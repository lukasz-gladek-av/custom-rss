            <p>There's been a question mark over this one for years, but it seems BioWare did once plan to let you import your Hero of Ferelden, your Grey Warden protagonist from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age: Origins</a>, into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>. It was only at the last minute that the studio cut the feature and swapped a Grey Warden character called Stroud in their place.</p>
<p>In Inquisition, there's a pivotal mission near the end - Here Lies the Abyss - where you get a chance to meet protagonists from previous games. You meet your Hawke from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-ii">Dragon Age 2</a>, and then you get the chance to meet one of three Grey Warden characters from Dragon Age: Origins - and it's here the game was supposed to let you meet your Hero of Ferelden. But it didn't - this is where Stroud was swapped in instead.</p>
<p>"Here's the thing about honouring previous game choices from a design perspective: it's a sucker's game," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lbfwpwi6ns22">wrote Gaider on Bluesky</a>. "What many fans picture, when you mention it, is divergent *plot* - the story changes path based on those major choices. How exciting!</p>
<p>"But you will never be able to deliver divergent plot."</p>

<p>"It's a question of resources, and there's never enough to go around.</p>
<p>"Here Lies the Abyss in DAI was about as good as it gets," he added, "and even that was a far cry from how I originally pictured it (hello last-minute insert of Stroud when a DAO Warden import got cut)."</p><p>Gaider's Bluesky thread came about as an addendum, of sorts, to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-developer-cast-farscape-star-as-morrigan-after-hearing-her-beat-poet-rendition-of-noughties-rap-banger">yesterday's story about the origins of Morrigan's character</a> and the voice actor cast to play her. The primary focus of the addendum concerns Morrigan's child in the game, Kieran, AKA the Old God Baby. He does appear in Inquisition but this was another choice from Dragon Age: Origins that gave Gaider a headache.</p>

<p>Remember, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-knew-the-deepest-secrets-of-dragon-age-lore-20-years-ago-and-locked-it-away-in-an-uber-plot-doc">BioWare didn't know there would be a Dragon Age 2 when it was making Dragon Age: Origins</a>, let alone a Dragon Age 3 (Inquisition), so it didn't plan these things in advance. It did a bunch of things in Origins it turns out were incredibly hard to fulfil later on.</p>
<p>The Old God Baby is a big deal... <em>if</em> it happened in your game. The soul of the Archdemon you defeat - a corrupted Old God - is transferred into the baby that you and Morrigan, or Morrigan and another character, conceive on the eve of the final battle. Already, then, there are permutations in who the father could be, so who should canon-Kieran look like?</p><p>"It was a decision from *two games ago* that only a small minority (hello telemetry) would even choose," said Gaider. "To the rest, they probably neither knew about it nor cared... so how many resources could you invest? To do what? Set up an even bigger divergence for the NEXT game?"</p>
<p>The solution came when Gaider made the scene more about Morrigan and less about Kieran, a character the players didn't know. "Thus began a feverish three days where I wrote probably the most complicated scene of my career: Morrigan's reckoning with Flemeth in DAI and the fallout after," he said. "Three different versions (OGB Kieran, non-OGB Kieran, and no Kieran), each with branching for other choices (like the Well of Sorrows)."</p>
<p>It was a scene that resonated with Morrigan actor Claudia Black, who'd had a child of her own not long after Dragon Age: Origins had come out. In fact, she would later have her own child play the role of Kieran in the scene. "Claudia was in the booth, gently coaching him through his lines," Gaider said, "and I think that was the first moment I felt I'd done the right thing."</p>
<p>Gaider, incidentally, did not work on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> at all - a game that sidesteps a lot of the issues Inquisition faced by letting you customise an Inquisitor during character creation, and then outlining only three of the biggest choices they made. It does not - as previous Dragon Ages did - use the web-based Dragon Age Keep database, which tracked a multitude of decisions from the older games.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-is-now-selling-digital-shoes-for-your-character-skin-with-nike-air-jordans-costing-around-7</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-is-now-selling-digital-shoes-for-your-character-skin-with-nike-air-jordans-costing-around-%C2%A37.1041639/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-is-now-selling-digital-shoes-for-your-character-skin-with-nike-air-jordans-costing-around-7<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has a new type of cosmetic option for its characters - Kicks - which are, in a nutshell, shoes. 
</p>
<p>
The first pair of Kicks has been viewable within Fortnite since the start of its current Chapter 2 Remix season - a pair of Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG 'Black Toe Reimagined' trainers, which you can unlock as part of the current battle pass. 
</p>
<p>
As of today, however, Kicks are now equippable by (many, though not all) Fortnite character skins. A range of other shoes - sorry, Kicks - are also available to buy. 
</p>
<p>
Starting today, you can buy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Nike Cortez Leather OG - 800 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Nike Air Foamposite One 'Galaxy' - 1000 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Nike Shox R4 'Comet Red' - 1000 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Chomp Stompers - 600 V-Bucks</li>
</ul>

<p>
And from tomorrow, you can buy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Air Jordan 3 Retro 'Palomino'- 800 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Air Jordan 3 'Black Cement-Gray' - 1000 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Air Jordan 11 'Black/Gym Red' - 1000 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Air Jordan 4 Retro 'Manila' - 1000 V-Bucks</li>
</ul>

</figure>
<p>I really like the Chomp Stompers - those shark slippers which only cost 600 V-Bucks (around Â£3-ish?) As a Fortnite-original design, these are cheaper than the other options. There's no way I'm paying 1000 V-Bucks - the price of a battle pass - for anything else.</p>
<p>
Fortnite maker Epic Games says Kicks are currently compatible with over 500 Fortnite skins, with 95 percent of the game's skin library set to be compatible by the spring of next year. 
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-permanent-og-mode-will-have-its-own-battle-pass">Fortnite revealed a shake-up to its battle pass system</a> and the introduction of another separate battle pass for its upcoming, permanent edition of the game's original map: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-reviving-original-map-as-permanent-addition-featuring-multiple-classic-seasons">Fortnite OG</a>.

            <p>The award-winning <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> is seemingly the gift that keeps on giving.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse revealed that the game's average daily peak concurrents are up by a not-to-be-sniffed-at three percent this year over last year, when Baldur's Gate 3 launched.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, its average daily active users are up by a more substantial 20 percent over last year. "If you zoom out on our sales chart it looks like the heartbeat of a happy little guy," Douse wrote on social media platform X.</p>

<p>These increases, Douse has implied, are thanks to mods (they are "very good", in his words).</p>
<p>Back in October, Larian celebrated 50m mod downloads since it released Patch 7 (which<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-next-week-on-pc-bringing-modding-support-and-more-evil-endings"> introduced mod-support to the fantasy role playing game</a>). At this same time, the developer said 10k of those mod downloads were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-modders-really-want-to-change-withers-name-to-bone-daddy">players changing Baldur's Gate 3's mysterious Undead entity Withers' name to Bone Daddy</a><em>.</em></p>

<p>In June, Larian head Swen Vincke stated Baldur's Gate 3's official mod support would be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mod-support-in-baldurs-gate-3-will-be-final-handover-moment-to-players-says-larian-ceo">handover moment to players</a>, though the studio will continue to provide updates afterwards.</p>
<p>As for what's next, Larian previously confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-initially-started-work-on-a-follow-up-as-it-was-the-obvious-thing">Balder's Gate 4 was briefly toyed with</a> before the studio decided to try something new instead. The developer is yet to formally reveal its next project, it has confirmed two games are currently in the works - both of which will be based on its own IPs and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">described as the studio's "best work ever"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Manchester will get a Pac-Man Live Experience where contestants run around a virtual maze under the watchful eye of the "Pac-Master", a "lively gameshow host". 
</p>
<p>
Set to open at Manchester's Arcade Arena on 22nd March 2025, the offering is described by its creators as a "multi-sensory adventure, seamlessly blending the real world with augmented reality". It's being put together by Little Lion Entertainment, which previously worked on live experiences for The Crystal Maze Live Experience and Tomb Raider.
</p>
<p>
Images show contestants making their way around a maze projected onto the floor, while the series' classic ghosts patrol around them. 
</p>
<p>
"Using a combination of cutting-edge wearable technology, projection mapping and augmented reality, you will be transported into the world of Pac-Man," the event's website promises. "No headsets needed!"
</p>
<p>
Tickets are available now, in 30-minute slots, at Early Bird pricing. Adult tickets are Â£25. Child tickets are also Â£25. There's no word yet on how much the experience will cost once Early Bird pricing ends.
</p>
<p>
The experience is played in teams of eight, with two mazes operating concurrently. The full experience lasts 50 minutes, of which you should expect to spend around 30 minutes playing (though presumably less if the ghosts catch you).
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Pac-Man Live Experience</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
<a href="https://www.pacmanlive.co.uk/">Pac-Man Live Experience's website</a> warns this is a "physical activity", and players are "likely to get warm". 
</p>
<p>
"This is an active experience where you'll be moving, dashing and chomping your way to victory," it states. "It's normal to work up a sweat during your adventure, so come prepared."
</p>
<p>
The website's FAQ notes that drinking alcohol is allowed before playing but that anyone deemed too intoxicated would be refused entry "as this is an active, physical experience that requires coordination and awareness for your safety".
</p>
<p>
Fancy dress is permitted, however, "as long as it does not restrict your movement or ability to wear the PAC-Vest".
</p>
<p>
Here's hoping this offering is fun on a level of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-londons-star-trek-inspired-bridge-command-an-interactive-gaming-experience-powered-by-smart-tech-and-role-playing">Star Trek-inspired Bridge Command live experience</a> in London that Jim and I recently visited, and less like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/glasgows-infamous-willy-wonka-experience-lives-on-through-the-sims-4">Glasgow's Willy Wonka experience</a>.

            <p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl released yesterday, and has since seen a strong number of players jumping into The Zone over on Steam.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, its all-time player peak on Valve's platform is 113,587. Meanwhile, it has 71,497 players making their way through the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone at this very moment in time.</p>
<p>These numbers are perhaps not too surprising, given Stalker 2 was one of Steam's most wishlisted titles up until its debut. However, even with a strong wishlist, reviews of the game have pointed out that it has been released with a number of glaring technical issues. These issues are one of the reasons <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wheres-our-stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Eurogamer's own Stalker 2 review isn't on the site just yet</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-dev-acknowledges-rough-edges-says-its-monitoring-feedback">Stalker 2 team addressed these issues and acknowledged the game "may" have some "rough edges"</a> now that it is out. The studio has assured its players it will address any niggles that arise in the game, as and when it is able.</p><p>Many users have been forgiving of these issues, however, given the road developer GSC has had to take to get Stalker 2 released at all. Since 2022, GSC has delayed Stalker 2 several times due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-on-hold-ukraine-based-developer-confirms">Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>. This has seen the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-developer-reportedly-moving-to-prague-to-finish-game">relocate staff</a> to safely finish the project elsewhere, while others <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-harrowing-update-from-gsc-game-world-the-stalker-2-developer-based-in-ukraine">joined Ukraine's armed forces</a>, and dealt with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-dev-says-russian-hackers-have-leaked-test-build-online-asks-fans-not-to-share">Russian hackers who leaked test builds</a>.</p>
<p>Stalker 2 currency sits with a 'Very Positive' review average on Steam. "Stalker 2 is nothing short of a miracle," reads one user review.</p>

Dragon Age: The Veilguard has launched to "solid" sales in the UK, though has numbers of "nearly 21 percent lower" than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>: Rebirth across Europe. 
</p>
<p>
That's according to European sales data analysed by Eurogamer sister site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/european-video-game-sales-jumped-12-in-october-on-the-back-of-blockbuster-launches-european-monthly-charts">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, which noted that Dragon Age: The Veilguard had been the continent's seventh biggest launch of October, after arriving on the 31st.
</p>
<p>
Over on Steam, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-off-to-solid-start-on-steam">Dragon Age: The Veilguard launched to a peak of 70,414 players</a>, setting a new record for a single-player game published by EA, previously held by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>. It's all-time peak is now 89,418, with around 23,000 people playing in the last 24 hours.

<p>
Steam reviews, which require users to own and have played the game, sit with a Mostly Positive rating. But on Metacritic, The Veilguard still sits with Generally Unfavourable rating, in contrast to its average score by critics. 
</p>
<p>
In a statement to Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metacritic-responds-after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-review-bombing">acknowledging the backlash to Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> on its site, a spokesperson for Metacritic parent company Fandom said its site was a "place of belonging for all fans".
</p>
<p>
"We take online trust and safety very seriously across all our sites including Metacritic," the spokesperson said. "Metacritic has a moderation system in place to track violations of our terms of use. Our team reviews each and every report of abuse (including but not limited to racist, sexist, homophobic, insults to other users, etc) and if violations occur, the reviews are removed."
</p><p>
"It is the strongest and loudest answer BioWare could have mustered for the people still doubting whether it could do it," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>. "The answer is yes, emphatically. The Veilguard is spectacular."

            <p>The publishing rights to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue-3">Shenmue 3</a> have transferred from Ys Net to ININ Games, sparking hope of a future multiplatform release.</p>
<p>Ys Net was founded by former Sega developer and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a> creator Yu Suzuki, initially to produce Shenmue 3. At release, the game was exclusive to PS4 and the Epic Games Store (for its first year). Even now, the game is only available on PS4 and PC (Epic and Steam).</p>
<p>Enter ININ Games, then, a German publisher focused on remakes and re-releases of Japanese games.</p>

<p>In fact, ININ Games published the console and PC versions of Suzuki's most recent game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/air-twister-review-yu-suzukis-space-harrier-successor-is-a-compelling-curio-rather-than-a-classic">arcade shooter Air Twister</a>, originally released exclusively on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a>.</p>
<p>This new publishing deal has therefore raised hope among Shenmue fans it could be released on other platforms, Xbox and Switch specifically.</p>
<p>Indeed, a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E8u6GL-k0QVeUeDzSSJ2RHZrgtKOvtqu/view">press release</a> states ININ Games is "excited to shepherd Shenmue 3 into its next phase" and the two companies will "honour the series' legacy while ensuring its accessibility to even more fans around the world".</p>
<p>Presumably, that includes its availability on multiple platforms.</p>
<p>ININ's releases include the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wonder-boy-asha-in-monster-world">Wonder Boy: Asha in Monster World</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/space-invaders">Space Invaders</a> Forever, the Taito Milestones series, and Shadow of the Ninja - Reborn.</p>
<p>Shenmue 3 received a mixed response on its release, though our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-3-review-a-faithful-follow-up-to-an-all-time-classic">Eurogamer review</a> was certainly positive. "Yes, Shenmue 3 can look and play like a Dreamcast game," it reads. "But it looks and plays like a Dreamcast game that's as off-kilter, maddening, magical and majestic as the Shenmue and its sequel, both all-time classics. I think there's good reason to rejoice in that."</p>
<p>Fans, meanwhile, are eager for a fourth game to continue the Shenmue story. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-fans-rent-times-square-billboard-campaigning-for-fourth-game">one group of fans even rented billboards in Times Square</a> as part of their campaign.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> team has apologised to its community for the game's less than perfect debut, admitting "this is not the launch experience we want for our players".</p>
<p>Among other niggles, developer Asobo recently admitted it vastly underestimated how many of us would be looking to take to the skies in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 at launch. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuMd7udCyFM">YouTube</a> video, the developer said player numbers had "overwhelmed [its] infrastructure". This was obviously not missed by prospective pilots.</p>
<p>The team is now doing what it can to combat this particular issue, and has increased its server capacity (it has not, at this time, said by how much). Some ongoing issues still remain, however, and our own Matt Wales has just informed me the game is still barely playable for him.</p>

            <p>It's been a year of change for UK high street stalwart GAME, with impacts felt by the chain's loyal customers and long-term staff alike.</p>
<p>In January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-retailer-game-to-cease-video-game-trade-ins-staff-say">Eurogamer broke the news that the brand would end its long-running trade-in scheme</a> and the sale of pre-owned games, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-staff-discovered-zero-hours-contracts-move-via-mass-microsoft-teams-calls">some staff were moved onto new zero-hour contracts</a>. This summer, we reported on a flurry of further changes, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-shutting-reward-scheme-next-month-and-you-should-use-any-remaining-credit-while-you-can-still-can">the closure of GAME's membership programme</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-to-end-in-store-pre-orders">ending of in-store pre-orders for new releases</a>, as GAME's technical systems were "upgraded" to those of its parent company, Frasers Group.</p>
<p>This autumn, further effects of that change became apparent, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-acknowledges-website-issues-as-customers-await-missing-pre-orders">GAME customers struggled with online pre-orders</a> and faced confusion over deliveries - most notably including the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> Steelbook. And throughout this year, dozens more GAME shops have closed on the high street, replaced by concessions in other stores such as Sports Direct.</p>
<p>As 2024 comes to a close, we've spoken with shop floor staff, managers and those close to GAME's head office for more detail on where the company is currently, and an explanation for why the issues customers have faced over the past few months have been so persistent. All wished to remain anonymous for the sake of their careers.</p>
<p>Eurogamer contacted Frasers Group for comment on this report, as it has done with its reporting previously, but once again did not receive a response.</p>
<h2>"We have lost 78 percent of GAME head office staff"</h2>
<p>"When Frasers Group took over GAME, they had their own departments that deal with marketing and logistics making sure stuff goes out on time," someone with knowledge of GAME's head office told me. "But then Frasers Group sat down and said 'why do we need two of everything?'"</p><p>This year has seen layoffs and redundancies across the chain, from shop staff who have been moved to zero hours contracts or offered work elsewhere - such as in Sports Direct stores. Others have simply been told they are no longer required, including a widespread loss of area managers over the past couple of months, as well as the bulk of GAME's previous head office staff.</p>
<p>"They made area managers redundant, eliminating some very loyal staff members - up to 20 years with the company in some cases," a current employee said. "This means store managers now talk to and are managed by someone in head office - the same head office which has also had redundancies and been reduced significantly."</p>
<p>"Since the full integration with Fraser group on 1st August we have lost 78 percent of GAME head office staff," another employee said. "It was triple digits and now in the 20s," another person confirmed. "Of course, we are now suffering the effects of that."</p>
<p>On a shopfloor level, staff say Frasers Group sees redundancies as a way to cut GAME's wage bill while simultaneously investing in more staff for Sports Direct - "the brand they really care about, the more profitable business", one staff member told me. Eurogamer is aware of staff who have quit because they did not wish to be moved from a video games specialist store to selling sportswear and trainers, and others who were only offered nominal shifts, such as just three hours on a Saturday, under new zero hours contracts.</p>
<h2>"There's just been stock issues with every new release"</h2>
<p>The loss of head office staff and those experienced in the video games business has affected the delivery of games to stores, multiple staff say. "The Frasers Group ordering and logistics managers are not doing enough to meet release dates," one person said. "They're just ordering stuff whenever." While the launch of Silent Hill 2 made headlines, GAME staff say that, with few exceptions, the majority of game releases are not arriving on time. "There's just been stock issues with every new release," a staff member said. "Anything that hasn't been EA Sports FC or Call of Duty has been late arriving, or not arrived at all. And if we do get it, maybe we get a handful of copies. I've genuinely been sending more people away than serving. We did get a few <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> consoles in, but only half what we were told we would receive."</p><p>"It appears on the surface to all of us that yes, whoever is in the GAME head office now does not understand what a game specialist is," another staff member said. "The last delivery we had at our store, there were no new releases, no games, no accessories - instead we received 136 Zendaya action figures."</p>
<p>Eurogamer recently reported on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-games-bungled-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-orders-too">customers waiting days to receive Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 copies they had pre-ordered</a>, after GAME previously claimed customers would be available to "pick up and play" the game with an added Steelbook on the day of release. In reality, the game's launch brought an update from the chain that it was aware some orders were still "processing", with no word on how long the delay would last.</p>
<p>"My store got five copies of COD, one of the biggest launches of the year," one source said. "How can you make money on five copies? New copies cost a lot and you don't make much, Â£6-Â£12 depending on how much they're marked up. If you have someone working eight, 10 hours a day, you have to sell a lot to make their wages.</p>
<p>"I recently saw six or seven people come in within about half an hour to buy a game that came out that day, only to be told GAME didn't have it. 'What do you mean, it came out today, I pre-ordered it?' they'd say. We just have to tell them we don't have it in, and I'm really sorry. All of them left without the stuff they'd already paid for, on the day of the release. And you know how people who play video games are. We're compulsive buyers. The number of people who are then like 'well cancel my pre-order, I'll buy it from Smyths'. And then they don't come in ever again."</p>
<h2>"Honestly at this point we would not be surprised"</h2>
<p>The Call of Duty snafu came just weeks after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-pre-order-customers-left-in-limbo-as-metaphor-and-silent-hill-2-launches-loom">GAME shipped Silent Hill 2 copies late</a> and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-game-pre-order-customers-receive-copies-but-for-wrong-edition">left customers without the game's accompanying Steelbook</a>, which the chain simply said had been delayed, with no apology or further reason given. Eurogamer asked GAME staff what had happened there, and heard a persistent rumour that the person now ordering the chain's stock had been unaware of how to process it properly. </p><p>"When you have Steelbook editions, you order 50 copies of the game. You also order 50 Steelbooks," a person close to GAME's head office said. "I was told the person at Frasers Group who is now in charge for ordering stock for GAME simply didn't click that they wanted the Steelbook too. They just ordered 40k copies of the game but didn't select the Steelbook. It was only when area managers - some that were still there - said 'you just haven't ordered it' [that Frasers Group realised]. And at first they were like 'what do you mean, I have ordered it'. And they said 'no, for special editions you have to order it under special offers'."</p>
<p>"The Silent Hill 2 Steelbook we have heard several different excuses for," another GAME staff member told me. "The one that comes up the most is since the switch over to Fraser Group systems, all pre-order information was lost into the ether on pre-orders made before 1st August. So information on which stores needed allocations was gone. Then they randomly sent more than required to certain stores and some stores like ours who had pre-orders received none. Another store in my area only had 10 pre-orders but received 37 Steelbooks. So all available Steelbooks ended up at a select few stores."</p>
<p>"There are internal rumours," said a third staff member, "honestly at this point we would not be surprised if it were the truth."</p>
<h2>"Frasers Group doesn't know what to send out, where to send it to"</h2>
<p>Eurogamer has repeatedly heard of issues behind the scenes since GAME moved over to Frasers Group systems this summer, and indeed this is the reason behind many of the chain's various schemes, such as GAME Rewards and GAME Wallet, no longer being supported.</p><p>"They don't even have the sales data," one person close to head office said, "because all of the point of sale and stock managing systems have been ripped apart and converted over to the Frasers Group, or the people who knew this stuff are being made redundant. Frasers Group has no background in games, they have no affinity, no passion for it.  They can't look back at 10-15 years of sales history because it's been deleted.</p>
<p>"My local store, they haven't had Switch Pro controllers in for months," they continued. "Personally I got mine from CEX, saved Â£20. But some people want them from GAME and they're not being sent. There are warehouses up and down the country filled to the brim with stock because the Frasers Group doesn't know what to send out, where to send it to."</p>
<p>Staff say they don't believe anything will change until Frasers Group acknowledges GAME's current issues - and that this doesn't seem likely, as the company's focus on cutting costs and staff continues. Some even believe the only explanation for the changes is a form of self-sabotage, they told me.</p>
<p>"The general feeling amongst staff has been that the poor decisions, the firing of almost all the knowledgeable staff and now the low stock with absolutely zero communication of the issues from head office can only be a deliberate, calculated attempt to run the company into the ground," one employee said. "If it's not deliberate, it's total incompetence or desperate cost-saving measures that will only be detrimental to profits in the long run."</p>
<p>"I don't think they know they're doing a bad job," another said. "They think they're saving loads of money, still doing well, customers are still coming back. Well, they're not listening to anyone."</p>
