            <p>No, it's not just you - it looks like the latest <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> update has nerfed assault rifles.</p>
<p>As spotted by our friends at Digital Foundry, "assault rifles effective ranges have been accidentally nerfed, causing much lower damage at most ranges".</p>
<p>That's not all, either. It seems the Ghost perk - which hides you from UAV and scout pulse - cannot be equipped at all anymore (although it can be duplicated from a class that already has it equipped).</p>

<p>The issue with assault rifles is that the damage you mete out is extremely low as the effective range has seemingly dropped from 40+m to 5.7m and 10.9m - which means you're essentially tickling enemy players to death.</p>

            <p>
UK indie-focused game expo WASD has now been officially cancelled, as its organiser enters liquidation. 
</p>
<p>
The news is, sadly, no surprise to the industry or to fans, who had noticed the brand's website go offline earlier this year.
</p>
<p>
"Increasing costs and less demand for stand space means running events is just not viable for us anymore," WASD co-founder David Lilley told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yxvxzp909o">BBC News</a> today. "[I want] to take this oppurtunity to thank everyone who has supported us along the way."
</p>
<p>
WASD began life in 2022 as the spiritual successor to EGX Rezzed. It was run by largely the same team behind the scenes - now separate from current EGX owner Reedpop - while the main EGX event continued. (Eurogamer was previously also owned by Reedpop, until its sale this year.)</p><p>
The past few years have been particularly difficult for gaming events, with longer-term issues such as fewer games and the rise of online betas and early access mixing with wider issues such as the video game industry's downturn following a boom period during Covid lockdowns.
</p>
<p>
The past 18 months have been marked by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-not-the-result-of-corporate-greed-and-those-affected-should-drive-an-uber-says-ex-sony-president">countless video games industry layoffs</a>, as corporations seek healthier margins by cutting wage bills.
</p>
<p>
This year's EGX, the UK's only remaining major video games event, notably ran as a mash-up with fellow Reedpop-owned expo MCM Comic-Con, meanwhile.
</p>
<p>There's hope for the video games industry in 2025, with a bumper release schedule that includes the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>, but all of this feels like it has come too late for some. We're sorry to see you go, WASD.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Delayed Obsidian role-playing game Avowed launches for most people on 18th February 2025, but those who pay £89.99 (or $89.99) for the game's Premium Edition can play five days early. 
</p>
<p>
Obsidian <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/avowed-release-date-pre-order/">detailed</a> the game's Premium Edition options last night and confirmed the game's PC version would launch on both Steam and, surprisingly, Blizzard's Battle.net. 
</p>
<p>
There's likely a good amount of crossover between Blizzard's audience and the folk Obsidian are hoping will pick up its new fantasy RPG and, of course, all of the companies involved are owned by Microsoft - so perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised at the corporate synergy.

<p>
For £90/$90 you'll get a copy of Avowed, five days early access, two premium skin packs and access to Avowed's digital artbook and soundtrack. 
</p>
<p>
That's an extra £20/$20 on top of the base game, which sells for £70/$70. Avowed is also available on day one on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, which will let you play via Battle.net if you link your accounts. 
</p>
<p>
Those cosmetic packs include the Eora Collection Set inspired by characters and locations from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars of Eternity</a>, and the Obsidian Collection Set, which features black-coloured outfits.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-collectors-edition-changing-due-to-delay">Ubisoft recently scrubbed its plans for Assassin's Creed Shadows early access</a> upon its own delay. It will now arrive within days of Avowed, on 14th February 2025.</p>
<p>I got to play a snippet of Avowed back in August, and enjoyed my time with it. "It plays like a funny Obsidian role-player where you buddy up with the voice of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>'s Garrus," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-plays-like-a-funny-obsidian-role-player-where-you-buddy-up-with-the-voice-of-mass-effects-garrus">Eurogamer's Avowed hands-on preview</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-thrones-sophie-turner-reportedly-in-talks-to-play-lara-croft-in-amazons-tomb-raider-tv-series<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Amazon's live-action Tomb Raider TV series might have found its Lara Croft. Following reports last month that Sophie Turner was in the running to play the iconic character, it's now being claimed the Game of Thrones' actor has reached the negotiating stage.
</p>
<p>
A live-action Tomb Raider series (not to be confused with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-best-look-yet-at-netflixs-tomb-raider-the-legend-of-lara-croft-animated-series">Netflix's animated adaptation</a>) was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">first reported</a> back in January 2023, with Fleabag and Killing Eve's Phoebe Waller-Bridge attached as writer. It wasn't until May this year, however, that Amazon <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/prime-video-tomb-raider-series">made the series official</a>, confirming Waller-Bridge's involvement and not much else.
</p>
<p>
Since then, curious minds have started pondering the obvious question: who might Amazon cast as Lara Croft following Angelina Jolie's memorable live-action turn as the jet-setting archaeologist in the early 2000s and, later, Alicia Vikander's more grounded approach to the role. Then, last month, it seems like an answer could be near, with <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/tomb-raider-sophie-turner-lucy-boynton-lara-croft-1236161243/">Deadline reporting</a> Sophie Turner (perhaps best known as Game Of Thrones's Sansa Stark) and Lucy Boynton (Mary Austin in Bohemian Rhapsody) were both poised to test for the part.

<p>
And it looks like Turner may have clinched it; Deadline has followed its earlier story with <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/11/sophie-turner-lara-croft-tomb-raider-phoebe-waller-bridge-amazon-1236173978/">claims</a> the actor is now "in negotiations to star as Lara Croft". So assuming all goes well, Turner could soon be joining the elite club of actors who've played the iconic role either on or off camera.
</p><p>
The Tomb Raider TV series - which Amazon has previously referred to as "epic" and "globe-trotting" - doesn't have anything close to a release date yet, but it'll air on Prime Video when it eventually shows up. In addition to the series, Amazon is also set to publish <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-huge-huge-task-but-things-are-going-well">Crystal Dynamics' next Tomb Raider game</a> and is even planning a new movie instalment. And if that's still not enough Lara for you, Apsyr is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-of-the-worst-reviewed-tomb-raider-games-is-getting-the-remastered-treatment-and-i-am-here-for-it">releasing Tomb Raider 4-6 Remastered</a> next year.
