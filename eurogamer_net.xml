            <p>
Skyblivion - the ambitious, highly anticipated mod remaking the entirety of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion using Skyrim's engine - won't hit its originally anticipated 2025 release, its development team has confirmed, with the project now expected next year.
</p>
<p>
Developer TESRenewal originally announced its 2025 release target back in 2023, but in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC6W0htYBOc">new update video</a>, project lead Rebelzize confirmed the delay, explained the team still has "some last challenges to overcome that are going to require a little bit more time."
</p>
<p>
"This is something we have known for a while," he continued, "but we did not want to announce a delay without also sharing our current plans and ambitions for the release of the project." To that end, the remainder of the eight-and-a-half-minute video takes a closer look at its current state, with Rebelzize stressing many parts are now "in great shape".

</div><figcaption>Will Skyblivion really be better than Oblivion Remastered?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmspR2xIL38" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Skyblivion's world map is "100 percent finished", for instance, and the team has <a href="https://skyblivion.com/">uploaded an interactive satellite version of the map</a> for closer perusal. Similarly, all quest dungeons, which have been remade for the project, are complete, while the remaining random dungeons are "mostly finished".
</p><p>
As for other key elements, interiors for houses, shops, castles, stables, inns, and chapels are complete, but there's still some work to be done on the Imperial City before they can all find a home. It sounds like the Imperial City - which is still awaiting final assets - is the last major roadblock as far as locations go. Other cities are complete and the studio believes it'll have all locations wrapped up and ready to go by the end of this year, at which point it can focus on quest finalisation, navmesh work, and QA as 2026 gets underway.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, weapons, armour, clothing, plants, clutter, and the majority of architecture assets are complete, meaning 3D modelling work is virtually done, leaving a few low priority assets to go. Additionally, UI work continues, with the team transitioning to a more Skyrim-like interface, and the mechanics team is said to be making "solid progress" as it focuses on enhancing player experience, based on feedback from the team. Most major systems are anticipated to be complete by the end of the year, and the goal is to open Skyblivion out for wider play-testing at a later date. The team has, however, hit a snag with cinematics, and is seeking volunteers to finish a major scene.
</p>
<p>
Once major work is complete, Rebelzize says the goal is to spend "as much time as possible polishing, balancing, and fixing" ready for launch day. And that work will likely continue after release, as it addresses issues spotted by players once they get their hands on the game. Additionally, there are robust plans for post-release updates, with the team hoping to implement custom content, original Oblivion DLC such as Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine, and other features - including spell crafting, Oblivion-like UI reskins, dynamic dungeons, grave robbing, increased creature variety, followers and hirelings, more unique weapons and armours, additional unique spells, and more.
</p>
<p>
One previously discussed element that won't make release is underwater combat. Despite getting the feature "partially working", the team opted to drop it due to conflicts with animation mods and other technical issues. There is, however, still hope it can be revisited and added at a later date. 
</p><p>
"We thank you all for your continued support of this ambitious project I started more than ten years ago," Rebelzize concludes. "And I really, genuinely cannot wait to get Skyblivion into your hands". Following today's delay announcement, the mod is expected to launch sometime next year.

            <p>Arrowhead trusts the newly-announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> film director, and has shut down any comments suggesting the director should at least try the game before taking on the adaptation.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-announced-helldivers-movie-director-may-not-be-a-gamer-but-he-has-worked-on-multiple-fast-furious-films">Fast &amp; Furious' Justin Lin would be taking the director reins for Sony's upcoming Helldivers adaptation</a>, which will be based on Arrowhead's game. On this announcement, it was revealed that Lin is not a gamer himself, and actually used this to his advantage when pitching his take for the film.</p>

<p>However, while this move was clearly enough to win over those within the film business, it caused a bit of scepticism with some over on the game's Discord server. In fact, one user tagged Arrowhead's studio head Shams Jorjani asking if they could direct the adaptation instead.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Jorjani did not take the user up on the offer, and instead showed his support for Lin's work. "Let Justin Lin work his magic," <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1445530210098352138">Jorjani replied</a>.</p>
<p>In a further exchange, another member of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> Discord asked the Arrowhead exec to ensure Lin "plays the game at least once" or checks out some gameplay footage. Again, Jorjani affirmed that Lin is the right person for the job.</p>
<p>"I trust Justin," the Helldivers 2 CEO said, adding: "He did a great job on the Star Trek movie."</p>

<p>The Helldivers film was initially announced back in January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">along with a Horizon Zero Dawn adaptation</a>. Soon after it was announced, Arrowhead's Johan Pilestedt confirmed the developer will be involved with the upcoming film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-will-be-involved-in-film-adaptation-but-not-as-much-as-you-may-have-hoped">but in a somewhat limited capacity</a>.</p><p>In the meantime while we wait for Sony's Helldivers film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-largest-fan-film-premieres-today-and-even-arrowhead-is-waiting-to-watch">there is a fan made release available to watch now</a>. Created by volunteers at YouTube channel Plot Coalition, the film is almost an hour in length, making it longer than any other Helldivers fan project made to date.</p>
