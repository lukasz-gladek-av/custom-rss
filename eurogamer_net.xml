            <p>A former boss of Amazon Games has detailed why the company couldn't compete with Valve's Steam platform for PC sales.</p>
<p>Ethan Evans was VP of Prime Gaming at Amazon until September 2020, and in a recent post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ethanevansvp_as-vp-of-prime-gaming-at-amazon-we-failed-activity-7295834479036702720-cDmX?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAVvKbEB4BSwtr1FhSqcqk72HAWxOtwQlK0">LinkedIn</a> he detailed how Amazon "failed multiple times to disrupt the game platform Steam".</p>
<p>"We were at least 250 times bigger, and we tried everything," he wrote. "But ultimately, Goliath lost."</p>

<p>Amazon tried three times to enter the "online-game-store market", said Evans. The first was by acquiring the small PC games store Reflexive Entertainment and trying to scale it, but this "went nowhere".</p>
<p>The second, after Amazon bought <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, was to create its own PC games store and utilise the Twitch audience for sales. "Our assumption was that gamers would naturally buy from us because they were already using Twitch," said Evans. "Wrong."</p>
<p>The third effort from Amazon was its Luna streaming service, which competed with Google's own ill-fated Stadia - that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stadia-is-shutting-down-in-january">shut down in January 2023</a>. Luna remains live, but Evans admitted neither Amazon nor Google's efforts "gained significant traction". "The whole time, Steam dominated despite being a relatively small company (compared to Amazon and Google)," he said.</p>
<p>So what went wrong? "The mistake was that we underestimated what made consumers use Steam," said Evans. "It was a store, a social network, a library, and a trophy case all in one. And it worked well."</p>
<p>He continued: "At Amazon, we assumed that size and visibility would be enough to attract customers, but we underestimated the power of existing user habits. We never validated our core assumptions before investing heavily in solutions. The truth is that gamers already had the solution to their problems, and they weren't going to switch platforms just because a new one was available.</p>
<p>"We needed to build something dramatically better, but we failed to do so. And we needed to validate our assumptions about our customers before starting to build. But we never really did that either.</p>
<p>"Just because you are big enough to build something doesn't mean people will use it."</p>
<p>Amazon still has its Prime Gaming subscription, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prime-gaming-gets-another-20-games-in-february-including-one-for-xbox">this month includes BioShock 2 Remastered and Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>And after publishing multiple MMORPGs, Amazon Games' next release will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/king-of-meat-is-a-chaotic-new-amazon-published-game-from-ex-lionhead-and-media-molecule-developers">King of Meat from ex-Lionhead and Media Molecule developers</a>.</p>
<p>Steam, meanwhile, has just seen its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-lands-series-second-biggest-start-on-steam">concurrent player numbers peak once again</a> this month, hitting 39.92 million online users.</p>
<p>Steam's other big competitor, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-store-has-more-pc-players-than-ever-295-million-in-fact">Epic Games Store, also now has more players than ever</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Bossa Games, the London-based company behind indie hits <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/surgeon-simulator">Surgeon Simulator</a> and I Am Bread, has announced a second wave of job losses - just a year after it previously shed a third of its staff.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bossa-games_activity-7298367748902912001-h4lt/">statement posted to LinkedIn</a>, company co-founder Henrique Olifers said Bossa had been forced to make "the painful decision to scale back" its size once more.
</p>
<p>
The company will now focus all its efforts on getting its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-featured-in-todays-humble-games-showcase">open-world airship adventure Lost Skies</a> out the door, before "reshap[ing] into small teams working independently on novel game ideas brought to the players as early as possible".
</p>
<p>
It's unclear how many staff have been impacted by these latest layoffs, though Olifers wrote that the changes meant the studio would be "saying very difficult goodbyes to extremely talented and treasured colleagues, truly some of the best people in the industry, who have been part of our journey for a long time".
</p>
<p>
"We wish we had found a way of navigating this turmoil without resorting to the decision of scaling back or teams," Olifers continued, "but unfortunately we've failed in this endeavour."
</p>
<p>
The co-CEO blamed the action on a "fundamental transformation of the games industry, a reshape of how games are made and by what kinds of teams", though did not elaborate further how Bossa had been affected in particular.
</p>
<p>
At the start of 2024, Bossa was thought to employ around 60 people, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surgeon-simulator-developer-bossa-studios-lets-go-a-third-of-its-staff">layoffs saw 19 jobs lost which Olifers blamed on a "perfect storm of events"</a> at the time: higher development costs, funding delays, and a tougher market for indie games.
</p>
<p>
It's been four years since Bossa last shipped a game - I Am Fish. It remains best known for Surgeon Simulator, which it launched in 2013 and followed up with various other versions for smartphones, Switch and VR.
</p>
<p>
Bossa had previously received funding from NetEase, the Chinese giant that is currently pulling back from many of its gaming studio investments across the globe. 
</p>
<p>
In 2022, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tinybuild-acquires-bossa-studios-ips-for-3m">Bossa sold the rights to I Am Bread and Surgeon Simulator</a> to US indie publisher TinyBuild, generating a reported $3m.

            <p>After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/still-more-netease-studios-like-quantic-and-grasshopper-at-risk-as-firm-reportedly-seeks-buyers">reports circulated over the weekend that NetEase is allegedly pulling back on its international game investments</a> by "actively shopping around more of its non-Chinese studios", NetEase-owned Rebel Wolves has reached out to assuage fears, reiterating that NetEase is a minority shareholder.</p>
<p>In a statement posted to LinkedIn, Rebel Wolves' chief publishing officer and co-owner, Tomasz Tinc said he was aware of the "rumoured situation" but said that Rebel Wolves' ownership largely rested in the hands of studio employees.</p>
<p>The company is currently at work on The Blood of Dawnwalker, a project headed up by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, who is also a studio co-owner.</p>

<p>"First and foremost, thank you for all the warm messages and wishes. The development of our game is progressing steadily, and we're facing no financial issues," Tinc wrote.</p>
<p>"The vast majority of Rebel Wolves' ownership rests in the hands of Konrad Tomaszkiewicz and other studio co-owners, all of whom are employed by Rebel Wolves. NetEase is Rebel Wolves' minority shareholder."</p>
<p>Tinc also confirmed that production of he Blood of Dawnwalker is "fully funded", and it was working alongside the studio's partners and publisher Bandai Namco to "bring the first chapter of the Dawnwalker saga to life".</p>
<p>NetEase's backtrack arguably commenced at the end of last year when it cut jobs and/or "paused" productions at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-will-pause-operations-at-fresh-aaa-game-studio-while-seeking-new-partner">Worlds Untold</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">Jar of Sparks</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">Liquid Sword</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, the Chinese megacorp <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">cut jobs at its US-based Marvel Rivals creative team</a>, despite the game's significant success, claiming the decision was made to "optimise development efficiency". It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">insisted it "has not wavered in its global expansion plans"</a> amid reports it's unloading "as much as all" of its overseas game companies due to rising costs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Obsidian's fun and colourful <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> doesn't sound like a one-and-done effort by the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Avowed arrived last week to a positive reception, and now a Bloomberg interview with the game's director Carrie Patel includes the suggestion we'll see more of the franchise from Obsidian.
</p>
<p>
Asked whether Patel's next project would be something new, the director said that work on more Avowed content - be that for this game, or sequels - was more likely.

</figure>
<p>
"Now that we've built this wonderful world, and also built this team strength and muscle memory around the content and gameplay in this world, I'd love to see us do more with it," Patel said.
</p>
<p>
Obsidian has invested more than six years in Avowed, and longer in its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars of Eternity</a> universe. Development on the project began in 2018, two years prior to the company's acquisition by Microsoft. 
</p>
<p>
Initially planned as a multiplayer version of Skyrim with a massive open world, Obsidian ditched the game's online component relatively early on. After Patel came on board to lead the game in 2021, the decision was then made to also switch the game's map from open world to multiple large open zones. The game also ended up leaning further into the Pillars of Eternity universe's lore than initially planned, too.
</p>
<p>
"With any game you think, 'OK, we can't climb every mountain  - which ones are really worth the effort for us?'" Patel said. "We knew from The Outer Worlds that we could build a really great game with open zones, and that also adds some advantages in terms of letting you really theme your areas more distinctly and intentionally, and provide a sense of progression as the player's going from one environment to the next."
</p>
<p>
"What Avowed lacks in gloss it makes up for with charm, depth and a playful heart," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Eurogamer's Avowed review</a>. "It's one of this year's most pleasant surprises."
</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-studio-plans-to-make-its-100th-birthday-by-staying-lean-and-invested">Obsidian said it was planning to still be open for its 100th anniversary</a> - in another 78 years - by staying "lean and invested".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
