            <p>A new playable character in FromSoftware's forthcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has been revealed.</p>
<p>In the network test, only four Nightfarers were available to players, but the latest pre-order push shows Ironeye for the first time.</p>
<p>Ironeye looks to be a ranger, or sniper, class who shoots enemies with a bow. Particularly cool is the ability to shoot arrows while in the air after leaping off walls with the game's new parkour system.</p>

<p>While Ironeye's core abilities are unknown, the video reveal does include the character charging a shot that fires through a number of enemies at once followed by a wave of energy.</p>
<p>It looks like Ironeye can free aim with the bow, as well as backstab enemies by firing arrows at close range from behind.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign will have eight Nightfarers in total, representing different player classes. The network test had the all-rounder Wylder, the tanky Guardian, the magic-wielding Recluse, and the rogue-like Duchess.</p>

<p>Ironeye should compliment the group nicely with ranged attacks, though builds can certainly change depending on the randomised weapons found throughout each run.</p>
<p>It's unknown who the remaining three Nightfarers will be, though perhaps a Faith character of some sort is a fair bet. I'd love to see a Wretch too.</p>
<p>The network test for Nightreign took place last month and allowed players to try out the three-player co-op game's roguelike three-day cycle.</p> <div>

<p>Last week, publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-players-were-really-struggling-to-complete-the-network-test">Bandai Namco released some statistics that showed players appeared to be struggling</a> to beat the big boss Nightlord: Gladius, Beast of Night, was defeated only 58,615 times.</p>
<p>Ahead of the network test, I was able to go hands-on with the game and came away very impressed by its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">new twists on familiar Elden Ring gameplay</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
