<p>Almost half of the 2100 user reviews left on the Steam storefront cite issues with bugs, stabilisation, and crashes, with one <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/goobywooby1234/recommended/2651280/">saying</a>: "Devs that ported this should be embarrassed.

<p>The issues persist even for those with <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/neodemio/recommended/2651280/">higher-end PCs running the latest drivers</a>.</p>
<p>"Hold off on buying until they get a couple of stabilisation patches out because holy hell," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047951793/recommended/2651280/">said</a> one reviewer who felt obliged to share their experience after just half an hour with the game.</p>
<p>"To say this is 'rough' is an understatement. Lighting doesn't load in some cutscenes, those same scenes run at seconds-per-frame, audio desync issues up the wazoo, freezing, stuttering, and just about every other performance issue I can think of.</p>
<p>"I'm gonna get a refund for now because frankly, there's other stuff I could use $70 for right now."</p>
<p>Even players who leave a positive thumbs-up are taking the time to caution others.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, the launch is pretty bad," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ravyyyyyyy/recommended/2651280/">added</a> another player. "Crashes every 20 minutes or so if you have turned ON the Frame Generation (which, guess what, is turned ON by default). A bit of stuttering here and there. The hair on the models looks awful. OH! And the biggest issue I had, was that I tried to delete my saves so I can start a New Game (you can't do that until you get rid of the old one), and I couldn't do that, seems it wasn't working. I had to disable the Steam Cloud, manually delete the save, and only then it worked. BIG OOF.</p>
<p>"Other than that, haven't had any other problems.</p>
<p>"I am only recommending it because I believe they will solve these issues, as they have pushed a minor patch after the launch, and because I am a Spider-Man fan."</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Sony confirmed it was dropping its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-pulls-controversial-psn-account-requirements-for-marvels-spider-man-2-and-other-games-on-pc">formerly mandatory PlayStation Network account requirements across a select number of its predominantly single-player titles on PC</a>, but introduced in-game content "benefits" as an incentive to continue using one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Released in 2000 for the Nintendo 64, Nintendo states this "arcade classic" takes you on "fast-paced races across three different environments for a total of nine courses".</p>
<p>"Dive right in with Quick Play to race three laps around the Revolution Novice course or take on Grand Prix and choose any available track to test your skills," the blurb teases. </p>

            <p>
Midnight Society, the studio co-founded by controversial streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm, is shutting its doors, four months after making "significant" layoffs. The news comes as Google announces it's lifting Beahm's YouTube monetisation ban, which was put in place following his admission of "inappropriate" behaviour with a "minor" last year.
</p>
<p>
Midnight Society was founded by Beahm and former Call of Duty community manager Robert Bowling in 2021, and the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-footage-of-deadrop-from-the-nft-fuelled-developer-backed-by-dr-disrespect">announced its first title</a> - free-to-play vertical extraction shooter Deaddrop - the following year. Development on Deadrop has continued since then, but 2024 proved challenging for the studio amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">Beahm's admission</a> he exchanged "messages with an individual minor back in 2017" that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate".
</p>
<p>
Bowling and Midnight Society were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-ousted-from-own-studio-as-new-twitch-ban-allegations-surface">quick to distance themselves from Beahm</a> when the allegations around his behaviour first surfaced, but the studio was seemingly unable to weather the resulting storm. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-studio-midnight-society-confirms-significant-layoffs-due-to-multiple-unexpected-challenges">announced "significant" layoffs in September</a>, blaming "multiple unexpected challenges in recent months." And now Midnight Society is shutting down.
</p>
<p>
"Today, we are announcing Midnight Society will be closing its doors after three incredible years, with an amazing team of 55 developers contributing to our new IP Deadrop," the studio wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1885061680398213160">statement shared on social media</a>, adding it is "actively seeking other game studios that would be interested in offering employment opportunities to our talented team members."
</p>
<p>
"We express our sincere gratitude to each and every one of our community members," the developer concluded, "and [are] deeply sorry we were unable to reach our ultimate goal."
</p>
<p>
Midnight Society's closure coincides with the news Google has lifted its suspension preventing Beahm from monetising his YouTube channel. The channel was initially demonetised following Beahm's admission of "inappropriate" behaviour with a "minor" last June, and Google chose to uphold that suspension following an appeal in October - despite Beahm's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-returns-insisting-conversations-with-minor-were-inappropriate-jokes-taken-out-of-context">attempts to backtrack on his statement</a> a month earlier, when he began referring to the messages as "jokes". Now, however, Google has announced a reversal of its decision.
</p><p>
"DrDisrepsect was previously suspended from the YouTube Partner Program for violations of our Creator Responsibility policies," it wrote in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lgykx4q7zc2k">statement shared by Kotaku's Ethan Gach</a> . "Creators who are suspended from this program can reapply for access, and after careful review of the channel's recent activity, we've reinstated it. If there are further violations, we'll take appropriate action." Google did not specify what had changed since last year's appeal.
</p>
<p>
"What a fucking weird world, huh?", Beahm said in a stream following YouTube's reversal (via <a href="https://kotaku.com/drdisrespect-twitch-ban-minor-youtube-monetization-1851752083">Kotaku</a>). "On the day that Midnight Society closes, we get monetisation. What a fucking trip."
