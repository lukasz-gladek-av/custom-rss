            <p>A sequel to the newly-released A Minecraft Movie is already being discussed.</p>
<p>This should perhaps come as no surprise given the film's record breaking opening - the Jack Black and Jason Momoa-fronted A Minecraft Movie debuted just last week, generating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">$301m worldwide on its first weekend</a>.</p>
<p>Now just a few short days later, A Minecraft Movie's director Jared Hess has revealed there are already talks of a sequel, with the filmmaker teasing where things could go next (<strong>please be aware of spoilers for A Minecraft Movie below</strong>).</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/minecraft-movie-sequel-plans-director-jared-hess-jack-black-jason-momoa-1236362421/">Deadline</a>, Hess - who was also at the helm of 2004's Napoleon Dynamite - expressed his excitement about potentially being part of another Minecraft film. "It would be so much fun. We had so much fun making this movie," Hess said before adding:</p>
<p>"It's such an expansive world in the game, and there were so many things that we didn't tap into that we wanted to. I would have a blast doing the sequel, and it seems like there's already talk about it happening, so I'm super excited. It'll be so much fun to go back into the world. The fans are just having such a good time.</p>
<p>"We  teased it in the end credits, and the fans seem to be going wild for it."</p>
<p>So, what exactly did Hess and the rest of the A Minecraft Movie crew tease that made fans go so wild? The arrival of Alex, of course! Alex is one of the nine default player skins in Minecraft, and is often shown alongside Steve (played in the film by Black) in promotional artwork and such.</p>
<p>In A Minecraft Movie's post credits scene, we don't see Alex's face. However, Alex introduces herself to Black's Steve after he decides to pop back to the real world at the end of the film. She now lives in the house Steve once did, you see, and she invites him in.</p>
<p>Alex is "the other massively critical character in Minecraft," Hess said, "so that's the one that we will be bringing to the table without a doubt."</p>

<p>In the meantime while we wait for more news on a sequel but you are itching for more Minecraft and have already seen the film (which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-is-just-what-the-world-needs-right-now-says-jack-black">Black says is just what the world needs right now</a>), you could check out these <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unfinished-version-of-a-minecraft-movie-leaks-spreads-online">clips of an unfinished version of A Minecraft Movie to pass some time</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (or BAFTA, if you're after something a bit snappier) has announced the winners of this year's BAFTA Games Awards - and it's very much been <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>'s night, with the acclaimed PlayStation 5 platformer taking home the gong in five categories including Best Game.</p>
<p>Astro Bot's Best Game victory saw it win out over fellow nominees Balatro, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, and Thank Goodness You're Here. And it was equally successful in the BAFTA Games Awards' Animation, Audio Achievement, Family, and Game Design categories.</p>
<p>Team Asobi's Astro Bot didn't entirely hog the limelight, however. Balatro, by developer LocalThunk, took the top spot in the Debut Game category, while Coal Supper's superb comedy oddity Thank Goodness You're Here was crowned Best British Game. Elsewhere, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a>' Helldivers 2 secured two gongs - winning out in BAFTA's multiplayer and Music categories - while Nomada Studio's Neva won Artistic Achievement, and Atlus' Metaphor: Metaphor: ReFantazio trumped fellow nominees for Narrative.

<p>But we're still not done! Surgent Studios' Tales of Kenzera: Zau won the Game Beyond Entertainment category, Ninja Theory's Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 came top in Technical Achievement, Vampire Survivors was deemed best Evolving Game, and The Chinese Room's oil rig horror Still Wakes the Deep was named best New Intellectual Property. Speaking of which, Alec Newman was victorious in the Performer in a Leading Role category for his portrayal of Cameron "Caz" McLeary in Still Wakes the Deep, while Karen Dunbar took the gong for best Performer in Supporting Role as Finlay in the game.</p>

            <p>
Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Hades 2's appearance in last week's Switch 2 Direct showcase</a>, developer Supergiant Games has confirmed the roguelike sequel will launch for the platform - as well as the original Switch - as a timed console exclusive.
</p>
<p>
Supergiant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-is-getting-a-sequel-the-princess-of-the-underworld-is-heading-our-way">announced a second Hades was in the works</a> at the tail-end of 2022, and it eventually entered PC early access in May last year. It's all change this time around too, with the original game's dashing protagonist Zagreus stepping aside so his sister - Melinoë, Princess of the Underworld - can take the spotlight as she embarks on a quest to defeat Chronos, the Titan of Time. With a little help from the Olympian Gods, of course.
</p>
<p>
Since entering PC early access, Supergiant has steadily expanded and refined <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, building on the formula that helped its predecessor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamers-game-of-the-year-is-hades-and-now-we-chat">earn the title of Eurogamer's Game of the Year in 2020</a>. And, now, following last week's confirmation of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> release, the studio has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G3wbCIUVqs">appeared in the latest instalment of Nintendo's new Creator's Voice series</a> to introduce the game to a new audience and confirm - via a quick on-screen message toward the end of the video - that Hades 2's 1.0 release will come to Switch 2 as a timed console exclusive.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="The God-Like Rogue-Like Returns – Hades II – Creator's Voice | Nintendo Switch 2" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1G3wbCIUVqs?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G3wbCIUVqs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
That announcement appeared to cause a little bit of confusion, however, and Supergiant <a href="https://x.com/SupergiantGames/status/1909686305342328902">took to social media</a> shortly after to clear up a few details. "Hades 2 v1.0," it wrote, "will launch simultaneously on our Early Access platforms (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/hades-ii">Epic Games Store</a>), Nintendo Switch 2, and the original Nintendo Switch." The only remaining question for now, then, is exactly when 1.0 will show up - but that's still TBA. All Supergiant has said so far is that early access will "continue during 2025", and that it doesn't have a specific end date "at this time".
</p>
<p>
The wait, though, should be worth it. Hades 2 was already looking special when it debuted last year, with Eurogamer contributing editor Christian Donlan <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">calling it a "game I already love" in his early access review</a>. So expect good for its eventual launch on Switch and Switch 2.
