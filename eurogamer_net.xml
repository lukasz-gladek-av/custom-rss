            <p>Developer 11 bit Studios has officially unveiled its new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> game.</p>
<p>It's called Frostpunk 1886, and is a revamped version of the original Frostpunk using Unreal Engine 5. However, 11 bit has said this release won't simply be a visual overhaul of the original. Rather, Frostpunk 1886 will include new content for players to discover, as well as new mechanics, laws, and an entirely new Purpose path.</p>
<p>The upcoming release - which is scheduled for 2027 - will also bring mod support with it, with the developer stating reimagining Frostpink in Unreal Engine "allows the game to become a living, expandable platform". That also means, future DLC is indeed a possibility.</p>
<p>All of this, 11 bit says, will offer up a "fresh" gameplay experience for even the "most seasoned" of Frostpunk-ers.</p>
<p>"The title marks the start of a new era for 11 bit studios - one focused on delivering in-house projects more frequently than ever before," the Frostpunk 1886 team said, promising more details in the coming months. Stay tuned!</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for  Frostpunk 1886 below.</p>

<p>We first got word of Frostpunk 1886 earlier this month, though we didn't know its name then. Speaking with our Bertie, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-project-in-frostpunk-universe-set-for-2027-release-and-11-bit-studios-is-working-on-a-new-ip-as-well">11 bit CEO PrzemysÅ‚aw MarszaÅ‚ teased the upcoming title</a>, stating: "We totally believe in Frostpunk. We believe in that IP. We totally believe in that fantasy."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/oblivion-remastered-includes-famous-voice-actor-flub-and-fans-are-delighted<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The long-rumoured <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remaster released earlier this week</a>, and fans have made a humorous yet oddly heartwarming discovery. That iconic line of an actor asking for a retake, that for some reason made it into the game's original release, is still there, alive and well in 2025.</p>
<p>On Oblivion Remastered's launch, Bethesda offered some clarification on why its new release is a remaster, and not a full fat remake. "We never wanted to remake it - but remaster it - where the original game was there as you remember playing it, but seen through today's technology," <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1914718584414089525/photo/1">Bethesda wrote in a post on social media</a>.</p>
<p>And, well, the studio has indeed been true to its word with the discovery that Bethesda along with co-developer Virtuos has kept the famous and really rather cherished double take voice acting mistake which has been there since the original's release in 2006.</p>

<p>The line in question is spoken by, rather ironically, Master Speechcraft trainer and Altmer (a race of High Elves) Tandilwe.</p>
<p>While Tandilwe will offer master Speechcraft training during the game - that is to say, she will help you get your influence and persuade skill up - the voice actor herself flubbed a line during recording and asked for a retake (we've all been there!).</p>
<p>When Tandilwe is chatting to the player about thieves being pesky buggers, the voice actress breaks character, clearly not happy with the take, and asks "wait a minute, let me do that one again", before proceeding to indeed do the line again. And, Bethesda kept it in the original game.</p>

<p>Anyway, when Oblivion Remastered was announced,<a href="https://x.com/TheNCSmaster/status/1914371675132506375"> fans immediately wanted that now famous line to be part of the rerelease</a>. And, it was!</p>
<p>As shared on social media, "wait a minute, let me do that one again" is still there in all its glory, almost two decades later.</p>
<p>"This might be the most perfect remaster ever," wrote one user in a now viral X post, with accompanying footage. You can check it out below.</p> <div>

<p>Elsewhere in Elder Scrolls 4 news, there are<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-already-almost-100-mods-for-oblivion-remake-even-without-official-support-from-bethesda"> now over 100 mods available for Oblivion Remastered</a>, covering things like armour, weapons and HUD improvements. That's even though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-say-no-official-mod-support-for-its-oblivion-remaster">Bethesda has said it won't offer any official mod support</a>.</p>
<p>For more, earlier this month our Jim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">called upon Bethesda to remake Morrowind rather than Oblivion</a>. "You cowards," Jim wrote, calling Morrowind a "special game, where a beautifully unique fantasy setting is locked away behind technology and interface design that has aged particularly badly".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
