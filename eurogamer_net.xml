            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> players have come together to unlock the Stella Montis map through a community donation event, which they completed in just one day.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-update-opens-up-the-north-line-towards-new-stella-montis-map-in-massive-community-event">The event</a> required Arc Raiders players to donate a substantial amount of basic resources to an in-universe effort to unblock the North Line. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-first-major-community-unlock-event-has-been-made-harder-mere-hours-after-launch-as-players-were-completing-it-too-fast">It was made increasingly difficult after the community was blasting through it in a matter of hours</a>, though even this change by the developers didn't manage to hold off the Arc Raiders community for long.</p>
<p>As of writing, players are playing their first few games in Stella Montis and discovering all the secrets hidden on this new map. Not so secret are the new Arc enemies, which includes the Matriarch. This giant robot is already chewing through players with an overly aggressive onslaught of varying attacks.</p>

</figure>
<p>It shouldn't come as a surprise that the event was finished so quickly, considering how many people have flocked to it over the past few weeks. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-officially-a-hit-with-over-4-million-copies-sold-and-a-peak-concurrent-player-count-of-700000-across-all-platforms">The game has shot past four million copies sold</a> according to Nexon, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-breaks-another-concurrent-record-as-player-count-soars">and continues to surpass its own Steam concurrent user peak as time goes on</a>.</p><p>This substantial update comes shortly after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-has-secretly-had-duo-queue-for-days-will-be-fully-supported-going-forward">duo queue was suddenly added to the game</a>, following fierce demand from players who weren't happy playing either solo or as a full squad of three. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-arc-raiders-players-so-averse-to-pvp-to-find-out-we-spoke-to-a-sociologist">Whether or not players will remain friendly in Stella Montis</a>, or will give into their murderous desires as new loot is up for grabs, will be determined this weekend.</p>
<p>If you're curious about Arc Raiders, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">why not check out Eurogamer's review</a>! In it reviewer Rick Lane summarises the game as such: "Rich PvE combat and an unusually friendly community make Arc Raiders a more approachable extraction shooter than most, but Embark Studios' continued use of AI voice generation is a black mark against its reputation."</p>

            <p>Despite being one of PlayStation's most prolific single-player series, developer Guerrilla Games has "always thought about" its Horizon franchise "as a multiplayer game".</p>
<p>That's coming from Guerrilla Games' studio head, <a href="https://x.com/janbartvanbeek">Jan-Bart van Beek</a>, who was resharing yesterday's announcement post about Horizon's spin-off MMO, Steel Frontiers. "From the first moment we imagined Horizon, we always thought about it as a multiplayer game," van Beek shared on social media.</p>

<p>The studio exec added that last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>, which told a brickified version of Aloy's initial outing in Zero Dawn, was the studio's "first small step" into Horizon's multiplayer offerings.</p>
<p>"With Steel Frontiers we're taking a bigger one," the Guerrilla developer furthered, before adding there is "much more to come".</p>
<p>Following Steel Frontiers' announcement yesterday, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier stated NCSoft's Horizon game is different from Guerrilla's own multiplayer release, which is currently said to be in development at the studio. "That one is Guerrilla's next big project," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m5jd6otif22v">Schreier said</a>.</p>
<p>As for Horizon Steel Frontiers, it's coming from NCSoft, though Guerrilla has collaborated with the studio. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrilla-affirms-its-working-on-new-games-in-the-horizon-franchise-as-ncsoft-mmo-skips-ps5">Steel Frontiers is described as a "fierce survival adventure"</a>, in which players take on the role of machine hunters in a region known as Deathlands. The team promises "large-scale raids" and an "advanced combat system". The upcoming MMO is poised for PC and mobile, with no mention of a PlayStation release.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrillas-horizon-franchise-has-sold-over-38m-copies-worldwide">PlayStation and Guerrilla's Horizon franchise had surpassed 38m copies sold</a>. The news came as part of Sony's filed legal complaint against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>, where the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">company accused the Chinese technology conglomerate of ripping off its Horizon video game franchise with Light of Motiram</a>.</p>
