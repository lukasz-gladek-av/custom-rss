            <p>Earlier this week, Capcom pulled back the (rotting) curtain on the latest instalment of its storied horror series, Resident Evil. And while we learned a bit more about Resident Evil Requiem's story and how it plays out, some fans were surprised that we didn't get a collector's edition (CE) reveal.</p>
<p>Like many publishers, Capcom usually goes all-in on pricey, limited-edition collector's editions, but in this case, almost all of the additional goodies for Requiem's deluxe version are digital, leaving some fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1qdz2bw/finally_an_end_to_the_overpriced_collector/">wondering if we've seen the end of "overpriced" physical collector editions</a>.</p>

<p>With little more than a month to go to release, it seems unlikely Capcom's holding off on the announcement, particularly as the official figurines we usually see in CEs have popped up for sale, separately, elsewhere, breaking a decade-old tradition. And rather than a CE, Capcom revealed two one-sixth-scale figurines of <a href="https://www.hlj.com/1-6-scale-capcom-figure-builder-creators-model-resident-evil-requiem-leon-s-kennedy-cap13730">Leon</a> and <a href="https://www.hlj.com/1-6-scale-capcom-figure-builder-creators-model-resident-evil-requiem-grace-ashcroft-cap13731">Grace</a>, retailing for around £150 each.</p>
<p>In case you're wondering, Requiem's physical Deluxe Edition comes with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Premium Stellbook (including the game)</li>
<li>A limited edition lenticular card</li>
<li>Digital code for 5 costumes</li>
<li>Digital code for 4 weapon skins</li>
<li>Digital code for 2 Charms</li>
<li>Digital code for filters</li>
<li>Digital code for bonus Audio Pack</li>
<li>Digital code for Files.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Digital Deluxe Edition is also available, albeit without the card and steelbook case. There's also a Requiem-styled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> controller available, and - also for Switch - the Resident Evil Generation Pack, which bundles together Resident Evil 7 and its DLC, Village and DLC, and Requiem. There's also amiibo coming in the summer, and all pre-orders get the bonus Grace costume, Apocalypse.</p><p>Leaker Dusk Golem, who has previously leaked correct (and some not-so-correct) details about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-the-short-message">Silent Hill: The Short Message</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> ahead of time, posits the issue could be connected to the costs of getting items into the US.</p>
<p>"I think as much as some people don't want to hear it, Donald Trump and his unpredictable wishy-washy tariffs are what has actively lead [sic] to Resident Evil Requiem not really having a Collector's Edition like they usually do," they <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2011929965789659453">posted</a> after the showcase.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is due to be released across <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-re-engine-resi-switch-2">PC, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S</a> on 27th February. Director, Koshi Nakanishi, who also helmed previous series entry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-7-biohazard">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a>, said it will be "an experience with an emotional range unlike any other Resident Evil title to date".</p>
<p>Nakanishi was talking during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-requiem-an-experience-with-an-emotional-range-unlike-any-other-series-entry-to-date-and-um-janitor-zombies">this week's Resident Evil broadcast</a>, which gave us all another look at Requiem's gameplay, including how the sections between Grace and Leon differ. Grace's gameplay will have a much stronger slant on horror, while things will be more action-focused when we are in Leon's shoes.</p>
<p>Alex has been hands-on with Resident Evil Requiem already, admitting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-played-resident-evil-9-and-they-heard-me-scream-in-the-booth-next-door">even the relatively small chunk he played made him scream so loudly that those in the booth next door heard him</a>.</p>
