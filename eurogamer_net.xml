            <p>A leaked trailer for 007 First Light - the Bond origin game from Hitman developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> - has shined a light on one the villains set to appear in the upcoming release. And, they are played by a name you will likely recognise, but perhaps not expect.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of potential 007 First Light spoilers below. </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-twitter-account-jumps-the-gun-and-posts-trailer-announcing-first-light-villain.1379350/#post-148736176">leaked trailer for 007: First Light</a> reveals that American rock musician and Hunger Games actor Lenny Kravitz will star in the upcoming release as Bawma, who shares Kravitz's likeness. The footage, which evidently went live earlier than intended, shows Bawma sitting in a rather plush armchair, monologuing a bit as many Bond villains seem to find themselves doing.</p>
<p>"I am sometimes asked 'Bawma, how is it that you hear every whisper, of every corner of Aleph'," Bawma says. "And I answer, I have built Aleph with my will, my blood, my whole self. This city is an extension of my being. My body. And today, it became infected."</p>
<p>Bawma then gets his cronies to launch Bond into a pit of crocs. "Easy girls," the villain coos.</p>
<p>It is fair to assume Kravitz's inclusion in the upcoming game was meant to be revealed at The Game Awards later this evening, where <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">007 First Light is nominated for Most Anticipated Game</a>. So, stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>007 First Light will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and PC on 27th March next year.</p>
<p>For more on IOI and Bond, our Alex recently got a closer look at 007 First Light, stating it's "so much more than Hitman", and thanks to "its 'breathing' structure", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-james-bond-preview-hitman-uncharted-comparisons">it looks like "the ultimate composite video game"</a>.</p>
