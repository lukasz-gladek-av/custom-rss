<p>Survival Kids, as the name suggests, is a survival video game developed by Konami. It was first released in 1999. It pops players into the shoes of either a boy named Ken or a girl named Mary, who has become stranded on a deserted island.</p>
<p>The addition of Survival Kids is ahead of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaRKOs05tMQ">a new game in the series arriving on Switch 2</a> for launch.</p>
<p>Gradius the Interstellar Assault is another Konami number, but this one is set in space with horizontal scrolling gameplay.</p>
<p>Kirby's Star Stacker is a Kirby-spin off game, which is more puzzle focused, with a block falling mechanic akin to Tetris.</p>
<p>Last up, we have The Sword of Hope, which has a fantasy-bent. Players take on the role of Prince Theo whose father, King Hennessy, has been corrupted by an evil dragon.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s director has apologised for the lack of two player mode in the multiplayer spin-off, but is considering adding it post-launch.</p>
<p>The co-operative game is designed for three players, though it's possible to play alone too. However, a two player option does not exist.</p>
<p>"The simple answer is that this is simply something that was overlooked during development as just a two-player option, so we're very sorry about that," director Junya Ishizaki told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-ign-first">IGN</a>. "As we said before, we set out to make this a multiplayer co-op game for three players, balanced for three players, so that was the main focus and it's at the core of Nightreign."</p>

<p>In addition, the development team at FromSoftware considered solo play "from the start".</p>
<p>"And so we did put a lot of effort into creating this experience that was playable for solo players in as much as the rules and new systems allowed," said Ishizaki. "So in putting all our efforts into that aspect, we kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect, but this is something that we are looking at and considering for post-launch support as well."</p>
<p>Ishizaki also discussed further how players are somewhat alone, whether playing solo or as a group of three.</p>
<p>"Seeing as this game is built around three players, we understand the concerns of those solo players, but essentially a lot of the time in Nightreign you will be acting and behaving on your own," he said. "Even in a group as three, you'll be going off and challenging different areas of the map and collecting different things before you accumulate together at the boss fight.</p>
<p>"So solo play is generally encouraged and is a natural part of the game loop, but also in general for those solo players - and this might be something that's difficult to notice in multiplayer - but the activeness and aggressiveness of enemies towards any one single player has been adjusted so that you don't find yourself in any unreasonable multi-foe fights.</p>
<p>"And just generally, when you're playing single player, the parameters adjust dynamically depending on the number of players in that session. So we hope that this will alleviate that feeling somewhat."</p>
<p>Still, playing solo is a much more challenging experience without teammates to revive you, though Ishizaki hints there's a self-revive feature hidden around the map for players to discover.</p>
<p>FromSoftware has made some tweaks since the network test back in February. Judging by player numbers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-players-were-really-struggling-to-complete-the-network-test">many were struggling to defeat the first Nightlord, Gladius</a>.</p>
<p>Following the test,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-director-promises-difficulty-tweaks-following-beta-feedback-and-updates-for-nightlord-gladius"> Ishizaki said the team had "received a lot of helpful feedback regarding the difficulty"</a> and that Gladius would "receive some updates".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Those wanting to utilise the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s GameChat feature will need to register a phone number.</p>
<p>The Switch 2's GameChat feature does pretty much as it says on the tin. It will allow users to communicate with their friends and family (or, bitter rivals if Mario Party is involved) while playing a game. This is done via a microphone built into the console itself, while a separate camera will also allow for video chat. It is all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-finally-explains-what-switch-2s-mysterious-c-button-does">accessed via that once-mysterious C button on the console</a>.</p>

<p>GameChat will be available for Switch 2 users for free, without a Nintendo Switch Online membership, until 31st March 2026. After that, users will only be able to access the feature if they have a paid NSO membership. However, if you read the small print, users will also need to register a phone number with a Nintendo account to access this feature.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Hardware/Nintendo-Switch-2/GameChat/Nintendo-Switch-2-GameChat-2785625.html">Nintendo's official GameChat page</a>, the small print reads: "Mobile phone number registration required to use GameChat." On the same page, the company states that as an "additional security measure" text message verification "is required to set up GameChat". It adds that text message verification for children wanting to make the most of the Switch 2's GameChat feature will need to use a number registered to a parent or guardian's account to get access.</p>
<p>This phone number requirement is for here in the UK, as well as across the pond in the US, so presumably will be a requirement worldwide.</p>

<p>On its debut, the Switch 2's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-gamechat-function-includes-welcome-accessibility-features">GameChat will include text-to-speech and live captions</a>. As we reported earlier, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-reserves-the-right-to-brick-your-console-following-unauthorised-use-in-bid-to-prevent-piracy">Nintendo will also be able to record video and voice chats stored on your console for a limited time</a>, if you give consent. This is to ensure a "safe and family-friendly online environment", Nintendo said, with footage only reviewed as part of its user-report system.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will be available worldwide in just under two weeks time, on 5th June. For more, you can <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-specs">check out our guide to the Switch 2's specs here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Konami has released the intro video for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, a remake of the iconic Bond-theme opening from the original game.</p>
<p>Singer Cynthia Harrell has re-recorded the theme song Snake Eater, while Kyle Cooper has re-done the visuals to match the revised main game.</p>
<p>While the song is essentially the same, the visuals are changed. The description states the staff credits will be included in the in-game version.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CbFAZ2ztlE">the PS2 original</a> the song comes after the initial prologue section as a credits sequence - just as you'd expect in a Bond film.</p>
<p>The new version has altered visuals in a similar style, but includes more gameplay footage, giving us another look at the improved graphics.</p>
<p>Before Snake Eater, Harrell also sang the theme song I Am The Wind for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/castlevania-symphony-night">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-announced-complete-with-a-butt-slapping-ape-escape-monkey">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will release on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam</a> on 28th August, complete with the Snake vs Monkey minigame.</p>
<p>Back in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/konami-confirms-kojima-not-involved-in-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Konami confirmed Kojima Productions was not involved in the Snake Eater remake</a>. Instead it's been developed by Konami and Virtuos. Kojima and Konami infamously had a falling out, with Kojima leaving the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-name-removed-from-metal-gear-solid-5-branding">after Metal Gear Solid 5</a> to start his own studio.</p>
<p>Still, the game is a "doggedly faithful remake", reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-is-a-doggedly-faithful-remake-but-new-controls-have-new-consequences">Eurogamer Metal Gear Solid Delta preview</a>.</p>
<p>Kojima himself is busy with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-death-stranding-2-preview-how-a-big-dollop-of-metal-gear-is-expanding-kojimas-bizarre-epic">Death Stranding 2</a>, which releases next month, putting the two games somewhat in competition over the summer.
