Ubisoft has signalled its expectations for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> in its latest quarterly financial results, in which it describes pre-orders for the game as "solid".
</p>
<p>
While the company did not divulge exact pre-order numbers, it said they were "in line with those of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a>, the second most succesful entry of the franchise".
</p>
<p>
The series' best-selling game, the Viking-set <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>, launched in late 2020.

<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">twice-delayed Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is a key game for Ubisoft, during a particularly turbulent time for the company as it faces <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-acknowledges-buyout-reports-stating-it-regularly-reviews-options">cost-cutting measures and a potential sale</a>, and after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">disappointing sales performance of last year of Star Wars Outlaws</a>.
</p>
<p>
Today, Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot struck an optimistic note - saying that "early previews have been positive" for the game. "I want to commend the incredible talent and dedication of the entire Assassinâ€™s Creed's team, who is working tirelessly to ensure that Shadows delivers on the promise of what is the franchise's most ambitious entry yet.
</p>
<p>
"In parallel," Guillemot continued, "we are progressing well on our cost reduction program."
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft has already made savings to its bottom line with the "difficult but necessary" decision to lay off hundreds of staff and close several studios, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff">including the UK team based in Leamington</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"We plan to pursue our efforts in FY26," Guillemot added, ominously, "going beyond the initial target by a significant margin."
</p>
<p>
Our Katharine said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">Assassin's Creed Shadows was "the biggest shake-up of the series in years"</a> during our recent hands-on time with the game, and praised its dual protagonist gameplay. "If Ubisoft can stick the landing on this one, it will be worth the extended wait."
