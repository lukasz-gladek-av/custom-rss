            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> Opening Night Live time, and that means <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>'s back and ready to dish out loads of gaming news and information. As part of the presentation, Keighley and the crew behind Opening Night Live took to the stage with brand-new trailers, announcements, reveals, and more, kicking off this year's Gamescom event in Germany. You'll find a complete list of everything announced during the showcase below.</p>
<p><strong>A new trailer for </strong><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7"><strong>Call of Duty Black Ops 7</strong></a></p>
<p>First up, there was a cinematic trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.de/video-game-franchises/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> Black Ops 7. The trailer, set in the year of 2035, showed a world under the grip of terrorism, where militarised police and soldiers take to the battlefield in both the real world and what appears to simulated, topsy-turvy versions of Los Angeles, Angola, Tokyo, Alaska, and somewhere called Avalon (a 'living, breathing space that evolves with the player', per the devs).</p>
<p>The trailer also seemed to tease some sort of Zombies mode called 'Arcade Zombies' which is a top-down, action-RPG style experience that'll be added to this year's CoD. You'll be playing as series veteran David Mason, who's deployed alongside the 'Guild', a tech-startup inspired group that apparently calls itself 'humanity's last stand'. Hm.</p><p>Perhaps the most interesting thing about today's news is that Activision confirmed you'll be able to play the whole story either single-player or with up to three other people. There's an emphasis on freedom in this campaign, and that's when it comes to narrative, gameplay, movement, or whatever else. It certainly seems like a drastic move for the series, and I'm pretty intrigued.</p>
<p>More information will be revealed at Call of Duty Next, which takes place on 30th September. The game is set to launch for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-suggests-theres-still-no-nintendo-switch-2-version-at-launch">on 14th November 2025.</a></p>

<p><strong>Lords of the Fallen 2 gets a reveal trailer</strong></p>
<p>Next up, we got a cinematic trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lords-of-the-fallen-2">Lords of the Fallen 2</a>, a sequel to 2023's title by Hexworks and CI Games. It's dark fantasy through and through, with your armoured knight character going toe-to-toe with an angelic foe against the backdrop of a crumbling Medieval world. The game is set 100 years after the last one, as the barrier between the living and the dead begins to tear.</p>
<p>It'll also be "bloodier, faster, and more brutal than ever", promise the devs. We'll get more gameplay later this year.</p>

<p><strong>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is getting an anime</strong></p>
<p>Next up, Geoff <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-is-getting-an-anime-adaptation">showed off a trailer for Sekiro: No Defeat</a>. The anime is heading exclusively to Crunchyroll and is directed by Kenichi Kutsuna, with character design by Takahiro Kishida.</p>
<p>"We are taking on the monumental task of animating the breathtakingly beautiful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sekiro-tips-and-tricks-6009">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a>. In doing so, we are pouring every ounce of our artistic vision and passion for beauty into its production," said Kutsuna. "The final product is being crafted to be a truly memorable experience, one that will leave a lasting impression on both dedicated fans of the game and those who are discovering the world of Sekiro for the very first time. Please look forward to it."</p>

<p><strong>Lego Batman returns with Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</strong></p>
<p>Lego Batman - not voiced by Will Arnett any more, apparently - returned with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-batman-is-back-in-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-and-its-out-next-year">goofy new Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>, packed to the cowl with little references to the series at large: the Penguin, Joker, Catwoman, the Batmobile, Bane and more were there (and it sounds like Matt Berry is voicing Bane?!)</p><p>Per the developer, Legacy of the Dark Knight covers Bats' whole career, from Origins to legend. There's decades of lore here, and it looks like the studio has taken the best moments from games, comics, TV shows, and more in order to make a proper love-letter to the IP as a whole. I wouldn't expect anything less from the Lego games, though. You can also drive about an open-world Gotham in "your choice of Batmobile". Cool.</p>
<p>Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is being developed by TT Games, and there's a demo on the show floor. A release date was not mentioned.</p>

<p><strong>Dawn of War 4 announced, gets a cinematic trailer</strong></p>
<p>Warhammer is on a roll right now. Whether it's Rogue Trader or Space Marine 2, the IP is having a real moment both in miniatures and video games. Today, that strength continues, with a big (and pretty good-looking) new trailer for Dawn of War 4. We've got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-4-announced-and-its-coming-from-a-surprise-new-developer-next-year">way more information on our dedicated page</a>.</p>
<p>Following the story of the Blood Marines, the cinematic trailer showed the marines dispatching enemies (Orks and Nekron, mostly) against the backdrop of that grimdark sci-fi universe that should be recognisable even to those that don't engage with Warhammer.</p>
<p>Dawn of War 4 is coming to PC in 2026.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.de/games/monster-hunter-wilds"><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></a><strong> gets a Final Fantasy 14 crossover (and vice versa) </strong></p>
<p>It's no Seikret that everyone thought the ridable mount in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> felt a bit like a chocobo from the Final Fantasy franchise; a mountable bird that is intelligent and dangerous in its own right? It's basically IP theft! Well, go figure - both franchises are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-and-final-fantasy-14-are-collaborating">collaborating to bring a touch of Final Fantasy 14's Eorza to the world of Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p><p>After first collaborating with Monster Hunter World, this promises to be a large crossover. We're getting the chocobo skins for our Seikrets, sure, but we're also getting a new monster to fight in the form of Omega Planetes, a mechanised beast that shares the name of a series-long villain in the Final Fantasy series. We didn't see much about the fight during the show, but if the Behemoth in Monster Hunter World is anything to go by, it'll be pretty brutal.</p>
<p>This collaboration works both ways: FF14 will let you replace your mount with a Seikret, and it looks like the MMO will be introducing Arkveld (the 'end-game' baddy from MH Wilds) as an encounter. It'll most likely be a raid. I think you may also be able to turn your Palico into a Cactuar, too? That's the real highlight.</p>

<p><strong>More gameplay for </strong><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/onimusha-the-way-of-the-sowrd"><strong>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</strong></a></p>
<p>Next up, we had a trailer for Onimusha: Way of the Sword that showed off combat against your standard 'mob' enemies (including some lush swordplay and some bow-based combat) as well as a few boss encounters: if you're a fan of parries, you're going to love this. I have a full preview (hands-on!) coming for you tomorrow, so expect to hear more then.</p>

<p><strong>Daemon X Machina Titanic Scion gets a free Switch 2 demo</strong></p>
<p>Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion now has a free demo available for users on all platforms, but the one I'm most intrigued about is Switch 2. The demo is available to download now, allowing you to play through the first nine chapters of the story and roam the open world. That's pretty generous for a demo. Even better, all save data can be transferred to the full game when it launches on 5th September 2025.</p>

<p><strong>Fallout season two sets the world on fire, gets a proper release date </strong></p>
<p>So, we're going to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a>. After dealing with a lot of 'family struggles' in their own right, the showrunners noted they wanted to send Lucy and the Ghoul to 'one of the most family friendly places on earth'. Will Lucy transform the Ghoul, or will the Ghoul transform Lucy? That's the core tension this season. The assembled actors and producers on stage also pushed a bit into Maximus' lore, and teased a journey for him as he steps gently into his role of a knight in the Brotherhood of Steel.</p><p>Now that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-will-blow-the-first-out-of-the-water-star-walton-goggins-says">Season 2</a> is diving more into New Vegas - a place explored well in the video game - we're also going to see some more crossovers with the game. So, say hello to Mr. House, as he appears in his human form. We even get a VATS-style slow-mo shot of Lucy shooting a gun, and our first glimpse of a Deathclaw as it appears in the show.</p>
<p>Fallout season two comes to Amazon Prime Video on 17th December, 2025.</p>

<p><strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is coming to Switch 2</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> will release on Nintendo's Switch 2 console next year, following the previously Xbox exclusive game's arrival on PS5 back in April.</p>
<p>We also got an update on the DLC - The Order of Giants - which is coming to Xbox Series X/S, Steam, and PS5 in September.</p>

<p>After this, we had the standard mid-show rush where a lot of stuff was announced all in one go:</p>
<p><strong>Deadpool VR</strong> is coming to Meta Quest 3 (launching in December), <strong>World of Tanks</strong> gets its biggest update ever with World of Tanks 2.0 (coming in September), we got a new trailer for <strong>John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</strong> ahead of its release date in 'early 2026' (which had some of the best music in the whole show), and then Ron Gilbert - creator of Monkey Island and Manic Mansion - took to the stage.</p>
<p><strong>Death by Scrolling brings back an industry legend</strong></p>
<p>It's a vertically-scrolling RPG-cum-roguelike that sees you struggling through purgatory to stay one step ahead of the Grim Reaper herself. There are five playable characters with their own unique perks, and the gameplay looks like a mix of Vampire Survivors, Enter the Gungeon, and classic Zelda. Yeah, I'm sold.</p>

<p><strong>Studio ZA/UM shows off its first game since Disco Elysium</strong></p>
<p>A cinematic trailer is never really going to be able to capture what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> is, or can be, but let's put that aside for now as we look at ZA/UM's new game, Zero Parades. A trailer shows off concept art, a very small bit of gameplay, and some voiceover that promises to be as moody and cerebral as the original game. Described as an 'espionage RPG', you play as Hershel Wilk - or CASCADE - who has been sent on a mysterious assignment. You'll need to make the acquaintance of various people at the end of history, each with their own agendas.</p><p>Of course, most of the original developers have left the studio at this point, so any tie to Disco Elysium is more down to developer name than shared DNA. It's too early to tell what this game will be like, but, from the trailer, it seems ZA/UM is at least keeping the <em>vibe</em> alive. It's all about "failing forward", apparently. But I won't make a comment about that.</p>
<p>You can wishlist the game now on Steam.</p>

<p>Next was another block of little trailers. There was <strong>Unbeatable</strong>, a stunning looking game where "music is illegal, and you do crimes". It's an anime-inspired rhythm game that is developed by D-CELL Games and published by PlayStack. It's coming to Steam and consoles in November. We also saw trailers for a new anime gacha game, <strong>Neverness to Everness</strong>, and a boss battle for <strong>Honor of Kings World</strong>. These were followed by a new trailer for Delta Force, which launches today on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

<p><strong>Ninja Gaiden 4 gets a story trailer</strong></p>
<p>Platinum Games showed off a new trailer for Ninja Gaiden 4 that featured some bloody and intense gameplay, but also dipped a bit deeper into the story and lore of the new game. The most notable thing was probably the cybernetically enhanced skills that most of the ninja and enemies seemed to be rocking. But the real star of the show is the combat; fluid, bloody, and brutal. It looks good.</p>
<hr>
<p>Time for another sizzle reel. This time we got Cinder City and Time Takers. Both from NCsoft, this was our first-ever look at the gameplay for Time Takers, and it revealed a team-based third-person shooter which brings together a group of rogues from across time to fix their past. Standard. Think Overwatch x Apex Legends. Cinder City is your standard MMO fare, and lands on 21st October.</p>

<p><strong>Silent Hill f gets a brand-new trailer</strong></p>
<p>And just like that, we're in old Japan: alone, tiptoeing around some creepy wooden buildings. And then she's gone into some other dimension. Per the trailer, Suzie Yeung provides the English voice of the main character. And she wields a naginata to fend off the undead hordes that have come to drag her kicking and screaming into the underworld. It's all very Silent Hill, and we can learn more when we get our hands on the game on 25th September.</p>

<p><strong>Moonlighter 2 gets a release date</strong></p>
<p>The teams at 11 Bit studios and Digital Sun have announced Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault - a follow-up to the wonderful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a> - is heading into early access via Steam on 23rd October.</p>
<p>There'll be three biomes to explore on its initial debut, each including "unique enemies", so keep your wits about you. When players return from these biomes, there will be plenty of relics to then sell in Will's shop.</p>
<p>"Set prices, serve customers, customise your space, and experience most of the story - all built around an updated combat system featuring four main weapons, nearly 100 shop and dungeon perks, and a smoother, improved feel," the blurb reads.</p>

<p>Next up, we got confirmation that <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2'</strong>s Legacy of the Forge DLC will launch on 9th September. It's the second story DLC, and is included in the Expansion Pass, but will also be sold separately for base game owners. Also, Massive Monster and Devolver Digital's multi-million-selling cult simulator <strong>Cult of the Lamb</strong> got a massive update announcement in the form of Woolhaven: an ice-cold new paid expansion coming early 2026.</p>

<p><strong>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 finally shows signs of life</strong></p>
<p>The sequel to Troika Games' gothic cult classic RPG has been delayed and moved from studio to studio so often that you'd be forgiven for thinking it was long dead. But here, at Opening Night Live, it finally shows signs of life. Bertie knows far more about this than I do, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-action-than-rpg-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-struggles-to-convince-after-a-few-hours-play">so I will defer to him and his wonderful preview</a> to let you learn more.</p>

<p><strong>World of Warcraft: Midnight gets a classic Blizzard cinematic</strong></p>
<p>World of Warcraft got a new cinematic for its Midnight expansion, and it showed infamous shoe-disliker Xal'atath pulling up to the sunwell where the Blood Elves have been hanging around for over a decade. Lor'themar, married and happy, somehow didn't get his brains blown out live on the Gamescom stage.</p><p>Funnily enough Blizzard also announced <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/new-demon-hunter-specialization-revealed-embrace-the-void-with-devourer-378233">a new Demon Hunter specialisation</a>, and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/new-allied-race-for-midnight-announced-haranir-can-be-druids-378237">an allied race</a>, but these weren't shown off during the show itself for some reason. Midnight is coming out at some point in 2026, so get excited to do awful DPS and not get invited to your friends' raids soon!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei"><strong>Ghost of Yotei</strong></a><strong> promises free DLC for players in 2026</strong></p>
<p>Ghost of Yōtei developer Sucker Punch has confirmed its highly anticipated sequel will be getting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-is-getting-its-own-co-op-legends-mode-as-free-post-launch-dlc">its own co-op-focused Legends mode</a> as free post-launch DLC sometime next year, including a "fantastical supernatural story and survival missions". It sounds like it'll be similar to Ghost of Tsushima's Legends mode, then, that was received pretty well and extended the gameplay - and sales-tail of the game - to a pretty impressive degree.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows"><strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong></a><strong> delves into Grace Ashcroft's past</strong></p>
<p>Resident Evil: Requiem protagonist Grace Ashcroft got a bit of fleshing out in the latest trailer for Capcom's storied franchise, but there's still no sign of fan-favourite and series stalwart, Leon S. Kennedy. After receiving a phone call from a mysterious stranger, Grace Ashcroft and her mum panic and attempt to escape from the building they're staying in, only to witness a brutal murder as people chase the duo down.</p><p>It's all a bit of a teaser for the promise Capcom has made to return to the series' "overarching narrative", as we go a little closer to home and the origins of Raccoon City and the Umbrella Corp. There is more to come in my hands-on preview of the game, which drops tomorrow at noon.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem launches on 27th February, 2026.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-black-myth-game-announced-by-game-science-following-wukong-success"><strong>Black Myth: WuKong gets a sequel</strong></a><strong> in the form of Black Myth: Zhong Kui </strong></p>
<p>Black Myth: Zhong Kui will be an all-new follow-up, focused on the titular ghost-catching god who wanders between hell and earth. The developer clearly doesn't want to stray too far away from what has been successful in the past, as this newly-announced title will be another single-player action-RPG, rooted in Chinese folklore. If it ain't broke, as they say.</p>
<p>A brief teaser trailer was aired during Gamescom Opening Night Live, showing a couple of men hiding from a parade of mythical characters, including Zhong Kui himself, who was riding a giant tiger.</p>
<p>"Upon completing the journey with the Destined One, we now aspire to take a tentative first step - to build more distinct game experiences, to challenge ourselves with bolder features, and to bring fresh ideas to our world and narrative design," say the developers in a Q&amp;A.</p><p>"Zhong Kui came as a natural choice born of that aspiration and other contributing factors. We are confident that, in this new project, we can make refreshing changes, create new things, while taking a hard look at our past flaws and regrets. And to all friends who love Black Myth: Wukong: the westward journey won't end here."</p>
<p>Black Myth: Zhong Kui has no release date yet, but promises to launch on PC and consoles.</p>
