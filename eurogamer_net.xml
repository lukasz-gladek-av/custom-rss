            <p>Lenovo has confirmed that whilst Legion Go 2 units are now making their way to "major retailers globally", some pre-orders placed on Lenovo's very own website will "need" to be cancelled.</p>
<p>The company did not confirm how many pre-orders have been affected, but said it was "truly sorry for the inconvenience it has caused".</p>

<p>"[W]e will need to cancel some pre-orders placed directly on Lenovo.com," the company said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegionGo/comments/1nhni67/were_the_lenovo_legion_team_ask_us_anything_about/">in a post on Reddit</a>. "We don’t believe in holding onto customer payments for products we can’t ship in a timely manner. As soon as our online inventory is replenished, Lenovo.com will show updated availability and ordering will reopen.</p><p>"We know this is frustrating, and we’re truly sorry for the inconvenience it caused, especially for our most passionate fans. The Legion Go Gen 2 was built with you in mind, and this experience has been an important lesson for us. We'll use this to improve and ensure a better process moving forward."</p>
<p>Lenovo states pre-orders "substantially exceeded our projections, leading to unforeseen delivery range extensions". It says it's "working diligently with our teams worldwide to fill these orders as quickly as possible. We truly appreciate the overwhelming support of Legion fans, and ask for your patience while we work to get the Legion Go Gen 2 into your waiting hands".</p>
<p>Dozens of unhappy customers have responded to the statement, some asking <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegionGo/comments/1nhni67/comment/nf2owd3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">why Lenovo is prioritising customers who placed orders with third-party retailers</a> rather than those who pre-ordered directly with the tech company, and questioning why there's been no compensation for players who paid thousands of dollars months ago, only to find their orders now cancelled. Others say that if their order is not fulfilled, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegionGo/comments/1nhni67/comment/nf3xg7k/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">they "won't buy [from Lenovo] at all"</a>.</p>
<p>"You can't just state some orders will be cancelled and ride back off into the sunset, state which ones and why! If it's to do with discount codes say so," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegionGo/comments/1nhni67/comment/nf3xg7k/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">commented</a> one unhappy pre-orderer. "There's NO reason to cancel someone's order who is willing to wait other than you don't like the price they paid for it. 'We don’t believe in holding onto customer payments' is a very weak excuse.</p>
<p>"If mine is cancelled, it will be the last straw and I won't buy it at all, a competitor benefits instead. I won't wait around constantly checking for a window of opportunity to order again."</p>
<p>At the time of writing, it's unclear how long the delay will be for those prepared to wait but Lenovo admitted it had "messed up this time but we promise we’ll move forward with a lot more caution and care because that’s what you, our awesome community, deserves".</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lenovo-unveils-legion-go-2-and-go-s-handheld-gaming-pcs-including-steamos-model">Lenovo's second-generation handheld gaming PC Legion Go 2 was announced back in January</a>. Alongside its built-in kickstand and ergonomically improved detachable controllers, it sports an 8.8-inch OLED display with VRR support, and comes equipped with either the upcoming AMD Ryzen Z2 or Ryzen Z2 Extreme. You can also boost the spec up to 32GB of RAM and 2TB of SSD storage.</p>
