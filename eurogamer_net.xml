            <p>If you want to toss a coin to your orchestra, you will soon be able to do just that, as CD Projekt Red has announced ticket sales for The Witcher in Concert will go on sale imminently.</p>
<p>The Witcher in Concert is a celebration of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>'s 10th anniversary, because it really has been that long (and yet, I haven't aged a day). It will "bring to life the open-world RPG's timeless score with a live orchestra performance". As with other video game-based concerts, gameplay will accompany the music as it swells from the orchestra.</p>
<p>The concert tour itself will kick off during this year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> event in Cologne, before traveling across Europe. That includes here in the UK, with the concert coming to London on 5th November, before it heads to Manchester on 7th November.</p>

</figure>
<p>As well as the UK, the tour has stops in Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and Sweden all scheduled. Further tour locations will be announced at a later date, including ones across the pond in North America.</p>
<p>"I can't believe it's been 10 years since we first introduced The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt to the world! Music is such an important part of our games, and to see the community respond with such enthusiasm for what we created has been truly incredible," said soundtrack co-composer Marcin Przyby≈Çowicz.</p>
<p>"From everyone's favorite 'le le les' to the tracks we used to underscore the most heartfelt moments, every single composition was a joy to create, and I'm looking forward to sharing it with people around the world."</p>
<p>Those interested are able browse the current list of venues and purchase tickets through The Witcher in Concert <a href="http://thewitcher.com/concert">official website</a>. Ticket sales go live on 24th January, so this Friday, however a pre-sale will begin 48 hours prior to this date for those who sign up to the concert's newsletter. So, I guess that means now. Get tossing those coins! (only if you want to, of course).</p>

<p>As for what's still to come for the Witcher series, CD Projekt lifted the lid on its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">next video game entry at The Game Awards in December</a>.</p>
<p>Known as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>, the upcoming game stars Ciri as the main protagonist, and will be another third-person action-RPG just like The Witcher 3. Oh, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-of-town-that-was-definitely-doug-cockles-white-haired-monster-hunter-in-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer">Doug Cockle is returning to voice Geralt of Rivia</a>, who will indeed be present in the game in some form.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>S-Game has released a new trailer for forthcoming action game Phantom Blade Zero, but it remains without a firm release date.</p>
<p>The new trailer celebrates 2025's Year of the Snake with a fresh gameplay of a boss battle and a look at new snake-themed weapons: the sword-whip Soft Snake Sword, and twin swords White Serpent and Crimson Viper.</p>
<p>The trailer also states a release date will be announced this year, as the developer is continuing to tweak and finalise the game.</p>

<p>In an email to Eurogamer alongside the trailer, S-Game stated the playable demos from last year proved Phantom Blade Zero is already a "polished title", but it's using Unreal Engine 5 to "push the boundaries even further" after a "significant" boost to the budget.</p>
<p>It also confirmed enhanced visuals will be supported on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>Phantom Blade Zero was announced by Sony in 2023. Developed by S-Game, it's a hack and slash action game fusing traditional techniques and philosophies of Chinese martial arts with inspiration from the Hong Kong action films of the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
<p>This new trailer shows a battle against boss the Seven Judgments - a sort of puppet master with clones. It's a further example of the game's parrying and dodging mechanics, as well as its high difficulty.</p>
<p>I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-blade-zero-is-speedy-stylish-and-absolutely-not-a-soulslike">hands-on with Phantom Blade Zero</a> at last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> and came away impressed by its hugely satisfying combat. Just remember: as the developer said, it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-blade-zero-has-dark-souls-inspired-non-linear-map-but-developer-still-insists-its-not-a-soulslike">absolutely not a Soulslike</a>.</p>
<p>S-Game CEO Liang Qiwei (known as Soulframe) stated last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-blade-zero-producer-says-foreign-themes-can-be-an-advantage-rather-than-a-barrier-for-a-global-audience">authentic cultural themes are important for games</a> and shouldn't be diluted for a global audience, as the Chinese developer chases the same success as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The launch of Doom: The Dark Ages is just a few months away, according to a release date which has popped up online ahead of tomorrow's Xbox Developer Direct.
</p>
<p>
id Software's legendary series is set to return on 15th May, according to a now-pulled article published by French website Gamekult and hastily spotted by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-releasing-on-may-15-2025.1088169/">ResetEra</a>.

<p>
Doom: The Dark Ages will be one of the stars of this week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-announces-xbox-developer-direct">Xbox Developer Direct, which airs at 6pm UK time tomorrow</a>. Presumably this is where we'll see that date made official.

<p>First up is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a>: Spacer's Choice Edition. Not to be confused with Outer Wilds, this is Obsidian's comedy space adventure that was optimised for PS5 in 2023. A sequel is still on the horizon.</p>
<p>Secondly, a bunch of the Tales Of games will be leaving the subscription service, including the most recent Tales of Arise.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> has announced another wave of price hikes across its various membership tiers - including a Premium subscription bump to $25 a month, among other things - but, for the time being at least, most European countries won't be affected by the charges.
</p>
<p>
The news comes as Netflix <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/FINAL-Q4-24-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">celebrates its biggest quarterly subscriber increase in history</a>, with 19m new customers having joined the streaming service in its most recent fourth quarter - something it attributes to a combination of live sports and original programming, including the second season of Squid Game, which has already amassed more than 165.7m views.
</p>
<p>
Amid all this, Netflix says it's expecting to generate higher than forecast revenue in 2025 - and that will, in part, be fuelled by a fresh round of price increases. These are specifically targeting the US, Canada, Portugal, and Argentina, coming into effect today.
</p>
<figure><div>

</div><figcaption>Switch 2 and Mario Kart 9 have been revealed - but questions remain.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyPgPcxLlIk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
"As we continue to invest in programming and deliver more value for our members," the streaming service wrote in its message to shareholders, "we will occasionally ask our members to pay a little more so that we can re-invest to further improve Netflix."
</p><p>
To that end, prices are rising across "most" plans. Netflix's ad-supported tier is increasing from $6.99 USD to $7.99 a month, while its standard ad-free subscription is getting a bump from $15.49 to $17.99 per month. And as for the streaming service's premium tier - currently the only way to watch its content in 4K - that'll rise from $22.99 to $24.99 a month.
</p>
<p>
For now, there's no word of price increases beyond the four currently announced countries, but - based on Netflix's previous behaviour - there's a fair chance it won't be too long before they come into effect across additional territories too.
