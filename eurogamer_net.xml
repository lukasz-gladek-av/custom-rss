            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> has been out for a few days, and has enjoyed its first weekend released into the hands of eager players. However, current concurrent player counts have many fans asking: Is Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 underperforming?</p>
<p>This question stems from one source in particular, the SteamDB listing for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3606480/charts/">The game is ranked 6th in global top sellers</a>, which should reassure some fans. However, the game has only just reached <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/#1w">a peak concurrent player count above 100,000</a>.</p>
<p>This sounds impressive - it is a huge amount of people to be playing a game at once on one platform - but comparing Black Ops 7 to previous releases paints an altogether different picture. Back in 2024 when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> came out, the game saw a peak of around 315,000 on Steam. Earlier still, in 2022 when Modern Warfare III released, the game saw a Steam peak of roughly 491,000.</p>

<p>There's been a clear drop in players, then. This returns us to the question: Is Black Ops 7 underperforming? While specific figures on other platforms aren't nearly as public than Steam, we can see a different story elsewhere. We can't sort games on storefronts by concurrents, but we can by recent sales (for the most part). For example, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is the second top selling game on the PlayStation Store as of writing. <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/all-games/console?xr=shellnav">The Xbox store</a> ranks Black Ops 7 at the top of "Most relevant", which indicates some degree of high interest from Xbox owners.</p><p>It's also worth noting other PC storefronts <em>do</em> exist, even if Steam is the most popular of them. Call of Duty has been available on the Battle.net launcher for a few years now, and there's the Microsoft games store too - though, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/top-paid/games/xbox">this store ranks Black Ops 7 15th in its Top Paid category</a>.</p>
<p>The game is also available on console and PC Game Pass, which may very well impact where it lands in terms of direct sales. Modern Warfare 3, which was previously highlighted as a peak for recent Call of Duty releases on Steam, did not launch day one on Game Pass. Black Ops 6 and Black Ops 7 did, which could very well have impacted these figures.
</p>
<p>The truth is obviously unclear as of right now, and we can only judge by Steam figures. However, Steam <em>is</em> the biggest PC platform, and it's not like Steam users are aliens with totally different wants than the console player base. With Black Ops 7 having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-the-lowest-metacritic-user-score-ever-for-a-call-of-duty-game">the lowest metacritic score for a Call of Duty game ever</a>, and other big hitters like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-only-been-out-a-day-and-its-already-one-of-steams-biggest-games-ever">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-breaks-its-pc-record-yet-again-as-it-inches-towards-half-a-million-concurrent-players#:~:text=Lotsa%20looters.&amp;text=Arc%20Raiders%20has%20blown%20past,peak%20by%20roughly%2030%2C000%20players.">Arc Raiders</a> popping up close to its release date, maybe Call of Duty has been jumped a bit this year.</p>
<p>If you are curious as to how Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">why not read Eurogamer's review</a>!</p>

            <p>Paradox Interactive has parted ways with Cities: Skylines developer Colossal Order in a mutual decision "made thoughtfully and in the interest of both teams".</p>
<p>The publisher and developer have worked together on the series for over 15 years. Now, Colossal Order will explore "new creative opportunities", while development on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a> will transfer to Finnish developer Iceflake Studios, which is one of Paradox's internal management game studios.</p>
<p>The city building sequel was released back in October 2023, but was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">heavily criticised at the time for performance issues</a>. Console versions, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2s-troubled-console-release-sounds-like-its-still-some-way-off">remain some way off following seemingly troubled development</a>.</p>

<p>"For over fifteen years, the Cities Series and our partnership with Paradox have been a defining part of our journey at Colossal Order," said Mariina Hallikainen, CEO of Colossal Order, in a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/">shared statement</a>.</p>
<p>"When we set out to create Cities in Motion, we never imagined it would grow to become a cherished franchise with a passionate, loyal community of millions of players around the world. We want to thank everyone at Paradox for their trust and collaboration, and of course the community for the incredible support that has made Cities what it is today. We're confident that the franchise will continue to thrive under Paradox's leadership. As we move forward, we're excited to channel our experience, creativity, and passion into new projects that align with our long-term vision."</p><p>Added Mattias Lilja, deputy CEO of Paradox Interactive: "Our partnership with Colossal Order is one of the longest-running relationships we've enjoyed here at Paradox. Four games, dozens of expansions, and a community of millions of Cities players; it's remarkable how much we've achieved together. We have deep respect for the Colossal Order team and we look forward to seeing where they go from here. On our end, we're eager to continue working for the passionate Cities: Skylines community and make sure to provide them with more content and new experiences."</p>
<p>Iceflake Studios will take over all ongoing development on Cities: Skylines 2, including free updates, continuous work on the Editor, forthcoming console editions, and future expansions. The studio will take the helm at the start of 2026.</p>
<p>"Taking the reins on a genre-leading franchise like Cities is an immense honour and a great responsibility," said Lasse Liljedahl, studio manager of Iceflake Studios.</p>
<p>"There's a huge, loyal community out there and I want to say to every member of that community that we will humbly carry this legacy with respect, together with all of you. Iceflake has the capacity and capability to get started. We have a decade worth of experience from making city building and management games. We see a strong foundation and so much potential waiting to be unleashed and I can't wait to show you what we have planned for the next chapter of this incredible game."</p>
<p>Colossal Order still has some work to finish up, including the forthcoming Bike Patch, Old Town buildings, bug fixes, and general improvements.</p>
<p>The last few years have been a troubling time for Paradox, known for publishing strategy and simulation games. News of this change in developer follows its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-developer-double-eleven-parts-way-with-paradox-after-nine-years-on-series">parting ways with Prison Architect 2 developer Double Eleven</a> last year, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-shuts-down-life-by-you-studio-following-sims-likes-sudden-cancellation">sudden cancellation of its Sims-like game Life By You</a>.</p><p>"What we have to do is start small, listen to the fans early, and most importantly, stay within our core,"<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-must-refocus-to-rebuild-trust-and-survive-bosses-say-after-life-by-you-cancellation"> Lilja told Eurogamer last year, discussing the company's future</a>. "We do more extensive and earlier peer reviews to get honest feedback earlier.</p>
<p>"We do want to take risks. We want to try new things," he added. "But we need to be much more disciplined about it than we've been."</p>
<p>Last month, Paradox released its long-awaited action-RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</a>, though it received negative reviews. "The Chinese Room has managed to make something from a box of inherited parts, but this action RPG feels hollow and functional, and is only redeemed by some stellar performances from the characters and cast," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">our review</a>.</p>
