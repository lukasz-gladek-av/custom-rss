            <p>The Pokémon Company has responded to a disturbing video from the US Department of Homeland Security posted on social media that used imagery and music from the Pokémon anime to promote the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-department-of-homeland-security-uses-pokemon-theme-song-and-images-in-disturbing-ice-promotion">Eurogamer reported yesterday</a>, the video (shared with the caption "Gotta Catch 'Em All") included footage of people being arrested alongside protagonist Ash Ketchum, as well as Pokémon card-style graphics of criminals.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company has shared the following statement with Eurogamer in response: "We are aware of a recent video posted by the Department of Homeland Security that includes imagery and language associated with our brand. Our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content, and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property."</p>
<p>The video was responded to with calls for Nintendo to sue for copyright infringement. However, the company is yet to respond to Eurogamer's request for comment regarding what action it plans to take in response to the unlicensed use of its property.</p>
