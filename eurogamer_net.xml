            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> producer and director <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> has once again warned players not to use third-party tools in the MMORPG.</p>
<p>In particular, there is one tool being used to check in-game character information not displayed during gameplay, which <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> is considering taking legal action over.</p>
<p>In a post on Final Fantasy 14 forum <a href="https://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/515102">The Lodestone</a>, Yoshida stated the development team is aware of this tool and concerns raised by the community.</p>

<p>"The tool is being used to display a segment of an FF14 character's internal account ID, which is then used in an attempt to further correlate information on other characters on the same FFXIV service account," explained Yoshida.</p>
<p>As a result, Square Enix is discussing requesting the tool be removed and deleted, as well as pursuing legal action.</p>
<p>Yoshida further assured players personal information is not accessible through this tool.</p>
<p>"Aside from character information that can be checked in-game and on the Lodestone, we have received concerns that personal information registered on a user's Square Enix account, such as address and payment information, could also be exposed with this tool," he said. "Please rest assured that it is not possible to access this information using these third-party tools."</p><p>He continued: "We strive to offer and maintain a safe environment for our players, which is why we ask everyone to refrain from using third-party tools. We also ask that players do not share information about third-party tools such as details about their installation methods, or take any other actions to assist in their dissemination."</p>
<p>Lastly, Yoshida reiterated that third-party tools are prohibited in Final Fantasy 14, concluding: "We will continue to take a firm stance against their usage."</p>
<p>It's a line Yoshida has repeatedly stated, despite some players using third-party tools and mods in the game.</p>
<p>Back in November last year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-world-first-ultimate-raid-challengers-busted-for-cheating-thanks-to-single-pixel">Ultimate Raid world first challenge was disrupted for the third year in a row</a> due to cheaters using a tool to highlight a character's exact hitbox.</p>
<p>"As the individual who is entrusted with full supervision over Final Fantasy 14, it is my responsibility to enact countermeasures and police the use of these tools, as well as educate people to not use these types of third-party tools - this is especially unfortunate when I, as a gamer, am cheering on everyone who is learning this content by trial and error and putting in the effort to clear," said Yoshida after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-extremely-disappointed-in-final-fantasy-14-mod-use">previous year's challenge was similarly disrupted</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
After partnerships with Halo, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> and Mountain Dew, Doritos' next video game promotion is the upcoming live-action/CGI Minecraft Movie starring Jason "Aquaman" Momoa and Jack "Tenacious D is on hold" Black.
</p>
<p>
Two new flavours are being rolled out - so you can finally find out what a Minecraft Creeper, and also a Ghast, taste like as a processed corn snack.
</p>
<p>
A press release today trumpets the fact that Doritos are also changing their shape for first time. Yes, the triangluar treat is turning square. But this will only be the case for a rare 100 packs - and if you find one, you win a £10k prize.

<p>
"Creeper Vinegar delivers a zesty, explosive flavour," Doritos said in a press release, describing its new flavour. Apparently, it is "reminiscent of the sneaky green creatures that lurk in the shadows". 
</p>
<p>
Ghast BBQ, meanwhile, "offers a sweet and tangy taste". 
</p>
<p>
So, basically salt and vinegar and then sweet chili.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movies-second-trailer-brings-deep-steve-lore-tree-punching-square-bee">Minecraft Movie is set to arrive in cinemas on 4th April</a>, and it looks... yeah. Jack Black plays default Minecraft man Steve, in a blocky CGI world that looks like Mojang's simulation put through an AI filter.
</p>
<p>
I'll give the salt and vinegar flavour a go, anyway.

            <p>Nintendo has added another three classic games to its SNES Switch Online collection, including one not seen in the west before.</p>
<p>The Mario maker promises "puzzles, brawls and ninjas galore" with these latest editions, which are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sutte Hakkun</li>
<li>Fatal Fury 2</li>
<li>Super Ninja Boy</li>

<p>Here's a little trailer for the three games, to give you a taste of what's in store.</p>

<p>Fatal Fury 2 is a SNES port of SNK's arcade fighting game. Will you choose to fight as Terry Bogard, or his younger brother Andy? Or perhaps wrestling as Big Bear is more your thing.</p>
<p>As for Sutte Hakkun, it's this chap's first official time in the west. It's a cute looking puzzler, where players control a little bird-like creature who can suck up liquids of different colours and then inject that liquid into once-colourless blocks to move them in different directions.</p>
<p>In case you were unaware, Nintendo Switch Online members can get themselves access to multiple NES, Super NES and Game Boy games.</p>
<p>Additionally, those who choose to go for the higher priced Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack option will also be able to get their mitts on Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance and SEGA Mega Drive games, along with other perks. That includes things like expansions for other Nintendo games, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-8-deluxes-final-wave-of-dlc-arrives-next-week">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's Booster Course Pass</a>.</p>

            <p>Kumail Nanjiani has reportedly joined the cast for the second season of Amazon's Fallout series.</p>

Amazon has not confirmed Nanjiani's casting, however, <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1882468492303388759">it is said</a> the actor - who previously appeared as Kingo the MCU's Eternals film alongside Angelina Jolie - will play "a high-ranking official within the Brotherhood of Steel".</p>
<p>Nanjiani looks set to join the likes of Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten, Kyle MacLachlan and Walton Goggins - who play wide-eyed vault dweller Lucy, squire of the Brotherhood of Steel Maximus, disgraced (at least, in the eyes of many) Vault-Tec executive Hank MacLean and the gunslinging Ghoul, respectively - when the series makes its return.</p>

            <p>
Well here we are again, with yet another <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> patch, despite CD Projekt having officially wrapped up development on the game last year. And the headline feature this time around is DLSS 4 support, added in anticipation of Nvidia's upcoming RTX 50 Series of GPUs.
</p>
<p>
As detailed in <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51296/patch-2-21">CD Projekt's update 2.21 patch notes</a>, Cyberpunk 2077 now supports "DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation for GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards, which boosts FPS by using AI to generate up to three times per traditionally rendered frame". This, the studio notes, will be enabled alongside the release of the RTX 50 Series next Thursday, 30th January. 
</p>
<p>
Additionally, DLSS 4's arrival brings "faster single Frame Generation with reduced memory usage" that's available for users with either RTX 50 and 40 Series GPUs. Furthermore, players "can now choose between the CNN model or the new Transformer model for DLSS Ray Reconstruction, DLSS Super Resolution, and DLAA on all GeForce RTX graphics cards today. The new Transformer model enhances stability, lighting, and detail in motion."

<p>
There's more going on in today's update than that, however. Version 2.21 also features an extensive range of fixes for Cyberpunk 2077's photo mode, and addresses various issues across the likes of vehicle colour customisation and character creation. Xbox and PlayStation users also get a number of platform-specific fixes, as detailed in <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51296/patch-2-21">CD Projekt's patch notes</a>.

Today's release follows December's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-22-adds-new-secrets-expanded-customisation-options-and-more">surprise 2.2 update</a>, which introduced the likes of expanded customisation options and new photo mode features - hence the focus on those particular modes in today's patch. CD Projekt's continuing support of Cyberpunk 2077 is perhaps a little surprising given the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-development-has-finally-wound-down-after-three-and-a-half-years">officially ended its development</a> last May - although a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-is-bringing-cyberpunk-2077-to-macs-early-next-year">Mac version</a> has since been announced for release this year.

As previously confirmed, the bulk of CD Projekt is now focused on developing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-confirms-new-the-witcher-game-in-development">announced back in 2022</a> and finally got its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">big Ciri-focused reveal</a> last year.
