<a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>'s "spring" arrival on PS5 has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">been known for a good few months now</a>, but with the season of daffodils and egg box art now almost upon us, we might finally have a specific release date to chew on. According to ultra-reliable leaker Billbil-kun, The Great Circle comes to Sony's consoles on 17th April, with pre-orders set to open soon.
</p>
<p>
Writing on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-les-dates-de-sortie-de-indiana-jones-et-le-cercle-ancien-sur-ps5-60055">Deallabs</a>, Billbil-kun (who has an excellent track record with PlayStation leaks) claimed their "recent investigations" had revealed the Standard edition of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will launch for PS5 on 17th April. However, Microsoft is reportedly also releasing a Premium version - just as it did on Xbox and PC - granting two days early access, from 15th April. Billbil-kun says they were unable to confirm if a PS5 Collector's Edition is in the works.
</p>
<p>
Billbil-kun claims The Great Circle's Standard and Premium editions will both be available as a physical release, with prices reportedly matching their Xbox equivalents. That means £69.99 / €79.99 / $69.99 USD for the Standard edition on PS5 and £99.99 / €109.99 / $99.99 for the Premium release. Pre-orders for both versions expected to go live on 25th March in Europe.

<p>
"Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones," Eurogamer's Katharine Castle <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">wrote in her five star review of The Great Circle</a> last year, "[this] is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames." And if you're somehow still on the fence after all the praise its received since its release, perhaps you might like to know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-eurogamers-game-of-2024">we loved The Great Circle enough that it was named Eurogamer's Game of the Year in 2024.</a>
</p>
<p>
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's PlayStation 5 release follows Microsoft's decision last year to bring select first-party Xbox releases to other platforms. And after a tentative first 12 months - which saw <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, Grounded, Pentiment, and Hi-fi Rush make the jump to either PS5 or Switch - 2025 looks to be a busy one. Microsoft has already confirmed the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-age-of-mythology-and-age-of-empires-2-remasters-heading-to-ps5-this-year">Age of Empires 2</a>, Age of Mythology Retold, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-forza-horizon-5-officially-heading-to-playstation-5-this-spring">Forza Horizon 5</a>, Doom: The Dark Ages, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2 are heading to PS5 - with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Halo">Halo and Flight Simulator 2024 reportedly also on the way</a>.

            <p>When the second season of The Last of Us airs this April, viewers will be introduced to the character of Abby.</p>
<p>Those who know the games will be aware of the conversation around this character, with some already expressing concern about the toxicity actress Kaitlyn Dever will likely receive through proxy of playing Abby. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/abby-actress-kaitlyn-dever-protected-by-extra-security-while-filming-the-last-of-us-season-two">Dever required extra security on set because of the role</a>.</p>
<p>But, while Dever has admitted it's "hard not to see those things on the internet", she has worked to "do this character justice" in The Last of Us' second season.</p>

<p>When asked by <a href="https://screenrant.com/last-us-season-2-abby-backlash-kaitlyn-dever-response/">ScreenRant</a> if she pays attention to how people anticipate a character such as The Last of Us Part 2's Abby, Dever replied:</p>
<p>"Well, it's hard not to see those things on the internet. It's hard not to stop myself from looking at it every once in a while, especially going into this, for sure. And I want to do this character justice and make the fans proud by bringing her to life in this kind of way."</p>
<p>Dever added her "main focus was just the collaboration between Neil [Druckmann] and Craig [Mazin], and making sure I was really getting to the core of who she is and what drives her and her emotional state; her anger and her frustration and her grief and all of that," before closing: </p>
<p>"I wanted to make sure that that was what I was focusing most of my energy on."</p>
