            <p>Tomonobu Itagaki, responsible for creating both the Dead or Alive and 3D <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> series, has died.</p>
<p>The announcement came via one final post on his Facebook profile. This news was corroborated by Itagaki's friend <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/milkman.bsky.social/post/3m3c3gq5q7c2k">James Mielke on Bluesky</a>, who posted their own statement mourning Itagaki.</p>
<p>The final message from Itagaki reads as follows:</p>
<p>"Final Words,</p>
<p>"The flame of my life is about to go out. The fact that this message has been posted means that my time has finally come. I am no longer in this world. (I have entrusted someone important to me with this final message).</p><p>"My life was a continuous battle which I kept winning. I caused a lot of trouble for others too. I take pride in having fought to the end, and having followed my convictions. I have no regrets, but I am deeply sorry that I could not deliver new works to my fans.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. So it goes.</p>
<p>"Itagaki Tomonobu"</p>

<p>Tomonobu Itagaki was a celebrated figure in the Japanese video game development industry. He formed Team Ninja (originally called Tecmo Creative #3) back in the late 90's, creating not only the Dead or Alive series of fighting games, but also the 3D Ninja Gaiden games and Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball.</p>
<p>His career was not without strife. In 2006, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doa-producer-slapped-with-sex-suit/1100-6161240/">a former co-worker of Itagaki sued him for sexual harassment</a> which he denied, losing his executive officer role as a result. Ultimately, he was deemed innocent by Japanese courts in 2007.</p>
<p>Later in 2010, Itagaki and Koei Tecmo reached a settlement after Itagaki claimed the company was withholding bonuses for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-or-alive-4">Dead or Alive 4</a>. Itagaki moved on to develop <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/devils-third">Devil's Third</a> at Valhalla Game Studios.
</p>
<p>Valhalla Game Studios eventually closed, leading Itagaki to form Itagaki Games in late 2021. This studio has been working on a new game ever since.</p>
<p>Tomonobu Itagaki, known for his love of sunglasses and long-lasting career in the games industry, leaves behind a daughter.</p>
