            <p>Nintendo will be present at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> 2025, having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-skipping-gamescom-2024-report">skipped the event last year</a>.</p>
<p>The company confirmed it would be returning to the annual German event, which is the highest attended gaming convention in the world, in a post on social media.</p>
<p>"Mark your calendar in red: Nintendo will be back at<a href="https://x.com/gamescom"> @gamescom</a> in 2025," Nintendo's German X account announced, adding it is "[looking] forward to welcoming you to Cologne from August 20th to 24th!"</p>

<p>Yes, Gamescom will be held in August, which - as I'm sure you're aware - is after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Nintendo Switch 2</a> releases. So, with that in mind, what can those attending the convention expect to see from the Mario maker?</p>
<p>Well, Nintendo hasn't shared specifics. However,  two of Nintendo's biggest first party games <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> will have already been released by the time Gamescom comes around, though it seems likely these will be available for players to demo while in Cologne.</p>
<p>"Yes, everyone might have been expecting Mario, but Bananza's brawny obliteration is far better suited to his one-time enemy," our former EIC Tom Phillips wrote after going <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-reveals-a-proper-generational-upgrade-though-its-biggest-new-idea-remains-unproven">hands-on with Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p> <div>

<p>Meanwhile, other games coming to the Switch successor have also been available to try out at other events including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>, so it again seems fair to assume it will be playable at Nintendo's Gamescom booth. Maybe we will hear a firm release date around then, as well.</p>
<p>Our Ed called Metroid Prime 4 "the best example of Switch 2's varied control capabilities" when he took the upcoming release for a spin earlier this year, though for now he isn't totally convinced by the mouse (as a reminder, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-good-are-switch-2s-mouse-controls-eurogamers-verdict-from-the-big-reveal-event">Switch 2 Joy-Con will boast mouse functionality on the console's release</a>).</p>
<p>"I played Metroid Prime 4 with each Joy-Con 2 placed on my thighs. This worked surprisingly well, with the controls still responsive despite being on an uneven surface. Nintendo told me the sensitivity can be tweaked too, allowing for smaller movements," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-is-the-best-example-of-switch-2s-varied-control-capabilities-but-you-might-want-to-work-on-your-thighs">Eurogamer's Metroid Prime 4 demo preview</a>.</p>
<p>"Still, how usable this method is will likely depend on the size of your thighs: if you don't have enough real estate to move the controller around, you'll be moving based on quick adjustments rather than smooth, sweeping motions." (Personally, I have quite generous thigh real estate.)</p>
<p>We will keep you posted with any more news regarding Gamescom 2025, and of course Switch 2, as and when we hear more.

            <p>The mobile version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> will be released in June, but only in China.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a trailer for the game was released on Chinese video platform <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1BeEtzBEip/?spm_id_from=333.1387.homepage.video_card.click">Bilibili</a> including the date, while a Live Letter stream provided new details on the game.</p>
<p>The mobile game is being developed by the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>-owned Lightspeed Studio, which previously developed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> Mobile, hence being released in China first.</p>

<p>However, a global release is still expected, though its date is unknown. In the meantime, players worldwide are able to sign up for updates and news on future tests on the <a href="https://ffxivmobile.com/web202409/index.html#/">game's website</a>.</p>
<p>A livestream for the game provided fresh details, including its 16 gear dye layers that will allow players to customise the look of their Warrior of Light in great detail.</p>
<p>For comparison, the main Final Fantasy 14 added only its second dye layer with the latest expansion, Dawntrail.</p>
<p>Also shown, as per a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1kqa1wx/xiv_mobile_live_letter_notes_16_dye_layers_dodge/">reddit thread</a>, were a new dodge button for all classes, as well as auto-pathing to quests and fates for ease of control - note there won't be auto-combat.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-mobile-officially-revealed">Final Fantasy 14 Mobile was officially revealed</a> by director and producer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> back in November last year. He confirmed the game will be free-to-play but won't include gacha mechanics.</p>
<p>A trailer at the time gave us our first proper look at gameplay, including a fully-realised version of Eorzea in the palm of your hand.</p>
<p>The game's release will follow the cancellation and shutdown of a number of mobile games from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> in recent years.</p>
<p>Just last week, the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-cancelled-but-kingdom-hearts-4-still-on-the-way">cancelled development of mobile game Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link</a>, though confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-look-at-kingdom-hearts-4-in-three-years-suggests-mickey-mouse-is-playable">Kingdom Hearts 4 is still on the way</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-sees-game-sales-drop-but-multiplatform-strategy-continues-in-earnest">Square Enix's latest financial reports showed a drop in sales of its games</a>, particularly with mobile games owing to multiple cancellations. However, sales and profits of its MMOs have increased thanks to Final Fantasy 14 expansion Dawntrail.</p>
<p>It makes business sense, then, to release a version of the MMORPG on mobile as part of its multiplatform strategy.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
