            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> has today added its latest booster pack, Shining Revelry, and alongside it a new card only obtainable by purchasing with real money.</p>
<p>The new booster pack adds a further 72 cards to be collected, as well as a fresh set of Deck Missions and Themed Collections.</p>
<p>Yet in the store is a new bundle under the Premium section, which includes a unique promo Mewtwo EX card. The bundle costs £18.49.</p>

<p>The bundle also includes a Shiny Mewtwo coin, playmat, and card sleeve, as well as a Shiny Radiance frame and cover, plus a bunch of gold.</p>
<p>Still, this is the first time a card has been locked behind a bundle rather than being obtainable the usual way by opening booster packs.</p>

<p>For those looking to complete their deck, you'll need to cough up the £18.49 for the privilege - at least for now. Perhaps the promo card will be introduced elsewhere in the future.</p>
<p>Another bundle has also been added for the same price, though this does not include a unique card. Instead it has accessories designed around Sinnoh region champion Cynthia.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the update has altered the Wonder Pick animation - it's now much quicker, perhaps to stop players guessing their order.</p>
<p>Shining Revelry, as the name suggests, adds a number of shiny Pokémon to the digital card collecting game, including a black Charizard, golden Lucario, and pink squirrel Pachirisu.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-next-booster-pack-adds-shiny-pokemon">Ranked Matches will also join with this booster pack</a>, with the first in-game session beginning tomorrow, Friday 28th March.</p>
<p>Later this year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-overhauls-trading-following-player-backlash">trading feature will be overhauled following a backlash from players</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It's been exactly ten years since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars of Eternity</a> thundered out into the world, and developer Obsidian Entertainment is celebrating the occasion with a new patch and the announcement it'll be adding turn-based combat to the acclaimed old-school RPG.
</p>
<p>
"Coming later this year," the studio wrote in a <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134573-patch-138087535-is-live/">post on its forums</a>, "Watchers will be able to help us test a brand-new feature: turn-based combat. We're excited to explore this new way to experience encounters in Pillars of Eternity, and your feedback will help shape its future." Obsidian says more details on how to participate in the test will be shared "in the near future".
</p>
<p>
That does suggest it could be a while before Pillars of Eternity's turn-based combat mode is ready for its full release, meaning players will just have to make do with classic real-time with pause battling until then. But the wait will hopefully worth it - turn-based combat worked well enough when it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pillars-of-eternity-2-deadfire-getting-a-full-on-turn-based-mode-this-week">introduced to Pillars of Eternity 2 as part of a post-launch update back in 2019</a>, so it should be a welcome addition to the original Pillars of Eternity too.

<p>
In the more immediate term, Obsidian isn't letting today's 10-year anniversary go by without something tangible for fans. It's also released a brand-new Pillars of Eternity update - officially titled Patch 1.3.8.0.87535 - promising a "wide range of fixes and improvements across visuals, combat, quests, and more" that the studio says should make the experience "a little smoother". You'll find the full patch notes at the end of this story.
</p>
<p>
"It's an RPG with design firmly rooted in nostalgia, but one that absolutely doesn't rely on it to be enjoyable today," Eurogamer contributor Richard Cobbett <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pillars-of-eternity-review">said of Pillars of Eternity in his Recommended review</a> ten years ago. "Instead, it's both a great reminder of why those games worked so well, and a brand new adventure well worth the hours upon hours (upon hours upon hours) that it takes to pick away at its secrets and its world."
