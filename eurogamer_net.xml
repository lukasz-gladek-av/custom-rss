            <p>The person allegedly once earmarked for the role of lead designer of The Elder Scrolls 6, Kurt Kuhlmann, has said that if they had their way, the game would have been like the beloved Star Wars movie The Empire Strikes Back.</p>
<p>His idea - he who spent 20 years working at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a> on nearly every Elder Scrolls game, including being co-lead designer of Skyrim - was the elven supremacists the Thalmor, the game's baddies, would temporarily win, Kuhlmann told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/bethesdas-former-elder-scrolls-loremaster-on-why-he-left-starfields-communication-breakdowns-and-how-he-wanted-the-elder-scrolls-6-to-be-the-empire-strikes-back/">PCGamer</a>. Evil would triumph and there'd be something of a cliffhanger, and you'd get a chance at revenge in the next instalment, The Elder Scrolls 7.</p>
<p>"I had in my mind that TES6 was going to be like The Empire Strikes Back," Kuhlmann said. The player might have "secretly saved the day" by rescuing an heir to the throne, say, preserving hope for another day, "but overall it looks like the Thalmor are on the march". It would be a welcome change from the 'chosen one' storyline The Elder Scrolls games always use, he believed.</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX9UuAt6FqI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>Bethesda Game Studios boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> allegedly verbally offered Kuhlmann the lead designer role on TES6, Kuhlman said, when work finished on Skyrim. The studio's plan then was apparently to make <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a> and return to the famed fantasy series afterwards. But this didn't come to be. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> diverted the studio's attention and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> preoccupied it for several years afterwards, meaning it would be 11 years before Bethesda Game Studios returned properly to the next Elder Scrolls game.</p>
<blockquote><em>"It wasn't just my expectation - I had been told that that was going to happen"</em></blockquote>
<p>Kuhlmann, who'd been a lead systems designer on Starfield in the meantime, was ready for his call-up. "I was obviously one of the old-timers there and had a lot of experience," he said. "Bruce [Nesmith] and I had been the co-leads on Skyrim. I think most people would call it a successful project, so I thought that it wasn't unreasonable for me to think that I could be a successful lead on TES6. It wasn't just my expectation - I had been told that that was going to happen. And they made the decision, no, you're not going to be the lead."</p>
<p>Bethesda apparently offered him a different role on the project instead - "an important role", Kuhlmann said Howard called it. "But what I wanted and what he wanted were different at that point," he said. There was no indication Howard remembered the alleged verbal promise made years earlier and no reference was ever made to it. This, coupled with the ways in which the studio had changed during the development of Starfield, as it ballooned across multiple studios, contributed to Kuhlmann's decision to leave Bethesda Game Studios in 2023.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Kuhlmann - once considered the loremaster of Elder Scrolls - acknowledges that leading the Elder Scrolls today is a different proposition to leading the studios back in 2011. "The role of lead on TES 6 is very different from the role of lead on Skyrim," he said. He also doesn't think his Empire Strikes Back idea would ever have flown with the team. Ending on a loss and a cliffhanger? "That's not a good way to end a game and say, yeah, we'll see you in 10, 15 years."</p><p>The Elder Scrolls 6 is now, blessedly, properly under way, having been announced ridiculously early back at an E3 in 2018, before Starfield was anywhere near made. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard-but-development-is-his-everyday-thing">Todd Howard said last November that the game was still "a long way off"</a>, but it sounds like a lengthy pre-production process is done and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-todd-howard-wishes-elder-scrolls-6-development-went-a-little-faster-but-says-its-progressing-really-well">the majority of the studio is working on it</a>. I can't wait to play it in 2030. Stop it, Bertie, stop it.</p>

            <p>Arknights Endfield has surpassed 35,000,000 pre-registered players ahead of its release on the 22nd January.</p>
<p>This news comes alongside a new launch trailer for the game, which can be viewed below. These 35 pre-registered players not only get to sign up for the game early, but have collectively earned a series of milestone-based rewards for the playerbase once the game releases.</p>
<p>These include in-game credits, a free five-star operator, and some gacha currency used to pull for in-game characters. The pre-launch community for Arknights Endfield also managed to pass a social media milestone previously, which means a five star weapon and additional gacha currency.</p>

<p>Arknights Endfield, for those who don't know, is a blend between a squad-based action RPG and a base/factory management system. You collect and enhance a gaggle of distinct characters to use in combat scenarios, while in the background you build and expand a growing hub of facilities to aid you as the game progresses. Think, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> meets Factorio for an over-generalised idea of what's on offer here.</p><p>It's been in development for a good while, being a spinoff from Hypergryph's 2019 game Arknights. Having first released a trailer for the game back in 2022, the game has been steadily gaining a wave of intrigued players thanks to ongoing beta tests and drip-fed trailers. The result of which being that staggering number of pre-registered players.</p>
<p>Is Arknights Endfield your cup of tea? Let us what you think below!</p>

            <p>That music which was reuploaded for Assassin's Creed: Black Flag was apparently just due to "technical issues", so stop reading too much into it, ok.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Ubisoft set tongues wagging when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-music-upload">reuploaded a sizable selection of sea shanties from Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag</a> over on its YouTube music channel. Many assumed this was all because a remake of the studio's piratical Assassin's Creed adventure is on the cards.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>However, apparently an impending Black Flag remake - which these days feels like the world's worst kept shared secret - has absolutely nothing to do with it, or so Ubisoft claims. Rather, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkx_qiROkA8vcnQk_a-1BH_gW4gTLnDetS0">studio has cited</a> "technical issues" as the reason for the shanties' sudden appearance on YouTube.</p>
<p>Here's Ubisoft's full statement: "Hi there music lovers! We encountered some technical issues with a few of our videos, which we had to reupload. Apologies for the trouble, and hope you enjoy the music."</p>
<p>Needless to say, though, many are unconvinced with the company's response. "Technical issues in the Animas that calls for a resync in Assassin's Creed Black Flag," reads one reply, while another adds: "yeah suuuuuuure." Another user is quite blunt, and has called this reasoning by Ubisoft "b******t".</p>

</figure>
<p>Now, like I have said, we are all basically just waiting for Ubisoft to confirm that yes, Black Flag is getting a remake. We all are 99.9 percent sure it is happening. Back in August of last year, voice actor Matt Ryan - who portrayed Edward Kenway in Assassin's Creed: Black Flag - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-threatened-with-legal-action-following-remake-slip-up">claimed legal action was brought against him by Ubisoft</a> after cheekily hinting at its existence at a convention.</p>
<p>Then, just a couple of months ago in November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-could-set-sail-before-april">the company's financial reports stated an unannounced title was due to be released during the fourth quarter of this financial year</a>. That would be before April.</p>
<p>And, if <em>all that </em>wasn't enough to convince you this remake is real, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">a PEGI listing for Black Flag Resynced was spotted</a> in December. It really does seem to be a case of when, not if this remake is coming. But that music was <em>definitely </em>about technical issues…</p>
