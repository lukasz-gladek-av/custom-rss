            <p>After what has felt like eons of waiting and wondering (and, for some people, setting up summoning circles), we still don't have a firm release for Silksong, but Xbox has confirmed again it will at least be some time this year. </p>
<p>The news was shared by Xbox's Sarah Bond, when she was chatting about handheld devices (more on that in another article, which I will link back to once it is live). </p>
<p>So, it isn't much, but yay for another Silksong mention! We are getting closer, people. </p>
<p>Of course, the time for an actual launch date has to come eventually, and more recently the signs were pointing to an imminent release. Just this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-update-ignites-perfectly-reasonable-shadow-drop-hopes">Silksong updates on SteamDB got fans predicted some kind of shadow drop or launch news</a>, while a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-release-window-finally-narrowed-down">Switch 2 teaser from April assured fans that the Hollow Knight follow up would arrive this year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Free-to-play "Halo meets Portal" shooter Splitgate 2 says it hears you "loud and clear" about some of the eye-watering prices that have popped up on its in-game store.</p>
<p>In a video update posted to Twitter, 1047 Games' CEO Ian Proulx said he was "doubling down" on being "community first" and confirmed the team was slashing its $80 cosmetics bundle - which was reportedly already on sale from an original $145 price tag - to $40 after fans complained about the pricing.</p>

<p>Proulx also touched upon his "Make FPS Great Again" cap, saying: "Obviously, some people didn't receive it the way we intended. Our intention is truly to make FPS [games] as good as possible. It's plain and simple."</p>

            <p>A new Tales Of remaster is on the way.</p>
<p>As part of the 30th anniversary celebration, a blink-and-you'll-miss-it tease popped up on social media earlier today, confirming there's a new Tales of Remastered project in the works. Which one? Well, Bandai Namco's being coy about that.</p>

<p>"The next Tales of Remastered will be announced this summer!" the tweet said andâ€¦ well, nothing else, really. And as for exactly what "this summer" means? That could be the end of August. It could be the end of today. Who knows. As <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bandai-namco-teases-new-tales-of-remaster-announcement/">VGC</a> points out, its proximity to this evening's Xbox Games Showcase is probably not a coincidence, though.</p> <div>

<p>As always, we'll let you know as/when this pops up again.</p>
<p>The Tales series is an RPG franchise that's been around for three whole decades. Kicking off in 1995 with Tales of Phastasia, there have since been 28 mainline titles and multiple spin-off games across all kinds of media, including anime and manga. Our most recent game was Tales of Graces f Remastered, which released at the beginning of the year.</p>

    <div id="main-content">
        

        <p>"Maintaining transparency and confidence with the community here is always our goal," the developer said.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Gearbox has confirmed via a statement that its games do not contain "spyware" after fans had "concerns about Take-Two's terms of service".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/49520/discussions/0/598528766295202095/">statement</a>, published to Steam, explicitly states that Gearbox's publisher, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>, does "not use spyware in its games", and confirmed its privacy policy applies not only to players, but also labels, studios, games, and services across all media and platform types.</p>
<p>Gearbox was forced to make the clarification after all of the Borderlands games were review-bombed on Steam by players who believe the updated terms were suspicious. Others were unhappy that the revised agreements made mods "a bannable offense", along with using cheats and exploits, or even just using a VPN. A forced arbitration clause for unhappy players in the US also caused considerable consternation.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the details of the revised EULA have <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/49520/discussions/0/598528666219110913/">fans reporting that the latest update</a>, if accepted, gives Gearbox "access to root access to your computer under the guise of 'anticheat' software," including access to "IP address, personal information, network traffic, and pictures on your PC", which the developer refutes.</p>
<p>"We know there have been some concerns from Borderlands fans about Take-Twoâ€™s Terms of Service. Maintaining transparency and confidence with the community here is always our goal, and we wanted to address some of these concerns," the statement begins.</p>
<figure>

<p>"Take-Two does not use spyware in its games. Take-Twoâ€™s Privacy Policy applies to all labels, studios, games, and services across all media and platform types such as console, PC, mobile app, and website. The Privacy Policy identifies the data activities that may be collected but this does not mean that every example is collected in each game or service."</p>
<p>The latter half of the statement, however, was still contentious for some.</p>
<p>"Take-Twoâ€™s Terms of Service prohibit mods that allow users to gain an unfair advantage, negatively impact the ability of other users to enjoy the game as intended, or allow users to gain access to content that the user is not entitled to," the statement added. "We do this to protect the integrity of the game experience for all users. Take-Two generally does not seek to take action against mods that are single-player only, non-commercial, and respect the intellectual property (IP) rights of its labels and third parties."</p>
<p>Gearbox locked the thread so players could not respond, but players are continuing to make their thoughts known via the user review sections of all Borderlands games on Steam.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-slam-gearbox-ceo-randy-pitchfords-message-to-cost-sensitive-fans">Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford double-doubled down on comments about the cost of Borderlands 4</a>, by inviting "cost sensitive" fans to download <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tiny-tinas-wonderlands">Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</a> from the Epic Games Store for "FREE".</p>
<p>These latest comments come after Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford made headlines when he told a X/Twitter commenter that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/80-for-borderlands-4-too-costly-randy-pitchford-says-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen">"real fans" would find a way to get their hands on a copy of the game, even if it came with a $80 price tag.</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-randy-pitchford-seeks-to-justify-80-real-fans-comment">He later tried to justify it</a>, all the while saying pricing was "not [his] call".</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 is arriving earlier than expected on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-forward-perhaps-because-2k-knows-exactly-when-gta-6-is-coming-out">12th September</a>, and developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-some-new-borderlands-4-gameplay-to-go-with-that-revised-release-date">Gearbox recently shared more of its latest looter shooter in a new PlayStation showcase</a>. It showed off a couple of new Vault Hunters, some of its new weapons, new traversal mechanics, its new planet, and more, all to whip up enthusiasm for what creative director Graeme Timmins called "hands-down our best Borderlands ever".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
