            <p><strong>UPDATE 4.40pm:</strong> Eurogamer has confirmed with Nintendo that there are no current plans to adjust the ongoing pre-order process here in the UK.</p>
<p>The original story continues below.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL 4.15pm:</strong> Those in the US looking to pre-order a Switch 2 will have to wait a little longer to do so than first expected.</p>
<p>In a statement shared with GameSpot's <a href="https://x.com/tamoorh">Tamoor Hussain</a>, Nintendo stated pre-orders in the US - which were scheduled to go live on 9th April - will now be delayed "in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions".</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Nintendo has not said when Switch 2 pre-orders in the US will open.</p>

<p>US president Donald Trump imposed wide-reaching trade tariffs earlier this week, with some of the highest levies targeting countries which also happen to be critical centres of video games hardware manufacturing.</p>
<p>According to Entertainment Software Association (ESA) senior vice president Aubrey Quinn, these <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-tariffs-will-have-a-real-and-detrimental-impact-on-games-industry-says-us-trade-group">tariffs will "have a real and detrimental impact" on the video games industry</a>. Quinn's comment follows on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-switch-2-actually-cheaper-than-the-original-console-cost-in-the-uk-and-whats-the-situation-with-switch-2-pricing-globally">industry analyst Daniel Ahmad's own earlier this week</a>, where the Niko Partners director of research and insights said:</p>
<p>"While the company has shifted some of its manufacturing to Vietnam to offset US tariffs on China, the looming threat of reciprocal tariffs prior to the Switch 2 showcase will have also forced Nintendo to consider a higher price for the rest of the world. The reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Japan have come in higher than expected, and Nintendo will feel the impact of this if the tariffs go into full effect."</p>
<p>While as of today Switch 2 pre-orders have been delayed, Nintendo said the Switch 2 will still release on 5th June in the US, as originally planned. It remains possible retail prices for Switch 2 could change following the news regarding tariffs.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Walmart Gaming Canada's <a href="https://x.com/WalmartCAGaming/status/1908136995685032054">social media account</a> is still touting a 9th April date for pre-orders. </p>

<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-pre-orders-will-prioritise-players-with-the-most-switch-playtime">Nintendo itself is enforcing strict criteria on pre-orders</a> from its own store in a bid to reduce scalping, while multiple online UK retailers have started pre-orders. However, the likes of Argos have already run out of stock.</p>
