Nintendo has finally detailed how US tariffs will impact the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, and confirmed price rises for an array of console accessories "due to changes in market conditions".
</p>
<p>A new set of Joy-Con 2 controllers, for example, will now cost $95, an increase of $5. The Switch 2 Pro controller and Switch 2 camera have also seen $5 price rises, up to $85 and $55 respectively.
</p>
<p>
But the $450 Switch 2 itself, including its $500 bundle with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, will not increase in price for now, Nintendo has decided. The cost of key software launches Mario Kart World ($80 when bought separately) and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> ($70) will also remain unchanged "at launch", Nintendo has said.

<p>
The news comes amidst a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-treehouse-live-viewers-have-very-clear-message-for-nintendo">backdrop of calls from fans for Nintendo to <em>lower</em> the price of Switch 2</a> - something that seemed increasingly unlikely as the expected impact of tariffs became clear.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, a statement from Nintendo today makes clear that price rises may still take place in future - and not just for Switch 2.
</p>
<p>
"Other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future depending on market conditions," the company said.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 pre-orders in the US, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">which had been delayed while Nintendo took stock of the fluctuating economic situation</a>, will now finally begin next Thursday, 24th April.
</p>
<p>
"We apologise for the retail pre-order delay, and hope this reduces some of the uncertainty our customers may be facing," Nintendo added. 
</p>
<p>
"We thank our customers for their patience, and we share their excitement to experience Nintendo Switch 2 starting 5th June 2025."
</p>
<p>Eurogamer previously heard from an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-likely-to-stick-with-switch-2s-450-launch-price-despite-trump-tariffs-says-analyst">analyst that predicted Nintendo would likely not raise the price of Switch 2 in response to tariffs</a>, as it faced criticism of the console's cost already.</p>
<p>
While a portion of Switch 2 consoles are being manufactured in China, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-already-shipped-over-1m-vietnam-made-consoles-to-us-this-year-as-switch-2-launch-threatened-by-tariffs">Nintendo has also used factories in Vietnam and diverted the majority of their manufactured  stock to the US</a> in advance of the current US-Chinese trade war taking effect.
