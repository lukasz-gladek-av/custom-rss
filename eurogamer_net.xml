            <p>Today is 31st October, which means one thing: It's Halloween!</p>
<p>To honour the occasion, Google has come over all bewitching with a spooky little mini-game to help while away the time before we can shut down our computers and head out trick or treating.</p>
<p>The game itself pops you into the shoes, or paws, of a little witch cat in a space helmet, who needs to ward off a number of creepy evils by drawing spell runes with their wand. This is done with your mouse, and let me tell you, it is all quite engrossing and more than a tad tense.</p>

<p>I gave the game a whirl myself (I want to be thorough with my reporting, it has nothing to do with frivolous fun I promise...) and managed to get to the final level before my hearts were all depleted. My top score was 16000, which was better than Tom's so I can sleep easy tonight knowing I am clearly <strong>The Best Gamer</strong> on the news team.</p>
<p>I do want to finish the final level, however, so I will go back again later to try again.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to give the game a go yourself, <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?ddllb=1&amp;doodle=306734893&amp;hl=en-GB">you can try it out here</a>. Have fun!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-alarmo-hack-cant-yet-run-doom-but-can-display-picture-of-a-cat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Nintendo's leftfield launch this month of Alarmo, an interactive alarm clock, was something of a surprise. 
</p>
<p>
Less of a surprise is the fact that enterprising electronics fans are now taking it to pieces, and trying to work out how it... ticks.
</p>
<p>
Alarmo has a relatively robust set of security protocols under the hood, though Wii U reverse engineer GaryOderNichts has gotten far enough to run custom code on the alarm clock via a USB (thanks <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/random-someones-figured-out-how-to-run-custom-code-on-nintendos-alarmo">Nintendo Life</a>) and display... a photo of a cat.

<p>
Getting to this stage looks (relatively) straightforward - there's no taking Alarmo to pieces needed for this. (And indeed, <a href="https://garyodernichts.blogspot.com/2024/10/looking-into-nintendo-alarmo.html">he did previously take Alarmo to pieces</a> to try and make more progress that way.)

<p>
There's no practical use to any of this at the moment, but work by Gary and others is continuing. What games would you like to see working on Alarmo's 2.8-inch LCD screen? With two buttons and a rotational dial, I reckon Tetris might work. And you wouldn't even have to leave bed!

            <p>Toby Fox has assured fans that the next two <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a> chapters will be released next year. In fact, the developer is "100 percent" on that.</p>
<p>Deltarune charts the adventures of human teenager Kris and their lizard friend Suzie in the mystery Dark World. It's a spiritual successor to retro-style RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/undertale">Undertale</a>, though it takes place in a different setting.</p>
<p>Its first chapter launched as a free download <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-creator-says-the-rest-of-deltarune-has-not-been-made-yet">towards the end of 2018</a>. A second free instalment then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-chapter-2-arrives-this-week-on-pc">arrived in September 2021</a>, and the promise of more to come followed. We are still to actually get our hands on the next chapter, however, but Fox has now shared a small morsel of an update on its arrival.</p>

<p>After sharing a Deltarune image for Halloween on social media platform X, the developer went on to state that he was "very eager" to share what's being worked on.</p>
<p>Fox said chapters three and four would "100 percent come out in 2025". However, the developer couldn't give a more specific time frame right now, due to "localisation and console porting" on the development side of things. In October of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-release-strategy-altered-will-be-available-to-purchase-sooner">Fox said chapter three was "content complete"</a>.</p>
<p>"Please hear me clawing at the door trying to escape the shallow coffin I have been buried in," Fox's post closed. Well, it is Halloween.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-creator-working-on-deltarune-chapters-3-to-5">previous plan</a> was to release chapters three, four and five of Deltarune together, and make the game available to purchase. Last year, however, this plan changed, as Fox said chapter 5 was still a way off.</p>
<p>"And I don't think anybody really wants to wait that long to release anything. Especially me," Fox explained at the time.</p>

            <p>Two Point Studios has announced the next museum type coming to its forthcoming Two Point Museum, and it's a spooky one in time for Halloween.</p>
<p>Yes, players will be able to manage their very own supernatural museum in the form of Wailon Lodge and its Ghostology exhibits.</p>
<p>This remote, old-fashioned and haunted location in Two Point County is far from a cosy holiday destination, but with the help of "ghostly front-of-house" Winston Wailon, players will transform the hotel into an eerie museum.</p>

<p>Of course, the big question is what sort of exhibits will we be able to put on show?</p>
<p>In this museum, players can create "immersive Polterguest Rooms to turn wandering spirits into museum guests", while expeditions into the Netherworld Rift will yield new exhibits and relics.</p>
<p>The trailer above also shows levitating furniture, a giant man-eating plant, and ectoplasm splatters. So, plenty of ways to scare the crap out of museumgoers, then.</p>
<p>Ghostology joins the already-revealed prehistoric and aquarium exhibits. I'm still hoping for an art gallery heist level, personally.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-point-museum-opens-for-visitors-next-march">Two Point Museum is set for release next March</a> across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>Ahead of the game's reveal, I spoke with design director Ben Huskins and executive producer Jo Koehler on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-point-museum-turns-a-fresh-slice-of-mundane-life-into-a-wacky-british-adventure">how Two Point Museum develops the series formula</a> from Hospital and Campus to mix the mundane and the whacky.</p>
<p>"We have some stuff that is grounded in reality," said Huskins, "so we obviously look at what are the sorts of things people would expect to see in a museum, because we always want that grounding. But then we have those slightly more out-there things that make sense in the world of Two Point County.</p>
<p>"It's about getting that variety, both in terms of what these cool exhibits look like but also how they behave and how the player interacts with them."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a post on social media, the developer shared a playful gif showing off the impressive download number. It also left us with this interesting little factoid. Apparently of those 50m downloads, 10k of those were players renaming Baldur's Gate 3's mysterious Undead entity, Withers.</p>
<p>And, what are people renaming him? Well, Bone Daddy, of course! "So, uh, glad we could facilitate that," Larian wrote in its post.</p>

<p>We knew mods were a hit for Baldur's Gate 3 players already.

<p>Mod support then came to console and Mac players in October, when the team revealed over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-says-baldurs-gate-3-console-mods-smashing-records-just-a-week-after-release">1.7m mods were downloaded in the first 24 hours of release on consoles</a>.</p>

<p>The developer is yet to formally reveal its next project, it has confirmed two games are currently in the works - both of which will be based on its own IPs and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">described as the studio's "best work ever"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo has launched Nintendo Music, a new music download and streaming app for your smartphone with access to a library of the company's top video game tunes. 
</p>
<p>
Available now via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nintendo-music/id6466376604">iPhone App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.znba&amp;pli=1">Google Play</a>, the app requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to let you mooch around with Mario or pick up your morning jog with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin">Pikmin</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo Music features playlists from dozens of Nintendo games across the years, with more to be added over time. You can play themes from specific games, or from playlists themed around certain Nintendo characters, music genres and moods.

<p>
There's also the ability to curate your playlists, and hide music from games you haven't played (or don't want to hear) via a Spoiler function. 
</p>
<p>
Best of all, tracks can be extended (you can choose from either 15 minutes, 30 minutes or a full hour) allowing you to bliss out to some relaxing Animal Crossing or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin-4">Pikmin 4</a> vibes all night long. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo has increasingly taken a sterner stance towards the hosting of its music elsewhere on the internet, and the decision to provide an official source for its tunes (and the ability to extend them - an offering that is a YouTube favourite) is an interesting step. 
</p>
<p>
So far, Nintendo Music hosts music from: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Nintendo Switch</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Splatoon 3</li>
<li>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</li>
<li>Kirby Star Allies</li>

<li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</li>

            <p>The creative director of Insomniac's upcoming Wolverine game has moved across to Xbox, and joined the team working on the Perfect Dark reboot.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wolverine-perfect-dark-brian-horton-playstation-xbox">Game File</a>, Brian Horton hasn't been part of the PlayStation Marvel project since the summer. Horton was announced to be serving as Wolverine's creative director back in 2021.</p>
<p>The game will now be led by Marcus Smith, who has taken on the role of creative director in Horton's stead. Mike Daly is Wolverine's game director, while the game's previously announced game director Camerson Christain will remain with Insomniac, but will serve in a different role. Smith and Daly previously worked together on Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, as creative director and game director.</p>

<p>According to sources close to the matter, the recent changes on the Wolverine development team are "the result of creative decisions around the game".</p>
<p>Following his departure from Playstation, Horton has now moved to Xbox, where he has joined the Perfect Dark reboot team as creative director. Horton will be "bringing his wealth of experience to the upcoming reboot of the classic secret agent series," an Xbox representative said.</p><p>We finally got a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/at-long-last-the-perfect-dark-reboot-gets-a-first-gameplay-trailer">gameplay for the Perfect Dark reboot back in June</a> during an Xbox showcase, four years after the game's initial announcement. The reboot is being co-developed by Microsoft's The Initiative and Embracer-owned Crystal Dynamics (where Horton once worked on Tomb Raider). In May, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-perfect-dark-reboot-reportedly-in-a-very-rough-state-and-a-big-protracted-mess">described as still being in a "very rough state"</a>.</p>
<p>There's still no release window for the Perfect Dark reboot yet but it'll be a day one Game Pass title when it arrives.</p>
<p>As for Wolverine, it was first announced in several years ago, but little official has been heard about the project since. </p><p>In 2023, Insomniac was subject to a cyber attack, following which people were playing - and uploading footage - of an<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/people-are-posting-footage-of-marvels-wolverine-from-stolen-early-version"> incomplete early development build of the game</a>, found within the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-investigating-insomniac-hack-which-reportedly-leaked-wolverine-files-and-employees-personal-data">files stolen from the developer by ransomware hackers</a>. Insomniac issued a statement following this incident stating: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-developer-issues-statement-addressing-hack">Like Logan... Insomniac is resilient</a>."</p>
