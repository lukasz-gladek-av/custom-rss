            <p>I'd be lying if I said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/007-first-light">007: First Light</a> doesn't look (and sound) like one the coolest triple-A games coming out this year. With its post-delay <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/merry-christmas-james-bond-game-007-first-light-has-been-delayed">27th May release date</a> not far away now, marketing and developer chatter are ramping up, and now we've learned about the explicit influences that were added to all the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman">Hitman</a> DNA we've able to discern in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>'s latest.</p>
<p>On 23th February, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-aims-to-channel-batman-arkham-freeflow-combat-with-uncharted-spectacle/1100-6538356/">GameSpot</a> shared juicy bits from <a href="https://gameinformer.com/007firstlight">Game Informer</a>'s recent interview with gameplay director Andreas Krogh, who admits the team looked at triple-A games "on the same scale" for inspiration. After all, even with a reboot, there's set of expectations around what a James Bond game should be, and IO's own style shouldn't get in the way of that if you ask me.</p>
<p>We already know many stealth and immersive sim elements from the recent Hitman trilogy, as well as spectacular and layered level design, have made their way into 007: First Light, but it's good to know IO looked at modern action-adventure classics for the more explosive sequences: "I think you see the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-games-order">Arkham games</a>, you see those games in it. You also see some modern takes on destructibility in the environment that are not necessarily from the Arkham games, but newer takes like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/uncharted">Uncharted</a>. We have a deeper system than that because we want to do more of it, and from shooting, you see references that are also from modern games," Krogh explained.</p>
<p>In any case, while some gameplay scenes will railroad players into big set pieces that would make renowned Hollywood action directors smile, the studio hasn't sacrificed the freedom of "choice" it's known for in most scenarios: "We want to set the player up to choose for himself. What kind of player are you? What kind of playstyle do you prefer? Play that way."</p><p>It won't be long before we check for ourselves if everything has come together beautifully, but with a mix of old and new, plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-trailer-unveils-lenny-kravitzs-villainous-side">Lenny Kravitz on board as the villain</a>, it seems like IO's take on the property won't be retreading much old ground.</p>

            <p>Xbox's new leadership double-act Asha Sharma (CEO Microsoft Gaming) and Matt Booty (chief content officer Xbox) have stressed the importance of new Xbox gaming hardware to their vision going forward.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-talking-to-new-xbox-ceo-asha-sharma-and-cco-matt-booty">Windows Central</a>, Sharma said: "I am committed to 'returning to Xbox', and that starts with console, that starts with hardware. You will hear more about that soon - we'll have some announcements coming up. You will see us collectively investing here.</p>
<p>"We also know that there are a lot of players who aren't on console or our hardware, and I want to deliver great games to them too. I need to learn more about what that can look like, what decisions were made, what we need to do going forward, and I want a little bit of time and space to do that."</p>
<p>Matt Booty added: "Our studio system is fully built around being first-party. We're not built to just be a publisher. It is core to our partnership with the Microsoft platform, being involved in early hardware decisions - all the work we've done to get games like Gears of War running great on new devices like the Xbox Ally, and so on. It is embedded within our structure, we're not backing away from that. We're committed to being a first-party games publisher in partnership with our first-party platform team."</p><p>Their comments come after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/future-of-xbox-vague-contradictory-phil-spencer-sarah-bond-asha-sharma-matt-booty">a wave of change unsettled the Xbox business and brand at the weekend</a>, with long-time Xbox figurehead <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> retiring from Microsoft after nearly 40 years, and Sarah Bond, the former president of Xbox - presumed to be Spencer's replacement-in-waiting - suddenly departing as well.</p>
<blockquote><em>"This team has brought it back before, and I'm here to help us do it again" - Asha Sharma</em></blockquote>
<p>Into the leadership void stepped Asha Sharma, a relative unknown to the gaming community, brought over from Microsoft's CoreAI division, and someone who boasts no gaming experience or apparent gaming passion of her own. Matt Booty is a much more known quantity, having led <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> since 2018, and Microsoft's first-party gaming output since 2023.</p>
<p>The suspicion surrounding Sharma's appointment is Microsoft is sunsetting Xbox and reorganising the company around AI - something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-likening-new-xbox-heads-job-to-a-palliative-care-doctor-original-co-creator-doesnt-actually-think-xbox-is-dead">Seamus Blackley, the original co-creator of Xbox, was very vocal about</a>. But there are contrasting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-insider-report-paints-different-picture-of-spencer-retirement-and-bond-departure">reports that claim Microsoft genuinely wants to reset the Xbox business</a> and turn it around. This "return of Xbox" is something Sharma talked about in her opening memo to staff, and it's something she elaborated on in the Windows Central interview.</p><p>Sharma said: "For me, the spirit of 'return to Xbox' is about returning to the spirit that the team was founded on. It's that spirit of surprise, it's the spirit of building something nobody else was willing to try - I've heard 'renegade', 'rebellion', and 'fun' used. That's what I was thinking about when I wrote that."</p>
<p>Reports have suggested that Sarah Bond was ousted because of the 'Xbox Anywhere' initiative, largely attributed to her, which hasn't really worked out. Regardless, it's an initiative Sharma will inherit, alongside things such as Game Pass and publishing on PlayStation that have become increasingly central to the Xbox division's core. What will Sharma do with them?</p>
<p>"Right now, I need to learn, candidly, about the 'why' of these decisions, what we were optimising for and what the data says about the Xbox strategy today. That's the honest answer," she said. "I'm looking at lifetime value, not just what happened in a previous moment, or in short term efficiencies and things like that. The plan's the plan until it's not the plan."</p>
<p>Sharma also underlined <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-new-head-of-gaming-has-no-tolerance-for-bad-ai-following-concerns-about-the-proliferation-of-ai-slop-and-sharmas-tech-background">her previously stated gen-AI stance</a> by restating that there are opportunities there but she won't allow this to devolve into okaying "slop". "I will not flood our ecosystem with slop," she said. "We won't have careless output, we won't have derivative work. I deeply believe in the words that I shared previously there."</p><p>Matt Booty had an additional remark to make on this, stating: "We've got no pressure from Microsoft, there are no directives on AI coming down. Our teams are free to use any technologies that might be beneficial, whether it's helping write code or check for bugs - things more in the production pipeline. At the end of the day as Asha said, we're committed to art made by people. Technology is only in support of that."</p>
<p>In closing, Sharma said she would try to "honour and uphold" the culture that Xbox Phil Spencer instilled - "a remarkable human and a remarkable leader" - when he took over Xbox in 2014. "We know that the business has gone through some challenges," she said. "I'm going to use my expertise and the leaders that have the deep gaming depth around the table to help us grow the business, and make sure that we have an incredible next 25 years.</p>
<p>"I will listen, I will learn, I will communicate what we're seeing, and what we're doing. I think from here, the work is proof over promise. Matt and I are in it, every hour of every day of every night; I am fully in this thing. This team has brought it back before, and I'm here to help us do it again."</p>

            <p>Ubisoft is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-a-lot-of-new-far-cry-and-assassins-creed-games-are-in-development">all in on Assassin's Creed and Far Cry</a> (among other lucky IPs) following all the recent layoffs, studio closures, and project cancellations, yet <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/with-ubisofts-dire-finances-widespread-cancellations-and-a-disastrous-launch-working-against-it-famously-aaaa-game-skull-and-bones-celebrates-year-2-with-a-big-ol-kraken/">Skull and Bones somehow continues to sail onward</a> against all odds. Its launch was a bit disastrous though, and one key creative behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-iii">Assassin's Creed 3</a> had something to say about that project and why it struggled so much.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/assassins-creed/the-director-of-the-first-assassins-creed-with-naval-battles-found-it-bizarre-to-watch-skull-and-bones-agonisingly-long-development-because-it-was-essentially-the-same-stuff-re-shipping-14-years-after-we-made-it/">PC Gamer had a chance to talk to AC3 and Far Cry 4 creative director Alex Hutchinson</a>, who's worked on the two <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review">Savage Planet</a> games since leaving Ubisoft. From the get-go, Hutchinson commented it was "bizarre" to see "essentially the same stuff re-shipping 14 years" after he and his team cracked the systems for the third Assassin's Creed. The full pirate experience wouldn't become a thing until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-review">Black Flag</a>, as Ubisoft <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/assassins-creed/assassins-creed-3s-greatest-feature-was-pushed-to-the-side-until-black-flag-because-ubisoft-was-worried-that-the-tech-wouldnt-work/">reportedly wasn't confident in the feature's chances</a> during AC3's development.</p>
<p>The rest is history, but even as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a> enters another year of post-launch support, many are still wondering how and why the base game's development was so difficult. In the director's mind, it was a mix of its core ideas feeling "stale" and the main development team not having the necessary experience to finish such a daunting project without major hiccups.</p>
<p>"Ideas have a window... They age out and become stale," he explained before adding a "junior" team trying to "make Black Flag crossed with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-tanks">World of Tanks</a> or World of Warships" was a recipe for disaster. "And then they didn't really have experience in making even an Assassin's Creed game down there, because they really did co-development. And then I think it just got away from them," he added.</p><p>As pointed out in the original piece by PC Gamer's Fraser Brown and Jeremy Peel, Ubisoft Singapore was founded in 2008 and mostly acted as a support studio before its headcount "ballooned to more than 300 employees." Even Hutchinson admitted many Ubisoft devs just moved to Singapore for the fun vibes: "For a lot of the French or Canadian developers, they would go down to Singapore for a year's holiday... I don't think they were serious."</p>

            <p>Seamus Blackley, one of the co-creators of the original Xbox, has assured the community he doesn't actually think Xbox is "dead", despite just yesterday likening the recent appointment of Asha Sharma to "a palliative care doctor who slides Xbox gently into the night".</p>
<p>Following his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/seamus-blackley-microsoft-reshuffle-all-about-ai">comments earlier this week about the recent leadership shakeup at Microsoft</a>, Blackley revealed he has been asked 59 times whether or not he truly believes Xbox is dead. "No," he has now stated.</p>

<p>"I love Xbox as my own flesh and blood," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/seamus.bsky.social">Blackley wrote on his social media feed</a>. "It's the most wonderful thing to me," he said, before adding: "The distress it's in kills me, haunts me." However, the Xbox co-creator said "progress requires introspection and realism" remarking that "learning is pain".</p>
<p>In an exchange with another Bluesky user, Blackley stated Xbox is "literally something I nearly died to bring into existence," so of course "seeing it struggle and being unable to act is hard". He added he loves Xbox "more than literally anyone" else.</p>
<p>"This is killing me," he wrote, "but I know a lot about organisations and business now, and I was being honest, not a PR asshole." Blackley also called Xbox "family", complete with a little green heart.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/article-45824">Blackley left Microsoft back in 2002</a>, to pursue other opportunities.</p>

<p>As for the here and now at Microsoft, Sharma was announced to be taking over from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> following news that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/today-marks-an-exciting-new-chapter-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-retiring-amid-major-leadership-shakeup-that-sees-microsofts-coreai-president-taking-over-roll">Xbox head would be retiring after nearly 40 years with the company</a>. Sarah Bond, who many had presumed would eventually succeed Spencer, also announced she would be leaving Xbox at this same time.</p>

            <p>Slowly but steadily, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is building up an impressive library of third-party ports, and Bethesda has been aggressively (and unsurprisingly) pushing to get as many of its heavy hitters on the platform since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a>'s arrival last December. Now, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> has arrived to great fanfare and is surprisingly great on the hybrid console.</p>
<p>Of course, we always wanted the FO4 Switch 2 port to turn out good, but our expectations were lowered after Skyrim's frankly disastrous launch on the system (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skyrim-switch-2-port-gets-proper-performance-and-quality-modes">which has since been fixed and greatly improved</a>). Would it mirror that mess or the Skyrim port's latest iteration? The answer is surprising: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a> currently offers an even better experience than Skyrim across both docked and portable play.</p>
<p>The shocker comes in the form of three different graphical modes available from the get-go versus Skyrim's two: Quality, Balanced, and Performance. In-game, however, they're named as 30, 40, and 60 FPS targets respectively, but that's what they are. The presence of the 40 FPS mode instantly confirms Fallout 4 is making good use of the Switch 2's 120 Hz screen and VRR capabilities, but it seems the 30 and 60 FPS modes also run on portable mode without lowering the refresh rate, with helps with responsiveness across the board. Even better, I've yet to notice any instances of screen tearing. Another pleasant surprise is TVs with 120 Hz capabilities can access the 40 FPS mode too.</p>
<p>In-depth testing by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdPfzW17WPM">ElAnalistaDeBits</a> has also revealed that, in docked mode, the game targets 1440p at 30 FPS, 1080p at 40 FPS with a nearly identical graphical setup, and dynamic 1080p (often below the target) with lowered graphical settings at 60 FPS. On portable mode, 1080p is the target in all modes, but the image can get quite blurry in Performance (60 FPS) mode. Check out my own screenshots near Sanctuary below:</p>



<p>The 30 FPS mode is the clear winner here when it comes to image clarity and settings, with texture resolution and filtering also seeing a significant boost vs. the other modes. Of course, you'll have to put up with less responsive controls and sluggish camera movement that just doesn't feel good enough anymore if you ask me.</p><p>The 40 FPS mode looks noticeably softer, but still provides a clean image result even when playing in portable mode in my experience. The extra 10 frames per second greatly help with the game feel, and with the console's 120 Hz screen, it lands very close to the experience of running it at 60 FPS.</p>
<p>Finally, at 60 FPS, you're getting frankly good results in interiors and areas that aren't overly busy, but the console has a harder time hitting the target in most exterior areas and crowded enemy encounters. This isn't such a big deal when running the game in portable mode due to VRR's help, but the image simply becomes too soft and blurry, especially when looking at distant details. Even my girlfriend, who typically doesn't pay much attention to graphics and was playing FO4 for the first time last night, complained about it looking "bad." Perhaps the shocker here is the actual graphical settings didn't seem as paired back as in Skyrim when going for 60 FPS.</p>

<p>As for stability, I'm happy to report it hasn't crashed on me a single time yet, something I couldn't say about the recent re-releases of the game on other platforms. Load times are virtually identical to recent iterations of the game on consoles, too. The missed opportunity here might be the lack of gyro or mouse controls, which makes Skyrim a more complete port at the time of writing. Hopefully, patches will add in those platform-specific control options as the fifth Elder Scrolls gets a 40 FPS Balance mode in exchange for them.</p><p>Overall, I'm quite impressed with this Fallout 4 port at launch, especially considering the current-gen refreshes and last year's Anniversary Edition launch were a bit of a technical nightmare. Moreover, lessons were learned following Skyrim's disappointing launch and recent improvements. Though the teams and tech involved are different, I'm now quite excited for how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-everything-announced">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Oblivion Remastered</a> could be translated to Switch 2 later this year.</p>
