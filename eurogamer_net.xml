            <p>McDonald's is offering its customers the chance to purchase a £8.19 Minecraft Movie Meal as part of its promotion for the upcoming film, complete with "amazing collectibles" crafted for adults.</p>
<p>Those interested in sampling McDonald's upcoming movie meal - which will be available from Wednesday, 26th March - can choose from a Big Mac, nine Chicken McNuggets, or four Veggie Dippers. Then, to obviously make this into a meal, there will be a side and drink of choice. Now, this all sounds like a pretty average McDonald's meal, but it will be Minecraftified thanks to some free blocky McDonald's characters with each purchase.</p>
<p>One of six collectibles will be available with McDonald's A Minecraft Movie Meal, and they are: Grimace Egg, Zombie Hamburglar, Birdie Wings, Fry Helmet, Soda Potion and Big Mac Crystal. It's your call if this is worth £8.</p>

<p>Other Minecraft-themed offerings coming to the menu include the limited edition Nether Flame Sauce, which is a combination of crushed red pepper and flaming cayenne, "balanced" with hints of garlic and sweetness.</p>
<p>There's also an Apple Cake McFlurry, which the company is sure will "excite A Minecraft Movie and McDonald's fans across the UK" thanks to its apple and shortcake pieces topped with a sour apple sauce. The Apple Cake McFlurry will sell for £2.19, but there is also a mini version for £1.69.</p>
<p>"McDonald's is exploring a brand-new world with the A Minecraft Movie collaboration. We're always looking for fun and exciting ways to bring excitement to our menu and the A Minecraft Movie Meal is a perfect way to bring two icons together," said Senior Vice President Chief Marketing Officer at McDonald's UK and Ireland Ben Fox.</p>
<p>"This partnership has allowed us to bring amazing collectibles, crafted for adults, to the UK for the first-time ever! We can't wait for fans to meet their favourite McDonaldsland characters in blockified form, and to experience the new products which have been inspired by the A Minecraft Movie universe - Nether Sauce and Apple Cake McFlurry."</p>

<p>Today, I learned that Black wasn't always going to play Steve, though.

            <p>
Final Fantasy publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has launched legal action against a developer it had partnered with to make a new Front Mission game.
</p>
<p>
Front Mission, the company's classic mecha battle franchise, was set to be revived by BlackJack Studio via a new game titled Front Mission 2089: Borderscape. 
</p>
<p>
After two years of development, Square Enix cancelled the project in October 2024, and walked away from BlackJack Studio for reasons unknown. Shortly after, BlackJack Studio announced its own "Front Mission-style game", known as Mecharashi.

<p>
Square Enix's <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/841035863/Square-Enix-suing-to-stop-this-Front-Mission-style-mecha-game-from-being-released-in-the-US">lawsuit</a> (uncovered by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/542570/square-enix-front-mission-mecharashi-lawsuit">Polygon</a>) claims Mecharashi uses the work BlackJack Studio undertook for its own project. Indeed, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3446920/Mecharashi/">Mecharashi's own Steam page</a> describes the game thus: 
</p>
<p>
"Mecharashi is a mecha-themed tactical turn-based game. The game adopts a Front Mission-style combat system, where you can assemble mechas however you want, equip a wide selection of weapons, and choose your favorite pilots to engage in battle."
</p>
<p>
Court documents filed by Square Enix include pages of screenshots comparing the unreleased Front Mission prototype made by BlackJack Studio and the developer's new project. The similarities are obvious. 
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>Front Mission 2089: Borderscape prototype images, compared with Mecharashi. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Square Enix</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Square Enix is seeking $150k (£115k) in compensation for copyright infringement, and an immediate removal of the game's listing from storefronts.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Mecharashi has already disappeared and reappeared from Steam as Square Enix and BlackJack Studio squabble over a DMCA notice.

  </p>

    

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
The Communications Workers of America (CWA) is launching an industry-wide union of video game workers in North America and Canada, which it says will help "build worker power irrespective of studio and current job status".
</p>
<p>
The CWA has been at the centre of many of the successful US games industry unionisation efforts over the last few years, with 2024 seeing announcements of unions at the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/200-workers-at-bethesda-game-studio-have-unionised">Bethesda Game Studios</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-world-of-warcraft-team-forms-500-stong-union">Blizzard</a>. Its <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/membership">newly unveiled United Videogame Workers</a> (UVW-CWA) operates a little differently to a traditional certified union, however, serving as a direct-join industry-wide organisation - said to be the first of its kind for the games industry in the US.
</p>
<p>
The nature of the UVW-CWA means any freelance or full-time video game industry worker - artists, writers, designers, QA testers, programmers, and <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/faq">beyond</a> - can join if they're based in the US or Canada, with dues calculated on a sliding scale. And it's also open to industry musicians, having been launched in partnership with the American Federation of Musicians (AFM). This, the CWA says, will help "build power across the industry without the obstacles and delays that employers can impose during the traditional union certification process".
</p>
<p>
"Our mission is to take back our lives, our labour, and our passion from those who treat us like replaceable cogs," the <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/mission-statement">UVW-CWA writes</a>. "To empower our fellow workers; to link up arms with the laid off, with the freelancer, with the disillusioned contractor, with the disenfranchised and the marginalized, with the workers labouring invisibly to keep this industry afloat. Our goal is to create a union... to fight the whims of CEOs and private equity vultures."
</p>
<p>
"We are going to draft a video game worker bill of rights," the UVW-CWA explains elsewhere, "setting standards that have been glaringly absent from our craft for too long. It will address inequality in hiring, the pervasive reliance on crunch, healthcare for contractors, and protections against all manner of injustice. Armed with this bill, new organisers can activate with clarity of goal and action, cultivated by the shared knowledge of not only fellow game developers, but workers in the entire labour movement."
</p>
<p>
In an <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/faq">accompanying FAQ</a>, the UVW-CWA continues, "Not only do we build community and solidarity amongst video game workers, we also strive to build large-scale education campaigns about labour organising in the video game industry, provide legal support and layoff support funds for disenfranchised workers, write template contract standards, build professional development and mentorship programmes within our community, and so much more." The first of the UVW-CWA's campaigns will focus on layoffs, and a petition is being shared at this week's GDC in the hope of gaining "widespread support".
</p>
<p>
The CWA's announcement comes amid a devastating few years for the games industry, marked by extensive layoffs and studio closures. Over 25000 employees are believed to have lost their jobs since the start of 2023 - and according to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gdcs-state-of-the-games-industry-survey-says-one-in-ten-respondents-laid-off-in-2024">GDC's most recent State of the Games Industry survey</a> from earlier this year, one in 10 respondents reported being laid off in 2024.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> has been an enormous success - like, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-fourth-expansion-releases-really-really-soon">a 100m downloads enormous success</a> - so inevitably, there are now other, similar franchises that would like a piece of that action.
</p>
<p>
What other franchise like Pokémon are we talking about? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-had-to-scale-back-a-little-bit-and-hire-security-guards-palworld-developer-reveals-nintendo-lawsuit-reaction">No, not Palworld</a>. (Don't make things worse for yourselves, PocketPair.) We mean, Digimon, of course. 
</p>
<p>
So, here's Digimon Alysion - an upcoming free-to-play online card battler with a slightly odd name that publisher Bandai Namco likely hopes will get just a sniff of Pokémon's success.

<figcaption>Digimon Alysion debut trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaoHerGig5w" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Footage of the game shows battles against an opponent where each player has a selection of Digimon, represented by cards, on the field. This is intercut with CGI sequences showing characters gesticulating, Pokémon Trainer-like, at the cards. It's unclear if this is actual gameplay. 
</p>
<p>
From my limited knowledge of Digimon, which is basically watching the anime 15 years ago, I recognised several creatures featured in that original generation of Digimon monsters. Nostalgia!
</p>
<p>
The trailer concludes with the message: "Project Start!" suggesting it still may be some time before Digimon Alysion actually arrives. When it does, its set to pop up on both the iPhone App Store and Google Play for Android.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-overhauls-trading-following-player-backlash">Pokémon TCG Pocket announced an overhaul of its much-criticised trading feature</a> following fan backlash - though the changes won't take effect for several months.

            <p><strong>UPDATE 11.45am UK: </strong> Thronefall developer Grizzly Games has responded to the use of its name and logo by the company behind Flight Simulator 2025 - the Microsoft Flight Sim rip-off that uses AI art which Eurogamer spotted via a PlayStation Store listing earlier today.</p>
<p>"Thanks for contacting us and thank you for bringing awareness to this topic," Thronefall developer Paul Schnepf Games said in an email to Eurogamer. "We're not associated with Grizzly Games Ltd. and they're using both our name and logo illegally. 
</p>
<p>"Furthermore they seem to incorporate the absolute opposite of our values, of what we stand for and what we’re trying to give to the gaming community. Unfortunately our legal resources are limited as a two-person indie team, but honestly I'd love to see this kind of stuff being stopped, especially since it's not only happening to us but lots of indie devs that just lack the legal power."</p>
<p>We'll update again if we hear from Sony - or the other Grizzly Games.</p>
<divider></divider>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY 11am UK:</strong> 
Flight Simulator 2025 is now available to Wishlist on the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10014255">PlayStation Store</a> - but it's nothing to do with Microsoft. 
</p>
<p>
Trophies for the game caught the eye of Flight Sim fans overnight via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jfkg5q/trophies_live_for_flight_simulator_ps5_that_hasnt/">reddit</a>, though it quickly became clear this wasn't a leak of the actual Flight Sim landing on Sony's console. 
</p>
<p>
Instead, Flight Simulator 2025 features what looks like AI-generated art for its cover image, and has been made by a developer named Grizzy Games Limited.
</p>
<p>
A quick search online brings up the <a href="https://www.grizzly-games.com/#games">Grizzly-Games.com website, which features a long list of supposed mobile projects </a> that also feature clearly AI-generated artwork for their title covers. 
</p>
<p>
These mobile games - Idle Command: Supply Frontline, Merge Blocks Magic Numbers, Color Page ASMR: Drawing Art, etc - all have links to download the apps via the Google Play store, but all of these links are broken. It's unclear if these games ever existed.
</p>
<p>
The single game with actual gameplay visible is City Outlet: Store Empire, which looks to be a tycoon game based in a corner of a shopping mall. You can see a trailer of it below:

<p>
If the name Grizzly Games sounds familiar, then it's because this developer shares its name with the developer of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thronefall-kingdom-building-hack-and-slash-and-the-spirit-of-lumines">popular indie action title Thronefall</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Indeed, the team behind City Outlet: Store Empire and Flight Simulator PS5 is also using the same Grizzly Games logo of the Thronefall team.
</p>
<p>
We've contacted both Grizzly Games for more. We've also contacted Sony, which looks set to imminently launch Flight Simulator 2025 on PlayStation.
</p>
<p>This isn't the first time that a knock-off game has been discovered on the PlayStation Store. What <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-looks-like-a-suika-game-rip-off-set-to-launch-on-playstation">looked like a Suika Game rip-off was set to launch on PlayStation previously</a>. Meanwhile, in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-rubbish-god-of-war-rip-off-on-the-xbox-store">we discovered a rubbish God of War rip-off on the Xbox store</a>. And in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-knock-off-removed-from-nintendo-eshop-as-sony-stakes-copyright-claim">Sony launched a copyright claim against a rip-off of The Last of Us on the Nintendo eShop</a>.</p>
<p>
For now, perhaps hold off a pre-order of Flight Simulator 2025. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-xbox-exclusive-games-heading-to-ps5-and-switch-according-to-phil-spencer">real Microsoft Flight Simulator seems likely to actually turn up on PS5 at some point</a>.

            <p>Jack Black is set to play Steve in A Minecraft Movie, but that wasn't always going to be the case. Originally, Black was actually going to play a talking pig. No porky pies here - really, a talking pig.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/a-minecraft-movie-game-microsoft-1236341672/">Variety</a>, Mojang senior director of original content Torfi Frans Ólafsson revealed Black's switch to become Steve happened "very, very, very late" in the game. Ólafsson stated the team "needed an expert and host" in the film, and so Black went from being envisioned as a talking pig to becoming Steve.</p>

<p>Now, if you saw the trailers with Jack Black as Steve, and said to yourself (or even out loud), 'hang on, that isn't Steve! That's just Jack Black in a blue shirt!'. Well, you weren't alone, and the A Minecraft Movie team is aware of those reactions.</p>
<p>"This is not my Steve or your Steve - this is Jack Black's Steve," Ólafsson said of the part. "A lot of fans responded when they saw the first teasers and trailers, like, 'Hey, wait a minute -- this is just Jack Black. This isn't Jack Black being someone else.' And maybe it is, because this is literally him interpreting this character and what it means to him."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ólafsson got the cast and crew Xboxes for the trailers while on set, and booted up private Minecraft servers. The Mojang exec said Black logged over 100 hours on the blocky game, and became "the most passionate player" on set.</p>
<p>"He was just completely manic, hoarding stuff in the mines, searching for lapis lazuli because he liked the way it sounds," Ólafsson told the publication. "He kept saying it: 'Can I talk about lapis lazuli in the movie?'"</p>
<p>So, I guess listen out for mentions of Minecraft's blue mineral when the film releases next month.</p>
<p>To tie in with the upcoming film, the Minecraft team has also made that leaked movie pack for the game official. The  'A Minecraft Movie' in-game Hero Pack will be available from today, 20th March.</p>

<p>The Minecraft Movie is set to release on 4th April. Along with Black's Steve, the film also stars Jason Momoa as Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison.</p>
<p>Away from the big screen, an animated Minecraft series was also announced for Netflix back in May. Netflix will produce the project alongside Minecraft developer Mojang Studios, while WildBrain Studios - the studio behind Sonic Prime - will handle the development.</p>
<p>While further details are thin on the ground, it is said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-animated-series-announced-for-netflix">upcoming show will "feature an original story with new characters</a>, showing the world of 'Minecraft' in a new light".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
