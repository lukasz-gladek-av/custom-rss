            <p>Futuristic racer Fast Fusion will receive an update later this week, adding new tracks and a new rendering mode without upscaling.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-fast-fusion-most-technically-impressive-switch-2-launch-title">Digital Foundry reported</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> launch game actually renders at a low image resolution but uses the console's DLSS equivalent to upscale the image. Put simply, the game has been criticised for poor image quality, despite being such a fast game.</p>
<p>Now, developer Shin'en Games is introducing a new render mode called "Pure" that removes upscaling and instead renders at a native 1440p when docked (and 1080p in handheld).</p>

<p>What's more, a new Carbium Cup will be added, including three new tracks: Alpine Trust, Sunahara Plains, Zenshoh Habitat.</p>
<p>Players of previous game Fast RMX may recognise these tracks, though they have all-new graphics and changed layouts to make use of Fast Fusion's Hyperjump feature.</p>
<p>Further additions include: a new particle effect for snow, two new jukebox entries, a lower price to unlock the third cup for easier progression, fixed an issue where the game shut down when changing render mode, while stability and performance improvements have been implemented.</p>
<p>The update will arrive on 26th June.</p>

<p>Fast Fusion is one of the few brand-new launch games for Nintendo's new console. It's the follow up to Switch game Fast RMX, itself an improved version of Fast Racing Neo on Wii U.</p>
<p>Anyone who's a fan of the F-Zero or WipEout series will find much to enjoy here, with the game's high speed thrills, rollercoaster tracks, and techno soundtrack. Indeed, it's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/f-zero-gx-on-switch-2-is-virtually-unplayable-without-remapping-the-controls">modern day rival to F-Zero GX</a> - one of three GameCube games available on Switch 2 through Nintendo Switch Online.</p>
<p>"The Switch 2's best launch exclusive might not be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, but another racing game," wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-best-launch-exclusive-mario-kart-world-fast-fusion">Eurogamer's Tom Orry on Fast Fusion</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-launch-game-fast-fusion-gets-update-to-improve-image-quality]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Popular gaming peripheral manufacturer Dbrand has acknowledged a defect affecting a small number of its Project Killswitch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2?page=2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> cases.</p>
<p>This defect impacts the lip attaching the joycons to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> screen, disconnecting when the console is held up by a singular joycon. Speaking to influencer Nintendo Prime, the company has stated it's in the process of fixing the issue.</p>
<p>"Yep, we're definitely working on it. Ultimately, this is a manufacturing tolerance issue on the small lip keeping the Joy-Con Grips attached to the Joy-Cons (some were a hair too thick)," Dbrand told Nintendo Prime. "We've got a replacement program set up already, where anyone who is affected is able to email robots@dbrand.com with 'July Joy-Cons' in the subject to be added to the list for replacement stock in July."</p>

<p>According to Nintendo Prime, Dbrand also acknowledged this problem was replicable among a "small number of units from their run". Nintendo Prime didn't share the exact number he was told, but reemphasised any defective Killswitch cases could be replaced for free in July.</p>
<p>There are plenty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-accessories-deals-third-party-jsaux">great third-party accessories for the Nintendo Switch 2</a> - Dbrand's Killswitch included! These enhance the play experience on what is already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">a pretty rad console</a>. The only real negative being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-much-as-it-pains-me-to-say-it-the-switch-2s-short-battery-life-is-a-real-bummer">the battery life, which can drain fairly quickly</a>.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 has proven so tempting, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/california-man-steals-10k-of-nintendo-switch-games-from-libraries-now-faces-more-than-a-large-late-fee">one bloke pilfered over $10,000 worth of Switch games from libraries</a>, one can only assume because he was <em>so</em> excited to play them all on more powerful hardware. It's not like third-party publishers couldn't do with the help, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-third-party-sales-reportedly-very-low-despite-record-breaking-console-launch">as their games struggle to ship in spite of record breaking console sales</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/popular-third-party-switch-2-case-suffers-manufacturing-defect-in-small-number-of-orders-producer-promises-its-working-on-it]]></content:encoded>
