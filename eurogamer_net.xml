            <p>
Velan Studios, the team behind the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/knockout-city-to-shutdown-in-june-private-server-version-incoming">sadly ill-fated Knockout City</a>, has announced its PlayStation-published pitch-black FPS Midnight Murder Club is launching into PC and PS5 early access on 13th March. And as an added incentive to make a purchase, up to five friends can play for free.
</p>
<p>
Midnight Murder Club sets players loose in the pitch-black interior of Wormwood Manor - arming them with a revolver and flashlight, and then challenging them to be the last person standing. "You sprint toward your friends' shouting voices echoing through the mansion, only to bump into someone else hiding in a dark corner!", Velan enthuses in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/27/midnight-murder-club-early-access-dated-wildcards-mode-and-guest-pass-detailed/">bout of scene-setting on the PlayStation Blog</a>. "Shots ring out, luring the other hunters to your location. Every flash of light is the promise of a deadly firefight."
</p>
<p>
Midnight Murder Club's choatic action comes in five distinct flavours. There's a Free for All mode, as well as Thief in the Night, Team Deathmatch, Headhunters, and the newly announced Wildcards mode. This last one lets everyone play cards in their collection to twist the rules of a match - perhaps giving participants super speed or causing them to explode in a fiery ball on death - with new cards unlocking once the match is over.

<p>
Perhaps the most notable aspect of today's announcement, however, is the news purchasers can invite their friends to play along at no extra cost. Friends will first need to download the free Midnight Murder Club Guest Pass Edition, and after that, purchasers can invite up to five of them to play public or private matches, in all current game modes, as much as they want.
</p>
<p>
Midnight Murder Club launches into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2698870/Midnight_Murder_Club/">Steam</a> and PlayStation 5 early access on 13th March, and will cost $19.99 USD for the full game.

            <p>
PUBG creator Brendan Greene's "ambitious" three-game project will soon get underway with the launch of Prologue: Go Wayback! in "Q2" this year. And in the run up to the survival game's release, Greene's studio PlayerUnknown Productions has shared a first trailer.
</p>
<p>
For some backstory, Greene <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-creator-announces-three-game-plan-one-of-which-has-a-demo-that-you-can-play-today">unveiled his studio's three-game plan last December</a>, explaining that each project would build on the last, culminating in something called Project Artemis. That started with last year's early access release of Preface: Undiscovered World - not one of Greene's three planned games, but rather an "immersive tech demo" giving players the opportunity to explore an Earth-scale world generated by machine learning agents in real-time.
</p>
<p>
With that project now out in the wild, things are about to step up a notch with the release of Prologue: Go Wayback!. This builds on last year's tech demo by introducing more traditional survival game elements into a wilderness generated by machine learning - enabling "millions" of maps and delivering what's being described as a self-contained "single-player open-world emergent game within the survival genre".

<p>
Go Wayback! promises a world where "emergent systems subtly influence gameplay", with players needing to brave unpredictable weather and ever-changing landscapes as they attempt to reach the Weather Station and call for help to escape the wilderness. To that end, they'll begin with an old, weathered map and essential tools, utilising resources, foraging for food, making repairs, and building shelters to improve their chances of survival.
</p>
<p>
"No one will tell you where to go or how to survive," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/">explains the blurb on Steam</a>. "There are no hand-holding mechanics, no fixed paths, and no guarantees. It's a world where preparation is key, and improvisation is often the difference between life and death." That's about all the information shared so far, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KI6H_WNHUlU">Prologue: Go Wayback!'s first trailer</a>, which you can see above, gives an approximate idea of how it'll all unfold as players explore vast expanses of autumnal forests, crystalline lakes, and looming mountains in snow, ice, and driving rain.
</p>
<p>
Go Wayback! is the first of three standalone games that'll serve as "building blocks" for the studio's ultimate project, Artemis - "a massive multiplayer sandbox experience that leverages the technological advancements tested" across earlier games. "After Prologue, two more games are planned for release in the coming years," Greene explained previously, "each addressing critical technical challenges that will bring the studio closer to the final product."

            <p>
Some 35 years after experiencing an overwhelming sense of mild disappointment thanks to Ocean Software's Terminator 2: Judgment Day on the ZX Spectrum 128K, I get to tell you a new video game adaptation of James Cameron's movie hit is coming this September. But despite the furious march of technology, this one's also going to be 2D.
</p>
<p>
Terminator 2D: No Fate is the work of developer Bitmap Bureau - the studio behind the likes of Xeno Crisis and 88 Heroes - and it's looking to deliver some good old-fashioned arcade-style side-scrolling action inspired by "iconic scenes from Terminator 2" and "original scenarios".
</p>
<p>
Its obvious selling point is its rather strikingly animated pixel art, but - as per Terminator 2D's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkMFYMG3QLw">announcement trailer</a> - it's also got a bit where you get to wander around a bar as the T-800, smashing up baddies while unabashedly in the nude. As it happens though, the T-800 (nude or otherwise) is just one of several characters you can play as in Terminator 2D.
</p>

<p>
Bitmap Bureau say the T-800 has been designed to emphasise his weight and power, with moves including a devastating shoulder barge. And while he's slower than Terminator 2D's other playable characters - Sarah Conner and John Connor - he also has high durability. As for Sarah, she's agile and reactive, excelling at melee combat with a sliding attack. However, she can also deploy her laser sight, locking her in place but significantly boosting damage.
</p>

<p>
John Connor, meanwhile, will be playable as an adult during the game's Future War missions. He's not as agile as Sarah, but can evade attacks with a tactical roll, and also emphasises mid-to-long-range combat, with a plasma rifle, pipe bombs, and three ammo types. And, of course, the iconic T-1000 is back as the game's main adversary - liquid metal abilities included.
</p>
<p>
Terminator 2D: No Fate - which also includes multiple endings, leaving players to decide humanity's future - launches for PlayStation 5, Playstation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam and Epic) on 5th September.
