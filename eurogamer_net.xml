            <p>You may have noticed your Conquest matches in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> have been getting shorter recently. Well, you're not imagining things! As part of an intentional tweak by Battlefield Studios, the starting ticket counter has been significantly reduced across the board for the popular game mode.</p>
<p>For those unaware or in need of a reminder, Conquest is one of Battlefield's most popular modes that's been included in every game in the series. It tasks an attacking team with capturing objectives before time or their allocated number of tickets (revives) runs out.
</p>
<p>As for why, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1978462075488817479">an official statement posted on the Battlefield Comms X account</a> revealed a desire from the team to improve the pacing of the Conquest, as matches were hitting the time limit more than they'd like.</p>

<p>The post reads: "We've reduced the starting ticket count across all Conquest maps so matches finish at a more natural pace. Previously, many rounds were hitting the time limit instead of ending when one team ran out of tickets. We'll keep monitoring feedback and data to make sure the flow of each match feels right."</p><p>As a result of these changes, the standardised starting count of 1,000 tickets per team has been sliced down to a smaller figure, with each map getting its own tailored starting ticket count. For example, Siege of Cairo has been knocked down to 900 tickets, while Mirak Valley has been cut down to a stunning 700 tickets! This way, Conquest matches on these maps shouldn't drag as much as they did.</p>
<p>The response to this has been mixed however. While a portion of the community agrees this is a genuine problem, <a href="https://x.com/wiz_political/status/1978478913643802831">welcoming the change</a>, others have wondered <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1978476272327201258">why the time limit on Conquest matches wasn't increased or outright removed instead</a>. There's certainly a portion of the Battlefield playerbase keen for long big team battles, and lowering the ticket count could take away from their preferred game mode.</p>
<p>This is the latest in a series of quick fixes that have come to Battlefield 6 in the days following its full release. Adjustments to the movement system <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-issues-fix-for-jump-momentum-bug-and-is-monitoring-breakthrough-player-counts">killed a certain interaction between jumping momentum and your equipped weapon</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-issues-free-premium-battlefield-6-season-passes-to-ea-app-pre-orderers-frozen-out-of-the-game">free premium battle passes were handed out to EA App users due to launch issues</a>.</p>
<p>Incoming fixes are on the way too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/missing-shots-in-battlefield-6-well-you-might-not-be-bad-a-bug-might-be-throwing-your-shots-off">including a tweak to weapon bloom to improve aim during sustained fire</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-ladder-launching-one-of-the-games-funnest-bugs-will-soon-be-gone">the approaching death of "Ladder Launching"</a>. All in all, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-only-been-out-a-day-and-its-already-one-of-steams-biggest-games-ever">it looks as though a lot of alterations are coming to one of the biggest Steam launches of all time</a>.</p>

            <p>Quantic Dream is still developing Star Wars: Eclipse, it's assured in a new blog post, alongside development of a new competitive multiplayer game.</p>
<p>The Star Wars game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heavy-rain-developer-quantic-dream-reveals-star-wars-eclipse">first revealed in 2021</a>, but in the years since we've seen little of its development. In October 2023 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/quantic-dreams-star-wars-eclipse-development-is-simmering">development was said to be "simmering"</a>, while earlier this year Quantic Dream CEO Guillaume de Fondaumière <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-eclipse-developer-quantic-dream-gives-update-amidst-netease-cuts-and-closures">confirmed the studio was not impacted by cuts at NetEase</a> and development continued "at full pace".</p>
<p>Now the studio has shared a <a href="https://blog.quanticdream.com/writing-a-new-chapter/">new blog post</a> from studio founder David Cage entitled "Writing A New Chapter", in which he provides an update on forthcoming projects.</p>

<p>Since 2018 the company has doubled in size and opened a new studio in Montreal.</p>
<p>"After years as a single-project studio, we also decided to take a new step," said Cage. "Multiple teams are fully dedicated to crafting the next generation of great games, including something very different, a competitive multiplayer experience, born from the same spirit of curiosity and creativity that has always defined us.</p><p>"This new title may surprise our fans as it is very different from what we have done so far. But taking risks, challenging ourselves, exploring new ways of playing and telling stories, and attempting what seems impossible, has always been part of our DNA."</p>
<p>He admitted since the studio has "no legacy in this genre" it has "everything to prove".</p>
<p>Cage then added: "Of course, development of Star Wars: Eclipse continues, and we are eager to share more with you in the future."</p>
<p>It's not much to go on, but it does suggest more concrete news is on the way.</p>
<p>After a couple of releases, Quantic Dream found success with PS3 game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/heavy-rain">Heavy Rain</a>, which it later replicated with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/beyond-two-souls">Beyond: Two Souls</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a>.</p>
<p>Back in 2018, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/david-cage-and-quantic-dream-shocked-by-allegations-of-unhealthy-studio-culture">multiple French outlets reported on alleged unhealthy studio culture at Quantic Dream</a>, which was refuted by Fondaumière.</p>
<p>Later, in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/david-cage-defends-response-to-allegations-of-unhealthy-studio-culture-at-quantic-dream-in-new-interview">Cage responded to the allegations</a>. "I don't think we had an aggressive attitude," he said. "When you're accused of things that go against everything you believe in, everything you've done in your life, it hurts. It went beyond just attacking the studio culture."</p>
<p>Lead writer on Star Wars: Eclipse <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-star-wars-eclipse-lead-writer-announces-new-studio-working-on-handcrafted-dark-mature-fantasy-rpg">Adam Williams left the studio</a> in 2024 and has since formed a new studio, Republic Games.</p>
