            <p>Nintendo is currently in full swing gearing up for the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, and part of that has seen the company update a number of its original Switch games for the newer model. While many of these updates are along the lines of 'added support', Nintendo has gone a bit further with Legend of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> - there's finally a more streamlined way to find favourite Echoes no matter which console you play on.</p>
<p>Echoes, for those unfamiliar with the game already, are essential items (or creatures) Zelda can copy and paste into the world, and use to her advantage. For example, once Zelda learns a bed Echo, she can use imitations of this object to create a bridge. An <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/best-echoes-to-get-early-zelda-of-wisdom">Echo of the classic Legend of Zelda enemy the Peahat</a>, meanwhile, can be deployed during any confrontation and steadily use its spikes to jab your foes into oblivion. However, they could sometimes take a while to find during gameplay, given in total there are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-echoes-locations-abilities-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-listed">127 Echoes to eventually choose from</a> all in one long list to scroll through. </p>
<p>Thankfully, Nintendo has heard our outcries (I am sure I am not the only one who has cried out...) about this. Now, those playing Echoes of Wisdom will find a new feature which displays "only favourited echoes in the list of echoes after 30 or more echoes have been learned". Huzzah! My word, I would have really loved this when I played the game on its release last year.</p>

            <p>The director of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has claimed he was able to beat the game solo and without relics, that it's very possible to do so, and wants players to have the confidence to try it themselves.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/elden-ring-nightreign-director-interview-if-he-can-solo-every-boss-so-can-you/">In an interview with CNET</a>, director Junya Ishizaki was asked about how many bosses he had beaten himself, to which he responded: "I can hopefully give you reassurance to know that I have beaten all of the game's bosses. I've seen everything it has to offer, both in multiplayer and as a solo player. So I want you and players to know that this is very possible, and I want you to have the confidence to give it a try yourself. "</p>
<p>In a quick follow up, Ishizaki was asked if he'd solo'd every boss in the game too, to which he confirmed: "Yes. And without relics."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-is-now-easier-for-solo-players">Elden Ring Nightreign was made easier for solo players last week</a>, acting as a salve for those who felt the solo experience was too daunting compared to the difficulty level experienced in groups of three. FromSoftware also announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">duo-mode is in development in response to player feedback</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while many are struggling still and Ishizaki has politely laid out a "Git Gud" to folks, one player has already jazzed up a regular Nightreign run by beating Gaping Jaw with a saxophone controller. This player - Dr. Doot - previously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg3RS_vYxpM">beat Elden Ring with a saxophone without being hit</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-years-agdq-included-someone-speedrunning-elden-ring-bosses-with-a-saxophone">and finished the game on the sax in less than 30 minutes at ADGQ this year</a>.</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>So what I'm wondering is, when is Ishizaki busting his sax out? If he can't crack it, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-streamer-missmikkaa-completes-elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-on-a-dance-mat">a DDR mat would also suffice</a>.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign has proven to be a solid success despite its drastic departure from FromSoftware norms,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players"> surpassing 3.5 million players yesterday</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
