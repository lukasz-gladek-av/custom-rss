Previously unseen concept art purportedly showing character designs from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games-montreal">Warner Bros. Games Montreal</a>'s cancelled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a> follow-up Project Sabbath has surfaced online, showing further glimpses of a beardy Bruce Wayne, Damian Wayne, and more.
</p>
<p>
Whispers of Project Sabbath's existence first emerged back in 2016, with Batman: Arkham Oranges developer Warner Bros. Games Montreal said to be at the helm. Along the way, however, Project Sabbath was ditched in favour of what would ultimately become the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gotham-knights-review-batman-minus-batman-is-scrappy-but-riddled-with-charm">rather middling Gotham Knights</a>, and much of what we know about the cancelled game has been gleaned through various bits of concept art that've emerged over the years.
</p>
<p>
In 2019, for instance, concept art from Project Sabbath - which would supposedly see Bruce Wayne's son Damian donning the famous cowl and cape - popped up on 4chan, showing off various elements including an older Bruce Wayne, a rundown Gotham City, Gorilla Grodd, and more. All that was accompanied by claims the game would have used <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor">Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a>'s acclaimed Nemesis System. Additional concept art then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-knight-canned-sequel-apparently-shown-via-concept-art">emerged two years later</a>, offering closer looks at both Bruce and Damien.
</p>
<p>
And now, yet more Project Sabbath concept art has emerged, this time from character artist Rodrigue Pralier, who worked at Warner Bros. Games Montreal circa 2014/2015. Although the Artstation page originally featuring the concepts has now been removed, the images have been <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/arkhamvideos.bsky.social/post/3ls75vje3d22d">saved for posterity on social media</a>, revealing a further look at Damian Wayne and his beardy pa Bruce, alongside Killer Croc, The Huntress, and more.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gotham-knights">Gotham Knights</a> - the title WB Games Montreal switched its attention to after ditching Project Sabbath - did, of course, fail to generate much enthusiasm among critics and fans, and it was followed in 2024 by Arkham Knight studio Rocksteady's Suicide: Kill the Justice League. That proved to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">another Batman-adjacent flop</a> in a year that also saw Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions underperform and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-to-shut-down-until-2024-with-no-refunds-for-paying-players">limp return of Warner's now-cancelled MultiVersus</a>.
</p>
<p>
At the start of this year - following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gotham-knights-developer-warner-bros-games-montreal-slashes-99-jobs">several rounds</a> of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs">layoffs</a> across its studios - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a> boss David Haddad <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-departs-following-rocky-period-for-publisher">departed the company</a>. Just a month later Warner Bros. announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">cancelling Monolith Productions' long-in-the-works Wonder Woman game</a>, closing the studio, and shutting down Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego too. Since then, it's announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-restructures-leadership-team-following-new-focus-on-game-of-thrones-dc-harry-potter-and-mortal-kombat">drastic shift in leadership</a> that'll see it refocusing on several core brands, including Mortal Kombat, Harry Potter, DC, and Game of Thrones.
