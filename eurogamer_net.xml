            <p>
Review aggregation site Metacritic has spoken out in response to the ongoing review bombing of Dragon Age: The Veilguard by online commenters upset at the game's inclusive characters and themes.
</p>
<p>
BioWare's latest Dragon Age epic holds a "generally favourable" review average of 84 on Metacritic, based on a consensus of 54 critics' scores. 
</p>
<p>
But the game's Metacritic user score is listed as just 3.8 out of 10, with a majority of user opinions falling in the starkly negative range. Looking at some of the most recent reviews at the time of writing, these include numerous scores of zero out of 10 for content in the game repeatedly described as "woke".

</figure>
<p>
"Awful dialogue and obviously some woke agenda psyop," reads a zero out of 10 review from one user. "This is censorship at its worst."
</p>
<p>
"Woke kill the game," wrote another user who rated the game with a zero. "But gameplay is nice."
</p>
<p>
"This is what happens when you try to force push DEI [Diversity, equity, and inclusion] and sexual ideology in a fantasy game," wrote a third, who also scored the game with a zero. 
</p>
<p>
Countless other examples are also visible, some of which include slurs and abuse we won't reproduce here. A number of commenters note they are leaving repeat responses as their earlier ratings have been deleted, presumably by Metacritic moderators.
</p>
<p>
By contrast, the 13,006 user reviews for Dragon Age: The Veilguard currently on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/#app_reviews_hash">Steam</a> - which requires you actually play the game before leaving a review - are "Mostly Positive".
</p>
<p>
Dragon Age: The Veilguard features a companion character who identifies as non-binary, who the game's protagonist Rook can be supportive of. Rook themselves can also identify as transgender if the player chooses. 
</p>
<p>
In a statement to Eurogamer acknowledging the backlash to Dragon Age: The Veilguard on its site, a spokesperson for Metacritic parent company Fandom said its site was a "place of belonging for all fans".
</p>
<p>
"We take online trust and safety very seriously across all our sites including Metacritic," the spokesperson said. "Metacritic has a moderation system in place to track violations of our terms of use. Our team reviews each and every report of abuse (including but not limited to racist, sexist, homophobic, insults to other users, etc) and if violations occur, the reviews are removed."
</p>
<p>Last year, Fandom confirmed to Eurogamer it was "evolving [its] processes and tools to introduce stricter moderation" following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metacritic-improving-moderation-after-abusive-disrespectful-horizon-forbidden-west-burning-shores-reviews">similar reactions to Horizon Forbidden West's DLC</a>, Burning Shores.</p>
<p>
"It is the strongest and loudest answer BioWare could have mustered for the people still doubting whether it could do it," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>. "The answer is yes, emphatically. The Veilguard is spectacular. BioWare is back."

            <p>The latest <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> update, released last night, accidentally introduces a few new issues - including chickens that mysteriously disappear.</p>
<p>The 1.6.9 update - which was released alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-confirms-version-16-console-release-date">1.6 for consoles</a> - adds a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-latest-update-adds-a-new-friend-to-retrieve-lost-items-and-more">new friend to retrieve lost items and more</a>. However, there have been some cases of players losing their chickens when they start a new farm on the Meadowlands farm and open the door to the coop on the first day.</p>
<p>Stardew Valley creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone has said that a fix for this, for the time being at least, is to make sure players leave the door to the coop "closed for one day". Then - not that he needed to but I love that he has - <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1853521395080368514">Barone</a> blamed the chickens' disappearance on a "wild coyote" nosing about the farm on day one. What a cheeky blighter (the coyote, not Barone).</p>
<p>Barone has already released patch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/413150/view/4445708897933590775?l=english">1.6.10</a> on Steam and GOG that addresses the rogue chickens, as well as some crashes. This update will arrive on other platforms "as soon as possible", Barone said.</p>

<p>So, after all this is sorted, what is next for Barone? Earlier this year, the creator admitted he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-developer-has-not-touched-haunted-chocolatier-in-a-long-time-due-to-ongoing-update-work">hadn't actually touched his next game - Haunted Chocolatier - "in a long time"</a>, because his focus had been on Stardew Valley.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier was first announced back in 2021</a>, with a cute trailer showing off its spooky chocolate-making, monster-stabbing, small town-living role-playing gameplay. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-creator-wont-rush-haunted-chocolatier-better-to-have-a-good-delayed-game-than-a-bad-game-on-time">Barone previously said he's "not too concerned with the pressure" of releasing Haunted Chocolatier</a>, saying, "it's better to have a delayed game that's actually good than a bad game that's on time".</p>

            <p>
Nintendo has lowered its sales projections for Switch hardware and software, as the company faces one final Christmas focused on its current, aging platform.
</p>
<p>
Switch hardware sales were down 31 percent year-on-year for the three months ending 30th September. The company has now cut its total Switch sales forecast for the financial year to 12.5m, down from the 13.5m it expected previously.
</p>
<p>
After more than seven years on sale, the Switch stands at 146.04m units sold, just 8m shy of the Nintendo DS, the company's best-selling gaming device.

<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, released just before the end of September, shifted 2.58m copies before the end of that month. 
</p>
<p>
Other recent releases to sell over a million copies include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/paper-mario-2-thousand-year-door">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> (1.94m) and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/luigis-mansion-2-hd">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a> (1.57m).
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, the Switch's evergreen bestseller, sold another 2.31m copies, and remains by some margin the console's best-selling game. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's final sales update of 2024 paints a picture of a company on the cusp of announcing much-needed new hardware - though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-year-fiscal-year">provided no new word on when that announcement might arrive</a>. 
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>, or whatever Nintendo eventually ends up calling it, is expected to finally launch in 2025 and will be announced before the end of March.
