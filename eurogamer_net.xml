            <p>The Invincible developer Starward Industries has announced its next project: action-adventure <em>anti</em>-combat RPG, Dante's Ring.</p>
<p>With survival and arcade elements, Dante's Ring tasks you with enduring the "unrelenting forces of nature during an unexpected volcanic eruption on an eerie, ancient, and mysterious island". It's here where you'll need to save as many lost beings as possible.</p>
<p>It's this requirement to save people rather than blow them up that makes Dante's Ring "anti-combat". You can check it out in the teaser below:</p>

<p>"On a perilous journey to the very gates of hell, Dante's Ring will see players step into the role of a bold explorer, striving to survive and rescue as many lives as possible, while mother nature throws everything she has into the Ring of Fire," the developer teased. "Uncovering secrets buried deep beneath the island’s fiery fury, players must face molten lava flows, powerful earthquakes, and scorching volcanic fires, armed with fireproof armour and stylized retro weapons.</p><p>"As if that wasn’t enough of a challenge, Dante's Ring will consistently push players to navigate life and death through strategic planning and ingenuity, all while navigating complex moral choices that will shape their story. The main questions are: how much are you willing to sacrifice to save one more life? Will you descend into the very heart of hell, and are you prepared to uncover its secrets?"</p>
<p>As yet, there's no firm release date, but Steam suggests it's coming "soon" to early access in 2025. The team says the game will remain in early access for as long as it takes to create "engaging gameplay and a captivating story". The early access version, however, will be fully playable.</p>
<p>We enjoyed our time with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-invincible-review-gorgeous-sci-fi-that-doesnt-quite-take-off">Starward Industries' prior project, The Invincible</a>, saying it is "a spectacular adaptation of Stanisław Lem's book", but "limited in terms of what you can do in it, and the impact on the story you have". Our Bertie awarded it three stars out of five.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> has outlined what's coming up in its next patch.</p>
<p>Whilst details were sparse, one-person developer Slavic Magic knows that a picture tells a thousand words, so peppered the post with a selection of images to show off new maps, building upgrades, and "reworked" ale and water distribution system to improve the function of taverns and wells, although that's currently in closed testing.</p>

<p>There's also been a marketplace "overhaul", too.</p>
<p>"We're reworking how marketplaces and goods distribution work, having tested three different systems to find an engaging, intuitive, and easy-to-understand solution," the update explains.</p>
<p>"This update will also include distribution filters for marketplaces, a feature that's been frequently requested."</p>

<p>The developer finished by pointing out that Manor Lords has been nominated for Best Debut Indie Game and Best Sim/Strategy for player voting at The Game Awards.</p>
<p>"This is very much appreciated, but of course, there's still much work ahead. The game remains in Early Access, and I know there are plenty of features, adjustments, and fixes you're all looking forward to," developer Greg Styczeń said.</p>

<p>"There's a confidence to Manor Lords that belies its one-person development, and what's there can be spellbinding, but it's a pastoral idyll that still needs significant development," Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/manor-lords-early-access-review-beautiful-foundations-but-missing-important-pieces">Eurogamer's Manor Lords early access review</a>. "The potential is there, the foundations are most assuredly laid, it just now needs to build on top of them."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Dataminers have discovered the ages of Dragon Age: The Veilguard's cast as given by developer BioWare.</p>
<p>Twitter/X user @amirdrassil has compiled a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ferRIG-9JEU4fcy3NAhpAv1ou2UCMwTqKJTXuw7UgSU/edit?tab=t.0">27-page Google Docs file</a> of information purportedly found hidden within the game's backend, including the ages and bios of a whole range of Veilguard characters, including some we've encountered in prior Dragon Age games, too.</p>
<p>The information below may be a little spoilery, <strong>so please proceed with caution!</strong></p>

</div><figcaption>Here is a spoiler free video version of our glowing Dragon Age: The Veilguard review.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f0BX-JXzek" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>As @amirdrassil stressed, these datamined descriptions could have been stripped for a whole host of reasons, so it's probably best just to take them with a pinch of salt, especially as they may have originated from "scrapped or altered storylines, meaning that they no longer align with the finalised story that the game presents".</p><p>As spotted and verified by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-datamine-character-ages-bios-morrigan-isabela/">TheGamer</a>, the datamined notes were seemingly included only for the team itself to see and not for public consumption. They reveal that the Inquisitor was around 30 years old, making them in their early 20s in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>, whilst Isabela is around 50 in Veilguard. Interestingly, at one point her appearance would have differed depending upon "how the player resolves her past".</p>
<p>Morrigan is around 40, with instructions that her speech be "Morrigan-y". Solas, too, is in the same age range.</p>
<p>New companions "girl-next-door" Harding, Emmrich, Lucanis - who is described as having a "hint of Italian" and being "lean, sinewy, handsome, but haunted" - and Neve are around 29, 50, 36, and 30, respectively.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">datamined veilguard character descriptions google doc is now complete. i've even organised all the characters into their respective factions and added a clickable table of contents!! yippee!!! <a href="https://t.co/kSOEIH9XJj">https://t.co/kSOEIH9XJj</a></p>— howwy 🐺✨ #veilguardspoilers (@amirdrassil) <a href="https://twitter.com/amirdrassil/status/1858713489482600821?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>For the full list - and it really is quite a delightful read - you can read amirdrassil's document <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ferRIG-9JEU4fcy3NAhpAv1ou2UCMwTqKJTXuw7UgSU/edit?tab=t.0">right here</a>.</p>
<p>"It goes without saying, but please don’t use any of this datamining as an excuse to be mean to anyone," the dataminer added at the end. "Please understand that game development is a lot of hard work, and storylines are scrapped all the time as writers get new ideas or are faced with inevitable roadblocks from the game system side of things! No matter what, Veilguard was made with love."</p><p>"It is the strongest and loudest answer BioWare could have mustered for the people still doubting whether it could do it. The answer is yes, emphatically. The Veilguard is spectacular. BioWare is back," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>.</p>
<p>The game launched to "solid" sales here in the UK, though has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-sales-solid-in-uk-softer-across-rest-of-europe-report">numbers "nearly 21 percent lower" than Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth across Europe</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>That's according to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi, who told the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-wont-34152228">Daily Star</a> that whilst he's aware that the fan community would like an expansion like Episode Intermission, the team's focus is instead on Part 3 in order to get it out "as quickly as possible".</p>

<p>"We definitely do hear the desire from fans, the voices out there that want that kind of thing," Hamaguchi said in the interview.</p>
<p>"I understand it completely, but I think, from my perspective, what the fans really want to see the most is not necessarily DLC. They want to see the third part of the series as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>"So that's why we've decided not to focus the development resources on creating additional extra episodes for DLC at the moment," Hamaguichi added.</p>
<p>"We really are putting all our efforts into getting the third game out as quickly as we can. So for the moment, that's where we're focusing our time."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-anticipated-a-mixed-reaction-to-its-controversial-ending-but-wanted-to-avoid-fan-service">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi also recently said he deliberately intended for the game's ending</a> to cause debate and keep players guessing until the trilogy's forthcoming conclusion.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer's own Ed Nightingale, Hamaguchi discussed fan reaction to the game's divisive ending and how he wanted to avoid fan service with its development.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
