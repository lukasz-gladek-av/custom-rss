            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> studio Ubisoft Montreal is reportedly working on a new Animal Crossing-inspired social sim featuring Minecraft-like building elements, with former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gotham-knights">Gotham Knights</a> creative director Patrick Redding said to be at the reins.
</p>
<p>
That's according to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-alterra-animal-crossing-inspired-game/">Insider Gaming</a>, which claims the title - currently codenamed Alterra - has been in the works for around 18 months. Alterra is said to have risen from the ashes of an earlier Ubisoft Montreal project, canceled after four years of development, with the two games supposedly sharing a focus on voxel creation.
</p>
<p>
Insider Gaming's source describes Alterra as an  "Animal Crossing-inspired social sim" in which players inhabit a home island populated by NPCs known as Matterlings. These Matterlings are "somewhat like Funko Pop figures", sporting large heads and designs blending fictional and real-world creatures, from polar bears to dragons.

<p>
Alterra's social aspect is reportedly combined with that aforementioned voxel creation element, featuring building mechanics "somewhat similar" to those seen in Minecraft, with players able to fashion items using resources found out in the world beyond their home.
</p>
<p>
Here, it's claimed they'll encounter different biomes containing specific resources and different Matterling types, as well as unique enemies, materials, and more - with one example given being an ice biome, inhabited by snow-ice Matterlings, where players can create objects from snow and ice. It'll apparently be possible to encounter other players out in the world too.
</p>
<p>
Insider Gaming adds Ubisoft veteran Fabien Lhéraud is serving as lead producer on Alterra, and that the project's launch is "likely still a few years away".
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's release slate is, of course, a bit fuzzy beyond next year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-necessary-to-change-narrative-of-ubisofts-inconsistency-in-quality">delayed Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anno-117-pax-romana-is-taking-the-economic-city-builder-to-ancient-rome-next-year">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a>, although the publisher <em>has</em> confirmed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-new-rayman-project-currently-in-the-exploration-phase-following-reports-of-a-remake">new Rayman project</a> is currently in the "exploration phase". That's alongside the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-still-in-development-now-with-new-creative-director">very long in the works Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</a> and Ubisoft's troubled Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake, with the latter now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-now-targeting-2026-gets-briefest-of-trailers">targeting a 2026 release</a>. In more recent news, Ubisoft has now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-first-ever-blockchain-game-with-nfts-costing-up-to-50k">launched its first-ever blockchain game</a>, featuring <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFT</a> figurines costing up to £50k.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> - AKA Project Polaris AKA "the first instalment in the new Witcher saga", as it continues to be referred to in lieu of a publicly announced name - is another step closer to release, with CD Projekt confirming its development has shifted to "full-scale production".
</p>
<p>
"I'm proud to confirm that several weeks ago the Polaris team wrapped up preproduction and moved on to full-scale production – the most intensive phase of development," joint CEO Michał Nowakowski wrote in a <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cd-projekt-wraps-up-the-third-quarter-of-2024/">statement accompanying its Q3 2024 earnings report</a>. "We are very pleased with our progress on this project, and I wish to thank the team for its dedication."
</p>
<p>
Nowakowski's update follows a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-says-the-witcher-4-will-enter-full-production-soon">progress report in August</a> anticipating Project Polaris' full production phase would start "soon", and CD Projekt's confirmation that milestone has now been reached was celebrated on social media by Polaris game director Sebastian Kalemba. "With new challenges just around the corner," he <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1861446070858846571">wrote</a>, "it's the talented and hard-working people who make me believe we can together make the upcoming Witcher Saga a remarkable experience. No stopping now! Stay tuned for what's on the other side of the coin!"

It has, of course, been a little over two and half years since CD Projekt <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-confirms-new-the-witcher-game-in-development">revealed</a> development on the next game in The Witcher series had begun, but the project still remains a bit of an enigma. About all we know so far, beyond whatever speculation can be eked out of the single bit of tantalising promo art shared alongside Polaris' announcement, is that it "won't focus" on Geralt of Rivia. That bit of news was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-voice-actor-confirms-he-will-be-part-of-the-witcher-4">shared by Geralt actor Doug Cockle earlier this year</a>, although he did at least confirm the character would be a "part of" the new game.
</p><p>
Alongside CD Projekt's Witcher news, the studio has provided updated sales figures for some of its older titles, confirming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> has now surpassed 30m copies sold. That's 5m more than the company had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sales-top-25m-cd-projekt-red-announces">shifted last October</a>, with the well-recieved <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> expansion also selling a further 5m copies in the same timeframe, bringing its total sales up to 8m. "These are impressive figures," Nowakowski added. "I'm very happy to see a large, dedicated community coalesce around our Cyberpunk games."
</p>
<p>Additionally, CD Projekt has reiterated, as per a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpeetmZuc80">teaser in September</a>, it'll be following the success of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-edgerunners-shows-cd-projekts-cyberpunk-is-still-worth-fighting-for">2022's acclaimed Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</a> with a brand-new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> animated series set in the Cyberpunk 2077 universe, although no further information has been revealed.
</p>
<p>
CD Projekt previously announced Cyberpunk 2077 is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-is-bringing-cyberpunk-2077-to-macs-early-next-year">launching for Mac next year</a>, but one thing the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-says-no-plans-for-cyberpunk-2077-upgrade-patch-on-ps5-pro">won't be getting</a> is any kind of update for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>.
