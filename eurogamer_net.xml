            <p>Cailee Spaeny is reportedly in talks to star in the forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> film adaptation.</p>
<p>The casting scoop comes from <a href="https://www.theinsneider.com/p/cailee-spaeny-elden-ring-movie-cast-alex-garland-a24-booster-gold-writer-dc-studios-hbo-max">Jeff Sneider</a>, who reported Spaeny will reunite with director Alex Garland after starring in his 2024 film, Civil War.</p>
<p>Spaeny also starred in Alien: Romulus last year, in the lead role of Rain Carradine. Her voice and likeness as Rain were also used in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> as a purchasable skin for Ellen Ripley. Prior to that, in 2023 she played the lead role in Priscilla, Sofia Coppola's biopic on Priscilla Presley.</p>

<p>So who might Spaeny be playing in the Elden Ring film adaptation?</p>
<p>We don't know yet what the plot will focus on and which characters will be included. A safe bet would be Melina, who acts as the Tarnished's maiden along their journey.</p>
<p>Other options include Ranni the Witch, Malenia, or perhaps even a female Tarnished.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-live-action-film-officially-in-development">Elden Ring live-action film was announced back in May</a>, with Garland as writer and director. Garland is also known for Ex Machina and Warfare.</p>
<p>Heartstopper star Kit Connor is also said to star in the film, after featuring in Warfare.</p>
<p>Film production company A24 and game publisher Bandai Namco are both behind the project, though it's unclear if FromSoftware or the game's creator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a> are also involved.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-has-sold-over-5-million-copies-while-shadow-the-the-erdtree-makes-it-past-10-million-at-last">Elden Ring team announced its co-op spin-off Nightreign had passed 5m copies sold</a>, while DLC <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> has now soared past 10m downloads.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/alien-romulus-star-reportedly-in-talks-for-elden-ring-film-role]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft has shared a new roadmap of content coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, including a release date for its Claws of Awaji expansion.</p>
<p>Claws of Awaji is set to be released on 16th September, as paid DLC (though those who pre-ordered Assassin's Creed Shadows will get it for free). On its release, Claws of Awaji will introduce a new region, a new weapon and abilities, new outfits and legendary gear, a new enemy faction and bosses, and a new chapter of Shadow's story. The expansion is said to be adding over 10 hours of content to the game.</p>

<p>Along with the Claws of Awaji date, Ubisoft has also promised a new game plus mode for Assassin's Creed Shadows, which will go live next week on 29th July. This will also add new achievements and trophies.</p>
<p>Then, the team is adding various quality of life updates further down the line, which will include the likes of uncapped framerates for cutscenes on PC and the ability to fast-forward the time of day.</p>
<p>Ubisoft also added a line about unfogging the world map under this future update section. This seemed a bit confusing, because we were doing that already, but the studio has elaborated this unfogging line means: "Once you synchronise all viewpoints in a region, the fog now completely lifts! You can focus your exploration on where you want to go."</p>

<p>Ubisoft recently celebrated welcoming five million players to Assassin's Creed Shadows. Along with those five million assassins, there have been 2bn stealth kills and 38 million animals petted. Meanwhile, players have travelled 1bn kilometers since the game was released in March. And it sounds like Assassin's Creed Shadows may soon be welcoming more players to Japan, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-ubisoft-hints">with a Switch 2 port seemingly being on the cards</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Assassin's Creed news, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-ubisoft-hints">earlier this month it was revealed that Netflix's live action adaptation is finally a-go</a>, five years after it was first announced.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-release-date-announced-new-game-plus-coming-next-week]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Troy Baker has had many video game roles over the years. He is Indiana Jones in The Great Circle, he is Sam Drake in the Uncharted series, he is Booker Dewitt in Bioshock, he is Higgs in Death Stranding… The list goes on (and on and on and on).</p>
<p>One of his most famous roles, though, is Joel in The Last of Us. Baker portrayed the cynical smuggler turned surrogate father in 2013's original release, before reprising his role in 2020's sequel. But, while Joel may have elevated Baker's career, the actor has admitted he was "woefully unprepared" for the part.</p>

<p>During a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe0xVuIcxMw">Q&amp;A at GalaxyCon New Orleans 2025</a>, Baker was asked if playing Joel had affected him personally, to which Baker jokingly quipped "you're trying to make me cry". He then elaborated on his role further, saying it had affected him "deeply" in many different ways.</p>
<p>"There's nothing worse, and I hope that no one ever feels this… [but] do you ever show up to something and go 'I am so woefully unprepared for this'? And, it's not imposter syndrome, it's a fact. You are not equipped to do the thing that you are about to do," Baker said. "You could be like, 'let's go bungie jumping!', and then you get on the platform and you go, 'I can't do this'. That was The Last of Us for me. You get the gig, and then you go, 'oh no, I have to deliver this'."</p>
<p>Baker recalled going through the script and pitch in the early days of The Last of Us with the development team and his co-star Ashley Johnson, who plays Ellie in the games. During a break, Baker turned to Johnson and said: "'Do you realise that if this thing sucks, it's our fault?'"</p>
<p>He noted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> already had had great success with its Uncharted games, and the studio now knew the story it wanted to tell next. "We knew that what they were going to make was going to be good," Baker recalled, so now the pressure was on him and Johnson to deliver a worthy performance.</p>
<p>The Last of Us "taught me how to be a better actor", Baker continued. "It taught me how to stop trying to convince people that I could act, and just realise that Joel has no idea that he's in a game, and he's just in a moment in his life. And, I took that lesson, and I apply it all the way across."</p>

<p>Baker more recently starred in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, where he reprised his role of Higgs. Earlier this month, he was also announced as the voice of Jack Pepper, <a href="https://x.com/mousethegame/status/1944561535625605444">the lead protagonist of Mouse: P.I. for Hire</a>.</p>
<p>As for Naughty Dog and The Last of Us, the studio recently announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-want-yet-another-way-to-experience-the-last-of-us-games-theres-a-new-script-book-on-the-way">book containing the video game scripts for both of Naughty Dog's games</a>, including the first game's Left Behind DLC, is being released. Away from its post-apocalyptical series, it's also working on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-online-backlash-prompted-naughty-dogs-next-star-to-get-bootcamp-ing-from-neil-druckmann">which stars Tati Gabrielle as bounty hunter Jordan A Mun</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/troy-baker-wasnt-ready-for-the-last-of-us-admits-he-was-woefully-unprepared-for-playing-joel]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> has passed 5m copies sold, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a> has soared past 10m downloads, FromSoftware has announced.
</p>
<p>This duo of big milestones was announced on the official <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1948382858109698175">Elden Ring X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, alongside a lovely piece of custom art featuring the two games. The post reads: "The flame of thy passion burns ever bright in these shadowed lands. To all who wander the Lands Between, we offer our deepest thanks."</p>
<p>It was only in early June that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">FromSoftware celebrated Nightreign passing 3.5 million players</a> for its Soulslike PvE twist on the battle royale genre. Since its release, Nightreign has seen a consistant stream of updates and fixes. This includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-round-of-everdark-sovereigns-will-arrive-at-the-end-of-the-month-but-still-no-sign-of-duo-mode">the addition of Everdark Sovereigns</a>, even harder variations of the game's end-of-run bosses.

<p>Smaller patches have made notable improvements to the game's rough edges too. A tweak to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-maintenance-makes-matchmaking-less-of-a-headache">how remembrances work removed the barriers they presented</a> with matchmaking online. In addition, soon after Nightreign's release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-is-now-easier-for-solo-players">solo runs were made easier in response to player feedback</a>.</p>
<p>The stage is now set for FromSoftware's future projects. Namely, the developer revealed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> exclusive: The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-duskbloods">Duskbloods</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-is-bloodborne-meets-sekiro-meets-dark-souls-with-jetpacks-and-dinos-thrown-in">Revealed during the April Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a>, it's a multiplayer PvPvE game that's another drastic shift away from the company's usual formula. There's also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-reportedly-in-advanced-development-on-an-unannounced-project-alongside-the-duskbloods">another unnanounced project we don't know too much about, but is reportedly deep in development</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-has-sold-over-5-million-copies-while-shadow-the-the-erdtree-makes-it-past-10-million-at-last]]></content:encoded>
