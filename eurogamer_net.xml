            <p>
Payday developer and publisher Starbreeze has officially sanctioned Notoriety, a popular heist shooter in Roblox, that previously existed as a Payday-inspired fan game.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/21532277/Notoriety-A-PAYDAY-Experience-READ-DESC#!/about">Notoriety</a> will now be relaunched within Roblox as Notoriety: A Payday Experience and feature "authentic Payday assets, characters and heists". 
</p>
<p>
It's unclear what the terms of this deal involve for both Starbreeze and Notoriety's development teams, though Notoriety is a hugely popular - and lucrative - Roblox experience, with more than 227m visits and 1.3m favourites from players on the platform.
</p>
<p>
"Notoriety was born out of a love for heist games, with Payday serving as a key source of inspiration," Notoriety developer Evan Pickett said in a Starbreeze press release today. "This official licensing partnership allows us to stay true to our vision while incorporating elements that fans of both Notoriety and Payday will recognise and enjoy."

<p>
For its part, Starbreeze said it "deeply admire[s] the skill, passion, and creativity that Evan has poured into crafting Notoriety" and that licensing Payday out opened up the Payday universe to "a fresh perspective". Hey, 227m visits means a lot of eyes on the Payday franchise.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a> launched back in October 2023 and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-gets-new-creative-leads-as-player-numbers-still-dwarfed-by-decade-old-predecessor">struggled to capture the same level of interest as its decade-old predecessor</a>. Various <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3s-second-operation-medic-bag-patch-is-now-available">game updates have followed</a> to try and turn things around, though the project's commercial failure has seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starbreeze-ceo-tobias-sjogren-ousted-by-board-following-payday-3-flop">Starbreeze's CEO ousted</a>, its previous game director step down, and one employee describe its launch as "disastrous". 
</p>
<p>
"The whole stage just collapsed and everyone left," Starbreeze community head Almir Listo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-developer-likens-launch-to-being-a-rock-band-when-the-whole-stage-collapses-and-everyone-leaves">said back in October</a>. "The game just felt unfinished. It was a bad experience for our players."
