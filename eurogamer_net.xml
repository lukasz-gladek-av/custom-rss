            <p>Microsoft has announced its first wave of Game Pass titles for March.</p>

Dive straight into epic, 33-player co-op battles with instant 'pick-up and raid' matchmaking," reads the official blurb. "Cooperate with your allies to survive against hordes of monsters and massive, challenging bosses. Expand your arsenal and equip powerful new relics to permanently upgrade your soul."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the critically acclaimed deck-building roguelike Monster Train is making its return to the service across Cloud, Console, and PC.</p>
<p>Here's everything coming to Game Pass in the coming weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Monster Train - Cloud, Console, and PC via Game Pass Standard, Ultimate and PC Game Pass -  4th March</li>
<li>Galacticare - Xbox Series X/S, now with Game Pass Standard - 5th March</li>

<p>In addition, and as is the case with every new batch of games, the following titles will be leaving Game Pass on 15th March:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evil West (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Lies of P (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>No More Heroes 3 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Solar Ash (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom â€“ Rehydrated (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Yakuza 5 Remastered (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Yakuza 6: The Song of Life (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to keep playing these games after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to purchase them. On the plus side, Game Pass subscribers get a 20 percent discount.</p>

            <p>Acclaim, the publisher behind hundreds of classic games from the 80s and 90s, is set to be revived.</p>
<p>The company closed back in 2004 as it filed for bankruptcy, but will now return to support indie developers and "reignite classic franchises" from its portfolio of IP.</p>
<p>Acclaim was known in the 90s for game adaptations of familiar franchises, from WWF (now WWE) and The Simpsons, to movie tie-ins like Alien 3, Judge Dredd and Batman Forever, to comic book games like Spider-Man and Wolverine.</p>

<p>It also published the likes of the controversial Mortal Kombat games and Theme Park. Then, in the late 90s, it was prolific for publishing N64 games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/turok">Turok</a>, Extreme-G, Shadow Man, and the South Park FPS.</p>
<p>As well as resurrecting its old franchises, the company will be offering funding, marketing, and PR support to indie studios.</p>
<p>The newly-revived publisher has an advisory board of industry leaders, including "licensing icons, professional athletes, living music legends and season veterans who have defined the intersection of video games and pop culture". That includes two-time Hall of Fame wrestler Jeff Jarrett.</p>
<p>"For more than three decades, I've had the privilege to have been a part of both the wrestling and gaming universes, and I'm thrilled to now be a partner in the revival of Acclaim, an iconic publisher known for releasing some of the most legendary games of the '80s and '90s," said Jarrett.</p>
<p>"From my early involvement with the publisher's hit 16-bit WWF titles to my experience helping shape the TNA Wrestling series, which spawned the first video game wrestler to become a full-time roster member in the Squared Circle, I've seen firsthand the type of impact great games can have on players and fans. Resurrecting Acclaim is an opportunity to impart the same degree of passion and love to a new generation, and I'm excited to be involved."</p>
<p>Acclaim was originally founded in 1987, publishing a number of NES and Game Boy games. However, sales of its games declined in the early '00s which led to a number of studio closures across the UK. Eventually the company closed in August 2004, closing all of its facilities and terminating all employees at its Austin and New York studios.</p>
<p>Still, a number of game franchises first published by Acclaim have made a return in recent years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-n64-racing-games-join-nintendo-switch-online-today">High-speed racer Extreme-G and puzzle game Iggy's Reckin' Balls</a> were added to Nintendo Switch Online's N64 catalogue last year, which were followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-online-mature-app-receives-two-additional-n64-games">Turok 2: Seeds of Evil and Shadow Man in the Mature app</a>.</p>
<p>What's more, as previously reported, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-shadowman-game-in-the-works-21-years-after-the-last">new Shadow Man game is in development</a> from Blowfish Studios along with comic publisher Valiant Entertainment, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-new-turok-game">Saber Interactive is working on a new Turok game</a> it revealed at last year's The Game Awards.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Activision's social media post advertising a new entry in the Guitar Hero series is market research for a game that doesn't exist, and is not meant to be an actual announcement, Eurogamer understands.
</p>
<p>
The fake advert - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-accused-of-ai-slop-yet-again-this-time-for-new-guitar-hero">which has been dubbed "AI slop" for its use of poorly-generated imagery</a> - is one of several tests currently being run across the publisher's social media profiles. 
</p>
<p>
These adverts also include new smartphone games in other Activision franchises such as Call of Duty and Crash Bandicoot that also don't exist (yet) either. 
</p>
<p>
Clicking on some of the adverts will take you through to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GuitarHero/comments/1j0jbh3/instagram_ad_for_a_new_guitar_hero_mobile_game/">mocked up mobile store page</a> organised by marketing service Geeklab, and then onto a survey that reveals "this isn't a real game, but could be some day!"
</p>
<p>
Market research questions then include queries asking users what made them click on the advert and what gameplay features they expected the game to include, based on the fake advert.
</p>
<p>
Activision posts on Instagram and Facebook have similarly advertised "Call of Duty: Zombie Defender", "Call of Duty: Sniper" and "Crash Bandicoot: Brawl".
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Activision plans to develop two new Call of Duty titles for mobile platform:</p><p>ðŸ”¸ Call of Duty: Zombie Defender<br>ðŸ”¸ Call of Duty: Sniper</p><p>AI-generated advertisements are being used to gauge player interests. If there is enough interest, the project will go into development. Theseâ€¦ <a href="https://t.co/PWA1KjLd4h">pic.twitter.com/PWA1KjLd4h</a></p></div>â€” Leakers On Duty (@LeakersOnDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/LeakersOnDuty/status/1896536223478403382?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
Artwork for the latter game, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Activision/videos/569180362817791/">hosted on Facebook</a>, again shows obvious use of AI image generation. One squirrel-like character appears to be missing half a face.

<p>
Will any of these Guitar Hero, Crash Bandicoot or Call of Duty smartphone games ever see the light of day? That remains to be seen. If and when they do, however, here's hoping Activision hires some actual humans to work on their artwork.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-admits-call-of-duty-includes-generative-ai">Activision recently added a warning label to the Steam page for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> confirming the game "uses generative AI tools to help develop some in-game assets", after players spotted various in-game examples - including a zombie Santa Claus with six fingers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
