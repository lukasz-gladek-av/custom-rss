            <p>
The director of A Minecraft Movie has reacted to the chaotic scenes seen in some cinemas as viewers interrupt screenings to stand up, scream and empty buckets of popcorn over other people.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">A Minecraft Movie is a breakout success that's performed far beyond initial expectations</a>, seemingly fuelled by its viral nature among younger viewers. In particular, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">videos on social media have shown crowds reacting wildly to the film's now-notorious "Chicken Jockey" scene</a>.
</p>
<p>
But while the trend may be popular, it hasn't gone down well with all cinema goers. Viewers have been removed from showings for disruptive behaviour and <a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/mat-su/2025/04/08/wasilla-police-eject-rowdy-teens-from-minecraft-movie-showing/">police have been called</a> as the trend has continued - escalating now to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/people-are-taking-live-chickens-into-screenings-of-the-minecraft-movie-now-as-chicken-jockey-meme-gets-out-of-hand">disturbing incident where someone brought a live chicken into a screening</a>.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps unusurprisingly, A Minecraft Movie director Jared Hess doesn't sound too bothered about it all. 
</p>
<p>
"It's way too funny," Hess told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/movies/chicken-jockey-minecraft-movie.html">New York Times</a>. "It's been a total blast. I'm just laughing my brains out every time someone sends me a new video.
</p>
<p>
"Just the fact that people are making memories at the movies  - that's what it's all about," Hess continued. "That's why we do it. I never could have anticipated this level of passion and fun and craziness that's happening."
</p>
<p>
Is it okay to dump your popcorn over other people? Hess seems to think so. 
</p>
<p>
"No one's going to get hurt from popcorn," he concluded. "Look, when I go to the movies with my kids, it’s like a popcorn massacre that happens and they're not throwing anything, but it ends up on the ground, regardless."
</p>
<p>
Just spare a thought for the minimum wage employee who has to come along a clear it up.
</p>
<p>
As you'd expect, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">the success of A Minecraft Movie has already sparked talk of a sequel</a>.
</p>
<p>"Lovely performances elevate a movie that captures Minecraft's many bits and pieces but not its creative spirit," Christian Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">Eurogamer's A Minecraft Movie review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>While <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> may have dominated any and all Nintendo news this month so far, we still have some Sega-related goodness for the here and now to break things up a bit.</p>
<p>Nintendo has today updated its Sega Genesis / Mega Drive catalogue for Switch Online members, and added three more classic games for us to enjoy. These games are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Streets of Rage</li>
<li>Super Thunder Blade</li>
<li>ESWAT: City Under Siege</li>
</ul>

<p>As a reminder, to access these Sega games, you will need to make sure that you have an active Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership, which is the company's more expensive subscription tier. You can check out a little teaser trailer for April's Mega Drive update below.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Nintendo news - and there has been a lot of it - last week the company announced that some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-gamecube-games-coming-to-switch-2-via-switch-online-along-with-purchasable-gamecube-inspired-controller">classic GameCube games will be coming to Switch 2</a>, via Switch Online.</p>
<p>So far, the company has revealed that The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/soulcalibur-ii">Soulcalibur 2</a> and F-Zero GX will all be available for those who have Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack members, starting on 5th June. While those three are just the start, more titles will be added to the Switch Online GameCube library as time goes on.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Mafia: The Old Country - the next game in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hangar13">Hangar 13</a>'s Mafia series - will seemingly be arriving as soon as August.</p>
<p>Publisher 2K appears to have accidentally revealed the release date for Mafia: The Old Country via a post on Steam: 8th August 2025.</p>

<p>While the post itself no longer has that all-important date attached, many were able to grab a screenshot of the original with those release details included. "Mafia: The Old Country will be available on August 8, 2025. Pre-orders are available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC via Steam," read the text.</p>
<p>This date was likely meant to be saved for Mafia: The Old Country's newly-announced PAX East developer panel, which is scheduled for 8th May at 7pm UK time.</p>
<p>"Watch as Hangar 13 developers debut a new gameplay trailer and offer a rare behind-the-scenes look at the past, present, and future of this storied franchise," reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1941540/view/592894082264596999?l=latam">panel's announcement post</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-is-back-and-heading-to-the-old-country-next-year">Mafia: The Old Country was first revealed</a> at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> last year. While the developer has kept many details about the upcoming title under wraps since, it has confirmed the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-developer-promises-sicilian-voice-acting-and-italian-subtitles">will include Sicilian voice acting and Italian subtitles on its release</a>.</p>
<p>"Authenticity is at the heart of the Mafia franchise," the team wrote in August. "Mafia: The Old Country will offer voice acting in Sicilian, inline with the game's setting in 1900s Sicily. Additionally, Italian language localisation will be available for both in-game UI and via subtitles."</p>
<p>Mafia: The Old Country will be coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
