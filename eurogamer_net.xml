            <p>Japanese racehorse Haru Urara, who inspired a character of the same name in popular gacha game Umamusume: Pretty Derby, has passed away.</p>
<p>Haru Urara was 29 when she passed. In human years, she would have been around 90 years of age. According to Japanese outlet <a href="https://friday.kodansha.co.jp/article/438213">Friday Digital</a>, the cause of Haru Urara's death was colic.</p>

<p>"It is with heavy hearts that we share that Haru Urara passed away," the official X account for Umamusume: Pretty Derby wrote today, calling her a "legendary" racehorse despite her not having a particularly strong track record. In fact, she never won a single race.</p>
<p>"We share our condolences to all the staff involved in Haru Urara's care," the Umamusume: Pretty Derby account said.</p>
<p>Haru Urara was a fan-favourite in Umamusume: Pretty Derby. As our Connor reported earlier this year, Uma Musume: Pretty Derby fans recently came out en masse to send <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/so-why-exactly-are-uma-musume-pretty-derby-players-are-sending-massive-amounts-of-grass-to-a-retired-japanese-race-horse">packages of delicious ryegrass to the real-life inspiration of their favourite horse from the game</a>.</p> <div>

            <p>Nintendo's lawsuit against accessory manufacturer Genki, which earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-leaks-turn-into-deluge-as-dummy-units-shown-at-ces">debuted a mock-up Switch 2 unit before the console had actually been officially unveiled</a>, has come to an end.</p>
<p>Back in May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-began-working-on-switch-2-shortly-after-the-release-of-switch-1-new-genki-lawsuit-papers-reveal">Nintendo filed a copyright claim against Genki</a>, when it accused the manufacturer of "capitalising" on demand for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> news and giving "contradictory and inconsistent" statements.</p>
<p>Nintendo and Genki have now reached a settlement, without any further need for a trial. As per official court documents, Genki is required to pay an undisclosed amount to Nintendo for damages.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>In addition, Genki along with all other subsidiaries of its parent company Human Things are banned from using any Nintendo logo, design or "anything confusingly similar thereto", in "any manner in connection with its business".</p>
<p>Genki is now also prohibited from using approximations such as 'Glitch', 'Glitch 2', 'Genki Direct' and 'Genki Indirect' when promoting its own products, with these of course being very close to Nintendo's own Switch and Nintendo Direct-related branding.</p>
<p>The accessories manufacturer is also no longer able to use colour schemes in any of its products or packaging which are "confusingly or substantially" similar to Nintendo's. The court document states: "Namely, red and white, red and blue, green and pink, blue and yellow, purple and orange, pink and yellow, and purple and green."</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015.30.1.pdf">read the full court document here</a>.</p>
