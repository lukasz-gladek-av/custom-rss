            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> looks increasingly likely to be shown off in some form this evening at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> Opening Night Live. Show host and producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> tweeted a selfie while wearing a red nose, heavily pointing towards the game showing up at ONL tonight.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> clown image has become a popular meme around every possible Silksong re-reveal, fans posting it every time they get their hopes up only for them to be dashed at lack of new info.</p>


<p>We already know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-has-laid-out-its-gamescom-plans-and-they-include-a-playable-demo-of-hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong will be playable at Gamescom</a> on the show floor, so it's not a massive leap to expect to see it kick off the show at ONL. Whether or not we get a release date alongside new gameplay, well, that might be asking for a lot, but if the game is going to release in 2025 we'd expect to be getting that info in the near future.</p>
<p>Gamescom ONL kicks off properly at 7pm BST today, with a pre-show expected beforehand.</p>

            <p>PC gamers who are hoping Capcom updates <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> to improve performance will have to wait a little longer. A statement made on <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1957473035885121806">X.com</a> via the official Monster Hunter account has told players that improvements are coming, but not until this winter.</p>
<blockquote><p>To our hunters playing #MHWilds on PC, we're committed to listening to your feedback and improving both performance and stability of the game.</p>
<p>Although we will continue to implement gradual improvements in the weeks ahead, we are targeting Free Title Update 4 this winter to implement a multifaceted plan, including CPU and GPU related optimizations, followed by a second stage of mitigation measures afterwards.</p>
<p>We'll share more information on the specifics in the future.</p></blockquote>
<p>The news comes alongside the release of <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.021.02.00.html">Hotfix patch Ver.1.021.02.00</a>, which has dropped on PS5, Xbox, and PC.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hotfix patch Ver.1.021.02.00 details:</p>
<p>Bug Fixes and Balance Adjustments</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that reduced the invulnerability window upon successfully performing the long sword's Iai Spirit Slash against monster attacks that have long hit detection durations.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, when the Item Bar Display option is set to Type 1, if you select an item using the Item Bar while in Aim/Focus Mode and then release Aim/Focus Mode, the selected item would revert to an empty slot.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
