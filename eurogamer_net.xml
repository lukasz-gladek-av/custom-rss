            <p>A new Plants vs Zombies game is reportedly seeing some movement behind the scene, with a potential release date coming up this year. Plants vs Zombies Reloaded (or Replanted, if the report is to be believed), is said to be a remake of the original game, which may be sprouting up this October.
</p>
<p>This information comes <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/une-version-revisitee-de-plants-vs-zombies-en-approche-on-vous-revele-tout-ce-que-lon-sait-60272">courtesy of Dealabs</a>, a website known for its history of leaks that have largely proven correct. 
</p>
<p>According to the publication, Plants vs Zombies Replanted will launch on 23rd October. Dealabs claims the game will be revealed within the month, and sell for â‚¬19.99 across PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>Plants vs Zombies 'Reloaded' was previously registered as a trademark in Brazil, <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1902169093538521453?">as spotted by Gematsu in March</a>, but according to Dealabs the developers at PopCap want to dub it something a bit more in-line with what the series is about. Thus: Replanted. 
</p>
<p>Plants vs Zombies has proven exceptionally popular over the years. The original game was an instant classic, winning over huge numbers of people with its quirky take on the tower defence genre. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/plants-vs-zombies-review">In the original 2009 Eurogamer review</a> (good times), Christian Donlan stated the game was: "An effortlessly streamlined take on tower defence games, enemies march across the screen from right to left, sticking to polite rows, and it's up to the player to place the various weapons required to slow their progress and finish them off."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/plants-vs-zombies-reloaded-release-date-rumoured-for-october-launch]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> developer Build A Rocket Boy has delayed its previously announced Hitman mission, as it continues to issue fixes to the game.</p>
<p>In a new post, Build A Rocket Boy apologised that its Hitman crossover mission with publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> would no longer be releasing in July as once planned. Rather, the studio has moved this release back to an unspecified date down the line. "We look forward to delivering this exciting crossover when the time is right and will provide further updates as soon as we're able," it wrote.</p>
<p>What Build A Rocket Boy does have planned for the coming months, though, is two more updates promising yet more performance improvements. In August, the studio will also introduce skippable cutscenes.</p>

<p>"It's been just over a month since MindsEye launched, and we're grateful for your support and detailed feedback," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1m8ykoy/july_update_from_the_studio/">the team wrote on reddit</a>. "Your input is shaping our ongoing efforts to enhance the game."</p>
<p>Since this post has gone live, many on the game's Discord are now lamenting the lack of a clear roadmap for MindsEye and content in general.</p>
<p>"Confirmation that Hitman is delayed is good and all, but there's no substantial content or really anything to bring people back until after September," a user wrote. "What's the point of the premium pass or getting a deluxe edition if we don't get the promised content," one user added (to which another replied with simply: "Cash grabbing punks.")</p>
<p>Another commenter on the MindsEye Discord wrote: "Of course, we do want the game to get fixed. But what we also need is content, or else there is literally no point continuing to try and fix stuff." Someone even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-fails-to-make-fps-great-again-goes-back-into-beta-resulting-in-layoffs-and-server-shutdowns">suggested Build A Rocket Boy take a leaf out of Splitgate 2's book</a>, and rerelease MindsEye in an 'early access' state.</p>
<p>"As a console player, there is literally no reason to return to this game," yet another user on the MindsEye Discord wrote.</p>
<p>These sentiments are echoed on the MindsEye reddit. "I want more MindsEye  missions to be added. Community and developer made ones as promised. As well as the essential fixes needed for free roam. Different playable characters, driveable vehicles, time of day, etc," reads one reply to Build A Rocket Boy's latest update.</p>
<p>Others are just annoyed that in its update post, the studio hasn't really said anything of any real importance. "This update doesn't say anything meaningful at all, are you kidding?" reads a reply.</p>

<p>MindsEye released earlier this year, however it wasn't the smoothest of launches. Many found themselves presented with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">distorting character bugs and stuttering issues when they booted up the game</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to its release, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">CEO of Build a Rocket Boy suggested negative reviews had been paid for</a>, though MindsEye's publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-publisher-doesnt-believe-negative-comments-were-paid-for-despite-developer-suggesting-otherwise">did not share this belief</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-review">Eurogamer's review of MindsEye</a>, writer Rick Lane said: "Although it shows some early promise, MindsEye is sunk by a ridiculous story, inconsistent writing, poorly designed mission scenarios, and utterly atrocious combat." We awarded it one star.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseyes-hitman-crossover-mission-delayed-leaving-its-community-starving-for-content]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s promised duo mode is finally on the way, and will be added to the game next week.</p>
<p>From 30th July, a two-player mode will be available in patch 1.02, alongside some UI improvements and more Relics filtering options.</p>
<p>The mode was announced in a new trailer, which you can see below.</p>

<p>Despite being primarily a three-player co-operative game, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> spin-off has been criticised by players - in part because the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/should-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-solo">included solo play was too tough</a>, and in part because a two-player option wasn't included.</p>
<p>Previous patches have re-balanced the solo mode, while a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">two-player mode was promised at the start of June</a>. Now it's finally on the way.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-has-sold-over-5-million-copies-while-shadow-the-the-erdtree-makes-it-past-10-million-at-last">FromSoftware announced Elden Ring Nightreign has sold over 5m copies</a> since its release at the end of May.</p>
<p>Further, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree has sold 10m copies, meaning around a third of players have dived into the expansion.</p>
<p>FromSoftware has continued to update Nightreign with the rotating Everdark Sovereigns. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-round-of-everdark-sovereigns-will-arrive-at-the-end-of-the-month-but-still-no-sign-of-duo-mode">next batch of these extra challenging Nightlords will arrive on 31st July</a> - good luck fighting them in pairs!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-duo-mode-is-finally-on-the-way-with-release-date-confirmed]]></content:encoded>
