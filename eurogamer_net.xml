            <p>Charlie Cox won himself a Game Awards nomination for his work voicing Gustave in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. However, while the actor is understandably delighted to see his work recognised, he says as much of the credit needs to go to Gustave's motion performance actor, Maxence Cazorla.</p>
<p>Cox recently reacted to his Best Performance nomination while speaking at a panel (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@posta.entretenimiento/video/7575433617237642517">recorded by POSTA Entretenimiento</a>). "Yes, I'm thrilled for this nomination," Cox said, before immediately praising Cazorla's work bringing the Clair Obscur character to life.</p>

<p>"I've said this before, and I think it is important to say that there's an amazing french actor by the name of Maxence Cazorla who did almost all of the motion capture for that role," Cox shared with the audience.</p>
<p>"And so, any nomination or any credit I get, I really have to give to him, because I really believe that the performance of that character is down to him, and my voice was just part of that process."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Cox admitted that while Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been met with critical acclaim, he personally feels "like a total fraud". Why? Because it turns out that the actor recorded <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/daredevils-charlie-cox-feels-like-a-total-fraud-following-clair-obscur-expedition-33-praise">most of his lines in only about four hours as part of a voice over gig set up by his agent</a>.</p><p>Cox is not the only Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 cast member to be up for the Best Performance award at this year's Game Awards. Both Ben Starr and Jennifer English have also been nominated for their part in Sandfall's turn-based RPG. Meanwhile, the title is also up for Game of the Year, alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.</p>
<p>With 12 nominations to its name, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has made Game Awards history by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">becoming the most nominated game since the show's conception</a>.</p>

            <p>Valve has addressed the pricing for its recently announced hybrid PC, the Steam Machine.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Valve revealed its new gaming hardware, including the Steam Machine, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-steam-machine-preview-a-powerful-customisable-mini-pc-for-couch-gaming">console/PC hybrid which will be able to run PC games on a television or as a normal gaming computer</a>. But, while we have seen what the gear looks like, Valve refrained from offering any guidance on its pricing.</p>
<p>Valve's Lawrence Yang and Pierre-Loup Griffais have now addressed this question. Neither have disclosed an exact figure, but they have said the Steam Machine will be "more in line with what you might expect from [the] current PC market".</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>The Valve duo were guests on the Friends Per Second podcast when the topic came up. "I think that if you build a PC from parts, and get to the same level of performance, that's the general price window we aim to be at, " Griffais said.</p>
<p>"Ideally, we would be pretty competitive with that, and have a pretty good deal," he continued, adding Valve was "working on refining" the pricing.</p>
<p>When further asked if the Steam Machine was "going to be a subsidised device", the Valve developer said its "more in line with what you might expect from [the] current PC market", again saying the team wants to ensure it is a good deal for consumers in relation to its performance. "You know, you have features which are actually really hard to build if you are making your own gaming PC from parts," Griffais further explained. "Obviously the small form factor and I think the noise level that we achieved (or lack thereof) is really impressive. We're excited that people are going to find out how quiet this thing is.</p><p>"But also, some integration features like HDMI CC, being able to turn on your TV, turn off your TV… that's all hard to do, but more importantly you can turn on the machine from your controller, which is not something that's straightforward depending on the kind of PC you have… so, being able to sit down on your couch, press one button on your controller and the whole thing lights up like you would expect for a thing that's in your living room, I think that's very valuable.</p>
<p>"There's not really a price point to that, because it's not something that exists in the PC market right now."</p>
<p>Closing, Griffais said there will be those among us who are perfectly happy to build a PC from scratch themselves. However, Valve's Steam Machine will be a "nice baseline offering", letting users access "some features which are really hard to get to otherwise".</p>
<p>In the same conversation, Griffais added Valve may be open to develop a 'Steam Machine Pro' down the line, but "for now" it is staying focused on the Steam Machine's current level of spec, as it offers "a good trade-off between affordability and the level of power" it provides.</p>

<p>Valve's new Steam hardware will be released next year, though release dates are currently unknown. If you're hoping to get your hands on it all, know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-it-be-easy-to-buy-a-steam-machine-valve-confirms-its-continually-improving-how-it-distributes-hardware-ahead-of-the-release-of-its-new-hardware-launches">Valve will continue to self-distribute hardware just as it did with the Steam Deck</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile earlier this month, head of market analysis at video game industry analysis company Alinea Analytics Rhyss Elliott told our Connor that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/400-with-a-controller-this-would-really-send-a-message-one-analyst-on-how-valves-steam-machine-could-make-the-biggest-impact-on-the-games-industry">price point will be a real indicator of how the Steam Machine is perceived in the market</a>. "If the Steam Machine launches above $500, it risks being perceived as an expensive niche PC (like the rumoured next-generation Xbox) rather than an accessible living-room gaming option," Elliott said.</p>
<p>"The sweet spot would be $400 with a controller. This would really send a message, as console manufacturers have been raising their prices."</p>

            <p>Celebrated indie gem Blue Prince won't be getting a localisation or a direct sequel, as its creator wants all his projects "to be able to stand up on their own and be unique things".</p>
<p>At present, the game is only available in English, with no in-game language options. Yet while some players have criticised the game for this as it's virtually unplayable for non-English speakers, its developer has no plans for localisation.</p>
<p>Blue Prince developer Tonda Ros told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/blue-prince-goty-localization-sequel/">Polygon</a> there are "certainly no concrete plans because it is largely considered near impossible".</p>

</figure>
<p>The reason for that is because so many of the game's puzzles rely on wordplay, which cannot be easily translated.</p>
<p>That's not to say it isn't necessarily doable, mind you, but that it would take far too long to achieve.</p>
<p>"It's a tough decision to let Blue Prince be discoverable by more people, but potentially risk burning out myself and/or giving up making a whole other game," said Ros.</p>
<p>That sort of work would equate to "creating a second game," he added. Yet a direct sequel isn't planned either, though a follow-up of sorts could still happen.</p>
<p>"I want all my projects to be able to stand up on their own and be unique things," said Ros. "That's just the type of sequels that I like. I like Myst followed by Riven, not Myst 2."</p>
<p>As such, there "will not be a direct sequel to Blue Prince," added Ros. "There might be a game set in that universe, but I can't even say it likely will be in the same genre."</p>
<p>At the very least, though, "it would take as many risks as Blue Prince took."</p>
<p>"More than anything, Blue Prince seems aware of the time you're spending within it, and that's pure magic to me," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blue-prince-review">Eurogamer review of Blue Prince</a>.</p>
<p>"The richest aspect of the game's extremely rich design may be how many secrets it springs once you’ve lived with it for a while. It's the pleasure of finding hidden aspects to things you thought you understood in full, the pleasure of coming back to something you thought was simple and finding that it's not simple at all."</p>
