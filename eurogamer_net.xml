            <p>Switch strategy RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/triangle-strategy">Triangle Strategy</a> has been removed from the Nintendo eShop for unknown reasons.</p>
<p>Although the 2022 game is still available on Steam, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has confirmed via X/Twitter that for now, it is "temporarily unavailable" for Nintendo Switch. Players who have already purchased it, however, can still download it at their leisure .</p>

<p>Square Enix did not expand on why the game had been withdrawn from sale on the Nintendo eShop, nor give any indication of when it will return. </p>
<p>"Triangle Strategy is temporarily unavailable to purchase on Nintendo Switch eShop," wrote Square Enix. "Those who have already bought the game will be able to download it.</p> <div>

<p>"We are working on this and will update when the game is able to be purchased again."</p>
<p>A similar issue happened with Square Enix's RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> back in March. That too was temporarily delisted after it switched publisher between Nintendo and Square Enix.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Nintendo and will update as and when we find out more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/triangle-strategy-sells-800k-globally-in-two-weeks">Triangle Strategy sold 800k copies globally in its first two weeks</a>, 200k of which were sold in Japan and Asia alone.</p>
<p>In Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/triangle-strategy-review-an-enjoyably-complex-tale-of-a-battle-over-salt">Triangle Strategy review</a>, we said that "despite moving slowly in both its story and in combat, Triangle Strategy ultimately rewards your patience".

December brings a shiny new Mewtwo card to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>, if you're a subscriber to to the game's Premium Pass. 
</p>
<p>
The Pokémon TCG Pocket Premium pass costs £7.99 ($9.99) and allows you to open an extra card pack per day, as well as gain access to exclusive premium missions and rewards. 
</p>
<p>
The latest of these rewards are now live, as of 1st December - perhaps suggesting a monthly addition going forwards. Subscribers can simply log in to claim their Mewtwo promo, plus some cute Pikachu card accessories, anytime from now until 31st December.
</p>
<p>
For those who aren't subscribers, you're not missing a card that's going to change the game's meta. This is the same Mewtwo with the same stats and attack as in the game already, albeit with different card artwork. It looks snazzy, though.
</p>

<p>
Fancy a promo card but aren't a subscriber? Well, the game's ongoing Venusaur drop event is live now until 13th December. You'll need to participate in solo AI battles for a chance at promo cards including a special version of Venusaur that does look rather lovely indeed.
</p>

<p>
Of the two dozen promo cards currently in the game's files, only two remain unreleased. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-cards-joining-pokemon-tcg-pocket-leak-ahead-of-december-events">Promo versions of Bulbasaur and Magnemite are expected by fans to become available from a Wonder Pick event</a> beginning next week. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-new-booster-packs-available-before-end-of-year">Pokémon TCG Pocket will add the ability to trade cards</a> with other players at the start of 2025, its developer has confirmed. Before then, the game will also be refreshed with the launch of new booster packs due "by the end of the year".

            <p>Visions of Mana director Ryosuke Yoshida has departed NetEase to assume a new position with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement on X/Twitter, Yoshida thanked NetEase and his development team for their support, but confirmed he quit the Chinese megacorp at the end of October and will join Square Enix in December.</p>
<p>Whilst Yoshida had been employed at NetEase subsidiary Ouka Studios, Visions of Mana was published by Square Enix - the company he has now joined.</p>

<p>"On a personal note, I quit NetEase Ouka Studios on October 31st. We were a new studio, but we were able to release Visions of Mana. I am grateful to the development team and NetEase for their support," Yoshida wrote (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/Knoebelbroet/status/1863447158667514060">Knoebel</a>).</p>
<p>It was a very good experience. Thank you all. I am happy to announce that I joined Square Enix in December.</p>

<p>Yoshida stopped short of revealing what position he will take on at Square Enix, or what game or franchise he may be working on.</p>
<p>The news comes after Ouka Studios <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/visions-of-mana-developer-ouka-studios-reportedly-set-to-close-days-after-games-release">had "all but a handful of jobs" cut</a> by parent company NetEase.</p>
<p>Ouka Studios opened in 2020 and hired staff from the likes of Capcom and Bandai Namco.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-will-pause-operations-at-fresh-aaa-game-studio-while-seeking-new-partner">NetEase told Eurogamer it remained committed to "a strong global presence"</a> despite pulling funding from Worlds Untold, the studio founded by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> veteran Mac Walters, and just days after fellow <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-director-casey-hudsons-aaa-sci-fi-game-cancelled-studio-closing">BioWare veteran Casey Hudson announced the closure of his own new studio</a> due to similar funding issues.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
