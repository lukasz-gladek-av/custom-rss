            <p>Itch.io - the digital distribution platform known for its focus on independent game developers and other artists - is today re-indexing adult NSFW (Not Suitable For Work) content that is available for free.</p>
<p>In addition, it is currently in discussions with payment processors who are comfortable with adult material, and will be reintroducing paid content "slowly" to ensure it can "confidently support the widest range of creators in the long term".</p>
<p>Itch.io noted that payment processor Stripe has said it will not support adult content that has been "designed for sexual gratification".</p>

<p>In a statement shared with Itch.io, Stripe said:</p>
<p>"Stripe is currently unable to support sexually explicit content due to restrictions placed on them by their banking partners, despite card networks generally supporting adult content (with the appropriate registrations). Stripe has indicated that they hope to be able to support adult content in the future."</p>
<p>In the meantime, Itch.io said those who wish to have their pages eligible for today's re-indexing process must ensure they have the "no payments" option checked.</p>
<p>The platform is also putting a new content warning system in place for pages tagged as being NSFW. It states this refers to pages that have the "contains sensitive material" option checked, as well as tags that suggest the project includes adult content such as "porn" and "fetish".</p>
<p>Itch.io said anyone wanting to be eligible for re-indexing is "required to complete this". The platform added the feature is not quite ready as yet, but those who had their pages previously indexed will be given enough time to complete all the necessary processes "to avoid going in and out of indexing".</p>
<p>You <a href="https://itch.io/t/5149036/reindexing-adult-nsfw-content">can find further information on the platform's re-indexing efforts via Itch.io</a>.</p>
<p>Today's update from Itch.io follows last week's news that the platform had "deindexed" all NSFW content following discussions with payment processors contacted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-approached-payment-processors-because-steam-did-not-respond-australian-pressure-group-collective-shout-claims-responsibility-for-steam-and-itchio-nsfw-game-removal">the same Australian pressure group that recently targeted Steam</a>.</p>
<p>In June, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/itchio-deindexes-all-nsfw-games-blames-same-anti-porn-group-that-campaigned-against-steam">itch.io creators began reporting their NSFW games were no longer being displayed in search results on the platform</a>. At this time, platform founder Leaf Corcoran said: "We are truly sorry for the frustration and confusion caused by this change."</p>
<p>Itch.io's movement followed on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-introduces-vague-new-rules-banning-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-to-appease-credit-card-companies">Valve "retiring" unspecified NSFW titles and introducing vague new rules banning "certain kinds of adult content" from its own PC storefront</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/itch-begins-re-indexing-free-adult-nsfw-content-as-it-seeks-alternative-payment-processors]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Mafia: The Old Country players on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X will be able to choose between Quality and Performance visual modes when the game launches in a week's time.</p>
<p>Those who prefer a higher resolution should plump for Quality Mode, while those who would rather prioritise framerate should go for Performance Mode. <a href="https://x.com/mafiagame/status/1951012716409397433">The studio</a> said Mafia: The Old Country will run at an "average" of 60fps when played in Performance Mode. The studio's statement does not include Xbox Series S, which will presumably run at a lower framerate.</p>
<p>In addition, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hangar13">Hangar 13</a> has confirmed the PC requirements from Minimum (suitable for older hardware) to Epic ("If you've got a powerful-enough PC, these Epic specs will give you the absolute best visual fidelity for Mafia: The Old Country's rendition of 1900s Sicily").</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> team has asked its community to stop directly blaming or criticising the artist who created cards for its mobile trading game using "incorrect reference materials", which turned out to be unofficial fan art.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, it came to light that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-developer-apologises-deeply-after-players-discover-key-artwork-for-its-new-set-was-based-on-fan-drawing">fan artwork had been inadvertently used as a reference to create cards for Pokémon TCG Pocket's Wisdom of Sea and Sky expansion</a>. At this time, the developer acknowledged it had "provided incorrect reference materials as official documents" to the artist who was commissioned to create the cards in question. However, it never explicitly stated how the materials were provided, and in the time since many were still directing the blame towards the illustrator themself for copying the fan art.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Now, Pokémon TCG Pocket's publisher The Pokémon Company together with developer Creatures Inc have issued a new statement, affirming the blame does not lie with the illustrator but with them.</p>
<p>"Regarding the previously announced issue with the Ho-Oh EX (3-star) and Lugia EX (3-star) illustrations – it has come to our attention that there is criticism towards the cards' illustrator circulating online," the statement, which was shared via the official Japanese X account of Pokémon TCG Pocket, reads (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/the-pokemon-company-claims-full-responsibility-for-tcg-pocket-card-plagiarism-issue-asks-fans-not-to-criticize-artist/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>"The illustration errors were caused by the production teams of The Pokémon Company and Creatures Inc, who provided incorrect materials as official documents to the illustrator, and we intend to take full responsibility for it."</p>
<p>The companies explained there are two workflows when it comes to creating cards for Pokémon TCG Pocket - either illustrators have creative control over the card designs, which is the most common practice, or the game's production team create a 'blueprint' of what it requires for a card. A commissioned illustrator then tweaks and finalises the concept before it is added into the game, and it would appear that this is what happened with the production of the since-removed Ho-oh and Lugia cards.</p> <div>

<p>The Pokémon Company and Creatures Inc have asked the community to stop blaming and criticising the illustrator for what they admit is their error, and said they will enforce stricter measures going forward, to ensure this kind of mix up does not happen again.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the affected cards have been replaced with placeholders cards which read "New Artwork Coming Soon" in lieu of a creature (see below).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Earlier this year, Black Flag actor Matt Ryan suggested Ubisoft was set to release a remake of its piratical Assassin's Creed entry, and it now sounds like the developer wasn't exactly thrilled about that.</p>
<p>Ryan portrayed Edward Kenway in Assassin's Creed Black Flag, which came out in 2013. It soon became a series favourite for many, and in recent times rumours of a remake have been making the rounds.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>These rumours were amplified again in June, when Ryan hinted not very subtly to one fan they should perhaps get ready to replay the game, implying with a bit of a 'wink, wink, nudge, nudge' that the remake was indeed real.</p>
<p>"Have you beaten [Black Flag]?" Ryan asked a fan in a clip that was shared around social media (see below). The fan confirmed they had but some time ago, to which Ryan followed up with: "Well, you might have to beat it again…"</p>
<p>When the fan suggested maybe playing through all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-games-order">Assassin's Creed games</a>, Ryan replied: "Well, especially this one… There's a reason I say that, but I can't say anything." </p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Edward Kenway's voice actor, Matt Ryan, said this during a fan interaction. It looks like he hinted at the Assassin's Creed Black Flag Remake. 🔥</p><p>🟢 Quote:<br>“Have you beat the game?… well you may have to beat it again”<br>And <br>“There’s a reason I say that but I can’t say… <a href="https://t.co/n3PwF8Q7Ri">pic.twitter.com/n3PwF8Q7Ri</a></p></div>— Zephryss⛩️ (@TheRealZephryss) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealZephryss/status/1939392046151926243?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Anyway, fast forward to today, and it turns out not only was Ubisoft unhappy that Ryan had been a little loose-lipped, but the company actually also threatened him with legal action.</p>
<p>At another more recent convention, the Edward Kenway actor was asked about a Black Flag remake or remaster, to which he replied with a casual shrug and a "I don't know, mate". The questioner then pressed Ryan further, calling back to the previous video from June, when the actor then explained:</p>
<p>"Well, the thing is, that when that happened, someone was doing this [gestures towards the person filming the exchange], and I was being very free and open, but I didn't know that they actually were recording me on their phone.</p>
<p>"And then the company threatened to sue me. So [now] I say nothing." A video of the exchange was uploaded to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kylo_hd659/video/7532502046889528598">TikTok</a> but has since been removed. A copy is embedded below:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Damn so it seems like Matt Ryan (voice actor for Edward Kenway) got into deep trouble with Ubisoft for hinting at the Black Flag Remake to that other guy..</p><p>He didn’t realize he was being recorded😵 <a href="https://t.co/2Vy8g6pMRr">pic.twitter.com/2Vy8g6pMRr</a></p></div>— The Hidden One (@TheHiddenOneAC) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheHiddenOneAC/status/1950940394310545618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Ubisoft for further comment on Ryan's Black Flag-flavoured exchanges, and will update you if we hear anything more.</p>
<p>Word of a Black Flag remake first began circulating in 2023, when it was said that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a> studio Ubisoft Singapore was "heavily involved". Of course, Skull and Bones - which sadly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skull-and-bones-metacritic-user-reviews-open-to-generally-unfavourable-scores">failed to really get any decent wind in its sails following its launch last year</a> - began life as a spin-off from Black Flag.</p>
<p>At the time of this initial rumour, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-reportedly-remaking-rollicking-pirate-adventure-assassins-creed-black-flag">project was not expected to be completed for "at least a few years"</a>, though given we are now marching firmly into the latter half of 2025, a 'few years' is actually coming up <em>relatively </em>soon now. Stay tuned!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-threatened-with-legal-action-following-remake-slip-up]]></content:encoded>
