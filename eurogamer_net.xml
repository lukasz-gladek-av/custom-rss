            <p>Just days after Sony decided to close remake masters Bluepoint Games, a new report claims that wasn't PlayStation itself that stonewalled the idea of a Bloodborne remake by Bluepoint, but developer FromSoftware.</p>
<p>Despite calling Bluepoint Games "an incredibly talented team" full of "technical expertise" which has "delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-closes-acclaimed-demons-souls-and-shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-studio-bluepoint-despite-acknowledging-it-had-delivered-exceptional-experiences-for-the-playstation-community">Sony shut down the studio last week</a>, impacting around 70 employees. At the time, a spokesperson said the decision was made "following a recent business review".</p>

<p>Sony - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buys-demons-souls-remake-developer-bluepoint-games">which acquired Bluepoint in 2021</a> - put the studio to work on a live-service God of War game, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">project it ultimately cancelled last year</a>, after Bluepoint released Demon's Souls as a launch exclusive for the PS5 in 2020. It was always hoped that Bluepoint would, at some point, be instructed to do the same for Bloodborne.</p><p>Now, a new report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-27/sony-s-bluepoint-pitched-bloodborne-remake-before-closure">Bloomberg</a> claims that Bluepoint did, in fact, approach FromSoft in early 2025, pitching a remake of the 2015 game. It's said that "the studio was told that the numbers made sense, but FromSoftware didn't want it to happen".</p>
<p>Interestingly, former president of Sony Interactive Entertainment <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-hasnt-playstation-done-anything-new-with-bloodborne-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-theory">Shuhei Yoshida posited the same this time last year</a>, saying: "Bloodborne is one of the most popular asks on my Twitter/X. And the people wonder why we haven't really done anything... it should be easy, right?</p>
<p>"Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, what he created. So I think he is interested but he's so successful and he's so busy, so he cannot do it himself, and he doesn't want anyone else to touch it."</p>
<p>After this rejection, Bluepoint allegedly pitched a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> remake to Sony, as well as a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> spin-off, but these ideas were also turned down, with Bloomberg suggesting that other studios were "concerned about dedicating significant resources to another team's project".</p><p>Bloodborne has long been considered one of the greatest games ever made. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloodborne-review">We gave it an Essential, writing</a>: " it will be a painfully long time until I play anything else that matches up to Bloodborne's breadth of vision, generosity of content, and - yes - genius".</p>
