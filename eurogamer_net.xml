            <p>
I suspect I might be in a minority here, but I can confidently say I didn't use a single repair kit as I bumbled and faffed my way through MachineGames' excellent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> late last year - mainly because I was so enamoured by the game's ludicrous clobbering loop I couldn't take two steps forward without hoovering up another handful of melee-focused bric-a-brac. So I very much appreciate that Indy's latest update finally gives my never-diminishing stash of repair kits a purpose by letting me lob them at foes.
</p>
<p>
Besides that, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's Update 4 comes with a heap of tweaks and changes designed to further enhance its already excellent action, starting with two new Adventure Books that'll provide Indy with some additional whip-focused benefits. Open Season, for instance, creates a temporary window after whipping enemies in which they'll take increased damage from subsequent attacks. And with Sleight of Hand, Indy can pull an enemy's weapon towards him after disarming them with the whip.
</p>
<p>
That brings us to Update 4's dozen or so quality of life improvements. These include new one-liners for Indy during fights, meaning you'll get a bit of extra vocal variety while punching Nazis and other miscreants. And Machine Games says Ray-traced Global Illumination has also been improved across all platforms "at no performance cost".

<p>
Elsewhere, there's now a timer around Indy's health showing how long you'll need to wait until enemies call off a search, and a number of UI elements and effects - specifically the HUD's centre dot and "stealth" vignette while crouching - can now be toggled on or off. Additionally, the journal has seen some improvements while in its somewhat fiddly "lowered" state; you can see more of it, for starters, and it's now possible to switch between local and level maps.
</p>
<p>
Moving on, there's a new "Always Allow Skipping Cutscenes" option if you have absolutely no patience for cinematic chatter; there are a couple off new tutorials; the menu for purchasing Adventure Books and map information booklets has been improved; the PC version now supports the PlayStation DualSense Wireless Controller for advanced haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, and PlayStation or Steam Deck controllers will now show up in the controller configuration menu on PC. And for more on Update 4's lengthy list of bug fixes, you'll be <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/7gQFCUktT0FwdnHFlcZVOV/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-4?linkId=100000356791847">wanting to check out MachineGames' patch notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's fourth major update is now live on PC and Xbox, and it seems reasonable to expect all its additions and improvements will feature in the PlayStation 5 release when it launches next Thursday, 17th April. And it is, of course, well worth picking up. "Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones," we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">wrote in our five star review</a>, "The Great Circle is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames" - and that was before we went on to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-eurogamers-game-of-2024">name it Eurogamer's game of the year in 2024</a>.

            <p>
If you thought Nintendo was the master of re-releases, then <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> might just be gunning for its title. The studio has announced yet another release for The Last of Us - but this time it's returning in the form of a two-game Complete edition.
</p>
<p>
Hints that Sony and Naughty Dog might be preparing another The Last of Us release first surfaced back in March, when it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-reportedly-getting-mysterious-new-physical-ps5-special-edition">reported a mysterious new PlayStation 5 special edition was on the way</a>. Little was known about it at the time, beyond the fact it was supposedly getting a physical edition, but all has now been revealed.
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us Complete, as its name suggests, bundles together the PS5 versions of The Last of Us Part 1 and The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, which initially released in 2022 and 2024 respectively. It'll be available in two forms; a digital edition, which is live on the PlayStation Store right now, and a special physical Collector's Edition, which arrives on 10th July.

<p>
The Last of Us Complete's digital release features exactly the same content as you'd get if you brought both games separately, but it does provide a bit of saving. It's <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-PPSA29488_00-0000000000000000">priced at £94.99 on the PlayStation Store</a>, making a purchase £19.99 cheaper than buying Part 1 and Part 2 individually.
</p>
<p>
As for the Collector's Edition, it's exclusive to PlayStation's online store. It comes in a steelbook case with separate discs for Part 1 and Part 2, and also includes the Left Behind prequel chapter, The Last of Us: American Dreams Comics #1-4 with new cover art, a set of four lithographic art prints, and a Thank You letter from Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann - which I'm assuming isn't going to be handwritten. It costs £109.99/$109.99 USD, and <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/buy-games/the-last-of-us-complete-collectors-edition-ps5">pre-orders are open now</a>.
</p>
<p>
But will Naughty Dog's latest The Last of Us release <em>actually</em> end up being the "complete" edition. Druckmann has sent mixed messages about the likelihood of a third series instalment over the last few years, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-3-could-be-one-more-chapter-to-this-story-says-co-creator-druckmann">telling fans "there's probably one more chapter to this story" back in 2024</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-boss-says-dont-bet-on-there-being-a-the-last-of-us-part-3">reversing course this March</a> and warning, "Don't bet on there being more."
</p>
<p>
There is, though, <em>sort of</em> new The Last of Us on the way, courtesy of HBO's live-action TV adaptation. Season 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">begins airing</a> this Sunday, 13th April (14th April in the UK), and looks like it'll be substantially expanding on the events of the second game. We already know some new characters are being introduced for Season 2 - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-who-catherine-ohara-will-play-in-the-last-of-us-marking-a-significant-change-from-the-games">Catherine O'Hara's Gale</a> - and given showrunner Craig Mazin is predicting the series will run to four season, there's plenty of space to chart routes previously unseen. Especially as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-show-renewed-for-season-three-and-the-second-hasnt-even-aired-yet">Season 3 is already confirmed</a>.
