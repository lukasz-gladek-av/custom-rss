            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/papers-please-creator-lucas-pope-has-made-a-free-game-watch-style-haunted-house-caper-for-halloween<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
'Tis the night for ghosties and ghoulies and hiding with the lights off because you suddenly remembered you forgot to buy sweets for trick-or-treaters this Halloween (oops!). And what better way to celebrate the occasion than with a free Game &amp; Watch-style haunted house caper from Papers, Please and Obra Dinn creator Lucas Pope?
</p>
<p>
The wonderfully titled Moida Mansion is <a href="https://dukope.itch.io/moida-mansion">available to play right now on itch.io</a>, challenging players to slip into the titular spookhouse and find their fellow Adventure Club members - who've all been trapped after following their mascot turtle inside. "Now it's up to you," reads the gloriously retro-styled manual. "Sneak in and rescue them before it's too late!"
</p>
<p>
In gameplay terms, Moida Mansion is a relatively simple thing, tasking players with moving from room to room and cycling through the objects within to search each one. Searching might locate one of your Adventure Club pals, or it might reveal a secret passageway, or even a handy key. Or all that rummaging might attract the attention of the mansion's "monsta", in which case you'll either need to sneak or - if you cause a ruckus while it's nearby - run away.

<p>
For all its simplicity, though, Moida Mansion is oddly compelling, and I've just merrily spend the last 20 minutes dodging monsta and scouring the house to uncover its secrets. It's also surprisingly atmospheric (and just a little bit tense) for a game with rudimentary LCD-style visuals, virtually zero animation, and minimal sound. What's more, Pope builds an impressive amount of variety from a relatively limited number of visual elements - and better yet, the mansion changes each game. I would buy this thing immediately if it was real!
</p><p>
This isn't Pope's first Game &amp; Watch style effort, of course; the acclaimed designer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/papers-please-gets-game-watch-style-demake-to-celebrate-10th-anniversary">created a free demake</a> of Papers, Please last year, in celebration of the dystopian document thriller's 10th anniversary. More recently, he released his Playdate-exclusive puzzler Mars After Midnight - a "lovely, silly game about community", as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lucas-popes-new-playdate-puzzler-is-a-lovely-silly-game-about-community">Christian Donlan put it</a> back in March.

Fireproof Games, the studio behind the acclaimed puzzle-adventure series The Room, has announced its first new title since 2021's The Room 4: Old Sins. It's a spooky, single-player VR puzzle-adventure called Ghost Town, and it's heading to PC, PSVR2, and Quest 2/3 next year.
</p>
<p>
Ghost Town unfolds in the London of 1983, charting the adventures of with turned ghost hunter Edith Penrose. "Life has been going well for Edith," Fireproof explains in its announcement. "The paranormal detective agency she runs with her flatmate has never been busier, she's almost up-to-date with her rent and the ghosts in her bathroom mirror have been less demanding than usual. But Edith's world is turned upside down when her brother goes missing and a mysterious new lead promises to reveal clues of his whereabouts."
</p>
<p>
Edith's journey first takes her to a remote Scottish island in search of a gifted clairvoyant, but Fireproof isn't saying much more about its story just yet. It does, however, share a few details on how Ghost Town will unfold in VR as players explore its world of "large navigable environments" and deal with fully motion-captured characters, both living and dead.

<p>
"Explore a variety of atmospheric locations with a controller in each hand and a torch to light your way," it explains. "Use the dexterity of your hands to overcome tactile puzzles, cast spells and even summon troubled spirits to move them on to the next world."
</p><p>
And that's about everything Fireproof is willing to say right now. Ghost Town will initially launch for <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/ghost-town/9531494193591052/">Meta Quest 2/3</a> in "spring" next year, with a <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10010082">PSVR2</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2496180/Ghost_Town/">Steam VR</a> release set to follow in the summer. Fireproof's wonderfully macabre The Room series has been a consistent delight over its numerous instalments (including 2020's excellent VR outing The Dark Matter) since launching over a decade ago, so Ghost Town's going straight on my wishlist.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged">Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged</a>, the newly remastered edition of developer Revolution Software's classic point-and-click puzzle adventure, finally has a Switch release date following its recent delay, and will launch next Thursday, 7th November.
</p>
<p>
Shadow of the Templars first released in 1996 (a Director's Cut remaster arrived in 2009), charting the adventures of American tourist George Stobbart - later with assistance from photo-journalist Nicole Collard - as he becomes embroiled in a global conspiracy after witnessing a bombing on the streets of Paris, perpetrated by a man dressed as a clown. It deftly weaves historical fact and fiction into a thoroughly engrossing, occasionally thrilling whole that quickly earned it fans, and it's been considered a classic of the point-and-click genre ever since.
</p>
<p>
Revolution Software's Reforged edition of the game launched for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation back in September, introducing a variety of upgrades, including "beautiful" re-drawn 4K backgrounds, re-animated sprites, enhanced audio, and other quality of life improvements. Its Switch release, however, got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged-delayed-on-nintendo-switch">last-minute delay</a> in order to "ensure the quality of play remains equally high across all versions of the game".

<p>
Six weeks later, and Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged finally has a release date of 7th November on Switch's eShop, where it'll cost £24.99/€29.99/$29.99. In a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/revolution-software/broken-sword-reforged-collectors-edition/posts/4238562">message shared on Kickstarter</a>, Revolution noted the Switch version will include all fixes and enhancements made to the PC version since launch, with other Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PS5 set to receive them "very soon".
</p><p>
As for what's next, a sixth game in the Broken Sword series, Parzival's Stone, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/broken-sword-parzivals-stone-is-a-new-entry-in-the-classic-point-and-click-adventure-series">announced last year</a>. It sees George and Nico caught up in a terrifying conspiracy featuring Nazi treasure hunters, brutal mediaeval histories, and Quantum Physics, where ruthless technology entrepreneurs, corrupt government agencies, and billion-dollar global energy corporations are battling for possession of a manuscript pointing to the secret location of the mythical thousand-year-old Grail - just perhaps not the one we're used to hearing about. Parzival's Stone was originally due to launch in 2024, but was delayed to an unspecified future point earlier this year.
