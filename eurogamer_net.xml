            <p>The Forsaken Hollows, the forthcoming DLC for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> spin-off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a>, is "definitely a little bit harder" than the main game, its director has admitted.</p>
<p>That's par for the course at this point. FromSoftware is notorious for releasing DLC that expands on its games with an even higher level of challenge.</p>
<p>Still, director Junya Ishizaki has discussed the difficulties of balancing the game for both casual players and experts, based on player feedback.</p>

<p>"The main takeaway we had post-release was just there was a lot of trouble trying to get the balancing right," Ishizaki told <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-forsaken-hollows-dlc-has-reignited-my-interest/1100-6536543/">Gamespot</a>.</p>
<p>"I think balancing is just so subjective, so a lot of our thoughts post-release working up to the DLC were how can we get the balancing in mind with what we were initially envisioning, and also with that balancing set, how can we take a different approach and devise new enemies, new characters, and stuff like that to play into that and utilise the new balancing that we are working with."</p><p>The studio didn't want the game to be "so hard that new players can't get into it" but even veterans required time to figure out the intricacies of Nightreign. "So whenever people who have played the main game extensively go into the DLC content, they'll be able to have a bit of that feeling like they had when they first played Nightreign, where there's still a bit that they're trying to figure out," said Ishizaki.</p>
<p>The Forsaken Hollows is "definitely a little bit harder," he admitted, "but it's not ridiculous or anything like that, but that's still within what we would consider to be a fair challenge."</p>
<p>Perhaps the most infamous DLC for its difficulty was Elden Ring's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, with the final boss in particular imposing a massive challenge.</p>
<p>Ishizaki also discussed the influence of that DLC on The Forsaken Hollows, even if it's not directly intentional. For instance, the new Shifting Earth event has more verticality than previous events, just as Shadow of the Erdtree was more vertical than Elden Ring.</p><p>"[The] idea behind that was that the original map was definitely very horizontally-focused, and when looking at that through the lens of working on DLC, we were thinking where else [was there] to go but up, right?" said Ishizaki. "We can add verticality to this and do it in a way that doesn't detract from the horizontal aspect of the map. So that was where that came from; trying to figure out how we can add to it in such a way that it expands upon the verticality.</p>
<p>"It's one of those things [where] a lot of our staff have also been playing Shadow of the Erdtree as the development for Nightreign has been going on. So there's probably a little bit of influence there, but I don't think [Erdtree's influence is] necessarily intentional. It might even be almost like subconscious, but there's definitely, I think, a bit of that for sure."</p>

<p>The Forsaken Hollows also adds new poison swamp areas, which are surprisingly missing from the base game.</p>
<p>"We're definitely aware of the [swamp] meme," said Ishizaki. "It's not like there's a rule or any sort of policy here where it's like we have to have a swamp in there, but it always seems to be [that before you realise] someone's come up with the idea, it's already sort of in there, and it's just sort of taken a life of its own."</p>
<p>The Forsaken Hollows launches this week on 4th December, adding two new Nightfarers to play as - the Scholar and the Undertaker - along with other additions, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-will-see-an-iconic-dark-souls-boss-return">return of an iconic Dark Souls boss</a>.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> is certainly a busy guy. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> might be out the way, but the famed game designer still has his plate full with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">Xbox horror OD</a>, and beyond that, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-metal-gear-like-physint-is-still-so-early-in-development-hes-currently-working-on-it-all-by-myself">Metal Gear spiritual successor Physint</a>. Then there's his spirited social media presence, his regular phone calls with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>, and now it, turns out, a swerve into Disney voice acting as he takes on the role of a mole.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Kojima has been cast as Paul Moldebrandt in the Japanese dub of Disney's Zootropolis 2, taking over from Josh Gad (Frozen's Olaf), who plays the character in the west. And if you're wondering how Kojima got involved, Famitsu <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/59427">reports</a> he was directly asked to play Zootopia Police Department's mole role by the movie's director, Jared Bush.

</p>
<figcaption>Here's the latest teaser for Kojima's OD.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHCqxLtwy5g" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Speaking to Famitsu (via Google Translate), Kojima said he accepted the role "without hesitation" after being approached, noting that while he's had "experience with cameos in live-action films and games" Zootopia 2 marks his first time dubbing an animated feature film, "and it's from Disney, of all places!"
</p><p>
Describing the original Zootopia as his "favourite film", he explained he "only took part in a small scene [for the sequel], but even at the time of recording, the level of detail was impressive." And while the recording process "went smoothly", Kojima noted he "learned a lot from the experience of actually acting. It made me realise how much attention voice actors pay to basic things like turning the pages of the script and noise".
</p>
<p>
Kojima, of course, has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-ponders-advancing-age-and-how-long-he-can-stay-creative-as-death-stranding-studio-enters-crunch">pondering his advancing years in recent times</a>, noting back in January that he "can't help but think" about how much longer he'll be able to stay creative. "I want to keep going for the rest of my life," he added, "but is it 10 more years? 20? Every day feels like I'm racing against the clock." But those concerns don't appear to be slowing him down; currently in the works is Xbox-exclusive horror OD, which he's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-marmite-hideo-kojima-says-you-will-either-love-or-hate-od">previously described</a> as "something totally different" and people are going to either "love it or hate it".

            <p>Another Mega Evolution has been revealed ahead of the Mega Dimension DLC for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, this time for a fan-favourite 'mon.</p>
<p>What's more, a classic Legendary will also be making an appearance.</p>
<p>To recap, the DLC will be released on 10th December and expands the story due to spatial distortions across Lumiose City, which appear to be resulting in more Mega Evolutions - superpowered versions of Pokémon.</p>

<p>Mega Lucario Z has now been announced as part of the DLC, with the fighting/steel type sporting a new fringe and colour scheme.</p>
<p>Now, Lucario already has a Mega Evolution in Z-A, but the DLC will include this new Mega Lucario Z variant. Z Mega Evolutions require less time to initiate moves but use much more power, so are better suited to quick battles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the iconic Mewtwo will also be making an appearance in Pokémon Legends: Z-A. The game now has an extra side mission available, where players will receive a Mewtwonite X stone and Mewtwonite Y stone as mystery gifts.</p>
