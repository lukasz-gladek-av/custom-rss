<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is not having a particularly good time of it over on Steam; thanks to ongoing performance issues and a perceived lack of meaningful content updates, players numbers are routinely dipping below those of the now seven-year-old Monster Hunter World, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">recent reviews have tipped the game into Overwhelmingly Negative territory</a>. Amid all this, Capcom has now outlined Monster Hunter Wilds' next free Title Update, but whether it'll do enough to shift player sentiment remains to be seen.
</p>
<p>
Monster Hunter Wilds' free Title Update 2 officially launches next Monday, 30th June, bringing with it two much-loved monsters from previous games. You've got the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-first-major-content-update-detailed-ahead-of-next-weeks-release">heavily teased return</a> of Monster Hunter 3's serpentine leviathan Lagiacrus, for starters, alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-4-ultimate">Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate</a>'s spiny aerial nuisance Seregios, last seen in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>'s Sunbreak expansion. For some reason, Seregios immediately brings back memories of chef outfits, but it's entirely possible that's just delirium setting in.
</p>
<p>
Both beasts show off their Wilds' reimaginings in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAf4Z4rCpK4">Capcom's newly revealed Title Update 2 trailer</a>, and Lagiacrus fans may be pleased to know it returns with its underwater combat segments intact, kind of. Capcom describes the underwater portions of Lagiacrus' fight as "accents" (the majority of the battle plays out on land), and while players can't freely swing their weapons while submerged, there <em>are</em> some special actions they can do to add a bit of pizzazz to the encounter. To which I say, Capcom, bring back swimming properly, you cowards.

<p>
Lagiacrus and Seregios feature their own armour and weapons to craft, and they'll appear as 8-star tempered monsters once unlocked. Title Update 2 also promises one additional monster - an arch-tempered version of the delightfully billowy Uth Duna - who'll appear as a limited-time event quest for players at HR50 or above, between 30th July and 20th august.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, the update promises several new features. There's new layered weapons, new functionality for photo mode - including brightness settings, new filter effects, and the ability to hide specific characters - plus the option to swap handlers, replacing Alma with Erik. Players can also select which support hunters they want to take out on quests, including new support hunter Mina, a Vespae Unit veteran who's armed with a sword and shield.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, there's talk of new events quests enabling players to forge special armour, a new challenge quest featuring Mizutsune, plus that arch-tempered Uth Duna challenge quest. And from 23rd July to 6th August, players can participate in the latest Festival of Accord seasonal event, Flamefete, which brings a range of summer-inspired rewards.
</p>
<p>
And that all leads up to perhaps the weirdest bit of Capcom's latest showcase: a collaboration event with guitar maker Fender (thre's apparently a real-life Monster Hunter guitar in Japan) running from 27th August to 24th September. This gives hunters a chance to unlock the brilliant/ludicrous Fender gesture, enabling them to rock out and play one of the classic Monster Hunter themes while their Palico pal air guitars merrily alongside them.
</p>
<p>
Will that be enough to placate players increasingly frustrated with Capcom's approach to Monster Hunter Wilds? It remains to be seen, but the publisher has at least confirmed a third Title Update - featuring an additional monster and a new seasonal event - arrives this autumn. "I think Capcom has what it takes to turn the fortunes of Monster Hunter Wilds around," Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">Dom Peppiatt wrote recently</a>. "It took seven patches for the publisher to figure out the issues with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-guides-tips-tricks-9422">Dragon's Dogma 2</a> back in 2024, and I'm just hoping Capcom can work that same engineering magic with Monster Hunter Wilds before it's too late."

            <p>
Daft but brilliant curation sim Two Point Museum is grabbing its D20s and venturing into the world of medieval fantasy for its first paid DLC release, which promises magical exhibits (and ensuing curses for unsuspecting guests), RPG-inspired expeditions, and more this July.
</p>
<p>
Fantasy Finds, as developer Two Point Studios is calling its DLC, introduces a total of 40 mysterious and magically inclined exhibits. You've got your Flying Carpet, your Teanie Kettle, your Novel Wardrobe, and more, all granting beneficial blessings to guests. Unless, that is, you fail to keep them well-maintained - in which case you'll be dealing with cursed patrons instead.
</p>
<p>
As in the base game, all these curios are acquired out on expeditions, which is where Fantasy Finds' RPG-style twist comes in. In order to track down or maintain the DLC's new exhibits, you'll need to hire new Fantasy Experts. These come in a range of familiar classes - barbarian, wizard, rogue, and bard - each with their own stats. "Does your team have enough combined Strength and Dexterity to counter a dragon attack?", Two Points Studios teases. "Perhaps you need the right combination of Intelligence and Luck to overcome a Picked Lock shortcut."

<p>
Fantasy Finds also includes three new guest archetypes, 26 decorations and utility items, a new medieval-themed paint job for your expedition chopper, Mythical Gear buffs for staff, plus new interactive displays, banners, wallpapers, floors, and more. All this arrives for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on 17th July, and while there's no word of a price yet, a week-long 10 percent launch discount is confirmed. And if you haven't played Two Point Museum yet (which you should if you're a management sim fan, because it's great and easily the best entry in the series so far) you can currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2185060/Two_Point_Museum/">pick it up with 20 percent off as part of the Steam Summer Sale</a>.

"Come for the clowns and cavemen," Eurogamer contributing editor Christian Donlan wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-point-museum-review">four star review of Two Point Museum</a>, "stay for the zombie capitalism."
