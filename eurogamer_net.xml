            <p>Sony president Hideaki Nishino has stated the company is open to adjusting the price of PlayStation Plus in the future, as the company aims to "maximise profitability".</p>
<p>The comments come as <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/movie/index.html">part of a discussion</a> between Sony CEO Hermen Hulst and president Hideaki Nishino on PS Plus and the company's future. Discussing Sony's subscription service, Nishino stated: "We will continue to add more value and adjust our pricing strategy in a dynamic way to maximise profitability."</p>

<p>This statement, while not an indication that a price increase is necessarily on the cards, is essentially stating Sony will ensure the service will prioritise profitability going forward. Indeed it's a statement Sony has been aligned with for some time, given the spread of price increases PS Plus has received over the years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-price-hike-announced-for-europe">There was a European price hike back in 2017</a>, and as recently as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-12-month-subscriptions-getting-global-price-increase-from-september">2023 PS Plus saw a global price increase</a>, which Sony justified by stating it could "continue bringing high-quality games and value-added benefits to your PS Plus subscription service" as a result.</p>
<p>In the accompanying presentation, Hideaki noted some key shifts in PS Plus profitability over recent years. In 2024, 22 percent of PS Plus subscribers were paying for the most expensive PS Plus Premium, compared to 17 percent back in 2022.</p>
<p>PS Plus Extra, the next in terms of price-per-month, also saw an increase in subscribers, rising to 16 percent of subscribers compared with 13 percent back in 2022. In addition, in 2024 PS Plus made up 14 percent of total PlayStation revenue, an increase of only one percent from 2022.</p>
<p>What we can glean from these statistics is that while overall growth for PS Plus as a service remains slow, those who are subscribed are gradually forking out the cash for the pricier tiers.</p>
<p>Whether this is due to these subscribers increasingly believing the increased price point is worth it for the selection of games provided, a shift in attitude in favour of subscription services like PS Plus and Xbox Game Pass, or some alternative cause remains an interesting point of discussion.</p>
<p>A few years ago, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shuhei-yoshida-says-playstation-plus-should-be-used-to-manage-the-lifecycle-of-a-game">former head of PlayStation Shuhei Yoshida stated that services like PS Plus should be used to extend the life cycle of games</a>, and that the company still believed in premium games getting a standard release at launch. Maybe this approach has resulted in growth for PS Plus over the years?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Remedy already has two major updates for its Control multiplayer spin-off FBC: Firebreak planned for this year, with more to hopefully follow.</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak is set to release later this month, on 17th June. It will throw players back into the halls of Control's mysterious Federal Bureau of Control, letting them revisit a number of familiar locations from that game but with a fresh multiplayer twist.</p>

<p>Following its initial launch, the studio will then release a major update this autumn. This will include a new Job, codenamed Outbreak, and a new Jobsite: the Research Sector. Players will also find new gameplay systems and enemies, new free earnable rewards, and new (paid) Classified Requisitions. These will include unique armor sets, sprays, skins, and character voice packs.</p>
<p>Winter will then bring in a second major update. Again, this will add a new Job to FBC: Firebreak, with this one codenamed Blackout. There will also be a new Jobsite, but for now where that is located is a mystery. Along with the new Job and Jobsite, this update will also add new equipment and enemies, new free earnable rewards and new (paid) Classified Requisitions, including unique armor sets, sprays, skins, and character voice packs.</p>
<p>Writing on social media, <a href="https://x.com/RiotRMD/status/1933057792631259491">Remedy's communications director Thomas Puha</a> said the team also has plans afoot for 2026, but the team wants to "launch the game first, see what the reception is and what the community wants to see, what you might gravitate to before we make more decisions on what kind of content we'll be releasing".</p>

<p>Our Chris went hands-on with FBC: Firebreak earlier this year, when he called it a "frantic, electrifying run-based shooter, with difficulties feeling like gambles".</p>
<p>"Its potential is up there with the games other Remedy staff reference in casual chit-chat around the studio's corridors, from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, yes, to Darktide, Payday, Deep Rock Galactic or even Overcooked," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedys-control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-has-only-come-together-at-the-last-minute-and-somehow-feels-better-for-it">Eurogamer's FBC: Firebreak preview</a>. "It might be coming together somewhat at the last, but again, perhaps that's exactly the way these kinds of games need to work."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>During an <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/movie/index.html">annual Sony business presentation</a>, CEO Hermen Hulst stated the company remains committed to building "a diverse and resilient" portfolio of live service games, which includes the unreleased <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marathon">Marathon</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fairgames">Fairgames</a>. That's despite high profile live service failures, in addition to controversy with these two forthcoming games.</p>
<p>Hulst stated that Sony is building on the successes of games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> for future projects, adding: "We look forward to showcasing our progress with Marathon", a game that has seen no shortage of controversy recently.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2, the large jewel in Sony's live service crown, was dubbed a "resounding critical and commercial success" by Hulst, who highlighted both its ability to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-sees-super-earth-itself-invaded">retain a passionate community</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-2024-winners-list-who-won-what-this-year">win industry awards</a>.</p>

<p>Hulst called Marathon "innovative and bold". No other compliments were offered to Bungie's upcoming extraction shooter, though the accompanying slide noted "strong early engagement" as its prime achievement so far.</p>
<p>An interesting perspective to be sure, at least as far as Marathon is concerned. While much of what Hulst said about Helldivers 2 is true - the game has managed to remain a fantastic success story for the industry giant - Marathon has found itself on the receiving end of some exceptional problems.</p>
<p>The "strong early engagement" noted in the presentation doesn't reflect the available player figures for the games' closed alpha. During this short-lived test, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon/comments/1k9fob3/marathon_has_lost_roughly_80_of_its_playerbase/">Marathon shed roughly 80 percent of its initial alpha playerbase</a>. As far as engagement via discussion, Marathon's many problems dominated the conversation, such as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/05/04/it-may-be-too-late-to-fix-marathons-core-problem/">its locked three-player format and lack of feasible solo mode</a>, repetitive nature, lack of crucial extraction shooter features such as proximity voice, and more.</p>
<p>One of the biggest merits of Marathon was its aesthetic, which soon soured due to an art plagiarism scandal. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">Bungie admitted to the use of external art in the games development process</a>, blaming it on a former employee and committing to a full audit of in-game assets in order to remove any stolen work. This situation would reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">send morale at Bungie into "free fall"</a>.</p>
<p>Then we have Fairgames, which hasn't been shown off much since its initial reveal. A co-operative heist game, it was recently delayed due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fairgames-reportedly-delayed-into-next-year-as-haven-founder-jade-raymond-exits">studio founder Jade Raymond departing for greener pastures</a>. This came following worrying external tests, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/playstation-executive-jade-raymond-leaves-studio-she-founded?embedded-checkout=true">according to a report from Bloomberg</a>.</p>
<p>According to Raymond in a 2022 <a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/">Gamesindustry.biz</a> article, "more than 30 percent of the studio is currently working on machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cloud-based dev tools", technology that has proven divisive in recent years. Not to mention what could possibly be the most devastating hit to Fairgames yet: the removal of the dollar sign from its title.</p>
<p>It is clear that, despite uncertainty surrounding Sony's upcoming live service releases, the company wishes to remain entrenched in the space. Or, at the very least, to appear confident in its continued presence in the world of live service. It's worth noting the full record of Sony's venture into live service, which includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reflects-on-concords-failed-launch-and-removal-after-two-weeks">the legendary blunder Concord</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">cancelled live service God of War project</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-was-great-former-playstation-exec-says-but-naughty-dog-couldnt-make-it-alongside-new-ip">The Last of Us Online</a>, and more. Sony, which initially wanted to release 12 live service games by March 2026, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/">has cut that figure down to six</a>.</p>
<p>Sony's single-player output however has proven a far better offering for PlayStation fans. Earlier in this presentation, Hulst highlighted releases such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War: Ragnarok</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvels-spider-man-2">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>. Describing such releases as "a core strength" for Sony, it appears as though this style of game has proven more successful overall for the company.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
