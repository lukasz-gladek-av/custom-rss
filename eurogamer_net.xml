            <p>Snufkin: Melody of the Moominvalley is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows and to celebrate, Raw Fury has revealed DLC is on the way.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/snufkin-melody-of-moominvalley">Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley</a>'s Fuddler’s Courtship DLC sees players embark on a "brand-new pocket-sized adventure filled with wonderful encounters set amongst the striking watercolour visuals of autumn".</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer below:</p>

<p>"In this heartfelt novella-like story of romance, newfound friend Fuddler needs a helping hand to express his feelings, and players join Snufkin and his best friend, Moomintroll, on a camping trip deep into the wilds before winter sets in," Raw Fury explains. "What should have been a relaxing excursion for two, turns into a chaotic and romantic journey, with many new and old friends."</p><p>As yet, there's no firm date on when we can expect Snufkin: Melody of the Moominvalley to hit these consoles (it's already out on Switch and Steam), but Raw Fury said it'll let people know "soon". Don't forget that standard physical editions are also now available, with a deluxe edition launching on 20th December.</p>
<p>"You can't throw a rock in Brighton without hitting a moomin. There are boutiques and galleries devoted to them," Chris Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/snufkin-melody-of-moominvalley-review">Eurogamer's Snufkin: Melody of the Moominvalley review</a>, in which he awarded the "lovely" game four stars out of five.</p>
<p>"They're on our teacups and our beach towels. They're on plant pots by our windows and on the rough-papered covers of fancy Tove Jansson reprints stocking our libraries. It's not surprising that they've made it to video games, but it is surprising - to a moomin outsider, at least - to discover that the sort of thing that middle-class Southern idiots like me lap up so readily has a little bite to it. Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley, a musical stealthy exploration game, is the best kind of surprise."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Strange Scaffold's sublime shooter, I Am Your Beast, now has nine new levels as part of a free expansion.</p>

<p>"With an unreliable narrator at the helm of the story, not all is what it seems," the team teases. "Players will experience gameplay effects enabled to this over-the-top framing, such as receiving extraordinary abilities (i.e. superhumanly punching someone’s head off) and undergoing extreme situations not seen in the base game."</p>
<p>Support Group is out today, 22nd November. The game is currently available on PC via Steam, GOG, and itch.io, and will be available on iOS in January 2025.</p>
<p>"Despite a schlocky – and shocking – presentation, this action-shooter is exactly what I needed it to be, which is a delightfully bombastic experience that neither outstays its welcome nor feels unjustly punishing," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-am-your-beast-review">Eurogamer's I Am Your Beast review</a> earlier this year, slapping it with a healthy four out of five stars.</p>
<p>"Stapled to a blisteringly powerful soundtrack, this is a trim, frenetic, thoughtful shooter that stayed with me far longer than its truncated playtime."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>BioWare has released a rather hefty patch for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which among a myriad of bug fixes, also adds some quality of life changes. </p>
<p>This includes more filters to its photo mode and new weapon icons. Players will now also be able to bind arrow keys to input mappings, thanks to this recent patch, while screenshot file names from photo mode are now "simplified".</p>
<p>As for those rings, new ones can now be compared against both equipped ring slots. Previously when you picked up a new ring to put on your finger, it would only compare the stats against one of the rings you had equipped. </p>

<p>On the bug side of this Dragon Age: The Veilguard patch, BioWare has implemented over 40 fixes. These cover crashes (BioWare has "eliminated" the causes for some of them - hurrah!), and some odd facial expressions from Rook's first meeting with Emmrich.</p>
<p>Also, companions should no longer get stuck on balance beams now, which I am sure they will be pleased about.</p>

<p>On its release, we awarded Dragon Age: The Veilguard a shiny five out of five stars.</p>
<p>"It is the strongest and loudest answer BioWare could have mustered for the people still doubting whether it could do it. The answer is yes, emphatically. The Veilguard is spectacular. BioWare is back," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>.</p>
<p>The game launched to "solid" sales here in the UK, though has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-sales-solid-in-uk-softer-across-rest-of-europe-report">numbers "nearly 21 percent lower" than Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth across Europe</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sega's iconic fighting series is making its 3D PC debut on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3112260/Virtua_Fighter_5_REVO/">Steam</a> this winter with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-5">Virtua Fighter 5</a> R.E.V.O, 18 years after its original release.</p>
<p>It's a remaster of the fifth entry in the series, but with all the modern requirements: 4K graphics, high-res textures, and rollback netcode support to optimise online play.</p>
<p>It will also include new online modes to compete with up to 16 other players, including Tournaments and League. You can check out the game's intro in the trailer below.</p>

<p>Virtua Fighter 5 was first released in 2006 in the arcades and was followed by PS3 and Xbox 360 ports in 2007. A number of revisions were made over the years since, culminating in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown">Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown</a> on PS4 in 2021. It's this version that is being ported to PC, with the new moniker R.E.V.O.</p><p>Technically it's not the first time it's been playable on PC, though, as Virtua Fighter 5 features as a minigame in Yakuza 6, which is available on PC. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-2">Virtua Fighter 2</a>, the 2D Mega Drive fighter, is also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/71115/Virtua_Fighter_2/">already on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Still, this is excellent news for fans of Sega's somewhat dormant series. In an interview earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-developing-another-virtua-fighter-game">Sega confirmed a new Virtua Fighter game was in development</a>. It's unclear, though, if this was referencing this PC port or a new game entirely - presumably <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter">Virtua Fighter</a> 6.</p>
<p>Both Capcom and Bandai Namco have seen great success with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> and Tekken 8 respectively, so perhaps Sega is hoping its own Virtua Fighter can make a triumphant return.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-announces-flurry-of-projects-including-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi">Sega is also looking to revive classic series</a> like Crazy Taxi, Shinobi, and Jet Set Radio.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> is set to receive "some surprises" later this year, the game's director Feng Ji said, suggesting DLC is indeed on the way.</p>
<p>The game won the fan-voted Game of the Year award at last night's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTDmABPisP8&amp;t=10102s">Golden Joysticks</a>, with Ji making the comment during his acceptance speech.</p>
<p>"Of course, you might have already completed our game," he said. "That's perfectly fine too, Keep following us, and there might just be some surprises waiting for you later this year."</p>

<p>So what could those surprises be?</p>
<p>At the very least, Xbox players are still waiting to get their hands on the game. Its release on Microsoft's platform was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch">delayed as it needed more time for optimisation</a>, though rumours swirled around a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusion-over-black-myth-wukongs-missing-xbox-release-follows-claims-of-playstation-exclusivity">PlayStation exclusivity deal</a>.</p>
<p>At the least, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates">Microsoft reiterated the delay was not due to "platform limitations"</a>. A release date still has not been given, three months after its launch, but could still arrive before the end of the year.</p>
<p>More interestingly, Ji's comment further suggests DLC is on the way. Back at launch, an FAQ on the game's website noted DLC and "non-pay-to-win in-game purchases" may be released in future.</p>
<p>After release, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-05/investor-who-risked-it-all-on-wukong-scores-another-sales-win">Bloomberg</a> reported Game Science was working on an expansion for the game, following in the footsteps of FromSoftware with its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a>.</p>
<p>Multiple rumours have also circulated the DLC will release in early 2025 to coincide with Chinese New Year. So perhaps Ji's surprise is merely a release date announcement this side of Christmas. Looking at you The Game Awards!</p>
<p>"Its dramatic and spectacular boss fights just about keep Black Myth: Wukong afloat, but behind all its glitz and glamour is a frustratingly hollow and rudderless action game," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Eurogamer Black Myth: Wukong review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
