            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> is set to receive "some surprises" later this year, the game's director Feng Ji said, suggesting DLC is indeed on the way.</p>
<p>The game won the fan-voted Game of the Year award at last night's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTDmABPisP8&amp;t=10102s">Golden Joysticks</a>, with Ji making the comment during his acceptance speech.</p>
<p>"Of course, you might have already completed our game," he said. "That's perfectly fine too, Keep following us, and there might just be some surprises waiting for you later this year."</p>

<p>So what could those surprises be?</p>
<p>At the very least, Xbox players are still waiting to get their hands on the game. Its release on Microsoft's platform was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch">delayed as it needed more time for optimisation</a>, though rumours swirled around a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusion-over-black-myth-wukongs-missing-xbox-release-follows-claims-of-playstation-exclusivity">PlayStation exclusivity deal</a>.</p>
<p>At the least, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates">Microsoft reiterated the delay was not due to "platform limitations"</a>. A release date still has not been given, three months after its launch, but could still arrive before the end of the year.</p>
<p>More interestingly, Ji's comment further suggests DLC is on the way. Back at launch, an FAQ on the game's website noted DLC and "non-pay-to-win in-game purchases" may be released in future.</p>
<p>After release, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-05/investor-who-risked-it-all-on-wukong-scores-another-sales-win">Bloomberg</a> reported Game Science was working on an expansion for the game, following in the footsteps of FromSoftware with its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a>.</p>
<p>Multiple rumours have also circulated the DLC will release in early 2025 to coincide with Chinese New Year. So perhaps Ji's surprise is merely a release date announcement this side of Christmas. Looking at you The Game Awards!</p>
<p>"Its dramatic and spectacular boss fights just about keep Black Myth: Wukong afloat, but behind all its glitz and glamour is a frustratingly hollow and rudderless action game," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Eurogamer Black Myth: Wukong review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Konami has deployed a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> update to address graphical glitches affecting the horror game on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>The patch comes after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-fans-want-to-know-when-the-game-will-run-properly-on-ps5-pro">Silent Hill 2 Remake players called on Konami to address the technical issues still plaguing the game on PS5 Pro</a> almost two weeks on from the Pro's release.</p>

<p>Patch  v.1.1.248,905 is now available across PS5 and PC. The PS5 patch specifically targets "graphics glitches" on PS5 Pro as well as trophy counting, whilst the Steam patch fixes "an issue that caused interference between game saves and controller vibration", mouse sensitivity and input, and controller issues.</p>
<p>Gameplay fixes across both platforms fix door markers on Brookhaven Hospital map, stops enemies getting hung up on environments, and several other bugs and glitches - the <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/2r/news/jp/ja/update_106">full list of fixes is here</a>.</p>
<p>The patch also resolves a "minor blocker" that prevented some players from escaping the Labyrinth after getting the map, an unspecified "progression-blocking issue" in Brookhaven, and an issue where the final boss was missing for some.</p> <div>

<p>"Overall, the philosophy for any PS5 Pro update should be that we get an upgrade over the base PS5, with no noticeable trade-offs," Digital Foundry's Thomas Morgan wrote earlier this week after breaking down <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-silent-hill-2s-ps5-pro-patch-is-another-update-with-glaring-image-quality-issues">Silent Hill 2 Remake's PS5 Pro patch</a>.</p><p>"The reality for Silent Hill 2 Remake's Pro upgrade though is that there are pros and cons. PS5 Pro does improve the game's performance at 60fps - and gets us to a vastly improved 30fps lock - both of which are welcome improvements."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Oh, my nostalgic heart is happy to tell you that Donkey Kong Land is available now for Nintendo Switch Online members.</p>
<p>The Game Boy classic once again asks players to set off in monkey form to find that banana horde. "Cranky Kong doesn't think Donkey Kong has proven himself to be a hero yet," reads the official description. "So, he decides to work out a deal with the closest villain that he knows."</p>
<p>Yes, K. Rool, that dastardly fiend, has hidden the bananas with a little help from his cronies. And, of course, Donkey and Diddy Kong won't stand for it. You can check out a trailer for its Nintendo Switch Online debut below.</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch Online members can get themselves access to multiple NES, Super NES and Game Boy games.</p>
<p>Those who plump for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack option will also be able to get their mitts on Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance and SEGA Mega Drive games, along with other perks. That includes things like expansions for other Nintendo games, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>'s Booster Course Pass.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in monkey-related news, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-coming-to-nintendo-switch">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is set to arrive for  Nintendo Switch next year</a>, on 16th January. The Wii classic will feature 80 levels on its Switch debut, including the additional ones from the game's 3DS version. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
