            <p>
PlayStation is celebrating its upcoming 30th Anniversary by letting you sit on its logo while riding the Victoria Line.
</p>
<p>
The marketing stunt is the first time in over 25 years that Transport for London has allowed a brand to advertise on its Tube seats. It's also probably the first time in over 25 years that TFL has actually put in new Tube seats.
</p>
<p>
Sony's design includes the classic Circle, Square, Cross and Triangle buttons emblazoned across the Tube's usual moquette seat cushions. (Today I learned that the correct name for this type of fabric is indeed "moquette". Impress your friends.)
</p>
<p>
Here's how it all looks:
</p> <div>

<p>
Somewhat oddly, PlayStation has also suggested people should kiss while sat on these seats. I will continue staring at the ground trying to ignore everyone else as normal, but thank you anyway Sony.

<p>
Keen to spot the PlayStation Tube branding for yourself? You might find it more difficult than it first appears. Reading further, it seems like just one carriage on the Victoria Line has been given the PlayStation spruce-up. With 36 trains operating per hour, that might take a while to find.
</p><p>
This isn't the first time PlayStation has teamed up with TFL. Back in 2020, Sony took over the Tube signs outside Oxford Circus by replacing those with the Circle, Square, Cross and Triangle designs to promote the launch of PS5. Finding these signs was easier than finding an actual PS5 at the time.

<p>
And before that, PlayStation memorably stuck its favourite buttons up on London's Oxo Tower back in 2013, to celebrate the launch of PS4.

PlayStation celebrates its 30th anniversary next week, on Tuesday 3rd December, when it will have been three decades since the launch of the original PS1 in Japan. Eurogamer will be marking the occaison here too - stay in your PlayStation-branded seats for much more.
</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-prepping-playstation-5-portable-plans-to-battle-nintendos-handheld-dominance">Sony is quietly prepping plans to re-enter the handheld gaming market with a portable PS5</a> that's set to rival <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-killing-avatars-on-pc-xbox-one-xbox-series-xs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-killing-avatars-on-pc-xbox-one-xbox-series-x-s.1045413/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-killing-avatars-on-pc-xbox-one-xbox-series-xs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Microsoft will shutdown its Xbox Avatar Editor app on PC, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S on 9th January due to "low engagement", the company has said. 
</p>
<p>
This means you'll no longer be able to access or edit your Xbox Avatar, and you'll lose any purchased cosmetic items for them. Any money spent on avatar items will be refunded.
</p>
<p>
After 9th January, Xbox Avatars will disappear from profile pages, Microsoft has <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/profile/xbox-avatar-editor-app-faq">said</a>. So, if you want to snap one last Gamerpic using your digital self, now's the time. 
</p>
<p>
The good news here is this solely refers to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-what-the-revamped-and-diverse-new-xbox-avatars-look-like">newer Xbox Avatars, launched in 2018 for the Xbox One era</a>. Microsoft's entirely separate and confusingly distinct Xbox Original Avatars are unaffected.
</p>
<p>
If you still remember (or use!) your Xbox 360, you'll remember having an avatar there, too. These avatars are what Microsoft now calls Xbox Original Avatars, and they were far more ingrained within Xbox 360's ecosystem. Some Xbox 360 games let you play as your avatar, for example, while others offered cosmetic avatar rewards via a system akin to Achievements.
</p>
<p>
Again, the Xbox 360-era Original Avatars are not going anywhere - hopefully because switching them off would be more of a headache when it comes to game preservation and back compatibility.
</p>
<p>
Back during the troubled times of the Xbox One, Microsoft pivoted back to using avatars and spent time creating an all-new system that offered a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-avatars-just-got-a-lot-more-diverse">far more diverse range of options and deeper customisation</a>. This included support for prosthetics, wheelchairs and gender neutral clothing, plus colour combinations for that can stretch to "almost eighty octillion", Microsoft said at the time.
</p><p>
"Microsoft is dedicated to delivering great experiences for players, including a variety of options to personalise their gaming experience with Xbox," Microsoft said in a statement now. "Due to low engagement and our shift in focus towards delivering other player experiences, the Xbox Avatar Editor app will no longer be available starting on 9th January, 2025.
</p>
<p>"Players can still personalise their gaming experience with dynamic backgrounds and profile colours on Xbox consoles, and with Xbox Original Avatars, profile themes, and gamerpics on Xbox consoles and PCs."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> and Mafia publisher 2K has killed off its PC  launcher, and uncoupled its top titles from the software.
</p>
<p>
Steam and Epic Games Store versions of BioShock Remastered, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-2">BioShock 2</a> Remastered, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a>, Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization-v">Civilization 5</a> and 6, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-quarry">The Quarry</a>, XCOM 2, XCOM: Chimera Squad and Marvel's Midnight Suns will now run without the 2K Launcher opening first.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/34845053169939--2K-Launcher-Complete-Sunset#h_01JB9Z24V9Q3426C558WRC173K">blog post</a> on the changes, 2K said its launcher had now been removed from every game that used it on Epic and Steam. Last night, an update was sent out to 2K games on Steam to ensure its removal - in case you wondered why BioShock was patched again.
</p>
<p>
From 2K's notes on the subject, the whole thing sounds like it should be pretty seamless. If you're still seeing the 2K Launcher now, be sure you've updated your games and rebooted Steam. 
</p>
<p>
Access to your games, as well as your save files, should continue uninterrupted, 2K says in a Q&amp;A on the subject. 
</p>
<p>
"Can I still use the 2K Launcher if I want to?" a final question asks. "We currently have no plans to allow an optional 2K Launcher setting, but we appreciate your interest," is the response.
</p>
<p>
2K's next games include Civilization 7 and BioShock creator Ken Levine's mysterious Judas, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creators-next-game-judas-to-be-released-by-march-2025">whenever that finally materialises</a>. When it does do so, however, it will be without the 2K Launcher.

            <p>Nintendo has added <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> to the official series timeline.</p>
<p>The adorable top-down game is part of the 'Hero is defeated' timeline, slotting in behind Tri-Force Heroes and the original The Legend of Zelda.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/character/zelda/en/history/index.html">timeline</a> links (pun intended) all the games together, famously splitting after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a> depending on whether the hero is successful or not at saving the world.</p>

<p>So what does this mean for Echoes of Wisdom? I'm yet to finish it myself, though in all honesty we all know the timeline is incredibly loose and somewhat meaningless.</p>
<p>Worryingly, though, after Echoes of Wisdom Nintendo specifies a "Decline of Hyrule Kingdom". What happened? What did you do Zelda?</p>

<p>Back in September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-officially-places-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-tears-of-the-kingdom-outside-series-established-timeline">Nintendo officially listed both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom outside of the established timeline</a>, with no relation to previous games.</p>
<p>Further, in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/11/12/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-eiji-aonuma/">The Washington Post</a>, series producer Eiji Aonuma stated Zelda games are developed from a gameplay perspective first, with story formed later. So how much does the timeline really matter?</p>
<p>Echoes of Wisdom was released on Switch back in September, and is the first game in the series to feature the titular princess as the playable protagonist.</p>
<p>Zelda voice actor Patricia Summersett told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda/after-echoes-of-wisdom-zelda-actor-says-having-the-princess-as-the-playable-character-in-a-breath-of-the-wild-style-open-world-game-would-be-amazing/">GamesRadar</a> it would be "amazing" to see the princess as protagonist in an open world Zelda too. "I'm so happy for the fandom that they got Echoes of Wisdom, of course, but I mean, yeah, there can always be more playable Zelda as far as I'm concerned," she said.</p>
<p>"Thanks to playful puzzles and an imaginative reinvention of Hyrule's historic iconography, Echoes of Wisdom emerges as a bold and creative new chapter in Zelda's legend," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-a-rebellious-remix-of-past-and-present">Echoes of Wisdom review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Is the next big video game company acquisition on the cards?</p>
<p>Last week, news broke that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware">Sony was in talks to buy FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa</a>. A day later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-acknowledges-takeover-interest-from-sony">Kadokawa acknowledged that takeover interest</a>. Should it be accepted, this would likely be the biggest video game acquisition since Microsoft bought <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> and Sony itself bought Destiny-maker Bungie.</p>
<p>FromSoftware is of course known for its Souls games and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, and already has an established relationship with Sony due to exclusives like Bloodborne and Demon's Souls. Yet Kadokawa not only owns other developers, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> developer Acquire, it's a major name in anime and manga too - an area Sony already has considerable claim to with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-set-to-buy-crunchyroll-for-nearly-usd1bn">acquisition of Crunchyroll</a>.</p>
<p>So what's the likelihood of this acquisition being accepted? What does Kadokawa - and by extension FromSoftware - stand to gain from Sony ownership? And does this mean Bloodborne fans will finally get the re-release they so desperately crave?</p>
<p>Joining me to discuss the possible consequences of this acquisition on this week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a> are news reporters Victoria Kennedy and Vikki Blake.</p>
