            <p>For those of you who enjoyed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s co-op spin-off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a> on release but now think meh, this is too easy, well buckle up buttercup. Bandai Namco and FromSoftware have announced a high-difficulty mode.</p>
<p>It's known as Deep of Night and it's intended for seasoned players who have navigated through the Night many times, which counts me out.</p>

<p>Deep of Night will arrive on 11th September and have stronger enemies in it. You won't be able to specify the Nightlord you want to fight and ongoing terrain changes won't be reflected. </p>
<p>"Furthermore, the difficulty increases the deeper you descend," the Nightreign team said. "The ratings will fluctuate based on wins and losses, affecting the 'depth'."</p>
<p>There will be some special items exclusive to Deep of Night, but be warned that some "detrimental effects" will also appear.
