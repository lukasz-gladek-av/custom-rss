            <p>Director Eli Roth has shared his thoughts on what went wrong with last year's Borderlands adaptation, which was a critical and commercial flop.</p>
<p>Why did it fail? Well, Roth believes that the circumstances around the film, such as the Covid pandemic, certainly didn't do the team any favours.</p>

<p>In conversation with podcast <a href="https://puck.news/podcast_episode/director-eli-roth-will-kill-you-on-screen-for-1-million/">The Town</a> (via <a href="https://www.darkhorizons.com/eli-roth-reflects-on-borderlands-difficulties/">Dark Horizons</a>), Roth admitted that the first time he got to view the final film, he wasn't actually sure what he was going to see. This is because Roth had already started work on another film, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deadpool-film-director-takes-reigns-on-borderlands-reshoots">Deadpool film director Tim Miller had taken over Borderlands' reshoots</a>.</p>
<p>"[I] was doing Thanksgiving, and it's also the kind of thing we're like, wow, this is the first time I'm going to see a movie sort of being like, 'OK, I directed this, what happens?'. That was kind of an experience like, never had that before," Roth said.</p>
<p>"And I remember being... Am I at the point of my career where I'm going to sit down to watch my own movie that says I wrote and directed it, and I really genuinely don't know what's going to happen?"</p>
<p>The director still has plenty of respect for those that worked on the film, and said he would still work with Lionsgate again, but not "under those circumstances".</p>
<p>Roth continued:  "I think none of us, none of us anticipated how complicated things were gonna be with Covid. Not just in terms of what we're shooting, but then you have to do pick-up shots or reshoots and you have six people that are all on different sets and every one of those sets is getting shut down because the cities have opened up, and now there's a Covid outbreak and it was just like... we couldn't prep in a room together, I couldn't be with my stunt people, I couldn't do pre-vis, everyone's spread all over the place.</p>
<p>"You can't prep a movie on that scale over Zoom and I think we all thought we could pull it off and we got our asses handed to us a bit."</p>

<p>Last year's Cate Blanchett-fronted Borderlands adaptation was branded a "disaster" and "huge misfire" by viewers. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-borderlands-movie-impressions-brand-it-a-disaster-and-a-huge-misfire">one review called it a "lifeless, unfunny, and visually repulsive dud"</a>. The film generated just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-earned-4m-on-its-opening-day">$4m across 3125 locations on its opening day</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youll-be-able-to-watch-the-borderlands-film-at-home-very-soon-it-seems">quickly getting shifted onto streaming services</a>.</p>
<p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick had a more upbeat outlook on the Borderlands adaptation, however. Indeed, he said that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-film-benefited-game-sales-despite-being-disappointing-flop-take-two-boss-says">the "disappointing" movie hadn't hurt the Borderlands video game series, but rather it had given it a boost</a>.</p>
<p>The next entry in the Borderlands games franchise is due to<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-gets-new-trailer-and-a-release-date">release across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gearbox-is-bringing-borderlands-4-to-steam-as-pitchford-admits-hopes-for-epic-were-misplaced">Steam and the Epic Games Store at the same time</a>) on 23rd September.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> editions of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> will allow players to repair their equipment using the new accompanying app.</p>
<p>In both games, breakable equipment is a controversial inclusion. It forces players to experiment with new weapons, but losing a favourite mid-fight can be frustrating.</p>
<p>Now, though, there's a new way to repair your equipment. Nintendo is updating its app alongside the games, which we already know will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/achievements-can-be-earned-in-switch-2-editions-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom">include achievements, voiced navigation, and all-new memories</a>.

<p>Each day, players will be able to roll a roulette wheel for a daily bonus to be activated at any point in-game.</p>
<p>These bonuses (as spotted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-n0v0mpBVM&amp;t=594s">Zeltik</a>) include health restoration, energy cell recharges, various meals, and equipment repairs. The latter will allow players to use their chosen weapons a little longer.</p>
<p>Players may worry this will upset the balance of the game, but the bonus can only be used once each day. What's more, Zeltik noted the roulette wheel appears to be different each day, so repairs may not always be available.</p>
<p>It's a nice addition, though, to give players an extra option when their favourite sword is close to breaking point mid-battle against a Lynel.</p>
<p>While the Switch 2 editions provide a boost to the visual performance of both games, last week Nintendo confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-clarifies-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-switch-2-edition-doesnt-include-its-paid-dlc">Switch 2 edition of Breath of the Wild won't include its paid DLC</a>. That originally came in two parts to extend the plot and add new shrines.</p>
<p>Another<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-looks-to-be-streamlining-screenshot-and-video-sharing-so-its-less-of-a-faff"> improvement on the app will be streamlining screenshot and video capture</a> and sharing.</p>

            <p>
Sony has raised the price of PS5 once again, with increases in the UK, mainland Europe, Australia and New Zealand.
</p>
<p>
The PS5 Digital Edition will now cost £40 or €50 more, and will sell for £430/€500, up from £390/€450.
</p>
<p>
The price hike was announced in the early hours of this morning, via a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/13/ps5-price-to-rise-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/">blog post</a> in which Sony blamed the "tough decision" on "the backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates".
</p>
<p>
No price rises have been announced for the PS5's disc edition or the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> in the UK or mainland Europe.
</p>
<p>In Australia and New Zealand, the price of both the PS5 Digital Edition and PS5 with a disc drive will increase, to AU $750 or NZ $860, and AU $830 or $950 respectively.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-price-increase-announced-by-30-in-uk">Sony last raised the PS5's price here in Europe back in August 2022</a>, when it hiked the Digital Edition by £30 or €50, from £360/€400 to £390/€450.
</p>
<p>
This second round of price rises mean the PS5 Digital Edition is now, in pure monetary terms, £70 or €100 more expensive than when it originally went on sale. 
</p>
<p>
But as Sony taketh, so it giveth at least something back. If you did still want a Disc Drive add-on, this has been slightly cut in price - down to £70/€80. Maybe there's plenty of those still lying around the warehouse.
</p>
<p>At £430, the PS5 Digital Edition is the same price as Nintendo's forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">Switch 2 bundle with Mario Kart World</a>. Equally notable: Argos is still offering the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aD3L4e">PS5 Astro Bot bundle</a>, including a disc drive, at £430 as well.</p>
<p>Moreover, over at EE, the <a href="https://tidd.ly/4ibW8XK">PS5 Digital Edition with Astro Bot is still going for £329</a>, a full £100 less than the Sony’s looming price rise for the UK.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Meet DMZ: Nuclear Survival, a new PVE and competitive PVP multiplayer open-world survival crafting game set in a post-apocalyptic world after a nuclear war. It's coming "soon" in early access so that the "brand-new, ambitious, and highly flexible" game can grow alongside its community.</p>
<p>It's thought the game - which hasn't indicated a price, but has at least confirmed it won't be free-to-play - will be in early access for the inaugural year, although that "depends upon development progress and player feedback". You can check it out in the teaser below, which debuted at Indie Live Expo 2025 earlier today:</p>

<p>Developed by a two-person team in Saitama, Japan, DMZ is the debut title from newly formed studio Wild Dog. It takes place on the supercontinent "Pangaea, a "vast, procedurally generated" environment featuring a variety of biomes, including forests, wastelands, deserts, and snowfields. The game's lore suggests it was formed by tectonic shifts caused by the war, where "intense battles for survival" unfolded. Players can excavate ancient ruins scattered across the land - such as pyramids, Terracotta warriors, and Roman temples - and research relics, craft items, and "even resurrect powerful soldiers from ancient genes to revive a fallen civilization and fight for survival".</p>
<p>You'll also get to capture NPCs and bring them back to base to become companions, each one with a specialty that may come in handy. Non-human recruits like Bears, wolves, and, er, ostriches are also available. Players can also set up shop on dedicated servers to "play with over 100 players", although offline single-player mode is also available.</p>
<p>The duo hope the final version will introduce new biomes and locations, "enhance soldier and NPC development features, improve PvE and PvP mechanics, add craftable technologies, and implement server updates that allow more players to participate simultaneously".</p>
<p>For more, head on over to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3316500/DMZ_Nuclear_Survival/">Steam page</a>, which informs me there'll be in-app purchases and full controller support.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Pretty much all we officially know about the next Battlefield so far is that it's set in the modern day, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">bring back traditional classes and more focused maps</a> after the unpopular changes made in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>. Beyond that, it's all speculation - although one sleuth scoured the new game's concept art and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-sleuth-seemingly-identifies-location-teased-in-next-games-first-bit-of-concept-art">identified landmarks suggesting it could be set in Gibraltar</a>.</p>
<p>However, with the first phase of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">its Battlefield Labs initiative</a> - described as the "most ambitious community testing program in franchise history" - now live, despite participants needing to sign an NDA before they can get involved, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefields-invite-only-playtest-has-just-begun-and-gameplay-is-already-leaking-online">gameplay is already popping up in various corners of the internet</a>. And EA is not happy.</p>
<p>Whilst at first, with mostly positive news leaking, EA seemed pretty content to let the rumours fly, the team is now cracking down on the leaks, saying that no one wins when "information and content [...] is shared out of context".</p>

<p>Global community manager Totalfps hit back at a grumpy reddit thread about purported skill-based-matchmaking, cutting the commenter off with "Okay, enough".</p>
<p>"Battlefield Labs is about building and collaborating on the future of Battlefield, and we want to do that in the correct way," Totalfps wrote."I want to remind everyone things that are taking place in Battlefield Labs may or may not make their way to the final finish line.</p>
<p>"This is the greatest thing about this program, it allows us the ability to get creative, see what works with those involved, gain educated and informed feedback from those that are participating and potentially spot bugs around the features too. We've long wanted to implement this program, responding to your requests for greater involvement and a return to this type of reactivity around all things Battlefield."</p>
<p>Totalfps added that "there is a specific time and place for the wider community to learn about new features and functionalities", but now "is not it", and "the constant reposting of things is not that time or place" yet, either.</p>
<p>"Individuals are and will continue to be removed if they continue to violate the NDA that they agreed to," they said.</p>

<p>"While the allure of brief internet fame might be tempting, it undermines our efforts to remain open and communicative. And quite honestly, if that is your intention, then I question where this aligns with the interests of our, THIS, community."</p>
<p>Totalfps stressed the Labs program exists because EA "wanted to have an environment that allowed for testing and collaborating once again", but it "cannot do it if the trust continues to be tampered with. We must be allowed the ability to do it right - alongside you all and in the correct way".</p>
<p>"Rules aren't fun, but they exist to make it better for us all. Thank you to those that are abiding by them, but thank you for your trust and time too to make this great for you - our community," they concluded.</p>
<p>Whilst we don't yet have a release name or date, EA confirmed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-expected-to-release-before-april-2026">expects the series' latest instalment to arrive before April next year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
