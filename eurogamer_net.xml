            <p>Bloober team has teased something mysterious on a brand-new website, leading the horror-enthusiasts on the internet scratching their heads.</p>
<p>The website, <a href="https://remosdneulserorehsoovamceyerd.com/">which you can see yourself here</a>, doesn't contain much. It has a countdown to Valentines Day, a jumbled URL, a rose that bleeds when you hover your mouse cursor over it, an audio reading of the William Blake Poem 'The Sick Rose', and the following words: "Some things never leave the walls. They only learn to wait.”</p>
<p>This has spurred speculation in a variety of directions. First, following a common interpretation of William Blake poem and its commentary on the corruption of innocence and beauty. This, as well as Bloober's prior work on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, has led some to believe this is a Silent Hill 1 Remake. The plot of that game, focusing on both Cheryl and the beauty of childbirth itself being corrupted / tarnished by the nasty Dahlia, could be applicable.</p>

<p>Another theory is quite a simple one.<a href="https://x.com/BlooberTeam/status/2006515753176953244"> In a social media post</a> released by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> alongside this website, this phrase is written: "RemosdNeulSerorehsoOvamCeyerd". Taking the capital letters from that, you can spell the word Cronos, which some are taking as a hint that whatever will be announced in February will be a DLC for Bloober's latest game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>.</p><p>Alternatively, some have seen the rose and have immediately gone to Rule of Rose, the legendary and quite controversial horror game released back in 2006 was at the heart of a moral panic across Europe, and totally cancelled in the UK. Now, what governmental bodies assumed was an obscene experience was actually just a pretty okay horror game that has since grown to have a cult following.</p>
<p>Looking behind the curtain a bit, we know that Bloober Team is working on something dubbed "Project F" thanks to a business blog it posted last year. That's being created under the Broken Mirror Games brand, but aside from that we know sweet little about it. There's also Project M, also scheduled for a reveal some time this year.</p>
<p>So those are the three main theories: Silent Hill 1 Remake, Cronos DLC, and Rule of Rose Remake. It could, of course, be something totally different. Maybe a selection of spooky Valentines Day cards. Who knows. We'll have to wait until next month (or someone exceptionally smart) to learn the truth of it!</p>
