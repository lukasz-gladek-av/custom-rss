            <p>Jagex has announced it's removing Treasure Hunter microtransactions from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/runescape">RuneScape 3</a>, after over 120,000 players voted for their swift destruction in a community poll. These microtransactions will be removed early next year.</p>
<p>Treasure Hunter is a daily activity that allows players to earn prizes, including XP boosts, in-game gold and more. You're given a number of keys for free each day, but players have been able to buy additional keys for real money for a while. Basically, you open a chest for free loot every day.</p>
<p>Starting the 19th of January, Treasure Hunting as well as over 225 direct XP and skilling items will be removed from the game entirely. The reason why? Well, Jagex held a community poll on whether or not RuneScape 3 would remove Treasure Hunter. This passed overwhelmingly, reaching well over the 100,000 vote requirement for the change.</p>

<figcaption>Jagex even made a cineamtic trailer for the loss of a revenue stream, check it out.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCjHVGbFwr4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>This isn't the first major community vote Jagex has held for both RuneScape 3 and Old School RuneScape. Back in 2013 it held a vote asking its community <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/2007---old-school-runescape-you-vote">whether it wanted Old School RuneScape to exist, which received a wave of support</a>. There were also votes held for<a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/wilderness-and-free-trade-vote"> the Wilderness and Free Trade</a>, which heavily impacted how PvP worked in the game.</p><p>This big change comes at the start of what Jagex is dubbing a new era for the game, which they'll reveal more about starting the 19th January. This will include a full roadmap for the game moving forward through 2026, so will be well worth a watch if you're interested in one the biggest MMOs out there.</p>
<p>Microtransactions have always been a sore point for RuneScape during its life. Treasure Hunter is actually the second loot box system the game has had, the first being so poorly recieved it was removed entirely. In fact, there's a quest where you can kill its mascot. This vote is, in reality, good thing for the game as unpopular microtransactions have proven a big reason for players leaving.
</p>
<p>It's a frankly respectable amount of fanfare over the loss of a revenue stream that should hopefully earn Jagex a lot of love from its community of RuneScape 3 enjoyers. Still, for games like RuneScape, community is key to maintaining momentum. One has to wonder what the 2026 roadmap will look like, given all the excitement around it. We do know there's going to be a new area called Havenhythe added to the game, so that's a taste of what's to come!</p>

            <p>The UK trade union Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has issued a legal claim against Rockstar following what it believes is the unfair dismissal of staff.</p>
<p>As we reported earlier this month, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">Grand Theft Auto maker has been accused of union busting</a> after it fired 30-40 Rockstar staff who were purportedly involved in union activities. Rockstar claims they were fired for gross misconduct.</p>
<p>Now the IWGB is fighting back with a legal claim, with members alleging these dismissals "amount to victimisation and collective dismissal linked to trade union activity". Rockstar has declined to meet with IWGB, leading to this legal claim.</p>
<p>"We are representing employees who were dismissed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> in circumstances that we believe amount to victimisation and collective dismissal linked to trade union activity," said the IWGB's legal team in a statement shared with Eurogamer.</p>
<p>"Despite our representation and attempts to meet with Rockstar to resolve the matter through negotiation, Rockstar have declined and persisted to terminate members of the union in a manner that is unacceptable and unlawful. Accordingly, we have now issued formal legal claims against Rockstar on behalf of the Claimants."</p><p>Added Alex Marshall, IWGB President: "We are confident that what we've seen here is plain and simple union busting, and we will mount a full legal defence with our expert group of caseworkers, legal officers and barristers. Employers like Rockstar would do well to understand that private spaces such as trade union Discord servers have protections, and that their company's contractual clauses do not supersede UK law.</p>
<p>"This case stands as a warning to any employer in the games industry and beyond who thinks they are able to act with impunity against organised workers - we will not be intimidated."</p>
<p>Following initial reports of the dismissals, Take-Two spokesperson Alan Lewis told Bloomberg the developers were fired for "gross misconduct, and for no other reason", adding "[Take-Two] fully support[s] Rockstar's ambitions and approach".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9nOwjeznjI&amp;t=240s">People Make Games</a> recently met with the former employees during a demonstration outside Rockstar offices in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>The employees had been in the process of forming a union, The Rockstar Games Workers Union, to push for better working conditions ahead of the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. Just over ten percent of the Rockstar workforce in the UK had been recruited, a crucial criteria for a union in the UK to apply for statutory recognition by the government.</p>
<p>Earlier this month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">Rockstar delayed GTA 6 once again</a>. It's now set for release next November.</p>
