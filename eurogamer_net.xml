            <p>Neil Druckmann is "really curious" about how viewers will react when The Last of Us season two debuts next month.</p>
<p>The Last of Us' second season is set to air in just over two weeks time, and will pick up the lives of Joel and Ellie several years after the events of season one. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbos-the-last-of-us-wins-eight-emmys-including-outstanding-guest-actor-for-nick-offermans-bill">Along with awards and praise</a>, in 2023 the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-averaging-32m-viewers-per-episode-in-us-most-watched-hbo-max-show-in-europe">first season was reported to be the most-watched HBO Max show in Europe</a>, and as such, there are some pretty high hopes for The Last of Us' second season, mine included.</p>
<p>However, as those who have played Part 2 will know, there are some plot points that may surprise and shock viewers unfamiliar with the source material. So, is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> exec and showrunner Neil Druckmann nervous or scared about the reception, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2s-abby-actor-reveals-online-abuse-didnt-just-threaten-her-life-but-her-baby-son-too">especially given some of the volatile abuse following The Last of Us Part 2</a>? Well, no, he isn't.</p>

<p>"When we're making it, we're just so focused on making it that I try not to think about what the reaction will be, but I'm very excited and curious to see what the reaction will be from people who are not familiar with the story and people who are familiar with the story, going over similarities and differences," Druckmann told <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/03/26/naughty-dogs-neil-druckmann-on-the-creative-process-behind-season-2-of-the">GameInformer</a>.</p>
<p>"I loved that conversation over season one, and I'm very much looking forward to it across season two."</p>
<p>During the same interview, Druckmann said he "used to be more concerned with fan reaction", adding he had "experienced the worst of it when [Naughty Dog] had the leaks and Covid hit with the second game", but has now "stopped caring" about all that.</p>
<p>"I've always operated under that, 'I'm not going to be worried about what the fan reaction is going to be. I don't have any control over that so I'm not going to be worried about it'.</p>
<p>"What I do have control over is the crafting of the thing that's in front of me and leading a team to do that. So I want to make sure that we make something we're extremely proud of, that we're very thoughtful in making. And then we put it out into the world and the reaction is not up to us. That's up to our fans and how they react."</p>
<p>As to <em>that</em> particular moment that may provoke reactions (won't spoil it here), well Druckmann refrained from commenting on whether or not it will feature in the second season. He dodged the Ellie-phant in the room, if you will. </p>
<p>"I'm not confirming or denying anything," Druckmann said.</p>

<p>The second season of The Last of Us will kick off next month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">on 13th April</a>, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">comprise seven episodes</a>, with one of those episodes being "quite big" in length. Spores have also been confirmed for The Last of Us' second season, with the showrunners <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-promises-viewers-a-different-evolution-of-infection-plus-spores-make-a-return">promising viewers "a different evolution" of infection</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the showrunners discussed the introduction of new character Abby (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-twos-abby-kaitlyn-dever-wants-to-do-this-character-justice-and-make-the-fans-proud">played in the show by Kaitlyn Dever</a>), and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-2-showrunners-are-changing-the-way-abby-is-introduced">why it will be different from The Last of Us Part 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
