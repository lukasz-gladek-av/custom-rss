            <p>
July and the sizzle of summer are finally upon us. And as ever, a new calendar month means a fresh batch of Xbox Game Pass titles, which this time include the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares-ii">Little Nightmares 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft has so far announced a grand total of nine titles joining the various tiers of its subscription service this month, with the first of those arriving today, 1st July. You can see everything coming - plus when, on what platform, and to what Game Pass tier - below:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Little Nightmares 2</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) - available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard from 1st July</li>
<li><strong>Rise of the Tomb Raider</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) - available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard from 1st July</li>
<li><strong>Legend of Mana</strong> (Console) ‚Äì available with Game Pass Standard from 2nd July</li>
<li><strong>Trials of Mana</strong> (Console) ‚Äì available with Game Pass Standard from 2nd July</li>
<li><strong>Ultimate Chicken Horse</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) ‚Äì available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard from 3rd July</li>
<li><strong>The Ascent</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) ‚Äì available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard from 8th July</li>
<li><strong>Minami Lane</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) ‚Äì available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass from 9th July</li>
<li><strong>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) ‚Äì available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass from 11th July</li>
<li><strong>High On Life</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) ‚Äì available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard from 15th July</li>
</ul>
<p>
It's a decent line-up, then, although Activision's long-awaited Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 remake will undoubtedly be the headline act for many people. But adorably sinister horror sequel Little Nightmares 2 is well worth your time if you're in the mood for some macabre chills, and that double-whammy of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s Mana series should keep fantasy RPG fans occupied. Beyond that, there's a spot of tomb raiding, some wholesome street-management action in Miami Lane, visually striking cyberpunk action in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-ascent">The Ascent</a>, and more.
</p>
<p>
As for departures, six games are leaving Xbox Game Pass on 15th July, so if you've been meaning to check out any of the following, you've only got a couple of weeks to do so:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flock</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><strong>Mafia Definitive Edition</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><strong>Magical Delicacy</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><strong>Tchia</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><strong>The Callisto Protocol</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><strong>The Case of the Golden Idol</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>
<p>
To keep playing the above titles after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to buy them - but subscribers do at least get a 20 percent discount.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-the-phantom-x">Persona 5: The Phantom X</a> is out and as you can imagine, people are having a good time making their way through the free-to-play RPG. However, they've been confronted with what may be the most peculiar Atlus villain of all time: The Subway Slammer.</p>
<p>The Subway Slammer is a major antagonist in P5X's initial chapter. He's basically just a guy who shoulder charges women on the subway. No one does anything about it, leaving him to continue tormenting innocent people.</p>
<p>This may all sound a little random, but it's very much based on reality. Men who intentionally ram into people (usually women) in a manner they can then claim is an accident are dubbed "Butsukari otoko", or bumping man". It's a real, weird, horrible thing!</p>

<figcaption>It's the Subway Slammer!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CU2-2hfX_8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The community reaction to the Subway Slammer is mixed. Some are genuinely underwhelmed by what is a relatively inconsequential villain compared to other antagonists in the series. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/heat--end.bsky.social/post/3lstcbyxunc2m">Lillie on BlueSky</a>, in reaction to the Subway Slammer's dialogue, wrote: "this looks like something someone would edit onto the textbox just as a joke".</p>
<p>Others find the absurdity of the Subway Slammer hilarious it seems. <a href="https://x.com/EXILEDpepsii/status/1939423712501272627">Memes are flooding online spaces</a>, with folks placing the Subway Slammer well above other antagonists from other properties.</p>
<p>Now you might think that people making memes about a Subway Slammer are a little bit out of line right? Persona games have featured themes of real-world problems, and the Subway Slammer is no different! <a href="https://japantoday.com/category/crime/%27bumping-men%27-are-a-uniquely-japanese-class-of-criminals-that-are-hard-to-deal-with">According to Japan Today</a>, "the severity of the bump - or in some cases even a punch - can vary quite a bit as does the purpose, whether releasing some sort of aggression, as a form of molestation, or in an attempt to claim the victim damaged an item of theirs".</p>

</span></p><p>The problem is you can't necessarily blame people for finding the depiction in P5X ridiculous, in part due to how it is portrayed. Yes, the Subway Slammer does hurt people, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/heat--end.bsky.social/post/3lstcbyzjes2m">but he also states</a>: "the whole Subway is mine for the Slammin'", which let's just say doesn't have the degree of seriousness one would expect. These people aren't making light of real people doing real crimes, it's likely many of them didn't even know about 'bumping men' before they played P5X, but it's hard to take a guy called the Subway Slammer seriously.</p>
<p>This whole thing goes even deeper too. According to P5X writer Yusuke Nitta, the Subway Slammer is a creation of the game's previous writer, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1lnt17q/in_a_deleted_twitter_post_yusuke_nitta_revealed/">kept anonymous in a now-deleted Tweet by Nitta</a>. Nitta stated the writer behind the Subway Slammer was like "the lord of the palace", and assured fans the story will get "more and more interesting from now on".</p>
<p>So the mastermind behind the Subway Slammer is out of a job, but his legacy shall remain forever seared into the hearts and minds of Persona fans. What he's doing these days remains a mystery, but if you ever find yourself catching a train, keep your head on a swivel. You never know if the Subway Slammer is lurking nearby‚Ä¶</p>
