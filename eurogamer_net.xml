            <p>Surprise! A new Friday the 13th-themed video game is on the way.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3890048/new-friday-the-13th-film-and-video-game-in-early-development/">BloodyDisgusting</a>, Horror Inc.'s Robbie Barsamian revealed that not only was a new movie on the cards, but a game - this one a prequel - was also in development.</p>
<p>When I say Barsamian gave us nothing else, I do mean exactly that: <em>nothing</em>. But it should be great news nonetheless for fans of Illfonic's game that died with a whimper after a licensing snarfu shut the 2017 game down at the end of last year.</p>

<p>"I can tell you that a new sequel movie and new sequel game are at the top of our list. It's where most of our energy's going right now. And I can tell you finally we're in a position to deliver on that," said Barsamian.</p>
<p>"While we're not officially announcing with our partners today, both are coming. They're both in the works and they’re both coming."</p>
<p>Illfonic's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/friday-the-13th-the-game">Friday the 13th: The Game</a> launched back in 2017, and, despite a rocky start, proved to be a solidly entertaining - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/friday-the-13th-has-sold-over-1-8m-copies">commercially successful</a> - horror experience. Unfortunately, its development <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lawsuit-will-block-friday-13th-getting-any-new-content-ever-it-sounds-like">ended prematurely</a> in 2018 as a result of a lawsuit relating to the ownership of the Friday the 13th licence. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/friday-the-13th-the-game-dev-bestows-max-power-on-all-players-ahead-of-shutdown">It eventually shut down on 31st December 2024</a>, resulting in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/friday-the-13th-the-game-studio-illfonic-lays-off-staff-as-it-realigns-to-a-refined-strategy">an unspecified number of layoffs as Illfonic "realign[ed] to a refined strategy"</a>.</p>
<p>Gun Interactive, which published the asymmetrical horror, later went on to publish the Texas Chain Saw Massacre game.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/another-friday-the-13th-game-is-on-the-way-and-this-ones-a-prequel]]></content:encoded>

<p>All cosmetic and taunt cases will grant summer 2025 Unusual effects instead of the normal ones until the event ends on 15th September.</p>

<p>Perhaps more surprisingly still, there's a modest number of bug fixes and general tweaks included in the patch, too. This includes some outdated in-game tips, balance changes - including a 30 percent boost to the damage done by mini-sentries - and a fix for dead players being flagged as AFK for "idling during long rounds". Hale, in particular, has had a number of bugs addressed.</p>
<p>For the full list of what's news, head on over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/440/view/526475421347217633">Steam</a>.</p>

Since then, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-releases-team-fortress-2-source-code-opening-door-to-completely-new-fan-made-games">Valve handed over the game's full client and server code to fans</a>, encouraging them to "change, extend or rewrite" TF2 in any non-commercial way possible.

            <p>Battlefield 6's Battle Royale map - complete with all its points of interest (POIs), big and small - has leaked online.</p>
<p>Typically reliable leaker Temporyal has taken to X/Twitter to <a href="https://x.com/temporyal/status/1949441365600797010">share</a> what they purport to be a leaked map of "Lyndon Beach", complete with marina, lighthouse, docks, and a snazzy golf resort.</p>

<p>It should be noted, however, that Temporyal has labelled some points of interest for context themselves, so the final map may look a bit different. However, the dataminer claims this mode is "currently labelled as Battlefield Royale in-game".</p>
<p>There's also 20+ smaller points of interest that include a military base, a water treatment plant, and a new housing development, as well as "hints of a metro system".</p> <div>

<p>It's possible we'll find out more soon enough, although rumour has it the battle royale mode may come some time after the base game's October release, so watch this space.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 has finally been revealed officially, courtesy of a brand-new trailer that premiered on YouTube earlier this week, although a firm release date was not provide. Typing in the disclaimer URL featured in the video takes you to a page that says: "This promotional offer expires October 10, 2025. Code expires October 10, 2027." <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-finally-revealed-with-a-dedicated-multiplayer-reveal-coming-next-week">This indicates that pre-sell offers end on October 10, and that a release date for Battlefield 6 may be October 11, 2025</a>.</p>
<p>The trailer ended with a date for an upcoming multiplayer reveal, which will take place on 31st July.</p>
<p>At this point, we know a lot about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-details-including-an-october-release-date-leak-ahead-of-official-reveal">Battlefield 6 ahead of its October release date</a>. Leaks from the Battlefield Labs tests have revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-leak-confirms-return-of-fan-favourite-mode">Rush will be coming back to Battlefield 6</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-single-player-campaign-details-leak-online">single player details have spilled out into the internet</a>, and a variety of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-most-important-leaks-battlefield-6">weapons that'll be usable in the full release have made their way online, too</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leaks-keep-on-coming-this-time-its-the-battle-royale-map]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Another day, another AI-generated "slop" accusation, this time against Blizzard and its upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-immortal">Diablo Immortal</a> x <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a> crossover event.</p>
<p>In a thread on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1m5v4d1/diablo_x_hearthstone_colab_is_ai_generated/">Reddit</a>, later picked up by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fans-claim-blizzards-new-diablo-immortal-x-hearthstone-art-was-made-with-generative-ai/">PC Gamer</a>, redditor Ipyreable believes they've spotted an image with telltales signs of generative AI. At the time of writing, over 4,400 people have upvoted the post.</p>
<p>Given Hearthstone's fantasy leanings, it would be fair to presume a make-believe world embodies mystical things that don't align with the real world we live in, but I don't think there's many people who'd be prepared to defend an ear with three conchas (yes, I did indeed have to look that word up. You're welcome).</p>

<p>Appending an image with several questionable features, including a hand that fades into a wall, mirrored/reversed card art, and that strange ear, of course, the OP wrote: "Guess $158 pets aren't enough to pay an artist to draw the image for their colab lmao".</p>
<p>The $158 refers to Hearthstone's first ever cosmetic pet, King Krush, which is locked behind a "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQVMosqrrek">gambling mechanism</a>" which requires you to spend your real life money.</p> <div>

<p>"Well, let's keep calling them out for this shit. If they're not going to pay artists, users are going to grumble. That's just how it is as well," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1m5v4d1/comment/n4ewxar/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> one player, to which another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1m5v4d1/comment/n4ex6vq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">replied</a>: "Less grumbling, and more 'stop buying things with real money'. Can do both, but the latter is the only thing that gets brought up in yearly budget meetings with the money goblins."</p>
<p>"The sad reality is that most users won’t notice or care much at all," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1m5v4d1/comment/n4fmtb9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> someone else. "It’s better to focus on supporting companies and creators who make their own shit. Easier to get people excited for something new rather than try to diminish their attachment to something comfortable and familiar."</p>
<p>Activision Blizzard has yet to comment publicly on the accusations and, at the time of writing, the artwork remains online.</p>
<p>At the start of the month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">Microsoft announced around 9000 employees would be laid off</a>, including roughly 200 staff from King. Now, in a new report, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/candy-crush-developer-king-reportedly-replacing-laid-off-staff-with-ai-tools-they-helped-to-build">sources state King is reportedly replacing laid off staff with AI tools they helped to build</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-are-once-again-accusing-activision-blizzard-of-using-ai-generated-art-in-diablo-immortal-x-hearthstone-event-marketing-materials]]></content:encoded>
