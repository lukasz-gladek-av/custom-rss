            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> will release on PC next month, according to a trailer posted too early on the PlayStation YouTube channel and since removed.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-gets-confirmed-pc-release-and-goddess-of-victory-nikke-dlc">PC version of the action game was announced back in February</a> but without a full date. Now we know it will launch on 11th June across Steam and the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>The PC version will come with a number of extras, including an unlocked framerate, higher resolution environment textures, DLSS 4 and FSR 3, ultrawide monitor support, and more.</p>

<p>Further, there will be a new boss fight against cyber warrior Mann, as well as 25 new costumes for protagonist Eve.</p>
<p>Additional content from the console release will likely be included, like the NieR: Automata DLC and photo mode.</p>
<p>More DLC based on Shift Up's other big franchise Goddess of Victory: Nikke is also set to arrive on console alongside the PC release (and presumably on PC too), though it's not part of the leaked trailer - but is in the trailer above.</p>
<p>Shift Up stated in a financial report from February it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-pc-sales-expected-to-exceed-console-says-shift-up">expects the PC version to exceed console sales</a>.</p>
<p>"In the AAA game market, PC devices have a higher market share than consoles, so we expect the performance of the PC version to exceed that of the console version," the company said. "We are particularly observing trends such as the significant expansion of the single-player action game market in the Asian gaming industry."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-stellar-blade-on-ps5-pro-a-simple-but-hugely-effective-upgrade">game received a PS5 Pro patch</a> in time for the new console's release, which Digital Foundry described as a "hugely effective upgrade". Soon we'll be able to see how the PC version compares.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
