            <p>Supergiant Games has confirmed it hasn't recast any actors for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, following accusations from the voice actor of Athena the studio is unwilling to utilise the SAG-AFTRA interim agreement.</p>
<p>The US actors' union is currently on strike due to concerns over the use of AI in the games industry, but an interim agreement is in place to ensure acting work can still continue until a full agreement is signed.</p>
<p>Marin Miller, the voice behind Athena in both Hades and Hades 2, has accused Supergiant of recasting the character because the studio "refused to flip to an interim".</p>

<p>"It's possible you may hear me get recast in a particular game that is very popular," they wrote on social media. "If I am, it was not because I stepped away from the character willingly. It's because the employer refused to flip to an interim."</p>
<p>And while they didn't explicitly mention Supergiant, their follow up post wasn't subtle: "It would be SUPER helpful if you wrote a GIANT email asking them to flip for their actors."</p>

</span></p><p>Supergiant has responded with a lengthy statement, confirming it has not re-cast any characters, but noted its games have not been subject to SAG-AFTRA contracts "for a variety of reasons".</p>
<p>"Voice talent has been integral to each of our games," the statement begins. "Recently, questions arose here about how we work with our voice talent, which we want to address."</p>
<p>Supergiant boasts it offers "the strongest AI protections in the industry to our talent, as we think their work is irreplaceable".</p>
<p>It continues: "Our games are intentionally made by human beings; no generative AI is being used in the creation of the voiceover, artwork, or any other content that goes into them.</p>
<p>"We have not re-cast any of our characters in Hades 2, and wish to keep working with each and every member of our wonderful cast.</p>
<p>"We have respected and will continue to respect any actor needing to pause work during the ongoing SAG-AFTRA video game strike. While none of our games have ever been subject to SAG-AFTRA contracts for a variety of reasons, we wish SAG-AFTRA the best in their negotiations to compel larger signatory studios to provide the kinds of protections we think actors deserve."</p>
<p>It's unclear what the reasons are for not using SAG-AFTRA contracts, though many of the voice actors from Hades 2 are either in-house staff or British (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>'s Ben Starr, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>'s Colin Ryan, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s Amelia Tyler) and therefore not part of the US union. Or perhaps the studio believes its own protections are enough.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Supergiant for more information.</p>

</span></p><p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marinmmiller.com/post/3likhkirnp22q">follow up thread</a>, Miller emphasised their reliance on SAG-AFTRA for protection, noting this is the seventh month of the strike. "SAG-AFTRA contracts are protected by their legal staff - I can't afford a lawyer without the union," they wrote.</p>
<p>"Clients keep asking me, 'If we include a no-AI rider, will you work non-union or on a 2020 agreement?' Will you be willing to cover the costs of my legal fees if you violate my agreement? Why are you refusing to sign a contract I can enforce?"</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">SAG-AFTRA strike began in July last year</a>, with AI usage the primary concern of the union.</p>
<p>"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members," SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher said in a statement. "Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live - and work - with, we will be here, ready to negotiate."</p>
<p>Audrey Cooling, a spokesperson for the video game producers that have signed the existing Interactive Media Agreement, responded: "We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions. Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA's concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry."</p>
<p>At the start of the year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why">Eurogamer spoke with celebrated voice actor Jennifer Hale</a> (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, Bayonetta 3) about the strike and why it's taking so long to reach a resolution.</p>
<p>"It's a huge issue for all of us and the repercussions are vast," she says. "So to me, it makes sense that everyone needs to take their time. As performers - and we saw this in the writers strike and the theatrical contract strike - we're just the canary in the coal mine."</p>
<p>The news follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-second-major-update-adds-god-of-war-but-still-no-full-release-date">second major update to Hades 2</a> revealed yesterday, as the game remains in early access, without a full release date.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/among-us">Among Us</a> developer Innersloth has announced Among Us 3D for PC, with a Steam Next Fest demo set to debut next week.
</p>
<p>
This 3D, first-person version of the game isn't brand new, however. Virtual reality headset fans will notice this is very much Among Us VR without the VR.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, Among Us 3D features crossplay with Among Us VR (though not, unsurprisingly, with the original 2D game). Essentially, this new version of the VR version allows a much wider 'flatscreen' PC audience to join in.

<p>
Otherwise, this is the Among Us you know and have probably played before, now with an additional dimension. The game caters for between four and 10 players, and of course lets you customise your bean with hats.
</p>
<p>A new Stardust currency will be introduced to let you acquire more cosmetic items for your bean. Post-launch, the game will add new modes, tasks, collaborations, and additional limited time events. As well as more hats.
</p>
<p>
There's no full release date for Among Us 3D yet, and no word of it appearing outside of PC at all. Still, if you're interested, and if you're a Steam user, you should probably keep an eye on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3168600/Among_Us_3D/">Steam page</a> for when its demo arrives as part of Steam Next Fest in just a couple of days.

            <p>
There've been strong hints a new Tony Hawk project is in the works for some time now, but it looks like an official announcement could finally be looming - based on a sneaky tease that's appeared in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>'s latest map.
</p>
<p>
Hints that Activision might be looking to revive its dormant skating franchise first emerged last September, when Tony Hawk <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-has-been-talking-to-activision-again-as-pro-skater-25th-anniversary-looms">revealed he'd "been talking to [the publisher] again"</a>. That was followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mystery-tony-hawk-remaster-now-mentioned-by-pro-skater-involved-in-the-game-even-though-activision-hasnt-announced-it-yet">pro skateboarder Tyshawn Jones' claims earlier this month</a> that he was "in a Tony Hawk coming out... a new one they're remastering".
</p>
<p>
And it now looks like Activision may finally be readying to make things official. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Season 02 Reloaded update went live earlier today, introducing a remastered version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-2">Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</a>'s skatepark-themed multiplayer map, Grind.
</p>

<figcaption>And there's a Black Ops 6's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles collaboration too.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FeOzkKmOtY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Although the skatepark serves as Grind's focal point, the map also hosts several other notable areas - including a skate-themed store that appears to be teasing some big things. To the rear of the unit hangs a large TV screen showing the date 03.04.25, alongside the unmistakable branding Activision used for 2020's well-received <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> 1+2 remake.
</p>
<p>
The obvious inference is that Activision will be announcing its new Tony Hawk project on 4th March this year (or possibly 3rd April, if it's suddenly come over all European). And as to what it'll be revealing, it's hard not to suspect - given the branding and Tyshawn Jones' previous talk of "remastering" - we could be looking at an announcement of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</a>+4.
</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-cid="bafyreid4wabt7japu6ebocfbrohsw526xy5f6bd2ydmd54wi3wra7gjz3u" data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:bpwpx7kycm6rmuksl4ty7psh/app.bsky.feed.post/3limtknm7es2x">— Charlie Intel (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bpwpx7kycm6rmuksl4ty7psh?ref_src=embed">@charlieintel.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bpwpx7kycm6rmuksl4ty7psh/post/3limtknm7es2x?ref_src=embed">February 20, 2025 at 5:41 PM</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

Tony Hawk himself previously revealed a Pro Skater 3+4 remake had been in the works at one point following the success of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2. However, plans were reportedly scuppered when Activision merged developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard, turning it into support studio for the Diablo franchise and other Blizzard games.
</p>
<p>
Whatever Activision is teasing, it doesn't look like we'll have too long to wait before everything is revealed. And in the meantime, there's always Black Ops 6's Season 02 Reloaded update, which - alongside its new Grind map - is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-calling-on-the-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">playing host to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>.
