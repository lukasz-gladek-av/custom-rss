            <p>
A year and a half after Microsoft's purchase of Activision Blizzard for $69bn, the US Federal Trade Commission's continuing attempts to block the deal might finally have come to an end following the 9th Circuit Court's decision to deny its appeal of a 2023 lower court ruling.
</p>
<p>
The FTC has been battling Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard since it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-near-deal-to-buy-call-of-duty-maker-activision-blizzard-report">proposed in 2022</a>, arguing - in an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ftc-suing-to-block-microsofts-69bn-activision-blizzard-acquisition">antitrust lawsuit filed in December that year</a> - the deal would "harm competition in multiple dynamic and fast-growing gaming markets." After a substantial amount of legal back and forth throughout 2023, the US courts (alongside regulatory bodies around the world) cleared the way for Microsoft's deal to proceed, and proceed it did.
</p>
<p>
However, despite the fact <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">Microsoft's acquisition was completed in October 2023</a>, the FTC has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ftc-resumes-case-against-microsofts-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard">continued to petition the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals</a>, asking it to overturn a lower court's July 2023 decision <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ftcs-final-attempt-to-block-microsofts-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard-has-failed">not to issue a preliminary injunction halting Microsoft's deal</a>. However, as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/microsoft-wins-ftc-appeal-challenging-69-bln-activision-blizzard-deal-2025-05-07/">reported by Reuters</a>, the 9th Circuit Court has now upheld the earlier ruling, saying the lower court "applied the correct legal standards" and that the FTC failed to provide sufficient evidence Microsoft's deal would lessen competition.
</p>
<p>
In order to pursue its case further, the FTC would need to convince the US Supreme Court to overturn the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling, or it could resume its own internal administrative action that was put on hold in 2023 pending the 9th Circuit's decision. But with a new US administration in power and a new Trump-appointed chairman helming the FTC, the agency's focus may now be elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
As for Microsoft, it has been reaping the benefits of its $69bn acquisition since the deal was finalised in 2023; the company's Q1 2025 financial report showed a substantial 61 percent year-on-year increase in Xbox content and services revenue, largely thanks to Activision Blizzard.

            <p>
A day after dropping jaws and making the recently anounced delay even tougher to bare, Rockstar has confirmed GTA 6's hugely impressive second trailer was a mix of "gameplay and cutscenes" captured "entirely in-game" on a PlayStation 5.
</p>
<p>
GTA 6's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-second-trailer-is-here">second trailer dropped earlier this week</a>, offering a closer look at its world - which includes the return of the Miami-inspired Vice City - and its sprawling cast of characters than we saw in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-will-release-on-xbox-series-xs-and-playstation-5-in-2025">2023's scene-setting first showing</a>. Rockstar subsequently released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-trailer-2-analysed">detailed character breakdowns</a> and dozens upon dozens of screenshots for eager fans to scrutinise still further.
</p>
<p>
Inevitably, plenty of chatter immediately ensued, some of it lauding the incredible amount of detail on display, some of it frantically sharing screen captures of Jason's rippling torso, and some of it casting doubt on the little note at the end of the trailer claiming it was all captured on PS5. At the very least, people speculated, Rockstar must have <em>surely</em> meant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>?

<p>
But the developer has now moved to quell any lingering doubts, suggesting that, yes, everything we saw in its most recent trailer was indeed generated by Sony's now nearly five-year-old console, and all of it was in-game. "Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 2 was captured entirely in-game from a PlayStation 5," the studio <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1920181314092765494">confirmed in a statement shared on social media</a>, "comprised of equal parts gameplay and cutscenes."
</p>
<p>
So there you go; let dazzlement and bewonderment be yours. The downside to all this excitement, of course, is that GTA 6 is still some considerable way off following its recent delay. Publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-doubles-down-on-gta-6-release-date-after-delay-rumours">previously</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">repeatedly</a> insisted GTA 6 would launch this autumn, but last week - after months of reports suggesting a delay was likely - Rockstar announced a new release date of 26th May next year, saying it needed "this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve."
</p>
<p>
And while its new release date leaves a big GTA-shaped hole in the 2025 release schedule, it does at least mean publishers previously unwilling to commit to launch dates for their own titles fearing GTA 6's dominance are likely now moving quickly to fill the void. Earlier this year, game execs <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-publishers-talk-challenges-of-gta-6-launch-in-new-report-we-dont-want-to-be-anywhere-near-that">bemoaned the "havoc" Grand Theft Auto 6's lack of a release date</a> was causing, with one saying, "We don't want to be anywhere near that."
</p>
<p>
With a full year still to go until GTA 6's arrival on Xbox Series X/S and PS5, it might be some time before Rockstar reveals more. But for those keeping track, here's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">everything we know so far</a>.
