            <p>
The latest <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> game did not perform well for publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, it's been claimed.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, which launched last autumn to a mixed response from fans, resulted in "large losses" for the company, <a href="https://kabutan.jp/news/marketnews/?b=n202503130535">Kabutan analyst Hideki Yasuda stated</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ffxvi-has-apparently-sold-3-5-million-copies-could-be-old-numbers-read-op.1133091/">ResetEra</a>/<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-sales-financial-report-large-loss-square-enix-sequel-unlikely/">TheGamer</a>).
</p>
<p>
Officially, Square Enix is yet to comment on Double Exposure's performance - and there's been no word on Double Exposure's sales figures pubicly at all. Deck Nine, the game's developer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-studio-deck-nine-makes-more-cuts-to-staff">previously announced layoffs at the studio in the wake of the game's launch</a>, and it's unclear what's next for the franchise - despite Double Exposure ending with a message stating that protagonist Max Caulfield would "return".

<p>
Last week, Square Enix issued its most <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/25q3earnings.pdf">recent financial results</a> - which largely focus on the sales of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake and the successful launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> expansion Dawntrail. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps tellingly, there's no notice of how Life is Strange: Double Exposure sold. Instead, Square Enix simply says that its HD gaming division's revenues had fallen due to the fact that unnamed "new titles generated lower sales"  than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster and Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince did over the same period during the previous year.
</p>
<p>
Square Enix doesn't state what the new titles that underperformed were, but does say that the launch of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D helped offset these losses, as it had performed better than initially expected.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Yasuda and Square Enix for more detail. The company is yet to release a transcript of the financial briefing that includes shareholder questions.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposures-first-two-chapters-are-mostly-good-but-making-fans-pay-extra-to-play-early-is-a-huge-mistake">Life is Strange: Double Exposure launched amidst a major backlash from fans</a> upset at how the game handled the ongoing storyline of returning protagonist Max Caulfield, and the impact of players' choice at the beginning of Life is Strange 1. 
</p>
<p>
The situation turned uglier when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-fans-upset-after-square-enix-removes-reddit-posts-featuring-leaked-content-anonymous-developer-comments">Square Enix removed leaked development material from a popular Life is Strange fan reddit</a>, including posts by several anonymous commenters who provided proof they worked at Deck Nine, and who made a number of claims regarding how Double Exposure's story had changed through development, shaped by feedback from Square Enix itself. In response, Square Enix said it had acted to remove the content based on "appropriate legal requirements" for "intellectual property violations".
</p>
<p>
"Like its own hero's dabbling with time travel, Life is Strange: Double Exposure highlights the troubles of trying to revisit old memories, while raising unanswered questions about the future," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review">Eurogamer's Life is Strange: Double Exposure review</a>.

            <p>It now seems even more likely that Bethesda's current Xbox console exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> will launch on PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, a new work-in-progress Creation which adds decals to the game's main ship was listed on <a href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/5eb39a17-916a-4220-85ff-b710174e184f/WIP___Ship_Decals/details">Bethesda's Starfield mod website</a>, featuring a PlayStation logo joining the usual PC and Xbox decals.</p>

<p>This creation now appears to have been pulled from the website, adding credibility to its upcoming PS5 status, however a screenshot showing that PlayStation icon can be seen via a screenshot shared on the Starfield subreddit (below).</p>

After all, Xbox games coming to PlayStation is hardly new news.</p>

<p>On Shattered Space's debut last year, we awarded Starfield's first expansion three stars.</p>

<p>"Your passion and dedication to the game and its community have meant the world to us, and we are committed to providing visibility and updates throughout the transition process," reads the <a href="https://starwarshunters.com/news/sunset-on-vespaara/">post announcing the end of Star Wars: Hunters</a>.</p>
<p>In light of this news, season five of Star Wars: Hunters will be extended by three weeks, beginning next week, on 25th March.</p>
<p>A final free content update will then be released on 15th April, when in-game purchases will be disabled. As part of this update, new support Hunter Tuya will join the fray. "Tuya will be available and playable for all users immediately at no cost, along with a slate of additional in-game content," the Star Wars: Hunters team state. "We will continue to run a final Ranked Mode leaderboard for players to compete in and run all battlefields and game modes in rotation."</p>
<p>Finally, on 1st October, the game's servers will go offline and Star Wars: Hunters will no longer be playable.</p>
<p>"Thank you for being a part of this incredible journey and for the time you’ve spent playing Star Wars: Hunters," the post closes.</p>

<p>But, while the sun sets on one Star Wars game, it will rise on another.
