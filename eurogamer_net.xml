            <p>A concept album for the now-cancelled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/earthblade">Earthblade</a> from the studio behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/celeste">Celeste</a> has been released by composer Lena Raine.</p>
<p>Back in January, Extremely OK Games cancelled its "2D explor-action" game, which would have followed up the widely celebrated platformer Celeste.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/celeste-devs-show-first-look-at-earthblade">first look at Earthblade</a> was shown in December 2022 at The Game Awards, but nothing has been shown since. As such, this new album from Raine provides a taste of what we could have expected.</p>

<p>Raine worked on the soundtracks of Minecraft, Celeste and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/guild-wars-2">Guild Wars 2</a>, as well as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a> and Chicory: A Colorful Tale.</p>
<p>Earthblade - Across the Bounds of Fate is available to listen to on <a href="https://radicaldreamland.bandcamp.com/album/earthblade-across-the-bounds-of-fate">Bandcamp</a> and can be purchased in full for $7.</p>
<p>It's typical of Raine's style, particularly with the focus on striking melody and a mixture of electronic and real instruments. The beautiful track Verdant Mysteries includes a strange vocal too, while the eight-minute long Lineage is a mesmeric piano piece and the opening Accept Your Fate begins with Vangelis-esque chords before a mournful tone takes over.</p>
<p>"[Earthblade] was in development for a number of years, and over that period of time I wrote quite a few pieces - both conceptual, and implemented tracks - that began to depict the world of the game," wrote Raine in the album's description. "Because we'll never get a chance to tell that story in game form, I decided to cobble together every bit of music I'd written for the game to the point of its cancellation in order to tell my own version of it.</p>
<p>"Across the Bounds of Fate, more so than a soundtrack, is a concept album. The music I wrote for the game is highly dynamic, in the tradition of what I wrote for Celeste. I took it many steps beyond, in ways that temporally-constrained pieces of music can't really do justice. But I did my best to arrange them into the emotional arc of their progression, much like I would for any soundtrack release."</p>
<p>Raine's inspiration includes the aforementioned Vangelis (best known for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a>), as well as Joe Hisaishi's score for Studio Ghibli's Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind, and Yoko Kanno's work on animes Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell.</p>
<p>Said Raine: "For now, tuck in and enjoy around 30 minutes of music that paint the picture of what I hoped Earthblade might be."</p>
<p>Extremely OK Games studio director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/celeste-studio-cancels-2d-explor-action-game-earthblade-nearly-four-years-after-its-announcement">Maddy Thorson called the cancellation of Earthblade</a> a "huge, heartbreaking, and yet relieving failure".</p>
<p>One factor leading to the cancellation was a disagreement about the IP rights of Celeste between Thorson and Noel Berry on one side, and studio founding member Pedro Medeiros on the other.</p>
<p>However, Thorson stressed "Pedro isn't to blame", adding: "In fact the split with him has given us the clarity to see that we have lost our way, and the opportunity to admit defeat. I feel many ways about it, but one big feeling is undoubtedly relief."</p>
<p>Thorson and Berry are now prototyping again for a new project. In the meantime, we have Raine's score as a lasting reminder of what Earthblade could have been.</p>
<p>"Melody encompasses so much of how I relate to music that it's hard for me to just write a piece that sinks solely into texture and rhythm. I do it, obviously, but I'm always humming something on top," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-composer-lena-raine-on-her-musical-style-im-a-big-fan-of-musical-metaphor">Raine told Eurogamer in a discussion about her compositional style</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-baldurs-gate-3-mod-gives-you-another-way-to-romance-sultry-vampire-astarion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>If you enjoyed your flirtations (and more) with Astarion in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, and want more, well, you can now romance the sultry vampire in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>.</p>
<p>This new line of romance comes thanks to the fan made Baldur's Village mod, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/romanceable-baldurs-gate-3-companions-are-being-modded-into-stardew-valley">which we first got wind of last year</a>.</p>
<p>"A new village has recently been built north of Pelican Town, and its new residents seem... rather unusual," <a href="https://x.com/XunHe1145/status/1898186199790981284">reads a post on social media</a>, announcing the mod's arrival.</p>

<p>The Baldur's Village mod is described as a "large expansion mod for Stardew Valley". Along with the ability to romance and eventually marry Astarion, this mod also adds new stores including a tavern, and other Baldur's Gate 3-inspired characters.</p>
<p>While Astarion is the only romanceable character right now, more are planned for down the line, with Halsin's storyline the next focus</p>
<p>"Once completed, we will shift our attention to expanding the mod's world-building, background stories, and gameplay by introducing new features and items," the Baldur's Village creators explained.</p>
<p>The mod's creators also assure that Baldur's Village will not "alter or break the original game", and you won't need to start a new save to play.</p>
<p>Interested? You can <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/30888">find the Baldur's Village mod on Nexus</a>.</p>

<p>As for Stardew Valley, as of December last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-continues-its-wholesome-farming-dominance-with-latest-sales-milestone">the farming sim has sold in excess of 41m copies across platforms</a>. Of those 41m, over half are on PC, with 26m copies sold. Meanwhile, the Nintendo Switch accounts for 7.9m Stardew Valley sales.</p>
<p>Last year, creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone also released Stardew Valley's bumper 1.6 update, which essentially boosted the game to an almost 2.0 status. This beefy update introduced a vast number of features to the base game, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-16-update-is-finally-here-with-some-impressively-lengthy-patch-notes">new NPC dialogues, home renovations and turtle pets</a>. This update was released on PC first, before becoming available across all platforms.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
