            <p>A level designer laid off from Highguard developer Wildlight believes the free-to-play shooter's difficulties stem from having "leaned too far into the competitive scene".</p>
<p>Acknowledging that the "really big spotlight" placed on the game following its reveal at The Game Awards additionally added pressure, senior level designer Alex Graner talked candidly on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3wuWRHLZeY">Quad Damage podcast</a> about the "constantly evolv[ing]" game, suggesting that his "biggest fear [came] when [the studio] decided to go full-in on 3v3".</p>

<p>"I can only speak to my side of it as a level designer, but when I joined [Wildlight], it was trying to figure out this new, ambitious game, and this team is always pushing the boundaries," he said, as transcribed by <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/highguard/too-sweaty">PCGN</a>. "You don't strive to create something that doesn't work out, but it happens, unfortunately. Throughout development, we really leaned into the competitive side of it, and that was always one of my biggest fears as a player.</p><p>"3v3 duos is always the sweatiest version of anything like battle royale, objective modes, wingman, you know it, you name it," he added. "It requires such a high intensity of communication with your team, and team play, that it doesn't leave much room for casualness. I think that was the biggest thing that turned a lot of players off Highguard."</p>
<p>Graner said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> came just as battle royales were a "kind of an up-and-coming mode" and was "really easy to understand after you played one game", which is why it was so successful. Conversely, Highguard was a little more complex.</p>
<p>"Highguard has all these different rules and stages, it's like, 'Oh, you want to loot, now we've got to chase this objective, now we have to plant this objective, now it's overtime… It has all these rules, which I think works at a really high level, but when players are first coming in it's a lot to grasp," he admitted.</p>
<p>"On top of all that, because it was 3v3, that kind of game just requires high-skill movement and shooting, which is already a pretty high [bar to] entry as well. So if you just have a few bad games or your teammates aren't sticking together, you're just going to get rolled, and it's very hard to 1v2 in our game.</p>
<p>"It's all designed to be a team-based shooter. I think that was the biggest thing. People just kind of turned it off because they didn't have the team."</p>
<p>Just yesterday (27th February), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-pulled-highguards-funding-two-weeks-after-launch">a new report alleged that Tencent pulled funding from developer Wildlight just two weeks after the game's launch</a>. Staff were called to an all-hands meeting, and then told that there would be layoffs as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> had pulled funding as Highguard had seemingly failed to meet whatever metrics Tencent had for it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-not-shutting-down-following-wildlight-layoffs-with-a-core-group-of-members-left-to-support-game">Wildlight publicly confirmed layoffs a day later</a> but wouldn't specify numbers, and it insisted "a core group of developers" remained to work on the game. It's thought fewer than 20 people remain at Wildlight today.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-reportedly-funded-by-tencent">Tencent's role in Highguard's development</a> was, curiously, kept quiet. It wasn't until several days after the layoffs that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-reportedly-funded-by-tencent">Game File confirmed Tencent's involvement</a>. The reason for the secrecy around the company's involvement is unclear.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>' DLC is so big, it's "basically like a sequel".</p>
<p>Talking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVTWtmGH-Fc">Slayers Club livestream</a>, game director Hugo Martin said that while he understands that "it's been a while since we shipped the main game", players will be rewarded for their patience with "a ton of new stuff".</p>

<p>"It's massive. It's so big," he said (thanks,<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/doom-the-dark-ages-dlc-is-freaking-huge-says-director-its-basically-like-a-sequel/"> GR+</a>). "I know it's been a while since we've shipped the main game and you're waiting for the DLC, but just know that it's freaking huge. It's basically a sequel. That's what it feels like. It's just ginormous. I love that."</p>
<p>As for what's coming in that update? Well, Martin was a little more coy about that, but we did learn that the DLC is "nothing like" the main game, and could boast a spear-like weapon.</p>
<p>"The DLC is nothing like this," Martin said as he played the main game on the stream. "I can't say too much, I'm just going to say that what I've been playing… I haven't been playing like this."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-biggest-launch-in-id-software-history">Doom: The Dark Ages was the "biggest launch" in id Software's history</a>, with three million players making their way into the fiery pits of hell since the game's release. To put that into more context, Bethesda says Doom: The Dark Ages reached this number seven times faster than Doom Eternal.</p><p>"As a parent, the game I'm most concerned about these days is probably something like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a>. By contrast, Doom feels like an entirely known and understood entity. Let's savour it," we wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-review">Eurogamer's Doom: The Dark Ages review</a>. "Here's a slice of pure gaming charisma that has come to us, unfrazzled, from a more innocent time."</p>

            <p>Just days after Sony decided to close remake masters Bluepoint Games, a new report claims that wasn't PlayStation itself that stonewalled the idea of a Bloodborne remake by Bluepoint, but developer FromSoftware.</p>
<p>Despite calling Bluepoint Games "an incredibly talented team" full of "technical expertise" which has "delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-closes-acclaimed-demons-souls-and-shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-studio-bluepoint-despite-acknowledging-it-had-delivered-exceptional-experiences-for-the-playstation-community">Sony shut down the studio last week</a>, impacting around 70 employees. At the time, a spokesperson said the decision was made "following a recent business review".</p>

<p>Sony - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buys-demons-souls-remake-developer-bluepoint-games">which acquired Bluepoint in 2021</a> - put the studio to work on a live-service God of War game, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">project it ultimately cancelled last year</a>, after Bluepoint released Demon's Souls as a launch exclusive for the PS5 in 2020. It was always hoped that Bluepoint would, at some point, be instructed to do the same for Bloodborne.</p><p>Now, a new report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-27/sony-s-bluepoint-pitched-bloodborne-remake-before-closure">Bloomberg</a> claims that Bluepoint did, in fact, approach FromSoft in early 2025, pitching a remake of the 2015 game. It's said that "the studio was told that the numbers made sense, but FromSoftware didn't want it to happen".</p>
<p>Interestingly, former president of Sony Interactive Entertainment <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-hasnt-playstation-done-anything-new-with-bloodborne-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-theory">Shuhei Yoshida posited the same this time last year</a>, saying: "Bloodborne is one of the most popular asks on my Twitter/X. And the people wonder why we haven't really done anything... it should be easy, right?</p>
<p>"Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, what he created. So I think he is interested but he's so successful and he's so busy, so he cannot do it himself, and he doesn't want anyone else to touch it."</p>
<p>After this rejection, Bluepoint allegedly pitched an updated version of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> remake to Sony, as well as a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> spin-off, but these ideas were also turned down, with Bloomberg suggesting that other studios were "concerned about dedicating significant resources to another team's project".</p><p>Bloodborne has long been considered one of the greatest games ever made. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloodborne-review">We gave it an Essential, writing</a>: " it will be a painfully long time until I play anything else that matches up to Bloodborne's breadth of vision, generosity of content, and - yes - genius".</p>
