            <p>
Lego is working to build up its in-house game development, the company's boss has revealed. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2f4944f4-8255-4115-8838-d2bde03588cf">The Financial Times</a>, Lego boss Niels Christiansen said the company was increasing its focus on video game experiences created by its own teams, following years of partnerships with outside companies. 
</p>
<p>
"We can definitely say, as long as we're under the Lego brand, we can cover experiences for kids of all ages, digital or physical," Christiansen said. "[In-house game development] is something we're building up. We have made quite a few investments in the future – I'd almost rather overinvest. That's the benefit of being family-owned and long term."
</p>
<p>
For over a decade, Lego games were mostly made by British studio TT Games, with a popular tie-in to a big movie franchise released every year.
</p>
<p>
For 15 years, TT Games pumped out dozens of annual Lego games with a familiar formula, based on Star Wars, Harry Potter, Marvel and DC characters. It also mounted the ambitious toys-to-life effort <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-dimensions">Lego Dimensions</a>. 
</p>
<p>
But that era of Lego gaming is largely over, with only one entry - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga">Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a> - in the past six years. TT Games is reportedly still working on a further title, but it is not expected in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Since then, Lego has licensed its brand to a wider set of developers - most notably <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> maker Epic Games, and the recent launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-review">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>, co-developed by Guerilla Games and published by Sony. Fortnite now has a deep integration with Lego, with minifigure versions of most of its digital skins, two large Lego game modes, and countless mini-games made by Lego itself and fans.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a>, now rebranded to Lego Fortnite Odyssey, is a Minecraft-y offering regularly played by around 50,000 people concurrently within the main Fortnite client. Last December, the company also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-fortnite-brick-life-is-a-major-new-social-game-mode-that-sounds-a-bit-like-the-sims">launched Lego Fortnite Brick Life</a>, a gentle life sim and house decoration game, to a smaller audience.
</p>
<p>
For now, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-lego-horror-cheerful-games-and-others-we-just-cant-get-into">The Lego Group has a small team of designers building and launching game concepts within Fortnite</a>, which now has an impressive replication of Lego bricks and physics baked into Epic's Unreal Engine. It'll be interesting to see what's next, as the wait for TT Games' next old-school Lego game continues.
</p>
<p>"I hope it will never be done," head of Lego gaming at The Lego Group Remi Marcelli told Eurogamer last year, of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-future-of-lego-fortnite-i-hope-it-will-never-be-done">the company's big Fortnite mode, which continues to expand</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Three top Ubisoft employees have appeared in a French court, accused of harassing employees before their departure from the company almost five years ago.
</p>
<p>
The trio includes Serge Hascoet, Ubisoft's previous chief creative officer and right-hand man to company boss Yves Guillemot, plus the former VP of editorial and creative services Tommy Francois, and Guillaume Patrux, a game designer and director.
</p>
<p>
All three deny sexually and psychologically harassing and humiliating employees during their tenures at the company, up until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-more-top-ubisoft-executives-resign-as-publisher-renews-commitment-to-fostering-an-environment-its-employees-can-be-proud-of">they resigned or were dismissed in 2020</a>.
</p>
<p>
Details discussed during the court appearance this week (thanks, <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250310-former-ubisoft-bosses-on-trial-in-france-over-alleged-harassment-1">France24</a>) include accusations of racist comments and behaviour by Hascoet, who allegedly asked a Muslim employee if she agreed with the Islamic State terrorist group in the wake of the 2015 Paris terrorist attack. It's alleged that the same staff member had their computer desktop wallpaper changed to that of bacon, and had food placed on their desk during the fasting month of Ramadan.
</p>
<p>
A string of allegations concerning Francois includes him having regularly watched porn in the company's open-plan office, kissing colleagues, and remarking on their appearance by calling them "ugly" or a "slut". Francois specifically is accused of sexual assault for allegedly forcing himself on a young employee during a Christmas party. He also allegedly forced a young employee to perform a headstand while wearing a skirt.
</p>
<p>
Patrux, meanwhile, stands accused of psychological harassment.
</p>
<p>
The trial has now been adjourned until 2nd June after lawyers complained they had not been given long enough with the case's documentation.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Ubisoft for comment.

Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> is suing PlayerAuctions - an online marketplace already targeted in a complaint by Roblox - accusing it of selling "heavily modified" player accounts, items, and virtual currency obtained through hacks and cheats.
</p>
<p>
Take-Two's lawsuit - filed in the US Central District Court of California last week and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/536315/take-two-gta-5-online-black-market-lawsuit">spotted by Polygon</a> - targets PlayerAuctions' Chinese owner Paiao Network Technology. It accuses the company of running a "lawless enterprise", claiming it has "full knowledge" of the alleged "rampant infringement and other unauthorised conduct" happening on its site.
</p>
<p>
"[This] is not a regular online marketplace," reads the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/836607989/Take-Two-PlayerAuctions-lawsuit-via-Polygon">filing</a>. "Instead, [it] runs a sophisticated sales platform and actively recruits 'sellers' skilled at using hacking software and other exploits to create infringing digital goods and to provide illegal 'services' to players of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>." More specifically, Take-Two claims PlayerAuctions contains "thousands of listings for unauthorised, infringing GTA 5 content – including heavily modified player accounts, in-game assets, and virtual currency – all gained by using hacking software, cheats, and technical exploits."
</p>
<p>
Take-Two claims PlayerAuctions sells accounts manipulated through hacking to provide "exorbitantly high game level ranking and in-game currency amounts", as well as content ordinarily only accessible through gameplay or purchases. "At the scale of its website," continues the lawsuit, "PlayerAuctions risks upending the GTA 5 player experience and interferes with the balance and fairness of the game."
</p>
<p>
Take-Two claims it has "repeatedly confronted PlayerAuctions with evidence of infringement and other tortious conduct", but says its cease and desist orders have so far been ignored - all while Paiao Network Technology allegedly continues to reap "millions in revenue" from infringement. Take-Two says it's bringing its complaint to the court in order to "shut down PlayerAuctions' rampant infringing online marketplace, end its corrupt business model, and protect the integrity of GTA 5 for its players."
</p>
<p>
Take-Two is claiming relief for copyright and trademark infringement, and is requesting the court "preliminarily and permanently" prohibits PlayerAuctions from selling accounts, virtual goods, and virtual currency in GTA 5 or any of its other games. Additionally, Take-Two wants PlayerAuctions to be prohibited from "aiding, abetting, contributing to, or otherwise assisting, benefiting or inducing" hacking of its software or infringing its GTA trademarks.
</p>
<p>
Take-Two's lawsuit follows a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/824845348/Roblox-vs-PlayerAuctions-via-Polygon">similar filing against PlayerAuctions by Roblox Corporation last month</a>. The company is also seeking monetary damages, as well as requesting the court prevents PlayerAuctions from buying, selling, and trading Roblox-related products.
