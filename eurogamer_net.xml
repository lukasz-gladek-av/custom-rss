            <p>Tomb Raider 4 - 6 Remastered will restore unused voice lines from Angel of Darkness, and make some quality of life changes to Kurtis Trent's abilities.</p>
<p>Tomb Raider 4 - 6 Remastered includes <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-last-revelation">Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation</a> (1999), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-chronicles">Tomb Raider: Chronicles</a> (2000), and - of course - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-the-angel-of-darkness">Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness</a> (2003). As with the first batch of remastered <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider games</a>, each of the next three games will feature improved visuals that bring new life to environments, characters, and artefacts. There will be the option to toggle between classic and modern graphics as well, much like with Tomb Raider 1 - 3 Remastered.</p>
<p>The Tomb Raider team has now laid out some additional changes and tweaks coming specifically to Angel of Darkness, the series' widely panned entry from the early 2000s. Perhaps these changes will allow Angel of Darkness to rise gloriously from the ashes like a reborn phoenix..?</p>

<p>Let's start with Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness' Kurtis Trent, who is playable for a brief section of the game. Tomb Raider 4 - 6 Remastered will restore Kurtis' ability to wield the Chirugai in-game. He will also be able to project a psychic shield around himself, shoot around corners while making his way about in stealth mode, and sprint like Lara does. Huzzah!</p><p>Meanwhile, the remaster team has restored some unused voice lines from Lara Croft herself and Kurtis. These lines will be able to provide players with "more context" about what is going on, which should help them "better understand the story".</p>
<p>These additional lines of dialogue will also provide a few more hints here and there.</p>
<p>Other quality of life improvements pegged for Angel of Darkness include Werner Von Croy's Notebook now opening automatically the first time Lara wakes up in the derelict railway carriage, with the notebook getting new entries as the game progresses.</p>
<p>"Additionally, some inventory items have been restored, such as Von Croy's cane, which holds a secret that can only be unlocked in the inventory," teases the Tomb Raider 4 - 6 Remastered team.</p>

<p>As for the original trilogy, on its release last year, we awarded the Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered collection four stars, while acknowledging some of the dated qualities.</p>
<p>"I still love this collection, because it's carefully made and lovingly updated, but also awkward, elbowy, frustrating and prone to leaving me stuck. It's a collection that understands that Tomb Raider was absolutely a game about its controls, and it still should be - even if it doesn't quite know how to deliver on that," our Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-i-iii-remastered-review">Eurogamer's Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Desperate Silksong fans believe a new ARG hinting at the long-awaited game's release date has begun, involving the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and a slice of cake.
</p>
<p>
Let's break it down. Two days ago, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> and Silksong co-creator William Pellen updated his social media handle, profile name and picture on X. 
</p>
<p>
His handle is now @everydruidwaswr, his name is now "little bomey" and his profile picture is a slice of cake. It's this slice of cake which fans have now linked to Switch 2.
</p>
<p>
Why? Well, Pellen went on to tweet: "something big is coming. keep your eyes closed tomorrow". Tomorrow meaning the 16th January - which was of course when Switch 2 was announced. 
</p>
<p>
So maybe Pellen was just in the know, as a lot of people were, about the Switch 2 reveal? Or, Silksong fans say, maybe there's more! 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">something big is coming. keep your eyes closed tomorrow</p>â€” little bomey (@everydruidwaswr) <a href="https://twitter.com/everydruidwaswr/status/1879751713621725206?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
A Google reverse image search on the slice of cake image does throw up something odd: that it comes from a recipe page posted on 2nd April 2024. That's exactly a year ahead of 2nd April 2025, when Nintendo will hold a huge Switch 2 Nintendo Direct and unveil the console's game line-up properly.
</p><p>
Could it be deliberate? Over on the Silksong <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1i31gas/what_we_know_so_far_about_the_william_pellen/">reddit</a>, fans say developer Team Cherry has dropped similarly labyrinthine hints previously. Fans also reason that an appearance in the Switch 2 Direct would be a reasonable place for the game to finally materialise. 
</p>
<p>
Silksong's launch made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-moments-set-to-shape-video-games-in-2025">Eurogamer's list of our most anticipated moments of 2025</a> - if it actually launches this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-will-no-longer-launch-in-first-half-of-2023">following years of delays</a>.
</p>
<p>"Silksong is the fast-paced and fluid sequel Hollow Knight deserves," we said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-the-fast-paced-and-fluid-sequel-hollow-knight-deserves">after playing a demo of the game</a> - all the way back in 2019.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Mario Kart fans are pouring over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">yesterday's reveal of a new entry in Nintendo's racing series for Switch 2</a> - and have come up with a few more clues on how the game might play. 
</p>
<p>
Our first look at Mario Kart 9 - or whatever it ends up being called - was, on the surface, a pretty straightforward affair. We saw one racetrack, 12 returning characters and not a lot else.
</p>
<p>
Except for the fact, as we noted yesterday, there are now 24 spaces on the track's starting grid. Huh! Let's hope Nintendo has improved its online servers to allow for 24 players.
</p>
<p>
Overnight, fans have analysed the trailer in more detail - with an eye to working on what Mario Kart 9's main 'gimmick' might be. We've had underwater racing and gliders, anti-gravity tracks, and now... could Mario Kart 9's big change revolve around conserving fuel?
</p><p>
One fan spotted a rather conspicuous fuel tank added to the side of Mario's otherwise familiar kart, labelled "1-UP Fuel". The same fan also pointed to the mysterious glowing power-up seemingly placed outside a pit-stop burger joint - perhaps a fuel-replenishing power-up.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">haven't seen anyone else talk about this but the gimmick of mario kart 9 is definitely a fuel tank<br>karts have conspicuous fuel tanks now and there's something on this track that doesnt look like an item box <br>it'll be a resource you can use freely to boost <a href="https://t.co/bhGnEOe8Xo">pic.twitter.com/bhGnEOe8Xo</a></p>â€” chloe (@payapaberii) <a href="https://twitter.com/payapaberii/status/1879956048762794250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

<p>
Another fan pointed to the presence of a large gas station by the track itself, with a large sign that reads: "Fire Flower Gas Station". 
</p> <div>

<p>
Other changes  noted yesterday include slight tweaks to Mario and Donkey Kong's character designs. (We think they now deliberately look more similar to those seen in the Super Mario Bros. Movie!)
</p>
<p>
