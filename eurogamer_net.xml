            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> has been delayed slightly to implement last minute changes from beta testers.</p>
<p>Back in February, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-gets-steam-release-date-plus-character-creator-and-benchmark-tool-in-advance">Funcom announced a release date of 20th May on Steam</a>. That's now been pushed back to 10th June (with earlier access for pre-orders on 5th June).</p>
<p>In a statement on social media, Funcom explained a major preview beta has been initiated in addition to the game's ongoing Persistent Closed Beta that's provided "invaluable" feedback to ensure the studio can "launch a quality game".</p>

<p>"Thanks to this process, we've concluded that with a bit more time to cook, we can act on a lot more of the feedback we know is important to our beta testers," the statement reads.</p>
<p>"This is not a decision we take lightly, we know everyone is very excited to get playing, but these three extra weeks will give us the time needed to make improvements that will lead to a better gameplay experience from day one."</p>
<p>As a result of the delay, Funcom will launch a large-scale beta weekend next month, with more information expected soon.</p>
<p>"Dune: Awakening is a <em>beast </em>of a game," the studio said. "This is multiplayer survival on a massive scale, and we're making gameplay and technical strides not seen in the genre before. We want to make sure we stick the landing."</p>

</span></p><p>There's no mention in the statement of the game's console release on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, which is expected to follow PC.</p>
<p>Before May was originally confirmed, the game had an "early 2025" release date. The game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakenings-early-2025-release-date-is-looser-than-you-might-think">executive producer Scott Junior told Eurogamer</a>: "I guess it depends how you define early. It could be the first half of '25 - that could be 'early'. So I'll leave it there. It could be the first half of 2025."</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Bertie Purchese came away impressed after going <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-proves-mmos-can-still-be-interesting-and-try-new-things">hands-on with Dune: Awakening</a> at the start of the year, writing: "You can live out your Dune fantasy in the most faithful recreation of Arrakis we've yet seen in a game, pausing as the ground shudders from a nearby sandworm, ducking for cover as a sandstorm blows in, and searching crevices for the secrets of the world hidden within. Dune: Awakening has promise - keep an eye on this one."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Microsoft has announced its next wave of Game Pass titles available in April 2025, including the return of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>, a game you may have heard of. As announced previously, this return also brings with it the PC Game Pass debut of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-arrives-on-pc-game-pass-this-month-for-first-time-in-enhanced-edition">GTA 5's new Enhanced Edition for PC players</a> - the first time the game has been offered in any PC subscription service.
</p>
<p>Also included in these latest additions is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 - the more recent one from 2022 - although you'll only be getting access to that, for now, if you have Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass. It's the same deal as well for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, the turn-based RPG from France that we've been keeping a hopeful eye on.</p>
<p>Here are the list of Xbox Game Pass additions for late April 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grand Theft Auto 5 (Cloud, Console and PC, via Standard, Ultimate and PC) - available now</li>
<li>Neon White (Console, now with Game Pass Standard) - 16th April</li>

As ever, whenever Microsoft giveth, so it taketh away. Games getting the chop this time include Rebellion's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sniper-elite-5">Sniper Elite 5</a> and the Annapurna-published <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/thirsty-suitors">Thirsty Suitors</a>. </p>
<p>
The full list of titles leaving Xbox Game Pass on 30th April are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a Nice Death (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Kona II Brume (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Sniper Elite 5 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>The Last Case of Benedict Fox (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Thirsty Suitors (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>The Rewinder (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to keep playing these games after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to purchase them. On the plus side, Game Pass subscribers get a 20 percent discount before they leave the service.</p>
