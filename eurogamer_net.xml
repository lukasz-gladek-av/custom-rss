            <p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has refuted rumours that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> will launch without physical copies.</p>
<p><a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/">In a recent interview with Variety</a>, Zelnick was asked to comment on previous reporting from <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/397290/gta-6-a-wersja-pudelkowa-sprzedawcy-zwiastuja-smutna-wiadomosc-dla-fanow-fizycznych-wydan.html">PPE</a> which stated that, according to a source, the highly-anticipated release would come out without physical copies in an attempt to curb spoilers from folks obtaining these copies early.</p>
<p>Zelnick responded to Variety: "That's not the plan" - a brief but sharp rebuttal of the prior reporting. So if you're keen on getting your actual hands on a copy of GTA6 day one, you should be in luck.</p>

<p>It's been an interesting period for GTA6. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/police-have-cordoned-off-rockstar-north-after-explosion-reportedly-caused-by-malfunctioning-boiler">Not only did Rockstar North suffer from a boiler explosion earlier this year</a>, but there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fired-employees-at-gta-6-studio-rockstar-denied-interim-pay-by-uk-tribunal-union-highlights-firms-flimsy-grounds-for-defence">an ongoing battle between the developer and fired employees</a>. These employees claim the company is union-busting, whereas Rockstar has claimed unauthorised sharing of confidential material was the reason they were let go. Recently, these impacted employees were denied interim pay pending further investigation by UK tribunal.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">Grand Theft Auto 6 is now set to release in November</a>, following a delay announced by Rockstar and Take Two last year. Don't feel too bad for Rockstar and Take Two though, as last year it also came out that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta5-more-sales-than-brazil-population-220-million">GTA5 had sold more than the population of Brazil</a>.</p>
