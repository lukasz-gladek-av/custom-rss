Two and a half years after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-confirms-new-the-witcher-game-in-development">announcement</a>, CD Projekt finally gave it the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">big reveal treatment</a> late in 2024, confirming Ciri to be the focus this time around. And now Doug Cockle - voice of former series protagonist Geralt of Rivia - has had his say, calling the switch to a new main character, a "really, really interesting move for all kinds of reasons".
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-talks-ciri-fan-reaction-playable-geralt-coyness-and-if-the-game-will-honour-your-previous-choices">shortly after The Witcher 4's reveal</a> last year, CD Projekt called Ciri's promotion to lead "really exciting" in terms of the opportunities it opened up, "by just virtue of who she is [and] what we can do with her in terms of the gameplay as well." And it turns out that's a sentiment Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle shares.
</p>
<p>
"I'm really excited," he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekts-decision-to-go-with-ciri-as-protagonist-for-the-witcher-4-a-really-interesting-move-for-all-kinds-of-reasons-geralt-actor-says">recently revealed to IGN</a>. "I think it's a really good move. I mean, I always thought that continuing the Saga, but shifting to Ciri would be a really, really interesting move for all kinds of reasons. But mostly because of things that happen in the books, which I don't want to give away because people, I want people to go read. So yeah, I think it's really exciting. I can't wait. I can't wait to see what they've done."

<p>
Of course, Cockle is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-of-town-that-was-definitely-doug-cockles-white-haired-monster-hunter-in-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer">now confirmed to be returning as Geralt</a> in The Witcher 4, despite the character's demotion - although it's not currently clear how substantial a role he'll play. The actor had already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-voice-actor-confirms-he-will-be-part-of-the-witcher-4">let slip he'd be "part of" the new game</a> last August- earning himself a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doug-cockle-got-slapped-by-cd-projekt-for-saying-geralt-is-in-the-witcher-4-but-not-as-the-main-character">bit of a slap on the wrist</a> from CD Projekt - and it was finally made official when Geralt popped up at the end of December's reveal trailer to utter a gravelly, "See you on the path".
</p><p>
Unfortunately for impatient sorts, The Witcher 4 is likely still some considerable way off (CD Projekt's hasn't even announced a release year yet), but fans can, at least, get a fresh Cockle fix much sooner. The actor is reprising the role of Geralt of Rivia in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-doug-cockle-starring-animated-witcher-movie-sirens-of-the-deep-gets-february-arrival-date">upcoming animated movie The Witcher: Sirens of The Deep</a>, which joins the streaming service on 11th February.
