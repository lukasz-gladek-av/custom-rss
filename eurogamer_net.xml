            <p>
The US Department of Defense has labelled Chinese megacorp <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> - a huge player in the global video games industry - as a Chinese military company. 
</p>
<p>
Tencent itself has responded to say the label is inaccurate, and a "misunderstanding". 
</p>
<p>
The listing of Tencent as a Chinese military company does not immediately impact its ability to do business in the US, but raises the risk of complications in the future. 
</p>
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337489/tencent-catl-us-defense-department-chinese-military-companies">The Verge</a>, drone company DJI has seen its US imports blocked since it was added to the same list. But other companies, such as Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi, have been added and then removed.
</p>
<p>
In 2020, President Trump issued an executive order which stated that US businesses could not invest in Chinese companies linked to the US military. Trump is set to return to power later this month.
</p>
<p>
"We are not a military company or supplier," Tencent spokesperson Danny Marti said. "Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business. We will nonetheless work with the Department of Defense to address any misunderstanding."
</p>
<p>
Tencent's reach across the global video games industry is enormous. It owns <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> developer Riot Games, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> maker Funcom and UK outfit Sumo Digital, in addition to several of its own companies such as Pok√©mon Unite maker Timi Studios.
</p><p>
In addition, Tencent owns majority stakes in Dying Light developer Techland, Rime studio Tequila Works, plus mobile studios Miniclip and Supercell. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and Unreal Engine maker Epic Games is 35 percent owned by Tencent, while the company also holds notable stakes in FromSoftware, Remedy, Krafton, Paradox, Frontier, Kadokawa, Marvelous, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> and Netmarble.
</p>
<p>
And then there's Ubisoft - another company in which Tencent holds a stake - which is currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-discussing-buyout-options-with-tencent">in discussions with the Chinese company over a potential stock buyout</a>, in a bid to stabilise the troubled Assassin's Creed maker.

<p>The 2016 Xbox One racing game has already been delisted from digital storefronts, but recent reports on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/forza/comments/1huvbgm/did_this_really_happen_as_the_comment_says_if_so/">reddit</a> suggested certain online features - marketplace, clubs, rivals - were unavailable.</p>

            <p>Imagine the scene: you've just got your hands on that physical Switch game you've been waiting for. Hurrah! But as you open the box, your heart and soul full of giddy anticipation, your eyes land not on that oh-so-special cartridge but an eye staring back at you.</p>
<p>This is what has happened to multiple Switch owners who have reported that, instead of a game, they have instead found themselves presented with a plastic googly eye in its place. Actually. We have come from Goggle Box to Googly Box.</p>

<p>The reports of this eye-sore phenomenon made the rounds with more vigour over the festive period, but it has seemingly been happening for a little while now. "This is what I found when I opened my brand new sealed copy of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a> from Walmart," reads <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1fqg8gv/this_is_what_i_found_when_i_opened_my_brand_new/">one reddit post</a> from several months ago, with a picture of the offending eye.</p>
<p>It seems that because the googly eye sounds a lot like a cartridge when the box is shaken, many have understandably presumed the contents are legit. And, really, why wouldn't they.</p>

        <p>While Modern Warfare cost $640m.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war">Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</a> cost a staggering $700m (¬£557m) to develop, a new report has revealed. 
</p>
<p>
2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare cost $640m (¬£509), while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 3 cost $450m (¬£358), according to figures confirmed by publisher Activision in a court filing, reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/call-of-duty-budgets-development-costs-black-ops-modern-warfare">Game File</a>.
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, these figures cover each game's cost over their full lifecycle, it's claimed, suggesting this also covers the development of post-launch support. On the other, these figures do not include the separate amount spent on marketing, which will almost certainly include additional hundreds of millions of dollars per title. 
</p>
<p>
The numbers dwarf the development budgets of pretty much every other video game we've heard about - though development budgets are notoriously kept under-wraps. 
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us Part 2 cost $220m to make, according to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-court-documents-removed-after-redacted-details-spotted">poorly-redacted court document from Sony published in 2023</a>. That same document also revealed a similar $212m cost to develop <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>, with 300 employees attached to the project for up to five years. 
</p>
<p>
Is Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War the most expensive video game ever made? Probably not, but for a relatively standalone boxed product, it is exceptional. 
</p>
<p>
As for what is the most expensive - well, things get more tricky when discussing live-service games. Gacha-powered anime role-player <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> is estimated to have cost $900m to date, with $100m spent on initial development then $200m each year since. Typically, most companies do not divulge such numbers, however. (I'd love to know how much Epic Games has spent on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> to date.)
</p><p>
"We need to address... the exploding cost of game development," former chairman of PlayStation Worldwide Studios <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/there-comes-a-time-when-we-all-declare-the-war-is-over-former-playstation-studios-boss-shawn-layden-on-the-future-of-video-game-consoles">Shawn Layden told Eurogamer last month</a>, when discussing the issues facing the video games industry today - such as a lack of originality due to the conservatism that comes with having to risk such huge sums making games. 
</p>
<p>
"The PS4 generation, which was the last I was associated with, game dev was 150m if you want to be top of the line, and that's before marketing," Layden said. "So by that math, PS5 games should eventually reach $300m to $400m - and that is just outright not sustainable.
</p>
<p>
"It's like we're at the end of the 18th century, and we're realising that building cathedrals is really expensive. Can we continue to build these massive edifices to God for this incredible amount of labour and time? Or should we just build four walls and a roof, and that's a church, right? I'm afraid we've built AAA gaming into a kind of cathedral business, and it just can't grow any further. In fact, it's probably grown too far already."

<p>Sony made the announcements during its CES presentation this morning. "I'm excited to announce we are working with Sony Pictures on developing a film adaptation of our amazingly popular PlayStation game, Helldivers 2," PlayStation's Asad Qizilbash revealed to audience applause.</p>

<p>Later in the same presentation, Qizilbash revealed Horizon Zero Dawn is also getting the film treatment. This news follows a report last year that stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-netflix-series-no-longer-moving-forward-following-showrunner-allegations-report">once-proposed TV series based on the Horizon franchise had come to halt</a> after accusations of "bullying, manipulative and retaliatory behaviour" by its planned showrunner Steve Blackman.</p><p>The newly announced Horizon film is now in the "early stages" of development with Columbia Pictures and PlayStation Productions. "Just imagine Aloy's beloved origin story set in a vibrant far future world filled with the giant machines brought to you for the first time on the big screen," said Qizilbash.</p>
<p>In addition, Sony also announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-ghost-of-tsushima-gets-groundbreaking-anime-adaptation-on-crunchyroll">Ghost of Tsushima anime adaptation for Crunchyroll</a> during CES, which is slated for 2027.</p>

<p>"This project is a testament to the creative synergy within the Sony family, uniting the expertise of PlayStation Studios and PlayStation Productions; the creative team of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/sucker-punch-productions">Sucker Punch Productions</a> and Aniplex; Sony Music's iconic global artist roster; and Crunchyroll's fan-first global marketing and distribution footprint," said Rahul Purini, president of Crunchyroll. "The Ghost of Tsushima anime will offer fans an exciting new way to experience the game in an anime style that will be bold and groundbreaking."</p>
<p>The Legends game mode has players choosing one of four classes (splitting main protagonist Jin's powers between them) to battle enemy hordes inspired by Japanese mythology.</p>
<p>"Having already proven the immense quality and versatility of our gaming properties across multiple successful film and television projects, we couldn't be more excited to announce our first ever anime adaptation," said Asad Qizilbash, head of PlayStation Productions. "Ghost of Tsushima's rich, immersive world and its fantastical Legends mode based on Japanese mythology provide the perfect canvas for this project, and Aniplex is the perfect partner to translate Sucker Punch Productions' hit video game into a stunning new anime series."</p>
<p>The anime appears to be separate from the forthcoming film adaptation announced in 2021 with John Wick: Chapter 4 director Chad Stahelski at the helm. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shogun-star-in-talks-for-ghost-of-tsushima-film-role">Shogun's Horiyuki Sanada is in talks for a role</a>.</p>
<p>More anime announcements could be on the way from Sony following its "strategic capital and business alliance" with FromSoftware owner Kadokawa. At the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-is-now-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawas-largest-shareholder">Sony became the largest shareholder of Kadokawa</a>, with the company's anime properties proving a major draw.</p>
<p>Later this year, Sony and Sucker Punch will release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reveals-ghost-of-yotei-the-follow-up-to-ghost-of-tsushima">follow-up game Ghost of Yotei</a> set a few hundred years later on the island of Hokkaido in northern Japan.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
