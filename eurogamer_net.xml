            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> is cleared for takeoff, ready to give aircraft fanciers and digital globetrotters another jaunt across its beautiful world. But in a turn of events almost exactly mirroring the launch day woes seen by its 2020 predecessor, Flight Simulator 2024 is struggling to gt off the ground, with players complaining of lengthy post-install download times, installation freezes, and more as Microsoft's servers buckle under the demand.
</p>
<p>
Already, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537590/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_2024/">tarred with the Overwhelmingly Negative brush on Steam</a>, with players reporting a range of issues - all of which are eerily familiar to those seen back in 2020. Mostly, the finger is once again being pointed toward developer Asobo's insistence that players download the bulk of the game - equalling approximately 50GB - through the in-game interface, utilising Microsoft's servers instead of Steam's. That's traditionally been a languid pursuit at the best of times, but on launch day - when everyone is struggling to get in at once - it's proving even more glacial.
</p>
<p>
Some users are seeing their downloads stall at 97 percent, while others, having successfully cleared that first hurdle, then report being stuck in lengthy log-in queues. Additionally, Flight Simulator's reliance on streaming means plenty of people are having a miserable experience even if they do get in, with reported issues including sluggish world loading and even invisible planes. "I can only marvel at the depth of the simulation," wrote one Steam reviewer, "as it now feels like Boeing was actually involved in building the servers."

<p>
"I enjoyed the short movie about a man and a plane," added another frustrated user. "However, it seemed quite expensive for its length - around one minute. I would wait until the loading screen is on sale before purchase because it does get quite samey after the 70th loop." As for the Microsoft's Flight Simulator subreddit, it's currently awash in some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/1gv54xo/status_update/">top</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/1gv3nhh/server_loading_times/">class</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/1gv5ekg/msfs_2024_will_use_cloud_streaming_the_cloud/">memes</a>.
</p><p>
Over on Flight Simulator's support page, Microsoft has <a href="https://x.com/MSFS_Support/status/1858932444260421714">acknowledged the issues</a> players are experiencing. "We are aware of user reports of long initial loading times into Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024," it wrote. "With so many users initialising the sim concurrently, we have a large number of server requests. We are working to help resolve the issues as soon as possible."
</p>
<p>
"For users whose initial load is past 90 percent and no longer progressing, we recommend a reboot," it added, immediately eliciting a collective scream from everyone without a high-speed internet connection. "Otherwise we advise waiting to allow the loading to proceed as normal." The Xbox support page, meanwhile, <a href="https://x.com/XboxSupport/status/1858954069924065751">acknowledged</a> "slow download and install times", suggesting players keep an eye on its <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status">live status page</a> while it investigates.
</p>
<p>
Some Steam customers have also expressed concern that Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024's lengthy in-game install solution means downloads are eating into the platform's two-hour refund window. Back in 2020, Valve moved to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-users-want-microsoft-flight-simulator-refund-time-extended">assure customers only actual play time would be counted</a>, but it's not yet confirmed the same applies in 2024.
</p>
<p>
Developer Asobo has, of course, been talking a big game for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 ahead of launch, promising a frankly staggering list of activities, including aerial firefighting, search and rescue, helicopter cargo transport, crop dusting, skydive aviation, hot air balloon tours, and more. It's also teased "literally trillions of trees", even the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-will-let-you-climb-out-your-plane-walk-a-trail-and-watch-the-sunset">ability to get out your plane and walk a trail</a> - all of which sounds like it'll be marvellous, as long as Flight Simulator navigates its launch day turbulence on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and Game Pass, and sticks the landing.

            <p>
A new report detailing the drama behind the three <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> spiritual successors all simultaneously announced last month has outlined a convoluted web of connections, fallouts, and legal action, suggesting the beloved RPG's legacy remains as messy as ever. 
</p>
<p>
Disco Elysium's original developer ZA/UM was, of course, at legal loggerheads with various former team members for quite some time; but while ZA/UM has said those lawsuits are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-says-lawsuits-from-former-members-have-been-resolved">now resolved</a>, it seems drama has continued to swirl around those involved, even as they move onto other ventures. Those ventures include new projects at Dark Math Games and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-in-development-from-leads-of-cancelled-sequel">Longdue</a>, two UK-based studios comprised of former Disco Elysium developers, who both announced Disco Elysium spiritual successors back in October. It also leads us to Argo Tuulik - one of the original writers on Disco Elysium and a key creative on ZA/UM's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cancelled-standalone-disco-elysium-spin-off-would-have-been-most-hardcore-disco-since-disco">cancelled Disco Elysium spin-off X7</a> - who followed up those announcements by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-former-zaum-devs-have-set-up-another-studio-but-they-are-definitely-not-working-on-a-disco-elysium-sequel">revealing he'd also co-founded a new studio</a>, Summer Eternal, with former ZA/UM developer Dora Klindžić.
</p>
<p>
And now a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-wild-story-behind-disco-elysiums-spiritual-successors-allegations-legal-threats-and-a-usb-stick">report by IGN's Wesley Yin-Poole</a> has delved deeper into the tangle of the three new studios, laying out the financial links between the two UK-based teams (Longdue founder Riaz Moola is also an investor in Dark Math Games), and revealing Tuulik and Klindžić both previously worked at Dark Math - as director and narrative director on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/detective-rpg-in-the-works-from-breakaway-group-of-former-disco-elysium-developers">recently announced XXX Nightshift</a> - <em>and</em> later at Longdue. It's fascinatingly convoluted stuff.

<figcaption>Dark Math Games' XXX Nightshift was unveiled in October.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QlFNp2WtgE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
IGN reports Tuulik and Klindžić both departed Dark Math this July after the company elected not to renew Tuulik's contract due to "creative differences". Tensions are said to have come to a head after Tuulik claimed Dark Math boss Kaur Kender (who was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-legal-battle-reaches-court-centres-on-alleged-48m-fraud">also previously embroiled in a bitter legal dispute with ZA/UM</a> over the ownership fo the Diso Elysium IP) had shown him - and other staff members - naked photos of his ex-wife. Speaking to IGN, Kender disputed the claim, saying the woman - who was to serve as inspiration for characters in XXX Nightshift - was wearing a bikini in some photos, and was fully clothed in others. Dark Math, meanwhile, told IGN it would "not be commenting on the past".
</p><p>
And it only gets more fractious from there. Tuulik and Klindžić are then said to have moved over to Longdue via parent company CoGrammar, with Tuulik working as a consultant on the studio's still unnamed "psychological RPG". However, the two later resigned, leaving at the end of September, ultimately leading to legal action that saw CoGrammar successfully obtain an injection in England and Wales on the basis of breach of contact - preventing the pair from working on anything at their new studio Summer Eternal until April 2025.
</p>
<p>
Tuulik called the verdict an "absurdity" in a message sent to IGN, while a statement shared by CoGrammar claimed that prior to its legal action, the company had offered to release Tuulik and Klindžić from contractual restrictions - blocking them from working with other studios within six months after their departure - but the duo declined to sign the release contracts.
</p>
<p>
And that's still not the end of it. Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM, in the midst of all this, is said to have filed a legal notice against Tuulik, alleging breach of contract, breach of confidentiality, and copyright infringement - all related to a USB stick containing a playable, 20-minute build of Disco Elysium follow-up X7 that Tuulik is said to have shown Longdue and Dark Math employees. But it's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-wild-story-behind-disco-elysiums-spiritual-successors-allegations-legal-threats-and-a-usb-stick">worth reading IGN's full report</a> for the details on that particular thread.
</p>
<p>
It is, in other words, all a bit of a mess. And that's without factoring in what Disco Elysium lead writer Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov - who were both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/report-details-allegations-of-toxic-behaviour-ip-theft-at-disco-elysium-developer">fired from ZA/UM in 2022 amid allegations of mismanagement and misconduct</a> - will do next. The pair have set up their own studio, Red Info, to make a game with the backing of Chinese company NetEase. The race is on, then, to see which Disco Elysium spiritual successor gets out the door first.
