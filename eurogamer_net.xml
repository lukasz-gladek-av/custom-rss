            <p>Supermassive Games - known for releases such as Until Dawn and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-quarry">The Quarry</a> - has reportedly cancelled an unannounced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> game.</p>
<p>The project was titled Blade Runner: Time To Live, and according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPUISqX5T6E">Insider Gaming</a>, it was going to be a "character focused, cinematic, action adventure" release, poised to be launched across PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, as well as on next generation Xbox and PlayStation systems. Reportedly, it was a single-player game, slated for a 2027 debut.</p>

<p>The report claims the player would be the only Blade Runner in 2065, and the game's campaign would feature a 10-12 hour "compelling" story, which would blend "the philosophical themes of Blade Runner with kinetic action-adventure gameplay".</p>
<p>This story would see players taking on the role of So-Lange, the report states. So-Lange is a vintage model Nexus-6 "inexplicably still alive well beyond your limited lifespan".</p>
<p>Documentation seen by Insider Gaming reads: "Journey from the teeming undercity of New Zurich 2065 to the eerie remnants of the forgotten world beyond... Under orders to retire Rev, the mysterious and ruthless leader of an underground replicant network, you are betrayed and left for dead in a brutally hostile environment."</p>
<p>Blade Runner: Time to Live was said to have entered pre-production in September 2024, with pre-production then expected to wrap up in March 2025. The end of prototyping, meanwhile, was set for this September.</p>
<p>On the cost side of things, Blade Runner: Time to Live's development budget was reported to be in the region of $45m, with $9m of this expected to cover external performance capture and acting talent.</p>
<p>The game was ultimately cancelled, reportedly towards the end of last year. As to why, that's allegedly due to Alcon Entertainment, who is the owner of the Blade Runner rights, although no further details were provided at this time.</p>
<p>While we may never know what could have been, according to one source, Blade Runner: Time to Live was "rather impressive".</p>
<p>Next up from Supermassive Games will be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/directive-8020-is-a-notable-upgrade-to-the-dark-pictures-anthologys-formula">long-awaited next Dark Pictures Anthology game, Directive 8020</a>. This one's set in space, features Bond and Marvel star Lashana Lynch, and has been in development for some time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a> is introducing its first paid battle pass, after previously experimenting with a free version of the feature.
</p>
<p>
Timed ahead of the game's Team of the Season (TOTS) event, EA will roll out a premium version of the Season 7 pass priced at 500k in-game UT Coins, or which you can buy for 1000 FC Points (around Â£9).
</p>
<p>
Access to this 40-tier pass begins today, 24th April, and will reward tradeable packs, Season Point boosters, TOTS items, evolution consumables and retro cosmetic evolutions. Its centrepiece is an exclusive 96-rated Immortal Icon Franck Ribery, the former French winger who spent most of his career at Bayern Munich. 
</p>
<p>
Announcing the Premium Pass, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-25/news/pitch-notes-fc25-premium-pass">EA said</a> that while this iteration of the battle pass wouldn't change, it would be  "monitoring your feedback to make sure we deliver the best experience possible in whatever mode you play in FC moving forward".
</p>
<p>
Anyone with feedback is invited to provide it via the EA Sports Discord, or EA's own direct feedback portal. 
</p>
<p>
On social media, however, the opinions are somewhat mixed. While some players have pointed to the items within the pass making up for its costs - and Ribery alone being worth the coins - others have said that Ultimate Team is already a money-sucking experience, without another additional thing to buy.
</p>
<p>
"Having Players EXCLUSIVE to the Paid Season pass is extremely greedy and is not the path to go down," <a href="https://x.com/Wildcatz442/status/1915300812835737605">wrote social media user Wildcat</a>. "If its packs/cosmetics/SP/kits im sure 99 percent of the community won't mind. But locking a card like that ribery behind a paywall??? Even if its only 500k coins its just greedy as hell."
</p>
<p>
"Don't get the outrage," <a href="https://x.com/NCFC_CJW/status/1915325530091487610">wrote Norwich City supporter Callum</a>, however. "I ain't sticking up for EA but if that Ribery was an SBC everyone would be happy spending 500k on it ðŸ˜‚ Let alone the other rewards (you even get coins back from tradable packs)."
</p>
<p>
EA Sports recently said that its upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-says-switch-2-versions-of-fc-and-madden-nfl-to-have-feature-parity-with-consoles-as-much-as-the-hardware-allows">Switch 2 versions of FC and Madden NFL would aim to have feature parity</a> with other consoles "as much as the hardware allows".
</p>
<p>
"This is a new FC, with some genuine differences on- and off-pitch," our Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc-25-review">Eurogamer's EA Sports FC 25 review</a>. "It's also the exact same FC it's always been."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We now know how much those <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-will-have-paid-upgrades-for-certain-switch-games-bringing-enhanced-frame-rates-and-more">previously announced Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrades for games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> will cost. However, I am afraid it is not going to be a 'one size fits all' deal.</p>
<p>As shown on Nintendo's official store, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Breath-of-the-Wild-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787250.html">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild â€“ Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> will cost Â£66.99 on its release, but those who already own the game on the original Switch can upgrade their copy for Â£7.99. This is the same for its sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Tears-of-the-Kingdom-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787249.html">Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>However, while <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Kirby-and-the-Forgotten-Land-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Star-Crossed-World-2787773.html">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</a> also retails for Â£66.99 via Nintendo, its upgrade back is Â£16.99. So, Â£9 more than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a>'s upgrade pack.</p>

<p>This is the same pricing as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Super-Mario-Party-Jamboree-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Jamboree-TV-2785806.html">Super Mario Party Jamboree â€“ Nintendo Switch 2 Edition ï¼‹ Jamboree TV</a>. As with Kirby, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> edition of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> retails for Â£66.99, with an upgrade pack available for owners of the original game coming in at Â£16.99.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that while the Zelda games do both have new features arriving with their Switch 2 editions, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/achievements-can-be-earned-in-switch-2-editions-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom">such as Zelda Notes</a>, Kirby does have new content coming, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-closer-look-at-kirby-and-the-forgotten-lands-remixed-switch-2-worlds">takes the form of a remixed campaign known as Star-Crossed World</a>. But then the Zelda upgrades come as part of a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription, while others do not.</p>

<p>Nintendo has already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-admits-switch-2-demand-far-exceeds-expectations-in-japan-as-company-president-offers-stark-warning-over-stock">acknowledged unexpectedly high demand in Japan</a>, casting doubt on consistent Switch 2 stock levels worldwide ahead of its 5th June release.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
