            <p>"Square collapsed" after Hironobu Sakaguchi left the company, said Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, adding the "situation at Square was awful after he quit".</p>
<p>Final Fantasy series creator Sakaguchi joined Uematsu on the podcast Nobiyo To Isshoni earlier this month where they discussed their time together at Square working on the series in the 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>Sakaguchi resigned in 2001, before officially leaving Square in 2003 along with other key members of the company, ahead of its merger with rival Enix that same year.</p>

<p>"Square collapsed after Sakaguchi left," said Uematsu on the podcast (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/square-collapsed-after-he-left-final-fantasy-composer-on-how-hironobu-sakaguchis-innate-leadership-skills-held-the-company-together/">Automaton</a>). "To put it simply - he is the big boss. Always has been and always will be."</p>
<p>Uematsu described Square in its formative years as more like a club of university students than a serious company, but Sakaguchi was "able to manage the work even in that kind of environment".</p>
<p>He added: "We didn't even have a proper corporate organisation, yet everybody listened to him. It's a kind of quality you just have to be born with." Uematsu called Sakaguchi "a leader" - he may have been bossy and strict, but he was able to attract the people around him.</p>
<p>Uematsu continued: "Maybe Sakaguchi isn't aware of this, but the situation at Square was awful after he quit.</p>
<p>"He left and the organisation suddenly collapsed. I thought to myself 'Oh no, I should get away from here'."</p> <div>

<p>After directing the first five Final Fantasy games, Sakaguchi moved to a producer role for subsequent games in the series. His final game at Square was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-x-2">Final Fantasy X-2</a>, for which he was executive producer.</p>
<p>Famously, his final years at Square were spent creating the Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within CGI film, which was deemed a financial failure. In 2004 he established his independent studio Mistwalker, which has since released a number of excellent RPGs with a cult following.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-final-fantasy-creator-hironobu-sakaguchis-past-present-and-future-can-be-found-in-fantasian">Sakaguchi discussed with Eurogamer how his most recent game, Fantasian Neo Dimension, is fuelled by nostalgia</a> for his past work.</p>
<p>Though there have been successes in the Final Fantasy series since Sakaguchi's departure - namely MMORPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> - the series has struggled to match the 90s golden era Sakaguchi oversaw.</p>
<p>As for Uematsu, he left <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> in 2004, but has since frequently composed pieces for the Final Fantasy series. Last year, he confirmed he would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-composer-uematsu-returning-for-remake-trilogy-finale">returning for the third part of the Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy</a> with a main theme.</p>
<p>As such, he's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-final-fantasy-composer-nobuo-uematsu-isnt-retiring-from-video-game-music">not retiring from video game music</a> as some had feared, but admitted he is "going to cut back a bit" on video game music work because "the time commitment for composing would be too long".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/square-collapsed-after-final-fantasy-creator-hironobu-sakaguchi-left-says-composer-nobuo-uematsu]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has received another update, which along with some general fixes also makes changes to courses selected in Random during an online VS Race.</p>
<p>While the update notes for Ver. 1.1.2, as it is known, simply state the Mario Kart World team has "adjusted courses selected in 'Random' when selecting next course in a wireless 'VS Race'", there is more to it than it may first appear.</p>

<p>Prior to this update going live, if a player selected Randon during course selection while racing online, it would always result in a more traditional three lap race, rather than Mario Kart World's community dubbed "intermission tracks". These are the tracks that essentially run in one long and almost linear layout, and connect Mario Kart World's, well, world.</p>
<p>Now, however, these intermission tracks have been added to the online Random fray, which means playing Mario Kart World in a more 'traditional' way with consistent three-lapped courses is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Some online are rather unhappy with this development. "Nintendo has basically stepped in and said 'no, you're supposed to play this way'," <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-updates-mario-kart-worlds-online-removes-the-only-guaranteed-way-to-play-normal-3-lap-races-with-randoms.1228638/">reads one comment on ResetEra</a>. "They saw players clamoring for a more traditional online mode and did... the exact opposite of what they wanted."</p> <div>
