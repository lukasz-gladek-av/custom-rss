            <p>
Hitman developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has cut ties with MMA fighter Conor McGregor, following last week's Irish High Court ruling that found he had assaulted and raped a woman in December 2018.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://x.com/Hitman/status/1861049881160273921">statement</a> released via social media this afternoon, IO said it was no longer associated with McGregor and would "begin removing content" featuring the UFC star from storefronts "starting today". 
</p>
<p>"In light of the recent court ruling regarding Conor McGregor, IO Interactive has made the decision to cease its collaboration with the athlete, effective immediately," the developer wrote. 
</p>
<p>"We take this matter very seriously and cannot ignore its implications. Consequently, we will begin removing all content featuring Mr. McGregor from our storefronts starting today."</p>
<p>
McGregor's voice and likeness is used in Hitman for a character named The Disruptor, which previously featured as one of the game's Elusive Targets. 
</p>
<p>
The Disruptor mission returned to the game earlier this month for a limited time, and had been set to be playable until Sunday 8th December. 
</p>
<p>
An additional Disruptor DLC pack meanwhile offers players permanent access to The Ostentatious, an arcade contract featuring The Disruptor, as well as a new outfit, items, and a set of cosmetics for the freelancer house. 
</p>
<p>
Last week, an Irish jury decided McGregor had sexually assaulted a woman in a Dublin hotel six years ago, and was subsequently ordered to pay at least €248k (£206k) in damages.
</p>
<p>
McGregor has said he will appeal the verdict.

            <p>A new trailer for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> film has been released, showing off its version of the Chao Garden.</p>
<p>Of course, it's not exactly as you remember from the games: it's some sort of mascot café featuring dancing Chao characters and a group of children who ask Tails if he's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detective-pikachu">Detective Pikachu</a>.</p>
<p>Then things turn bad and soon we see Keanu Reeves' Shadow the Hedgehog in the middle of Tokyo's Shibuya Crossing. You can check out the trailer below.</p>

<p>The trailer offers the best look yet at Shadow (with a gun!), as well as Jim Carrey's two Eggman villains, and Maria Robotnik from Shadow's past.</p>
<p>Despite its real world setting, then, it seems the film will include plenty of elements familiar to fans of the games.</p>
<p>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is due out in cinemas on 20th December, just before Christmas. It's fitting the trailer ends with a Christmas scene, in something of a callback to Carrey's performance as The Grinch.</p>

<p>The film will conclude Sega's Year of Shadow, which also included the excellent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>.</p>
<p>Sega also shared with Eurogamer some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-showcases-shadow-the-hedgehog-design-in-never-before-seen-sketches">exclusive design sketches of Shadow the Hedgehog</a> from Sonic Team's Kazuyuki Hoshino.</p>
<p>For the unfamiliar, the Chao Garden allowed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-adventure">Sonic Adventure</a> 1 and 2 players to level up cute Chao critters and then race and battle them against one another. It's a much-requested feature in a potential Sonic Adventure 3 game, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-plans-for-sonic-adventure-3-says-sonic-team-boss-but-wed-love-to-make-it">Sonic Team's Takashi Iizuka has "no plans" for such a project</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/darkest-dungeon-2">Darkest Dungeon 2</a> will receive a major free update in January, alongside its next paid DLC.</p>
<p>Both the new Kingdoms game mode and the Inhuman Bondage DLC will release on PC on 27th January 2025.</p>
<p>Kingdoms is intended to run parallel to the game's main narrative campaign, Confessions. It tasks players with journeying from Inn to Inn across a persistent map to complete quests before time runs out.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, players will need to defend against all-new enemy factions as they complete contracts, upgrade and protect Inns. The first of these three factions will be the "rotting and ravenous beastmen".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/darkest-dungeon-2-reveals-new-kingdoms-campaign-mode">Kingdoms mode was first revealed back in April</a> this year, but now finally has a release date.</p>
<p>The Inhuman Bondage DLC, meanwhile, will introduce a new mini-region, The Catacombs, along with a new playable hero. In The Catacombs, players will face a "corrosive, oozing threat" beneath the Kingdom. It features new enemies and items, and will be playable in both the Confessions and Kingdoms modes.</p>
<p>The new fan favourite hero, The Abomination, was an original Kickstarter backer-assisted designed character, who comes with a fully-voiced origin story along with unique mechanics and items.</p>
<p>"At Red Hook we love going against the grain," said creative director Chris Bourassa. "When asking ourselves how best to expand Darkest Dungeon 2, we were nonplussed at the conventional wisdom of simply packing in more content. Instead, we pushed ourselves to reimagine the very structure of DDII, and from that thought experiment was born an entirely new game mode: Kingdoms."</p>
<p>Darkest Dungeon 2 is available on PC across Steam and the Epic Games Store, alongside PS4, PS5, Switch, and Xbox Series X/S. Console versions of the free update and DLC will follow PC.</p>
<p>The game was first released in May 2023, with Red Hook continuing to tweak and update the game since.</p>
<p>"A copious and often brilliant, if not quite unmissable reworking of a powerfully grim fantasy," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/darkest-dungeon-2-a-lovecraftian-roadtrip-rpg-of-thrilling-and-suffocating-intricacy">Darkest Dungeon 2 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>An array of Ubisoft games including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> are broken on some devices running Windows 11 with version  update 24H2 installed.</p>
<p>As such, Microsoft has blocked the Windows upgrade for some.</p>
<p>Microsoft has acknowledged the issues on its support site, and noted that certain Ubisoft games could become "unresponsive while starting, loading or during active gameplay". It added other users may be met with a black screen.</p>

<p>"To safeguard your Windows update experience, we have applied a compatibility hold on devices with these games installed," <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24h2#3448msgdesc">Microsoft wrote</a>. "These devices will not be offered to install Windows 11, version 24H2 via the Windows Update release channel."</p>
<p>The company implores users to not manually install the update if they own the affected games, which are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assassin's Creed Valhalla</li>
<li>Assassin's Creed Origins</li>
<li>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</li>
<li>Star Wars Outlaws</li>
<li>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft has issued a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1sXCR6GmB3Kn7OrKiy8DPO/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-140">"temporary mitigation" for Star Wars Outlaws</a>, which should prevent the game from failing and stop responding. It did note there may still be performance issues, however.</p>
<p>Microsoft is currently working on a fix with Ubisoft, promising more information when the companies know more. In the meantime, it has provided the following workaround for users who find a game stops responding to their demands.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Task Manager. This can be accomplished by pressing Ctrl + Shift + Esc on your keyboard. Alternatively, you can right-click on the Start button and select Task Manager from the menu.</li>
<li>In the Task Manager window, look for your game in the Processes tab. It might be listed under the name of the game or the game launcher.</li>
<li>Click on the game’s name to highlight it. Then, click the End Task button at the bottom right of the window. This will close the game.</li>
</ol>

<p>In other Ubisoft news, the publisher recently announced it was removing those really rather frustrating (read, incredibly frustrating) forced stealth sections from "almost all quest objectives" in Star Wars Outlaws.</p>
<p>Thanks to an update earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-finally-getting-rid-of-forced-stealth-from-almost-all-quest-objectives">players will now be able to enter combat after getting caught while sneaking</a>, rather than getting ported back to the last checkpoint and being made to start the section again.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
