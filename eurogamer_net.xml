            <p>We're back this Sunday afternoon to cover the summer Xbox Games Showcase live. The show begins at 6pm UK time (7pm CEST/ 1pm EDT/10am PDT) and our updates will appear automatically below. You can also leave comments and chat along with us while watching the stream. You know the drill.</p>
<p>What do we expect? Firstly, note that this is a combined showcase so the general Xbox part of the show will happen first before we move to an Outer Worlds 2-specific broadcast after. We don't know how long either part of the show will last.</p>
<p>Microsoft hasn't given us any indication of games, either, but we expect to see more of the delayed Fable 4 - maybe a detailed look at gameplay - as well as another look at last year's announced games Perfect Dark (the reboot) and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/state-of-decay-3">State of Decay 3</a>. I wonder whether we'll also finally see more of Rare's long-in-development - perhaps lost-in-development - fantastical forest game Everwild, which was originally announced in 2019. Microsoft went on the record earlier this year to say <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-rares-everwild-is-still-in-development-and-xbox-is-committed-to-giving-the-team-the-time-it-needs">Everwild is still in development and getting the time it needs</a>.</p>
<p>Gears of War: E-Day will probably emerge like a burrowing locust swarm, at some point, and perhaps we'll see more of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inxiles-clockwork-revolution-is-a-time-bending-rpg-which-owes-a-lot-to-bioshock-infinite">inXile's BioShock-like Clockwork Revolution</a>. We may hear more about what Double Fine is up to, now it's owned by Microsoft, and - whisper it - there's talk Bethesda might drop the big one, Elder Scrolls 6. Work a Halo announcement in there from 343 and this could be a big show.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Game Fest 2025</a> kicked off last week with a State of Play broadcast from Sony, then springboarded on Friday with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-june-2025-everything-announced">the Opening Showcase</a>, which brought a ninth Resident Evil game, among other things. There was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wholesome-direct-2025-everything-announced-at-the-cosy-indie-showcase">the Wholesome Direct</a>, which we rounded up for you, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/day-of-the-devs-2025-everything-announced-in-the-big-indie-showcase">Day of the Devs</a>, which we rounded up too. Look for a Future Game Show roundup soon.</p>
<p>See you at 6pm?</p><figure>

Hello and happy Sunday to everyone. We could be in for an exciting show later on. What are you hoping to see?
</p>
<p>
I wonder if there'll be any disruption to the show because of the protests taking place in downtown LA. The National Guard are expected to arrive there at some point. Chris Tapsell is there for us and says things are getting a bit weird. Fingers crossed he's okay.
