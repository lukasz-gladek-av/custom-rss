            <p>Those looking to get into MindsEye on Xbox on launch day today will need to wait a little longer to get the game's day one patch.</p>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1l767j8/mindseye_release_everything_you_need_to_know/">reddit</a>, developer Build A Rocket Boy laid out the release times for its action-adventure thriller from former GTA producer Leslie Benzies, with those here in the UK able to get access from 6pm today (10th June).  While the game is currently available to preload across platforms, Build A Rocket Boy has said an additional update is also recommended after installation.</p>
<p>Update 2 will ensure the game is able to be experienced "as we intended", as it includes "key final refinements". This covers visual polish, performance tuning, stability fixes and general gameplay improvements, the studio has said. The update is available to those playing MindsEye via PlayStation and PC from today, however those on Xbox will have to wait longer due to "varied platform certification" issues.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the studio has not said when the update will be available on Xbox, merely stating it will be released "as soon as possible". We will update you when we know more.</p>
<p>As for the future, Build A Rocket Boy has said today's release "isn't the end" for MindsEye, rather it is "the start of something much bigger". This will see the developer releasing more "updates and refinements" shortly after release, with "plenty more" promised for further down the line.</p>
<p>"We want MindsEye to be a game that continues to grow with its players, and we'll be listening closely to your feedback as we go," the team wrote. "Expect updates, refinements, and adjustments â€“ based on what you're telling us. Launch may be the milestone, but it's far from the final word."</p>

            <p>UK actors' union Equity has applauded the "tenacity and persistence" of SAG-AFTRA video game performers, following news the US union has reached a tentative agreement after almost a year on strike. It now calls upon the industry to negotiate for UK performers too.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US union <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-and-video-game-employers-reach-tentative-agreement-interactive-media-contract-national">shared news of its tentative agreement</a> with multiple video game companies over the Interactive Media Agreement. The strike, which began last July, will continue until the agreement is finalised.</p>
<p>A key reason for the strike was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal">need to protect performers from AI abuse</a>. It's unclear what protections have been included in this new tentative agreement, but SAG-AFTRA national executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland has stated the "necessary AI guardrails" have been put in place.</p>
<p>"Everyone at SAG-AFTRA is immensely grateful for the sacrifices made by video game performers and the dedication of the Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee throughout these many months of the video game strike," said Crabtree-Ireland. "Patience and persistence has resulted in a deal that puts in place the necessary AI guardrails that defend performers' livelihoods in the AI age, alongside other important gains."</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher added: "Our video game performers stood strong against the biggest employers in one of the world's most lucrative industries. Their incredible courage and persistence, combined with the tireless work of our negotiating committee, has at last secured a deal. The needle has been moved forward and we are much better off than before."</p>
<p>Here in the UK, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-union-equity-stands-in-solidarity-with-sag-aftra-but-wont-authorise-its-own-strike">Equity members have been unable to strike</a> due to UK law, but the union previously stated it stands "in solidarity" with SAG-AFTRA.</p>
<p>Now, in a statement shared with Eurogamer, Equity assistant general secretary for recorded media John Barclay has called upon the industry to negotiate for UK performers too, adding: "The UK cannot be the poor relation".</p>
<p>"We applaud the tenacity and persistence of the SAG-AFTRA video game performers who have been on strike for nearly a year pursuing an agreement with some of the biggest media companies in the world," said Barclay. "Important gains have been made and, significantly, agreement has been reached to put in place AI guardrails to defend performers' livelihoods. We look forward to receiving further details of the tentative agreement."</p>
<p>He continued: "Equity UK now calls upon the very same global engagers to meet with us to negotiate an agreement for our video games performers in the world's most lucrative industries that will bring fair rates of pay along with contractual terms covering AI. The UK cannot be the poor relation, especially when the industry and engagers here in the UK are supported by tax breaks. So we call upon the engagers to step up to meet the challenge to make the UK games industry the best it possibly can be for creatives."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/actors-union-stages-baftas-protest-seeking-improved-conditions-for-performers">Equity members protested outside this year's BAFTA Games Awards</a> in April, calling on the games industry to improve conditions for performers. This includes better pay and terms and conditions for their work, as well as AI protection.</p>
<p>At the start of this year, Eurogamer spoke with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why">Mass Effect actor Jennifer Hale on why the SAG-AFTRA strike was taking so long</a>. "[AI is] a huge issue for all of us and the repercussions are vast," she said. "So to me, it makes sense that everyone needs to take their time. As performers - and we saw this in the writers strike and the theatrical contract strike - we're just the canary in the coal mine."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>An exclusive clip of the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/twisted-metal">Twisted Metal</a> Season 2 has been released exclusively by IGN. In it, we see the hectic start of the show's version of the Twisted Metal tournament.</p>
<p>The clip, which you can watch embedded below, features a collection of ragtag racers, including show star Anthony Makkie as John Doe, Tiana Okoye as Dollface, Richard de Klerk as Mr. Grimm, Will Arnett as Sweet Tooth of course, and a peak of Axel at last!</p>
<p>As the race kicks off, we see Axel racing off and he looks pretty faithful! We see two big wheels zooming off with some bloke T-posing between them. Shirtless too. Say what you want about the Twisted Metal TV series, it appears to be taking the source material seriously which is nice.</p>

<p>The trailer includes the following story description: "Following the revelations in the season one finale, John and Quiet find themselves entering the deadly Twisted Metal tournament, a sinister demolition derby hosted by a mysterious man known as Calypso (Anthony Carrigan)."</p>
<p>"As they try to survive an onslaught of dangerous new foes and familiar faces alike, including the murderous clown Sweet Tooth (Will Arnett &amp; Joe Seanoa aka Samoa Joe), things get complicated for John when he reunites with his long-lost sister, the vigilante Dollface (Tiana Okoye)."</p>
<p>As far as the clip itself, it seems to be a pretty engaging action series judging from this brief clip. Love me a bunch of cars driving out of what looks to be an airfield hanger and racing down a bunch of tarmac?</p>
<p>The clip goes alongside Rob Zombie's Dragula, which is a nice touch not only because it's a fitting song, but also due to that song (and Rob Zombie himself) being featured in Twisted Metal 4.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twisted-metal-tv-adaptation-renewed-for-second-season-on-peacock">Twisted Metal was renewed for a second season in December of last year </a> after the first season recieved fair critical and commercial success. Following that, we got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-twisted-metal-season-two">our first peak at the second season this February</a>, featuring a lot of adapted video game characters as well as the first hint at Axel.

<p>Twisted Metal season 2 is set to release on the 31st July, 2025. You can watch it on Peacock.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Gears of War team is hosting a beta for Reloaded, which will allow participants to "experience all the curb-stomping mayhem of the versus multiplayer" across platforms.</p>
<p>The first round starts this Friday, 13th June, before wrapping up on 15th June. This weekend will focus on the classic Team Deathmatch mode, with the action taking place across maps Gridlock, Raven Down and Gold Rush.</p>

<p>A second beta weekend will then take place between 20th and 22nd June. This time, players will be able to try their hand at the King of the Hill mode, which developer The Coalition describes as "competitive", so bring your A game. King of the Hill will add the Canals map into the mix, with Courtyard and War Machine also popping up for use in Team Deathmatch.</p>
<p>In terms of timings, both weekends' events kick off at 12pm PST on the Friday, which is 8pm here in the UK. The weekends then conclude 48 hours later. If you are keen to participate in Gears of War: Reloaded's beta, there are three ways to get in. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preorder Gears of War: Reloaded digitally for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox on PC, Steam or PlayStation 5</li>
<li>Have an active Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass membership</li>
<li>Own a digital copy of Gears of War: Ultimate Edition (although, you will need to have purchased your copy prior to 5th May)</li>
</ul>
<p>Those that do pre-order Gears of War: Reloaded, along with Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC members, will receive two multiplayer character skins: Adam Fenix (Marcus' old man) and Anya Stroud (the "guiding voice of Delta Squad").</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> is set to receive further updates, including "difficulty reduction", following the release of its Overture DLC.</p>
<p>In a video from director Jiwon Choi, he stated the development team is grateful for feedback and suggestions from players since the DLC was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-overture-shadow-dropped-during-summer-game-fest-following-new-gameplay-trailer">shadow-dropped last week at Summer Game Fest</a>.</p>
<p>"We're reviewing all of it carefully and are already looking into when to implement some of your suggestions," he said. "Among all the feedback, we are paying the closest attention to the combat experience.</p>

<p>"We identified areas that did not turn out quite as we intended," he continued. "Therefore, we are reviewing various adjustments, including difficulty reduction.</p>
<p>"However, combat is one of the most fundamental experiences in Lies of P, so any modifications or changes require meticulous work and thorough testing."</p>
<p>The details and date for the next patch are unknown, but the director is clearly keen to keep the game's community up to date with the development process. It follows a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1627720/view/519715574346941123">patch alongside the DLC that's added plenty of quality of life changes</a> to the base game.</p>
<p>Since the DLC's release, players have criticised Overture for its high difficulty. In particular, on NG+ even regular enemies are proving challenging.</p>
<p>What has perhaps exacerbated this is that the DLC is only accessible once you reach chapter nine of the main game. It means that, if like me, you started a NG+ run after finishing the game, you'll need to play through it again to reach the DLC. I suspect a lot of players are therefore attempting Overture for the first time on NG+ rather than starting the base game again, raising the difficulty level beyond what was intended for a first run.</p>
<p>While Overture is a paid expansion for Lies of P, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-to-receive-difficulty-options-in-free-update-alongside-overture-dlc">base game has received a free update adding new difficulty levels</a>. The original difficulty is now normal, while two easier difficulty levels have been added.</p>
<p>This addition is somewhat controversial for soulslike games, which are known for their high challenge, but it's also ensuring the game is more approachable for a wider audience. And, for me at least, it's making racing through the base game to get to the DLC a lot quicker on easy mode!</p>
<p>Still, it's clear that balancing the difficulty is proving a challenge for the developer with this additional expansion. But that's something even FromSoftware struggled with when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> expansion <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> was released - it was criticised by some for being too difficult and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-patch-revises-shadow-realm-blessing-balance">subsequently adjusted</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
