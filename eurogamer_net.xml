            <p>Two new Sony patents have been spotted that would allow players to aim their DualSense like a gun, and use AI to predict player inputs.</p>
<p>The first of these, spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/sony-dualsense-gun-accessory/">GameRant</a>, was filed in June last year and made public earlier this month. The patent is for a trigger attachment for the DualSense controller to add realism to gunplay.</p>
<p>Players would theoretically hold the controller sideways with one controller arm, using the space between the R1 and R2 shoulder buttons as an aiming sight.</p>

<p>The patent also suggests this could be paired with other hardware or accessories, including a VR headset. Though with PS VR2's Sense controllers I don't know why this would be necessary.</p>
<p>What's more, the controller arms don't seem long enough to me to house player hands and a trigger system, while the weight of the controller would be uneven to hold up for long periods.</p>

</figure>
<p>The second patent is, perhaps, more interesting as it could be used to reduce lag in online games by using AI to predict player inputs ahead of time (thanks <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/sony-patents-latency-predicting-inputs/">tech4gamers</a>).</p>
<p>The patent involves using a camera to view the player and controller, record actions, and let AI predict what inputs will be pressed next. Another option would be to use incomplete controller actions instead, allowing AI to guess players' intentions.</p>
<p>Essentially this would help to reduce latency - the delay between player input and in-game action - which can be a major issue during online games.</p>

</figure>
<p>Other recent patents spotted by tech4gamers include using AI accounts to impersonate players and catch cheaters, and providing real-time in-game location information to assist frustrated players - as well as detecting erratic button mashing and verbal outbursts.</p>
<p>Of course, these patents don't mean these ideas will necessarily come to fruition, but it's always interesting to see what companies may be working on.</p>
<p>Previous Sony patents include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-latest-patent-suggests-its-developing-a-dualsense-controller-that-can-provide-gameplay-hints">predictive AI assistance features</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-patents-ability-for-games-to-adjust-difficulty-levels-on-the-fly">adaptive difficulty</a>, or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-patents-game-replay-from-trigger-points-over-streaming">allowing players to replay a game from specific trigger points</a>. Many patents appear to be addressing accessibility issues.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
PlayStation maker Sony is among the companies that have announced donations to help with relief and rebuilding efforts in the wake of Los Angeles' devastating wildfires. 
</p>
<p>
A week on, several areas of the city are still burning - and there's now fresh fear of further destruction as forecasters expect "close to hurricane force" winds to spread the fires once again over the coming days (via <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cew52g8r8e7t">BBC News</a>). At least 24 people are known to have died, 23 more are missing, and 12,401 structures have been lost.
</p>
<p>
As firefighters continue to tackle the blazes, Sony has announced a $5m donation to support first responders and the community affected by the fires.
</p>
<p>
"Los Angeles has been the home of our entertainment businesses for more than 35 years," Sony chairman and CEO Kenichiro Yoshida and Sony president and COO Hiroki Totoki said in a joint <a href="https://x.com/Sony/status/1878965120178753577">statement</a> shared on social media. 
</p>
<p>
"We will continue work with our local business leadership to determine how best Sony group can support relief and recovery efforts in the days ahead."
</p>
<p>
Other entertainment companies have also announced donations, including $10m donations each from Amazon, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> and NBCUniversal owner Comcast, plus $15m from Warner Bros Discovery. 
</p>
<p>
Paramount is chipping in $1m, while Beyoncé has said she's donating $2.5m.
</p>
<p>
Away from the disaster's human cost, the early impact of the fires was also seen in a spate of delays to Los Angeles' film and TV industries, including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devastating-los-angeles-fires-shut-down-fallout-season-2">pause in production of Fallout season two</a>.

            <p>Sony is continuing its game to big (and small) screen push, last week announcing films based on both its Horizon and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> series. Details were still fairly thin on the ground at this time, but now Arrowhead CCO Johan Pilestedt has confirmed one thing about the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> adaptation: the developer will be involved with the upcoming film, but in a somewhat limited capacity.</p>
<p>And, that's the way it should be, the exec says.</p>

</figure>
<p>This little titbit comes from an exchange on social media platform X, which was spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-developers-dont-and-shouldnt-have-final-say-on-the-upcoming-movie">IGN</a>. When one fan asked whether or not the Helldivers 2 studio would be involved in the film's production to ensure the adaptation stays faithful to the source material, Pilestedt admitted he had been "dodging this question" since the announcement.</p>
<p>"The short answer is yes. The long answer is that we'll see," the CCO replied, before acknowledging the Helldivers 2 development team "are not Hollywood people", and therefore "don't know what it takes to make a movie".</p>
<p>Baring all this in mind, Pilestedt therefore said the studio won't have the final say on the film. And, in his opinion, nor should it really, which I guess makes sense.</p>
<p>It still hasn't been revealed who will be taking on the role of director for the Helldivers 2 film. In fact, other than word that a film is in the pipeline as part of a collaboration between Sony Productions and Sony Pictures, there is not much else concrete to say at the present time.</p>
<p>"I'm excited to announce we are working with Sony Pictures on developing a film adaptation of our amazingly popular PlayStation game, Helldivers 2," was all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">PlayStation's Asad Qizilbash said during its reveal at CES last week</a>.</p>

            <p>A recent batch of trademarks filed by Sega suggests another classic video game series could be set to make a return.</p>
<p>As spotted by Gematsu, Sega filed two trademarks towards the end of last month. Those trademarks? "Ecco the Dolphin" and "Ecco".</p>
<p>The filings were made in Japan on 27th December, before they were subsequently made public yesterday.</p>

<p>Ecco the Dolphin was released all the way back in 1992 for the Sega Mega Drive (or Genesis, for those over the pond).</p>
<p>As I am sure you have no doubt figured, the game stars a dolphin by the name of Ecco. Our poor lead gets separated from his pod at the start of the game, and as such must find his way through the waters to reunite with them. This sees (or seas) Ecco negotiating underwater cave systems while booping jelly fish and such out of his way. Ecco eventually comes across other unexpected areas and creatures, but I will keep those as a surprise for those who don't already know.</p><p>Ecco the Dolphin was developed by Novotrade International and published by SEGA. A sequel - Ecco: The Tides of Time - was then released in 1994. Two spinoffs in the Ecco Jr line were released in 1995, before a reboot known as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ecco-defender-future">Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future</a> was then released in 2000 for the Dreamcast. This is the last game in the series, as development on another instalment was cancelled back in 2001.</p>
<p>More recently, Ecco the Dolphin and Ecco: The Tides of Time were delisted from Steam, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-delisting-over-60-classic-games-from-virtual-stores-including-jet-set-radio-and-crazy-taxi">Sega set about removing over 60 of its classic games from virtual stores</a>.</p>
<p>So, could we see the return of Ecco in the near future? I shore am excited to find out.</p>

<p>This project was one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-announces-flurry-of-projects-including-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi">five fresh titles in classic franchises announced in December 2023</a>, alongside new entries in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jet-set-radio">Jet Set Radio</a>, Shinobi, Golden Axe and Streets of Rage series.</p></div>

            <p>
It's been almost exactly a year since the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-game-directors-new-studio-confirms-first-project-as-fantasy-rpg-dawnwalker">unveiling</a> of Dawnwalker - the new dark fantasy action-RPG from Rebel Wolves. And if you've been eager to learn more - which would be completely understandable, given the studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-director-starts-own-studio-called-rebel-wolves">formed by a number of ex-CD Projekt staff</a>, including Witcher 3 game director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz - today's your lucky day. Publisher Namco Bandai has now given a first look at Dawnwalker's world in a four-minute cinematic trailer.
</p>
<p>
Rebel Wolves' debut game is now officially titled The Blood of Dawnwalker, and is described as the first chapter in a "brand-new role-playing saga". It's single-player and open-world, with a "strong focus on story and narrative", casting players as Coen - a "young man turned into a Dawnwalker, forever treading the line between the world of day and the realm of night".
</p>
<p>
All this unfolds in a 14th century Europe still reeling from the Black Death - a "moment of weakness" for a decimated humanity that gives the world's long-hidden vampires an opporunity to step out and seize control, with other creatures of the night following their lead. "Legends turn into reality, and history as we know it will never be the same."

<p>
There's not a huge amount of additional detail to be shared right now, but Bandai Namco says players will need to use their skills - combining "vampiric strength with human resolve" - as they embark on a quest to save the ones they love. "Face your foes - be they human, monster, or the ticking clock itself," the publisher concludes. "But remember - the real evil may bask in the sun's light, and the most loyal of allies could lurk under the cover of night."
</p><p>
Previously, Rebel Wolves CEO Tomaszkiewicz - who also served as a secondary director on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> while at CD Projekt - suggested The Blood of Dawnwalker wouldn't "be as gigantic as The Witcher" (instead coming in at around the size of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a>'s Blood and Wine expansion) but that it could well have a "greater" number of quests. Whether things have changed since then isn't known, but today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWsyV7yQIBQ">cinematic reveal trailer</a> ends with the promise that more information will be shared this "summer".
</p>
<p>
Alongside Tomaszkiewicz, Rebel Wolves counts former CD Projekt scribe Jakub Szamałek as its narrative director and main writer, with other team members including design director Daniel Sadowski, animation director Tamara Zawada, art director Bartłomiej Gaweł, CFO Michał Boryka, and studio head Robert Murzynowski - who have collectively worked on games such as Cyberpunk, Thronebreaker, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-warrior-2">Shadow Warrior 2</a>, and The Witcher series.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> and Metal Gear creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> is pondering his advancing age again, this time telling fans he "can't help but think about how much longer I'll be able to stay 'creative'", amid confirmation his studio Kojima Productions has now entered "crunch time".
</p>
<p>
Kojima shared his thoughts in a <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1878722221058986139">post on social media</a>, his musings seemingly inspired by a recent purchase of Ridley Scott: A Retrospective. "At this age, I can't help but think about how much longer I'll be able to stay 'creative'", he wrote. "I want to keep going for the rest of my life, but is it 10 more years? 20? Every day feels like I'm racing against the clock.
</p>
<p>
"Even now, at 87," he continued. "Ridley Scott is still active. And back when he was past 60 — my current stage in life — he created the masterpiece 'Gladiator'."
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time Kojima has spoken publicly about the ramifications of his advancing years. Last February, the 61-year-old game design legend <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-says-he-decided-to-make-physint-for-fans-after-sickness-made-him-reconsider-his-priorities">admitted</a> his decision to revisit the action-espionage genre that put him on the map - in the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-making-new-metal-gear-solid-style-game-and-movie-for-playstation">PlayStation 5 game Physint</a> - came after a period of sickness and surgery, followed by thoughts of his own mortality.

"I was at my lowest and felt like I couldn't go back to making games," Kojima explained at the time. "I wrote a will, too. And in that moment, I realised that people die. But, I turned 60 last year. I'll turn 70 in 10 years. I hope to never retire. Having said that, if the users desire it so much, I thought I should change my priorities a bit. I still want to do new things, but I decided to make an action-espionage game."
</p><p>
Physint, though, is still some considerable way off, with Kojima Productions first needing to get <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On the Beach and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">Microsoft-backed OD</a> out the door. Death Stranding 2 is likely the current priority, however, given it's the only game in the studio's slate to have anything close to a release window right now - with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-officially-titled-on-the-beach-coming-2025">sequel expected to arrive this year</a>.
</p>
<p>
And Kojima's musings on his capacity to remain creative follow his announcement last week that Kojima Productions is officially in crunch mode, presumably as development of Death Stranding 2 enters the final straight. "The most demanding period of game development — both physically and mentally — commonly known as 'crunch time'", he <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1877861699409391835">wrote on social media</a>.
</p>
<p>
"On top of mixing and Japanese voice recording," Kojima continued, "there's an inevitable pile of other tasks: writing comments, explanations, essays, interviews, discussions, and non-game-related work. It's incredibly tough."
</p>
<p>
Kojima's schedule is unlikely to clear anytime soon, of course. On top of Death Stranding 2, OD, and Physint, he's also working on a Physint movie, and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-is-getting-a-movie-adaptation">heavily involved in a live-action film adaptation of Death Stranding</a> - which is being made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kojima-productions-announces-partnership-with-a24-for-death-stranding-movie">in partnership with A24</a>.
