            <p>An action-comedy movie based on the superlative Oregon Trail is on the way.</p>
<p>As detailed by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/oregon-trail-movie-apple-1236045454/">Hollywood Reporter</a>, the film will be developed by Apple, with Will Speck and Josh Gordon on board to direct and produce.</p>
<p>Slated to include a number of original music tracks "in the vein of Barbie", the music will be provided by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, who recently secured an Emmy for their work on Only Murders in the Building.</p>

<p>Max Reisman and Judas and the Black Messiah's Lucas' brothers are reportedly on board to write the screenplay based upon the cult game.</p>
<p>The Oregon Trail is a 1980s strategy game in which the player leads a wagon train down the Oregon Trail from Independence, Missouri, to Willamette Valley, Oregon, in 1848. The copyright for the game currently sits with book publisher HarperCollins.</p>
<p>As yet, no stars have been attached to the project, and no release window has been confirmed.</p>
<p>Oregon Trail is just one of several games getting the silver screen treatment, of course. Sony's live-action movie adaptation of Supermassive's acclaimed PS4 cinematic horror game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-horror-until-dawns-live-action-movie-adaptation-arrives-next-april">Until Dawn is set to hit the big screen on 25th April next year</a>.</p><p>Whilst the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted">Uncharted</a> and Gran Turismo movies didn't exactly dazzle when they launched in 2022 and 2023 respectively, still to come are big-screen adaptations of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, Jack and Daxter, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gravity-rush">Gravity Rush</a>, with a TV adaptation of God of War also confirmed.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nvidia, the Californian tech company known for its PC GPUs, has seen a surge in market value, briefly overtaking Apple as the world's most valuable company.</p>
<p>And the reason isn't video games. It's AI.</p>
<p>On Friday last week Nvidia's stock market value reached $3.53tn, overtaking Apple's $3.52tn, as reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-overtakes-apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-2024-10-25/">Reuters</a> based on LSEG data. At the end of that day, Apple remained on top at $3.52tn, but at $3.47tn Nvidia saw an overall market value increase of 0.8 percent.</p>

<p>LSEG data shows Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft are in a three horse race as the world's most valuable companies. Nvidia briefly hit the top spot back in June, but was overtaken by both Microsoft and Apple shortly after.</p>
<p>By comparison on Friday, Microsoft's market value was $3.18 trillion.</p>

<p>The reason for Nvidia's increased market value is it's become the dominant supplier of processors used in AI computing, which requires huge amounts of processing power.</p>
<p>Additionally, earlier this month, Nvidia unveiled a new AI model that reportedly outperforms the likes of Chat GPT maker OpenAI (thanks <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/nvidia-just-dropped-a-new-ai-model-that-crushes-openais-gpt-4-no-big-launch-just-big-results/">VentureBeat</a>). It marks a shift for the company as it enhances its AI capabilities alongside its typical GPU offering.</p>
<p>"More companies are now embracing artificial intelligence in their everyday tasks and demand remains strong for Nvidia chips," Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, told Reuters.</p>
<p>"It is certainly in a sweet spot and so long as we avoid a big economic downturn in the United States, there is a feeling that companies will continue to invest heavily in AI capabilities, creating a healthy tailwind for Nvidia."</p><p>It seems graphics processing and AI could go hand in hand, too. Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nvidia-boss-we-cant-do-graphics-anymore-without-ai">Nvidia boss Jensen Huang discussed how AI could be used to advance graphical capabilities</a>. "We can't do computer graphics anymore without artificial intelligence," he said. "We compute one pixel, we infer the other 32. I mean, it's incredible. And so we hallucinate, if you will, the other 32, and it looks temporally stable, it looks photorealistic, and the image quality is incredible, the performance is incredible."</p>
<p>Nvidia will be supplying parts for Nintendo's forthcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> console, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-inside-nvidias-latest-hardware-for-nintendo-what-is-the-t239-processor">Digital Foundry explored last year</a>.</p>
<p>The company's next round of top of the range graphics cards are also expected to be announced soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
