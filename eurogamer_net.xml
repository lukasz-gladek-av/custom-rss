            <p>After a few playful teases earlier in the week, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> team has officially announced its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> collaboration.</p>
<p>"A demon begins his HUNT," reads the blurb on Capcom's collaboration trailer, which you can check out for yourself below. Cap-come and have a go if you think you're hard enough (or something like that).</p>

<p>So, what exactly does this Capcom collab - which is slated to arrive in Monster Hunter Wilds on 28th May - include? Well, players will soon be able to get their hands on the free Akuma hunter layered armour, which comes with some special fist-focused actions, as well as a Blanka-chan Palico layered armour which doesn't look at all strange, no sir-y.</p>
<p>To get hold of these Street Fighter inspired goodies, players will need to complete a new side mission known as Ultimate Strength. This is only available for those at Hunter Rank 21 or higher. Don't fret if you aren't quite there yet, though. Once the collaboration arrives later this month, it'll be a permanent addition to the game.</p>
<p>In order to get the ball rolling with this new mission, players will need to have a chat with Quinn at the Oilwell Basin Base Camp.</p>

<p>Along with these freebies, the studio is also releasing separate cosmetic collaboration DLC, but these will need to be purchased. "Please note: these paid DLC items are sold separately and are not available as a pack," Capcom emphasised.</p>
<p>This DLC will include a Chun-Li outfit and a Cammy outfit for Alma, as well as a Blanka-Chan Doll pendant, new gestures and more.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Capcom-related news, earlier today we got word that Jason Momoa and WWE wrestler Roman Reigns are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecrafts-jason-momoa-and-wrestler-roman-reigns-tapped-for-street-fighter-roles">currently in talks to star in Legendary's live-action Street Fighter movie</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Hot off the heels of his turn as Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison in A Minecraft Movie, Jason Momoa is reportedly in talks to star in another video game adaptation.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/street-fighter-movie-eyes-jason-momoa-noah-centineo-more-1236407261/">Deadline</a> sources, Momoa is currently in talks for a role in Legendary’s live-action Street Fighter movie, based on Capcom's fighting series. As for who Momoa may be playing should these talks prove successful, that for now remains unknown.</p>
<p>As well as Momoa, Andrew Koji (Bullet Train), Noah Centineo (Warfare) and WWE wrestler Roman Reigns (Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw) are all said to be in talks for the Street Fighter adaptation.</p>

<p>Back in February of this year, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-film-gets-new-director-still-set-for-2026">Kitao Sakurai would direct the upcoming Street Fighter film</a>, with Capcom "deeply involved" in the adaptation as well.</p>
<p>The film is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/live-action-street-fighter-movie-gets-2026-release-date">set for a release next year</a>, on 20th March, having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-film-and-tv-rights-bought-by-legendary-entertainment">first been announced back in 2023</a>. Further details for now remain thin on the ground, but it sounds like production could soon be ramping up, so stay tuned for more. Personally, I would love to see cameos from Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue (but I am not holding my breath).</p>
<p>As for Momoa, well, he is probably riding high on the success of A Minecraft Movie right now. The live-action adaptation, which also starred Jack Black, became a meme-filled hit on its release in April. The film generated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">$301m worldwide on its first weekend</a>, and has been such a success that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">there are already talks about a sequel</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bungie once considered a subscription model for its online shooter Destiny, but the idea was "vehemently shut down" by management.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> went free-to-play in 2019, but players need to pay for the most recent DLC expansions. There's also a store for paid cosmetics.</p>
<p>Other MMOs, such as World of Warcraft or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>, run on a subscription model, where players pay a monthly fee for access. According to a new report, Bungie considered this but management decided against it.</p>

<p>The news comes as part of a report into the current state of Bungie, following word last week that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">Bungie morale is in "free fall"</a> following the fallout of stolen assets used in its next game, Marathon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7wZ2tpjrmE">YouTuber and journalist Destin Legarie</a> has spoken to former employees this week. Bungie management were described as "toxic and shut down creatives on a core level", with one former employee stating: "If [management] didn't think of it, it wasn't worth doing."</p>
<p>In this context, when one employee brought up the possibility of a subscription model, it was reportedly "vehemently shut down".</p>
<p>In another example, management was concerned the glowing Trials of Osiris PvP armour was too attractive, which would impact sales of armours in the Eververse store. Decisions by management "prioritised monetisation over player experience", a former Bungie employee said. Another added: "Everything happening to Bungie is because of greed."</p>
<p>One former employee surmised: "Bungie's problems stem from a lack of player empathy, disconnected leadership, and a corporate-first culture."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Bungie for comment.</p>
<p>In 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-ceo-criticised-for-spending-millions-on-classic-cars-as-calls-for-leadership-changes-escalate">Bungie CEO Peter Parsons was criticised for spending millions of dollars on classic cars</a>. This news followed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">a round of layoffs where 220 staff</a>, roughly 17 percent of the company's workforce, lost their jobs.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">Bungie admitted to including designs in Marathon without the artist's consent</a>. And this wasn't the first time Bungie had made this mistake.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">showed off Marathon back in April</a>. It's a PvP extraction shooter set to release on 23rd September this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Embracer - the Swedish conglomerate which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">bought up and then proceeded to lay off countless studios and employees</a> - still plans to release "76 different games during FY 2025/26".</p>
<p>These games will be a mix of "new IPs, sequels, and remasters", according to the <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q4-january-march-2025-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-1077-million/">company's latest financial report</a>.</p>
<p>Upcoming releases from Embracer studios include Metal Eden, Gothic 1 Remake, Reanimal, Fellowship, Wreckreation, the next SpongeBob SquarePants game, Norse: Oath of Blood and Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core. Embracer also has a number of games it is yet to announce.</p>

<p>The company stated its AAA game releases "continue to be key financial drivers across specific years and quarters". It highlighted upcoming releases <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killing-floor">Killing Floor</a> 3 and Amy Hennig's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, the latter of which is being developed by Skydance Games and published by Plaion. </p>
<p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra was once tapped for launch some time around Christmas this year, but was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amy-hennigs-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-into-next-year">recently delayed into 2026 in order to "add more polish"</a> and ensure players get "the best possible experience" on release.</p>
<p>"We are expecting Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra to drive notable revenues but to have lower margins due to shared economics with several other partners," Embracer wrote.</p>
<p>Embracer also alluded to a third AAA release on its docket, which the company previously expected to debut in FY 25/26 but will "likely need a few more quarters to polish". Therefore, this game will likely release the following fiscal year (I wonder if this is Tomb Raider).</p>
<p>"We expect this specific game to have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-nears-2m-sold-as-troubled-publisher-embracer-celebrates-success">financial dynamics more similar to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>," Embracer said.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>In addition to releasing those 76 games in the coming year, Embracer will also spin off Coffee Stain Group into a standalone company by the end of 2025. </p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-announces-plan-to-split-into-three-companies-including-middle-earth-enterprises-and-friends">Embracer announced its split into three companies</a>: Coffee Stain and Friends, Middle-earth Enterprises, and Asmodee Group. Now Coffee Stain, known for the likes of first-person open-world factory building game Satisfactory, will separate.</p>
<p>"This strategic move will allow Coffee Stain Group to focus on its core strengths as passionate game developers and publishers, focused on delivering high quality experiences," Embracer said.</p>
<p>Middle-earth Enterprises will be renamed Fellowship Entertainment as a result, and will unite "top creators and intellectual properties" to "build unforgettable experiences for the fans".</p>
<p>Said Embracer: "The strategy is to transform into one powerhouse group with game development and publishing at its core, complemented with transmedia capabilities within IP licensing, comics, merchandise, film and distribution."</p>
<p>After a huge acquisition spree several years ago, Embracer subsequently shed thousands of staff and shuttered studios such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-studio-volition-has-been-closed-down-effective-immediately">Saints Row developer Volition Games</a>, after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-shares-plummet-after-proposed-2bn-partnership-collapses">major $2bn investment fell through</a>.</p>
<p>More recently in March, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-groups-eidos-montreal-studio-lays-off-up-to-75-employees">Embracer-owned Eidos-Montréal announced it was laying off "up to" 75 members of staff</a>, saying it didn't "have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
