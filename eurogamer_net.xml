            <p>Filming for the third season of Amazon's Fallout adaptation is kicking off sooner that we first expected.</p>
<p>Only a few weeks ago (ok, possibly slightly longer than that), the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-will-begin-filming-summer-2026-as-showrunners-want-to-get-series-back-on-air-as-soon-as-we-can">series' executive producer Jonathan Nolan said the Fallout crew hoped to start filming sometime this summer</a>, however we now know that filming is actually going to start this May. To be more specific, filming is scheduled for 1st May, in Santa Clarita.</p>

<p>Frederick E.O. Toye is once again going to be handling director duties during Fallout's third season, which according to a <a href="https://productionlist.com/filming-may-frederick-e-o-toye-direct-upcoming-series-fallout-season-3-santa-clarita-ca-united-states/">production post on Film and Television Industry Alliance</a> will bring "continuity and seasoned genre expertise" to the new episodes.</p>
<p>"Toye's contributions behind the camera have been notable across seasons one and two, providing a consistent visual and narrative rhythm that anchors the show's sprawling world," the post reads.</p>
<p>As for the California location, this is the "logical return point" for Fallout season three, as the team has already built a number of set pieces and such there, after filming moved from New York to The Golden State for the second season.</p><p>"The early May shoot date gives department heads and crew ample time to position themselves for hiring. Set builders and art departments should prepare to expand practical landscapes and terrain builds that reflect the saga's continuation through the Classic Wasteland and into new territory," the production post for Fallout season three adds.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-renews-fallout-for-third-season-six-months-before-second-arrives">Fallout was renewed for a third season back in May of last year</a>, months before season two made its debut. Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-3-now-being-written-collaborations-between-show-and-games-discussed">Bethesda's Todd Howard confirmed the third season was already being written</a>.</p>
<p>As for season two, its episodes are currently airing weekly over on Amazon Prime. Along with returning faces like Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-goes-full-new-vegas-with-a-new-trailer-showing-a-deathclaw-the-kings-and-macaulay-culkin">Macaulay Culkin and Kumail Nanjiani have also joined the show for season two</a>.</p>
<p>And as for other potential Bethesda adaptations, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation">Todd Howard recently told Eurogamer he "can't rule in or rule out an Elder Scrolls thing in the future"</a>.</p>
