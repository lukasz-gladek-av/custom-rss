            <p>Supermassive Games - known for releases such as Until Dawn and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-quarry">The Quarry</a> - has reportedly cancelled an unannounced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> game.</p>
<p>The project was titled Blade Runner: Time To Live, and according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPUISqX5T6E">Insider Gaming</a>, it was going to be a "character focused, cinematic, action adventure" release, poised to be launched across PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, as well as on next generation Xbox and PlayStation systems. Reportedly, it was a single-player game, slated for a 2027 debut.</p>

<p>The report claims the player would be the only Blade Runner in 2065, and the game's campaign would feature a 10-12 hour "compelling" story, which would blend "the philosophical themes of Blade Runner with kinetic action-adventure gameplay".</p>
<p>This story would see players taking on the role of So-Lange, the report states. So-Lange is a vintage model Nexus-6 "inexplicably still alive well beyond your limited lifespan".</p>
<p>Documentation seen by Insider Gaming reads: "Journey from the teeming undercity of New Zurich 2065 to the eerie remnants of the forgotten world beyond... Under orders to retire Rev, the mysterious and ruthless leader of an underground replicant network, you are betrayed and left for dead in a brutally hostile environment."</p>
<p>Blade Runner: Time to Live was said to have entered pre-production in September 2024, with pre-production then expected to wrap up in March 2025. The end of prototyping, meanwhile, was set for this September.</p>
<p>On the cost side of things, Blade Runner: Time to Live's development budget was reported to be in the region of $45m, with $9m of this expected to cover external performance capture and acting talent.</p>
<p>The game was ultimately cancelled, reportedly towards the end of last year. As to why, that's allegedly due to Alcon Entertainment, who is the owner of the Blade Runner rights, although no further details were provided at this time.</p>
<p>While we may never know what could have been, according to one source, Blade Runner: Time to Live was "rather impressive".</p>
<p>Next up from Supermassive Games will be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/directive-8020-is-a-notable-upgrade-to-the-dark-pictures-anthologys-formula">long-awaited next Dark Pictures Anthology game, Directive 8020</a>. This one's set in space, features Bond and Marvel star Lashana Lynch, and has been in development for some time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
