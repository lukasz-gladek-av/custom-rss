            <p>
Microsoft has announced its line-up of Xbox Game Pass titles for the beginning of February. 
</p>
<p>
The selection is, as you'd expect, headlined by this month's big <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> arrival Avowed, the fresh role-playing game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> developer Obsidian.
</p>
<p>
But, of course, you'll only get the game on 18th February - its launch date - if you have either PC Game Pass or Game Pass Ultimate.
</p>
<p>
Here's the full line-up of Xbox Game Pass titles for February:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Far Cry: New Dawn - 4th February (Standard, Ultimate, PC)</li>
<li>Another Crab's Treasure - 5th February (Now with Standard)</li>
<li>Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes - 5th February (Now with Standard)</li>
<li>Starfield - 5th February (Now with Standard)</li>
<li>Madden NFL 25 - 6th February (Ultimate, PC)</li>
<li>Kingdom Two Crowns - 13th February (Now with Standard)</li>
<li>Avowed - 18th February (Ultimate, PC)</li>

<p>
If you're already on Ultimate or PC Game Pass, your other new additions this month include Far Cry spin-off New Dawn, a follow-up to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-5">Far Cry 5</a>, and the arrival of this year's Madden NFL installment from EA Sports.
</p>
<p>
Subscribers to the newer Standard tier now join Ultimate and PC subscribers in gaining access to Bethesda's space RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>, plus Another Crab's Treasure,  <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-review">Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes</a> and Kingdom: Two Crowns.
</p>
<p>
As ever, whenever Microsoft giveth, it also taketh away. Seven games are set to leave Xbox Game Pass on 15th February, in case you want to give them a quick bash before they go:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A Little to the Left (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Bloodstained Ritual of the Night (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>EA Sports UFC 3 (Console via EA Play)</li>
<li>Indivisible (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Merge and Blade (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Return to Grace (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Tales of Arise (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you want to keep playing these games after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to purchase them. On the plus side, Game Pass subscribers get a 20 percent discount.

Last week, Microsoft gave us a glimpse at Doom: The Dark Ages, Ninja Gaiden 4 and South of Midnight as part of its Xbox Developer Direct. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-is-positioned-to-save-the-xbox-console-business">It's taken eight years, but could  Game Pass finally be positioned to save the Xbox console business and give Xbox a point?</a>
