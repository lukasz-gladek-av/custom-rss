<p>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap brings a rogue-lite progression system and new heroes with unique abilities and traps with which to beat waves of enemies.</p>
<p>Players can utilise randomised buffs, the environment, and the weather too, fighting orcs, skeletons and more either solo or with up to four players in co-op.</p>
<p>The Orcs Must Die! series has proven particularly popular since the release of the first game back in 2011.</p>
<p>Since then it's spawned a number of sequels, resulting in Deathtrap bringing four-player co-op for the first time.</p>
<p>"With Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap, we embraced the challenge of innovating within a thirteen-year-old franchise by listening closely to our fans and their requests," said Patrick Hudson, co-founder and CEO of developer Robot Entertainment.</p>
<p>"We've stayed true to the classic chaotic action and light-hearted tone, while introducing four-player co-op, new and versatile heroes with deeply unique abilities, expanded level variety, and new roguelite progression choices."</p>

<p>The first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a>, released in 2022, won multiple awards and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-the-bafta-nominated-citizen-sleeper-is-a-game-about-now">nominated for four BAFTAs</a> including British Game and Game for Impact. It's a phenomenal tabletop-inspired game, exploring political themes with evocative writing and a beautiful electronic score.</p>
<p>The sequel, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-officially-unveiled">announced in June 2023</a>, will stick to a similar template to the first as it follows a new Sleeper android protagonist out in the stars and uses the same dice-throwing mechanics.</p>
<p>Creator Gareth Damian Martin stated the central theme was "crisis", with the pandemic and invasion of Ukraine being influential.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Katharine Castle went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-2-goes-even-harder-on-its-rpg-roots-with-its-bold-new-twists-on-its-tabletop-dice-rolls">hands-on with Citizen Sleeper 2</a> earlier this year. "There may be a different set of machines powering this ambitious RPG, but deep down, it still has the same gooey, human heart we know and love," she wrote.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
