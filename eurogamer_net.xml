            <p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> Reddit AMA has provided insight into when the next major update may be coming, as well as a firm stance on the design direction of the PvP endgame.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lehj35/official_dune_awakening_launch_ama_with_funcom/">AMA</a> was handled by Funcom developers including creative director Joel Bylos. It was Bylos who responded to questions regarding the endgame PvP, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-is-being-dominated-by-one-busted-technique-crushing-people-with-helicopters">which has proven controversial</a> among those torn on the orniphopter-laden meta that has formed in the game's opening weeks.</p>
<p>When asked whether the team was considering removing missile launchers for scout orniphopters - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-early-meta-helicopter-infested-nightmare">the source of much ire</a> - Bylos responded with considerations from the team.</p>

<p>"Equipping a Scout Ornithopter with rocket Pods [could] reduce overall maneuverability and max speed. This will help solidify this module selection as a desire to engage in combat and balance it versus other combat-focused vehicles," said Bylos. He also noted other ideas, like an increased impact on the scout orniphopters' heat when shooting missiles, as well as a baseline speed increase to orniphopters with boosters equipped to make escaping easier.</p>
<p>As for the overall endgame experience, Bylos expanded his thoughts as to explain more macro goals the team desire.</p>
<p>"We want players to make meaningful decisions about what they bring with them and how they outfit their vehicles," Bylos stated. "Once players have engaged in PvP, we want the experience to be reliable, responsive, and clearly understood. This determines how PvP as a whole feels and how players make their moment to moment decisions in a fight."</p>
<p>Bylos would conclude by addressing concerns regarding connection-related troubles: "To ensure a more reliable experience in ground combat, we are continuing to address issues with movement desyncs and rubber banding, as well as ability activation reliability."</p>
<p>When asked whether or not a Deep-Desert-style zone without vehicles was being considered, Bylos outright stated no, elaborating: "a lot of our adjustments and balancing are going to drive combat towards the core vision, which is people competing over points of interest in the Deep Desert". Bylos continued: "The current balance between vehicles and on-foot is not tuned to our liking and there are multiple changes in the pipeline to address this (above and beyond bugs we will fix)."</p>
<p>So it's certainly been made clear that quality of life changes are being worked on, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-patch-ends-the-reign-of-vehicular-terror-as-ramming-into-other-players-no-longer-deals-damage">like the removal of vehicle ramming damage in PvP</a>, the team stood firm for their ideas on how the Deep Desert works. Which is good, in my opinion. Filing down this "vision", as Bylos puts it, risks removing a substantial amount of character from the game.</p>
<p>The AMA wasn't just focused on PvP! Other interesting tidbits were revealed by the team, such as a quality-of-life update coming in July, the fact that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-new-maps-hagga-basin">major Dune: Awakening updates</a> are planned to release every three-four months with new PvE and story stuff to play through, as well as plans to add new contracts to the game.</p>
<p>In Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-review">Dune: Awakening review</a>, the endgame was described glowingly: "It feels less like structured group activities you'd see in a traditional MMORPG raid, and more like grouping up in Classic WoW for a world boss. Or joining a hunt train in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>. It's organic community play, something that forms bonds, strong friendships, and undoubtedly tense rivalries."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Those of you keen to revisit <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/house-dead">The House of the Dead</a> 2 via its souped-up remake will be able to do so later this summer.</p>
<p>Publisher Forever Entertainment and developer MegaPixel Studio have announced their rail-shooter The House of the Dead 2: Remake will release across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3376690/THE_HOUSE_OF_THE_DEAD_2_Remake/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_house_of_the_dead_2_remake">GOG</a> and Nintendo Switch on 7th August. It will retail for $24.99 (I have asked for clarification on UK pricing).</p>
<p>"Take on the lone role of a secret agent as James or Gary, or team up in co-op mode to neutralise the dangerous creatures standing in your way," reads the official blurb for The House of the Dead 2: Remake. You can check out a trailer for the remake below.</p>

<p>This is the second of the team's zombie games to get the remake treatment. However, reception to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/house-of-the-dead-remake-heading-to-playstation-5-this-week">first House of the Dead: Remake's reception was pretty mixed</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/house-of-the-dead-film-in-the-works-from-resident-evil-monster-hunter-director">The House of the Dead is also set for the big screen, with Paul WS Anderson</a> on board to write and direct. Anderson will also serve as a producer, alongside his partner Jeremy Bolt. The duo have also worked on adaptations for the likes of Mortal Kombat (1995) and Monster Hunter (2020), as well as multiple Resident Evil films.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Limited Run Games has requested Nintendo temporarily remove its Gex Trilogy from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> eShop.</p>
<p>The Gex Trilogy, which bundles together the cult-classic 90s platformer Gex and its two sequels, launched earlier this week across PC, PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and both Switch consoles.</p>

<p>But while things appear to have gone swimmingly across most platforms, the trilogy wasn't working as intended on Switch 2. A number of Limited Run Games titles which run on its Carbon Engine had compatibility issues with the new console, however a recent firmware update released by Nintendo last night resolved the majority of these. But, alas, the Gex Trilogy was not one of them.</p>
<p>Sharing an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/limitedrungames.com/post/3lrxtpy5kw627">update on social media</a>, Limited Run Games said: "Since we do not have clarity on when Gex Trilogy on Switch 2 will be fixed in firmware, we submitted our own patch last week to correct the issue."</p>
<p>However, due to the Juneteenth holiday across the pond, this patch is still awaiting approval. While Limited Run Games hopes to issue the patch early next week, it has requested Nintendo for the time being removes the game from the Switch 2 eShop.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your patience as we work with Nintendo to resolve these issues," Limited Run Games wrote, before sharing a list of its games that are now Switch 2 compatible following that aforementioned firmware update.</p>
<p>This list is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clock Tower: Rewind</li>
<li>Jurassic Park Classic Games Collection</li>
<li>Tomba! Special Edition</li>
<li>River City Girls Zero</li>
<li>A Boy and his Blob Collection</li>
<li>Rocket Knight Adventures</li>
<li>Shantae</li>
<li>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Retro Collection</li>
<li>Xtreme Sports</li>
<li>Trip World DX</li>
<li>Felix the Cat</li>
<li>Rendering Ranger R-2: Rewind</li>
</ul>

<p>The Gex Trilogy has otherwise been a successful launch for the team at Limited Run Games. Soon after its more modern debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gex-trilogy-celebrates-success-with-much-requested-feature-that-should-make-european-fans-happy">the publisher announced the PAL versions of Gex 2 and Gex 3</a> - which feature the vocal stylings of Leslie Philips and Danny John-Jules respectively - will be added in an update.</p>
<p>"We're excited for European Gex fans to relive these games the way they remember and for others to hear them for the first time," Limited Run Games said at the time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A controversial third-party plugin used by some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> players has been permanently shut down following a cease and desist notice.</p>
<p>A message on the PlayerScope discord (shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1lfgia4/playerscope_stalker_plugin_ceases_development_due/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit</a>) details the web back-end has been taken offline and all stored data has been "permanently and irreversibly deleted", while the plugin files have been completely removed from GitHub and GitFlic. "There will be no further updates, support, or development from my side," said the tool's creator.</p>
<p>While PlayerScope hasn't specified where the cease and desist notice has come from, back in January this year Final Fantasy 14 producer and director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> shared news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-considering-legal-action-against-use-of-a-third-party-tool-in-final-fantasy-14-says-naoki-yoshida">Square Enix was considering taking legal action against the creator of a third-party tool</a>.</p>

<p>Eurogamer has contacted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> for clarification.</p>
<p>Yoshida has long warned players against using third-party plugins, which are strictly prohibited in Final Fantasy 14. He's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-world-first-ultimate-raid-challengers-busted-for-cheating-thanks-to-single-pixel">repeatedly called out players for cheating during Ultimate Raid challenges</a>.</p>
<p>However, the PlayerScope tool in particular has been used for nefarious intentions.</p>
<p>The plugin would allow anyone to search for a Final Fantasy 14 character name to receive that player's account details, including information of all characters on that account. Player information was also uploaded to a central server combining all data. Essentially, this allowed for in-game harassment and stalking.</p>
<p>In short, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxivdiscussion/comments/1hvv7k5/comment/m5w6qo1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one reddit user</a> put it, the plugin was a "stalker's wet dream".</p>
<p>"We strive to offer and maintain a safe environment for our players, which is why we ask everyone to refrain from using third-party tools," said Yoshida back in January.</p>
<p>In February, <a href="https://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/515747-Letter-from-the-Producer-LIVE-Part-LXXXV-%2802-21-2025%29">Square Enix stated</a> it was making changes to how characters were blacklisted, although third-party tools were able to get around this - something the company admitted was "very problematic". While it had countermeasures in place, Square Enix did not disclose what those were.</p>
<p>Now, however, PlayerScope has been completely shut down. "This wasn't an easy decision, but it was necessary," said the tool's creator.</p>
<p>Still, while players have mostly praised the decision, some have concerns the database of player information may still exist elsewhere.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Blood Message, a single player narrative action game, has just been revealed by Netease Games.</p>
<p>The game is coming to PC and consoles, though no release date has been announced.</p>
<p>Developed by 24 Entertainment, the studio responsible for melee battle royale Naraka: Bladepoint, the new trailer introduces the Dunhuang's Uprising as Blood Message's setting, where your character must make a 1,000 mile trek with a crucial message in hand.</p>

<p>The trailer - which you can watch above - is a visually impressive display, showcasing plenty of third-person action across various distinct locations. While 24 Entertainment does have action experience courtesy of Naraka, this looks to be a much slower, cinematic affair.</p>
<p>An accompanying press release states Blood Message will feature: "Visceral, realistic combat blending stealth and survival mechanics", as well as "expansive landscapes inspired by the diverse terrains of East and Central Asia". In terms of gameplay comparisons, think something along the lines of The Last of Us, albeit with a close-quarters, historical focus.</p>
<p>"We are ushering players a new generation of high adventure with Blood Message," said Zhipeng Hu, lead producer and NetEase executive vice president. "As our first completely single-player focused experience from NetEase Games, after two decades of deep dedication to the gaming industry, we are prepared to deliver a truly epic and cinematic experience for players around the world."</p>
<p>We're seeing a lot of these big budget action games come from China as of late, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-black-myth-wukong-has-changed-the-game-for-chinese-developers">the success of Black Myth: Wukong changed the game for the country's developers</a>. Prior to Blood Message, Phantom Blade Zero, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, Lost Soul Aside, and Tides of Annihilation are just a handful of examples of interesting titles following the path Wukong first tread.</p>
<p>These examples have yet to release, and as such whether or not the financial and critical success of Wukong can be replicated by its contemporaries remains to be seen. Nonetheless, this wave of interesting looking games coming to the West from a historically under-represented part of the video game industry (at least as far as big budget AAA is concerned) certainly offers another avenue for exciting games to reach the hands of curious players.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
