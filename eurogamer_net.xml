            <p>
Ubisoft has quietly updated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> with a day one patch that includes changes to how players can interact with objects within the game's shrine locations. 
</p>
<p>
The change is minor, but notable as it follows attention on the game raised by Japanese politician Hiroyuki Kada, who was upset at preview footage of the game featuring a player crashing around a local shrine within Shadows (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-japan-concern-about-assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-confirms-day-one-patch-that-makes-tables-and-racks-in-temples-and-shrines-indestructible">IGN</a>).
</p>
<p>
At launch, major items in Shadows' shrines are no longer destructible. Ubisoft appears to have released the patch alongside the game's release last night, meaning players will already have it installed.

<p>
Yesterday, Kada flagged the situation again, to get a response from the country's prime minister. The following exchange comes via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-prime-minister-of-japan-responded-to-a-question-about-assassins-creed-shadows-today-heres-whats-actually-going-on">IGN</a>, with translation by IGN Japan colleagues.
</p>
<p>
"I fear that allowing players to attack and destroy real-world locations in the game without permission could encourage similar behavior in real life," Kada said. "Shrine officials and local residents are also worried about this. Of course, freedom of expression must be respected, but acts that demean local cultures should be avoided."
</p>
<p>
According to IGN Japan staff, the context to Kada's comments is that Japan has seen record tourism since the country's post-lockdown reopening, and wider concern of "over tourism" that has sparked a rise in vandalism. Kada's concern is that Shadows players who have played the game might try and recreate its violence in real-life.
</p>
<p>
"Defacing a shrine is out of the question - it is an insult to the nation itself," Japanese prime minster Ishiba said yesterday, in a response to Kada. "When the Self-Defense Forces were deployed to Samawah, Iraq, we ensured they studied Islamic customs beforehand. Respecting the culture and religion of a country is fundamental, and we must make it clear that we will not simply accept acts that disregard them."
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, Assassin's Creed Shadows' launch day patch includes a small list of fixes previously flagged as arriving on day one.
</p>
<p>
If you're playing Shadows already, you likely have this patch installed. Ubisoft told Eurogamer it will not be highlighting the patch publicly beyond confirming the below notes are accurate:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Players no longer getting stuck inside movable objects after dodging forward and interacting with them in kofuns</li>
<li>Fix for procedural weapons being removed incorrectly when selling items</li>
<li>Adjustments to prevent players from going out of bounds when proning against objects</li>
<li>Improved horse navigation, reducing issues with turning and blocked paths</li>
<li>Lighting adjustments for cave, kofun, and architectural entrances/exits</li>
<li>Fixes for cloth clipping on Yasuke's outfits (while riding) and Naoe's outfits (while crouching)</li>
<li>Citizens without weapons no longer bleed when attacked, reducing unintended blood spill in temples/shrines</li>
<li>Tables and racks in temples/shrines are now indestructible (Some objects like drums or bowls can still be broken as they are generic ones present everywhere in the world) (Tables are still dynamic objects, so players can still move/push them).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows has been a lightning rod for controversy over its road to release, including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-statue-pulled-as-company-behind-it-acknowledges-insensitive-design">reworked figurine with an initially "insensitive" design</a>, and gripes over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-sorry-assassins-creed-shadows-artwork-features-real-life-historical-re-enactment-group-logo">historical inaccuracies in concept art within a collector's art book</a>. </p>
<p>There has also been an ongoing backlash to Yasuke's presence and role in Shadows, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-explains-why-he-ignored-elon-musk-after-backlash-over-african-samurai-yasuke">caught the attention of Elon Musk</a>.

            <p>McDonald's is offering its customers the chance to purchase a £8.19 Minecraft Movie Meal as part of its promotion for the upcoming film, complete with "amazing collectibles" crafted for adults.</p>
<p>Those interested in sampling McDonald's upcoming movie meal - which will be available from Wednesday, 26th March - can choose from a Big Mac, nine Chicken McNuggets, or four Veggie Dippers. Then, to obviously make this into a meal, there will be a side and drink of choice. Now, this all sounds like a pretty average McDonald's meal, but it will be Minecraftified thanks to some free blocky McDonald's characters with each purchase.</p>
<p>One of six collectibles will be available with McDonald's A Minecraft Movie Meal, and they are: Grimace Egg, Zombie Hamburglar, Birdie Wings, Fry Helmet, Soda Potion and Big Mac Crystal. It's your call if this is worth £8.</p>

<p>Other Minecraft-themed offerings coming to the menu include the limited edition Nether Flame Sauce, which is a combination of crushed red pepper and flaming cayenne, "balanced" with hints of garlic and sweetness.</p>
<p>There's also an Apple Cake McFlurry, which the company is sure will "excite A Minecraft Movie and McDonald's fans across the UK" thanks to its apple and shortcake pieces topped with a sour apple sauce. The Apple Cake McFlurry will sell for £2.19, but there is also a mini version for £1.69.</p>
<p>"McDonald's is exploring a brand-new world with the A Minecraft Movie collaboration. We're always looking for fun and exciting ways to bring excitement to our menu and the A Minecraft Movie Meal is a perfect way to bring two icons together," said Senior Vice President Chief Marketing Officer at McDonald's UK and Ireland Ben Fox.</p>
<p>"This partnership has allowed us to bring amazing collectibles, crafted for adults, to the UK for the first-time ever! We can't wait for fans to meet their favourite McDonaldsland characters in blockified form, and to experience the new products which have been inspired by the A Minecraft Movie universe - Nether Sauce and Apple Cake McFlurry."</p>

            <p>
Final Fantasy publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has launched legal action against a developer it had partnered with to make a new Front Mission game.
</p>
<p>
Front Mission, the company's classic mecha battle franchise, was set to be revived by BlackJack Studio via a new game titled Front Mission 2089: Borderscape. 
</p>
<p>
After two years of development, Square Enix cancelled the project in October 2024, and walked away from BlackJack Studio for reasons unknown. Shortly after, BlackJack Studio announced its own "Front Mission-style game", known as Mecharashi.

<p>
Square Enix's <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/841035863/Square-Enix-suing-to-stop-this-Front-Mission-style-mecha-game-from-being-released-in-the-US">lawsuit</a> (uncovered by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/542570/square-enix-front-mission-mecharashi-lawsuit">Polygon</a>) claims Mecharashi uses the work BlackJack Studio undertook for its own project. Indeed, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3446920/Mecharashi/">Mecharashi's own Steam page</a> describes the game thus: 
</p>
<p>
"Mecharashi is a mecha-themed tactical turn-based game. The game adopts a Front Mission-style combat system, where you can assemble mechas however you want, equip a wide selection of weapons, and choose your favorite pilots to engage in battle."
</p>
<p>
Court documents filed by Square Enix include pages of screenshots comparing the unreleased Front Mission prototype made by BlackJack Studio and the developer's new project. The similarities are obvious. 
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>Front Mission 2089: Borderscape prototype images, compared with Mecharashi. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Square Enix</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Square Enix is seeking $150k (£115k) in compensation for copyright infringement, and an immediate removal of the game's listing from storefronts.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Mecharashi has already disappeared and reappeared from Steam as Square Enix and BlackJack Studio squabble over a DMCA notice.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
The Communications Workers of America (CWA) is launching an industry-wide union of video game workers in North America and Canada, which it says will help "build worker power irrespective of studio and current job status".
</p>
<p>
The CWA has been at the centre of many of the successful US games industry unionisation efforts over the last few years, with 2024 seeing announcements of unions at the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/200-workers-at-bethesda-game-studio-have-unionised">Bethesda Game Studios</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-world-of-warcraft-team-forms-500-stong-union">Blizzard</a>. Its <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/membership">newly unveiled United Videogame Workers</a> (UVW-CWA) operates a little differently to a traditional certified union, however, serving as a direct-join industry-wide organisation - said to be the first of its kind for the games industry in the US.
</p>
<p>
The nature of the UVW-CWA means any freelance or full-time video game industry worker - artists, writers, designers, QA testers, programmers, and <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/faq">beyond</a> - can join if they're based in the US or Canada, with dues calculated on a sliding scale. And it's also open to industry musicians, having been launched in partnership with the American Federation of Musicians (AFM). This, the CWA says, will help "build power across the industry without the obstacles and delays that employers can impose during the traditional union certification process".
</p>
<p>
"Our mission is to take back our lives, our labour, and our passion from those who treat us like replaceable cogs," the <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/mission-statement">UVW-CWA writes</a>. "To empower our fellow workers; to link up arms with the laid off, with the freelancer, with the disillusioned contractor, with the disenfranchised and the marginalized, with the workers labouring invisibly to keep this industry afloat. Our goal is to create a union... to fight the whims of CEOs and private equity vultures."
</p>
<p>
"We are going to draft a video game worker bill of rights," the UVW-CWA explains elsewhere, "setting standards that have been glaringly absent from our craft for too long. It will address inequality in hiring, the pervasive reliance on crunch, healthcare for contractors, and protections against all manner of injustice. Armed with this bill, new organisers can activate with clarity of goal and action, cultivated by the shared knowledge of not only fellow game developers, but workers in the entire labour movement."
</p>
<p>
In an <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/faq">accompanying FAQ</a>, the UVW-CWA continues, "Not only do we build community and solidarity amongst video game workers, we also strive to build large-scale education campaigns about labour organising in the video game industry, provide legal support and layoff support funds for disenfranchised workers, write template contract standards, build professional development and mentorship programmes within our community, and so much more." The first of the UVW-CWA's campaigns will focus on layoffs, and a petition is being shared at this week's GDC in the hope of gaining "widespread support".
</p>
<p>
The CWA's announcement comes amid a devastating few years for the games industry, marked by extensive layoffs and studio closures. Over 25000 employees are believed to have lost their jobs since the start of 2023 - and according to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gdcs-state-of-the-games-industry-survey-says-one-in-ten-respondents-laid-off-in-2024">GDC's most recent State of the Games Industry survey</a> from earlier this year, one in 10 respondents reported being laid off in 2024.
