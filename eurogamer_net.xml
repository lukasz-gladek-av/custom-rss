            <p>It's been an interesting year for Capcom, so far. After the successful launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> earlier this year, the keystone franchise for the developer appears to have hit a snag, as sales have declined rapidly in the post-launch window. As the game released, it broke records for Capcom as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">its fastest-selling game ever</a>, and enjoyed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-biggest-physical-launch-of-any-ps5-game-in-japan">the biggest physical launch</a> of any game in the series.</p>
<p>Per Capcom's <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/1st/explanation_2025_1st_01.pdf">latest financial results</a>, however, it's clear that the initial fervour around the game has died down. In the last quarter, Monster Hunter Wilds sold 477k copies - that's only a bit higher than the 389k copies <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> managed to shift in the same period. And that game is four years old.</p>

<p>This significant sales falloff is probably due to a couple of factors. Firstly, there has been plenty of criticism of the game for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">poor optimisation and lack of end-game content</a>. PC players, in particular, have been frustrated by a perceived lack of support for the game on the platform (with some player noting it was literally unplayable for a while due to<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-performance-related-pc-improvements-coming-this-week-says-capcom"> issues with shader compilation and stuttering frame rates)</a>. Though Capcom has consistently been applying patches to the game,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-details-next-monster-hunter-wilds-update-as-steam-reviews-continue-overwhelmingly-negative-plunge"> it's clearly not enough</a> to stem the sales bleed.</p>

<p>The result? Capcom's share price has dropped significantly in Japan. The company's share price sat at t ¥4,283 at the end of Wednesday, as of this morning's market opening, it was down nearly 10 percent. Perhaps frustratingly for the company, though, it's operating profit was actually up 90.8 percent year-on-year - it's amazing to see what an impact the perceived slump in just the Monster Hunter series can have on the markets. Capcom insists brand health is still strong, going as far as pointing out the strength of legacy series titles:</p>
<p>"Regarding catalog titles, although sales were soft for Monster Hunter Wilds, the latest title in the series released in February this year, Monster Hunter Rise, a previous title in the same series, continued to see sales growth."</p>
<p>Attempts to put Monster Hunter Wilds back on course continue, and just this week Capcom announced a rejig of the game's roadmap to address player concerns<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-revised-roadmap"> and move planned features up the schedule</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Devil May Cry series (which hasn't seen a wholly new release since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/devil-may-cry-5-special-edition">Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition</a> in 2020) has proved to be a smash hit for the publisher over the past few months. Per the financials, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/devil-may-cry-5">Devil May Cry 5</a> sold 1.782m units in the last quarter alone (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-anime-boosts-devil-may-cry-5-sales-to-over-10m">bringing total sales of the game to over 10.5m</a>). The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/devil-may-cry-hd-collection">Devil May Cry HD Collection</a> sold 594k in the last quarter, and Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition sold 495k in the same time period. That means overall series sales rose 3m, up to 36m as of June 30, 2025.</p>
<p>Capcom attributes these bumper sales figures to "the series' synergies with the newly released anime series", despite a lot of criticism from fans about the quality of the animated show. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-season-1-review">Our reviewer seemed to like it to some degree</a>, although popular consensus would say that it's a bit too juvenile for most tastes (and deviates a fair amount from the source material, to boot).</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the Devil May Cry series has also seen plenty of sales over the past six months, and there was even a Humble Bundle deal (<a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/devil-may-cry-devil-trigger-collection">the Devil Trigger Collection</a>) that was live from 16th July through to 31st July that managed to shift 13,182 units, raising £25,285 for charity.</p>
<p>Overall? Despite share price woes in the short term, it's clear Capcom is still in a very healthy place, and - here's hoping - we'll get an announcement about the future of the Devil May Cry series soon. DMC1 remake, anyone?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-5-monster-hunter-wilds-capcom-latest-financial-quarter]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s horror game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-medium">The Medium</a> is set to be adapted for film, courtesy of It and Annabelle writer-producer Gary Dauberman.</p>
<p>Dauberman has secured the screen rights to the game and will produce the film alongside Mia Maniscalco, the president of Coin Operated - the production company he founded (thanks <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/gary-dauberman-spooky-video-game-the-medium-exclusive-1236333819/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>).</p>
<p>"With its compelling story and incredibly cinematic visuals, The Medium is a natural for a feature film adaptation," said Dauberman.</p>

<p>"When I talked to Piotr [Babieno, Bloober CEO] about it, we immediately connected on our mutual love of horror and his vision for where the genre is headed," he continued. "I have no doubt anything Bloober develops is going to push horror forward in unique and terrifying ways, and I'm excited to be working alongside them."</p>
<p>The search for a writer and director for the film adaptation has now begun.</p>
<p>"Adapting games into films often involves balancing many interests, but with The Medium, I have a deep sense that Gary is the perfect partner for us," said Babieno. "From our very first conversation, I felt we were completely in sync. And every conversation since has only reinforced that feeling."</p>
<p>This won't be the first game adaptation Coin Operated has worked on, after the company co-produced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/full-until-dawn-film-trailer-shows-plenty-of-gruesome-deaths">Until Dawn film</a> with PlayStation Productions.</p>
<p>Dauberman himself is known for writing The Conjuring Universe films Annabelle and The Nun, as well as the 2017 film It and its sequel (based on Stephen King's novel).</p>
<p>The Medium, released in 2021, followed Bloober's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/layers-of-fear">Layers of Fear</a>, Observer and Blair Witch. Set in Poland, it's a psychological horror with a protagonist who's able to travel between two terrifying realms.</p>
<p>Bloober has since seen success with its remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> and is now preparing for the release of Cronos: The New Dawn later this year. According to our preview, it pilfers liberally from other survival horror games.</p>
<p>"In the crudest terms possible, Cronos: The New Dawn is a survival horror game about going back in time to steal things from the past," wrote Eurogamer's Ian Higton in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cronos-the-new-dawn-feels-like-a-combination-of-every-other-survival-horror-game-ive-played-before-it-which-isnt-always-a-good-thing">Cronos preview</a>. "I say this because its developers, Bloober Team also seem to have gone back in time and stolen almost every aspect of Cronos' gameplay from past survival horror titles and more."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/bloobers-the-medium-will-be-adapted-to-film-courtesy-of-it-and-annabelle-writer-producer-gary-dauberman]]></content:encoded>
