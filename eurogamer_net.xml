            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a> will be a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> launch game, but developer Toby Fox has announced the RPG will be cross-compatible with both Switch consoles.</p>
<p>That means if you buy the Switch 1 version now, you can get the Switch 2 version later at no additional cost. Similarly, on the PlayStation Store, you get both the PS4 and PS5 versions at once.</p>
<p>Fox also <a href="https://toby.fangamer.com/newsletters/release-time/">confirmed the release times for the game</a>, with the Switch 2 version being available from 5th June at midnight local time in each respective region. That does mean Japanese players will have access to the game much earlier than those in the US.</p>

<p>For other platforms, though, the game will launch at a specific time globally - that's midnight Japan time on 5th June, meaning it's actually out on 4th June in other countries.</p>
<p>As such, the launch times for the game will be as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Switch 2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>5th June 12am local time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam, Switch, PS4, PS5</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>5th June 12am JST</li>
<li>4th June 4pm UK</li>
<li>4th June 5pm CET</li>
<li>4th June 11am EDT</li>
<li>4th June 8am PDT</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, Fox shared a handful of trophies that will be available on the PlayStation version of the game. He noted players will need to complete the current "room" where a trophy unlocks in order to receive it.</p>
<p>He added: "But, really, I think you'll enjoy the game more if you don't pay attention to whether you get the trophies."</p>
<p>Deltarune is Fox's follow-up to the cult classic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/undertale">Undertale</a>. Though development began in 2012, it's been released episodically as a series of chapters - the first two were available for free when released in 2018 and 2021 respectively.</p>
<p>This release next month will therefore at long last mark the game's complete release.</p>
<p>"Toby Fox is in a weird position," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-is-a-game-about-playing-and-its-bloody-brilliant">Eurogamer's preview of the first two Deltarune chapters</a>. "On one level, he has every artist's dream: near unlimited resources, plenty of time, and an eager fanbase willing to lick the dregs of an idea from his outstretched fingertip. He can make whatever he likes. But whatever he makes, be it a cupcake or a clothing brand or a package holiday business, will be compared, inevitably, to Undertale."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>That's a wrap on Fallout season two. And what better way to celebrate the end of a hard shoot than peeling off your skin? OK, I can think of many better ways, but that is how actor Walton Goggins decided to share the news.</p>
<p>Goggins plays Fallout's gunslinging Ghoul in the Amazon show, and as his character has been exposed to plenty of radiation and harsh conditions, the actor wears a lot of prosthetics to get the look just right.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJZqMmDOBab/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">post on Instagram</a>, Goggins peeled off his Ghoulish outer layer and threw it at the camera. In true Goggins fashion, though, he made it look good.</p>
<p>Fellow Fallout star Ella Purnell, meanwhile, shared a more wholesome photo to mark the end of production. "aaaaand thatâ€™s a wrap on @falloutonprime Season 2 folks! ðŸ¤“," Purnell, who plays Vault dweller Lucy in show, wrote with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJZnLWFKUHw/?igsh=MTV6OHNxbWN6ZnZ5Zg%3D%3D">an accompanying photo</a> of the actress next to her on-screen dad Kyle MacLachlan.</p>

<p>The Fallout X account also shared the news, writing "Achievement unlocked! Fallout Season 2 has wrapped production." The account shared Goggins' skin shedding shots, so feel free to enjoy those below.</p>

<p>Fallout's first season was a huge hit for Amazon, and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">quickly picked up for a second season</a>. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy - who executive produce the show via Kilter Films - said they couldn't "wait to blow up the world all over again".</p>

            <p>
Alien: Rogue Incursion, the action-horror adventure from developer Survios, is ditching its headset requirements and getting a non-VR release on PS5 and Steam this September.
</p>
<p>
Alien: Rogue Incursion initially launched for PSVR 2 and PCVR last December, putting players into the big clompy boots of ex-Colonial Marine Zula Hendricks as they - alongside their ever-present synth companion Davis 01 - embarked on a dangerous mission to the uncharted planet Purdan, in the hope of exposing the Weyland-Yutani's black-site experiments. Unsurprisingly, it doesn't take long for those pesky Xenomorphs to make their presence known.
</p>
<p>
Survios calls Alien: Rogue Incursion (which additionally launched for Meta Quest 3 earlier this year) part one of a two-part story, albeit one that "stands alone as a complete story" if you don't include "thrilling cliffhanger". It's newly announced non-VR release is titled Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition, and is described as having been "re-envisioned" for console and PC. What that means in specific terms isn't entirely clear, but there's talk of "even deadlier Xenomorphs and enhanced visuals."

<p>
The original Alien: Rogue Incursion currently has a 'mixed' rating on Steam, having garnered criticism for issues ranging from wonky AI to poor performance - but the general concensus seems to be it's built on solid foundations and manages to capture the essence of the beloved sci-fi series. And if that works for you, Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition will be available in two guises when it launches for PlayStation 5 and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3655390/Alien_Rogue_Incursion_Evolved_Edition/">Steam</a> on 30th September.
</p>
<p>
There's a $29.99 USD Standard Edition featuring just the base game, plus a $39.99 Deluxe Edition. This includes the base game, a Blue Camo armour skin, a Blue Camo weapon skin, and The Art of Alien: Rogue Incursion in-game art book. It's unclear, however, if owners of the earlier VR edition will be able to access the new version without forking out for the new release.
</p>
<p>
So to recap, Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition launches for Steam and PS5 on 30th September. And if that's put you in an Alien mood, why not take a trip to last year, when Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-decade-of-alien-isolation-how-creative-assembly-made-an-all-time-horror-classic">celebrated a decade of Creative Assembly's all-time horror classic Alien: Isolation</a>?
