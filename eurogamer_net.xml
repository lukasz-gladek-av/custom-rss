            <p>
Another week is upon us - and that means more Epic Games Store freebies, with the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jurassic-world-evolution-2">Jurassic World Evolution 2</a> currently available for nowt. But things are a little bit different this time around; starting today, Epic is introducing weekly free games to its mobile store - available worldwide on Android devices and on iOS in the EU.
</p>
<p>
As usual, Epic's latest free games are available for seven days - starting today, 20th March, and running through to next Thursday, 27th March. During that time, you can grab the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Jurassic World Evolution 2 (PC)</li>
<li>Super Meat Boy Forever (iOS/Android)</li>
<li>Eastern Exorcist (iOS/Android)</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<p>

<p>
It's a decent line-up then, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/jurassic-world-evolution-2">starting with Jurassic World Evolution 2</a> - Frontier Developments' dinosaur-themed park management sequel, in which players attempt to create a thriving dino attraction that, all being well, won't attempt to eat the guests.
</p>
<p>
As for this week's mobile offerings, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-meat-boy-forever">Super Meat Boy Forever</a> is a good 'un, taking the twitchy platforming of developer Team Meat's 2010 classic and turning it into an endless runner. "Super Meat Boy Forever does more with two buttons than most do with 14", we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-meat-boy-forever-does-more-with-two-buttons-than-most-do-with-14">wrote back in 2017</a>. And finally, there's Eastern Exorcist - a side-scrolling action RPG set in a fantasy world of spirits and monsters. Epic notes this one's only available in certain regions, but doesn't say which.
</p>
<p>
And if you're wondering what's coming next, you might have to wait a bit. Epic's breaking from tradition this week, and hasn't revealed what'll be replacing its current bunch of free games. Instead, its next two PC freebies are simply listed as "mystery game" over on its store. 
</p>
<p>
Epic, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-sweeney-no-regrets-on-fortnite-app-store-drama-as-epic-game-store-launches-on-mobile-in-europe">launched its mobile store last August</a>, following ceaseless legal activity and new EU regulations requiring major companies such as Apple to allow sideloading and alternate marketplaces on their devices. Not long after, Epic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-bringing-free-games-to-its-mobile-store-in-a-bid-to-entice-new-users">confirmed its free weekly games programme would be coming to mobile</a>, and here we are now.

If you've found yourself pondering the time-travel terrors teased in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-developer-bloober-reveals-next-game-original-sci-fi-horror-cronos-the-new-dawn">Bloober Team's Cronos: The New Dawn reveal trailer last October</a>, you might be intrigued to hear the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> studio has now shared further details in a new developer diary. That's alongside the reveal of I Hate This Place - an open-world survival horror game it's publishing later this year.
</p>
<p>
Cronos: The New Dawn, as we previously learned, follows the adventures of the enigmatic Traveler as they journey between a monster-infested post-apocalyptic future - created after a cataclysmic event known as the Change - and 1980s Poland. Now, though, Bloober has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuSJpd2c7UY">talked a little more about its upcoming sci-fi horror</a> - which is said to draw inspiration from the likes of John Carpenter's The Thing, mind-pummelling German TV series Dark, 12 Monkeys, Dead Space, and even a touch of Dark Souls in terms of its challenge.
</p>
<p>
As for Cronos' enigmatic lead, the Traveler is just one of a group - described as 'divers in time' - sent to explore the ruins of human civilisation in search of time rifts. These enable them to extract people from the past who didn't survive the apocalypse. In Cronos' alternative timeline, the world ended in the '80s - thanks to the aforementioned Change - and the resulting wasteland is populated by monstrous creatures known as The Orphans.
</p>

<p>
These are the remnants of humanity, and can take different forms, each with distinctive abilities. What connects each variant, however, is the fact they're all still made of human tissue, introducing an element of body horror reminiscent of The Thing. Additionally (as per Bloober's not entirely serious closing Q&amp;A), players can expect walls of flesh, face-punching melee combat, "kinda" flamethrowers, dismemberment of sorts, and aliens ("maybe"). And ladders.
</p>
<p>
It's promising stuff (especially for ladder fans, apparently), but sadly we've still no clearer idea of when Cronos: The New Dawn will arrive - beyond its previously announced "2025" launch window on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, that is. What we do know, though, is that it isn't the only game on Bloober's 2025 release slate. The studio has also unveiled I Hate This Place, an isometric open-world survival horror currently due to arrive in "Q4" this year.
</p>
<p>
I Hate This Place is the work of developer Rock Square Thunder (Bloober is handling publishing duties under its new Broken Mirror Games label) and it's inspired by Kyle Starks and Artyom Topilin's comic book series of the same name. Players take on the role of Elena, who finds herself in a deadly fight for survival in a "harsh and unforgiving wilderness" after unwittingly awakening a malevolent force. It promises crafting, formidable foes, tense gunfights, and melee combat "that rewards ingenuity over brute force" - alongside a day and night cycle said to impact gameplay dynamics. Oh, and "avoid the Horned Man at all costs".

<p>
"Drenched in bold, vivid colours and retro '80s comic book aesthetics," adds Bloober, "each location is lovingly crafted to tell its own disturbing story through stylish visuals that blur the line between reality and nightmare in a world where everything wants you dead."
</p>
<p>
I Hate This Place launches via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2604490/I_Hate_This_Place/">Steam</a> and the Epic Games Store in "Q4" this year.

            <p>
Nightdive Studios' long-in-the-works <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/system-shock-2">System Shock 2</a> remaster finally has a release date, and it's coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on 26th June.
</p>
<p>
Nightdive initially announced it would be remastering <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> developer Irrational Games' critically acclaimed - and hugely influential - 1999 FPS/RPG sci-fi horror hybrid <a href="https://x.com/NightdiveStudio/status/1160740078685057025">back in 2019</a>. At the time, it was known as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/system-shock-2-enhanced-edition">System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition</a>, but it's since had a name change, and will now be arriving as System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster.
</p>
<p>
Following on from Nightdive's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/system-shock-review-shodan-steals-the-show-in-this-faithful-remake">extremely well-received System Shock 1 remake</a>, which launched in 2023, its System Shock 2 remaster promises enhancements to characters, weapon models, textures, cinematics, and animations. That's alongside quality of life improvements, optimised controller support, updated co-op multiplayer, and achievements. PC players can also expect mod support, up to 144fps, and ultra-widescreen compatibility.

<p>
At its heart, though, it's still the same acclaimed System Shock 2. That means another battle of wits against rogue AI SHODAN as players - choosing between one of three military branches - find themselves on the FTL ship Von Braun in the year 2114. "Hybrid mutants and deadly robots roam the halls while the cries from the remaining crew reverberate through the cold hull of the ship," explains Nightdive. "SHODAN... has taken over, and it's up to you to stop her."
</p>
<p>
And now, just managing to squeak into the 25th anniversary window with two months to spare, Nightdive's System Shock 2 remaster launches on 26th June. It'll be available for Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PS4, Switch, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/866570/System_Shock_2_25th_Anniversary_Remaster/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/system_shockr_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">GOG</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-cb94d9">Epic</a>, and the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/agecheck/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster">Humble Store</a>. Additionally, anyone that pre-ordered Nightdive's original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/system-shock">System Shock</a> remake on Steam (or crowdfunded it at the $30 level or higher) will <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598858095/system-shock/posts/4320315">get the System Shock 2 remaster for free</a>.
</p>
<p>
"It's the finest work that both Looking Glass and Irrational ever produced," Eurogamer contributor Rick Lane <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/system-shock-2-still-stands-as-irrationals-finest-work">wrote of System Shock 2 back in 2015</a> (beware spoilers!), "and if that doesn't give you a shout of being the best game in existence, I'm not sure what does."
