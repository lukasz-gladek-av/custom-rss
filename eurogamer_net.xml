            <p>After delaying and then cancelling Football Manager 2025 due to ongoing issues getting the massively reworked game ready, SEGA and Sports Interactive have announced that Football Manager 2026 is coming.</p>
<p>Details on the game are sparse, with no new details beyond the fact that we know Sports Interactive planned for FM25 to be a huge evolution of the series which had seen more iterative changes and improvements over the years prior.</p>
<p>According to SEGA FM26 will "take players on a journey to define their footballing destiny with our most immersive and visually rich Football Manager experience yet. The potential for storytelling is redefined by taking players closer to the heart of the beautiful game."</p>
<p>The move to the Unity game engine should bring the 3D match engine up to modern standards. While the teaser released by Sports Interactive doesn't show an actual match in action, it does tease some in-engine visuals and points to the official Premier League licence.</p>
<p>You can watch that small teaser trailer below:</p>

            <p>Speaking to Eurogamer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a> director Katsuhiro Harada (via translation from designer Michael Murray) stated a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> port of the 3D fighting game could happen, but it'll be a costly endeavour.</p>
<p>In an interview at Evo earlier this month, Harada stated: "It's an interesting option, and not totally off the table. But it would require a lot of work on the game to get it running on that hardware."</p>
<p>Harada continued: "From a business standpoint, [the Switch 2] is doing quite well, so it would be a very good business decision if you're trying to get a bigger audience. But the amount of work that would have to be done on the game makes it not a very easy decision. At this point in time, there are no… (laughs) There is nothing to announce."</p>

<p>Perhaps a launch on the Switch 2 would be a good thing for Tekken 8. The game is currently mired in controversy thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-receives-emergency-patch-in-response-to-season-two-balancing-backlash">a series of new changes</a> that have been implemented as part of both Seasons 2 and 3 of the game. The reception on returning Muay Thai specialist Fahkumram has been mixed, though the fan barometer seems to have improved slightly with the reveal of Armor King. Newcomer Miary Zo has split the fanbase somewhat, too, although there appears to be more to the Malagasy teenager than meets the eye (current fan theories point to her being some sort of vessel for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-3">Tekken 3</a>’s Ogre…) A release on new hardware to a more casual audience could be good for the game, and Harada has previously spoken at length about <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1760182225143009473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1760182225143009473%7Ctwgr%5Ea4d3d2e1be924ba8754cd1486aa9e2204e4e3130%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2Fmediaembed%2F1b1wup2%2F%3Fresponsive%3Dtrueis_nightmode%3Dfalse">Tekken 8 needs to recoup a lot of money</a> in order for the series to have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekkens-harada-isnt-worried-about-his-future-absence-damaging-the-series-wont-be-hard-to-continue-with-someone-else">a future</a>.</p><p>As for the Switch 2, the platform has proven an interesting destination for fighting games. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> launched on the Switch 2 alongside the console's release back in June. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-street-fighter-6-on-switch-2-classic-60fps-action-with-better-image-quality-than-xbox-series-s">It's a good port that holds its own against other versions on the PS5, PC, and Xbox</a>. Plus, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-6-sells-five-million-copies-on-track-to-be-best-selling-street-fighter-ever">it contributed to the file million sales milestone for Capcom's latest 2D fighter</a>.</p>
<p>Not only is the Switch 2 a popular new console, its portability offers interesting opportunities for genres with an inherent social component. Fighting games are - and have always been - best played with others. Slapping down a Switch 2 at an airport or local meet-up and getting some games in is a lovely little value add for those games who make the leap. Here's hoping Tekken 8 manages it.</p>
