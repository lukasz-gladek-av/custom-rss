<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s upcoming permanent OG Mode will have its own unique battle pass, developer Epic Games has revealed, separate to that of the game's main Fortnite Battle Royale offering.
</p>
<p>
Epic Games previously revealed that its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-reviving-original-map-as-permanent-addition-featuring-multiple-classic-seasons">hugely-popular original Fortnite map would return permanently in December</a> as a separate mode that looks set to rotate through its various seasonal incarnations. The decision follows the map's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-smashes-concurrent-user-records-as-over-6m-players-log-on-this-weekend">massive but temporary return 12 months ago</a> that gave the game its best-ever player count of 44.7 million participants in 24 hours.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-crew-will-include-the-battle-pass-lego-pass-music-pass-and-more-starting-in-december">blog post</a> today, Epic Games revealed that the new OG Pass, as well as the game's main Battle Pass, plus the next iterations of the Music Pass and Lego Pass (each 1400 V-Bucks) will all be included in the existing Fortnite Crew subscription going forward. 
</p>
<p>
That's a big upgrade for anyone currently paying £10/$12 a month for Fortnite Crew. The changes mean that this subscription will soon include four battle passes for the same price, instead of just the main Battle Pass.
</p>
<p>
There are a couple of other tweaks today, too. The cost of the main Fortnite Battle Pass is being rounded up to 1000 V-Bucks instead of 950, and new Crew subscribers after 1st December will only be able to claim battle pass rewards while their subscription is active.
</p>
<p>
More details on exactly what will be in the new OG Pass and how much it will cost are still to come ahead of the mode's arrival on 6th December.
</p>
<p>At the same time, Fortnite will also offer an all new Chapter 6 version of its evergreen battle royale, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-6-map-features-japanese-theme-leaks-suggest">which looks set to have a Japanese theme</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
