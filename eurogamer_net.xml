            <p>Team Cherry has confirmed it's still working on new content for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, but won't say when it's coming out.</p>
<p>The long-awaited adventure was finally released in September to huge fanfare. And it would seem the developers aren't done with it yet.</p>
<p>"We didn't plan seven years for Silksong," Team Cherry co-founder Ari Gibson told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-28/the-makers-of-hollow-knight-silksong-aren-t-done-just-yet?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDM0NzQzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzY0OTUyMjM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNkczNjFLR0NUSDAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.nHDv04b3quPAcWKT5nBOeCqr1KCS01wBn_nMscKzzng&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>. "Not that we expect to take an excessive amount of time, but we still are pursuing the same development philosophy, which sometimes can expand our timeframe."</p>

<p>Silksong, infamously, began life as DLC for the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> game before ballooning into a full standalone game.</p>
<p>It's unclear exactly what the studio is working on, and if that too has the potential to balloon in size.</p>
<p>Bloomberg has speculated a DLC focused on Steel Assassin Sharpe may be in the works. This character was teased in a <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/happy-hollowmas">studio blog post years ago</a>, but wasn't included in the final game.</p>
<p>"Just waiting in the wings," said Gibson of the character. "Waiting to arrive is probably the best way to say it. One of those enemies, a little suite of Sharpe and their companions, they got tucked away for a while because the game had so much in it. And all of these pieces need polish, and polish takes time. We're excited to reintroduce Sharpe. We just have to get to them."</p><p>Gibson added: "We will make sure to deliver on all of our obligations. One, because they're going to be very fun to do. But even alongside those tasks we had our own ideas for extra things that could be added to the world. We're trying to juggle when that could potentially be."</p>
<p>Bloomberg also asked Team Cherry if they wish to shorten the time for their next game.</p>
<p>"At the start of Silksong, and at the start of Hollow Knight, we had no conception it would take as long as it did for either game," said co-founder William Pellen. "We started to work on the basic idea of it, and allowed it to grow as much as we wanted it to. We could've stopped that from growing if we'd wanted to. I imagine we'll go on to the next game, again with that core idea and begin exploring it and start to suss out what the boundaries will end up being."</p>
<p>Gibson added: "We're clearly not concerned if it ends up taking a long period of time."</p>
<p>For now, the pair are "certainly happy with where [Silksong] is sitting right now, and we're not planning anything dramatic at this point," said Gibson, following multiple balance tweaks and updates.</p>
<p>He continued: "We're also quite happy where technically it's sitting, noting that we will continue to do small fixes of course. And we are looking at what else can we do, what else can be brought to the experience and how that world can expand. I don't know how much we can really speak about it. We're playing a little coy again. But that's also because this stuff is in flux."</p>
<p>The pair are considering different sizes of updates too, similar to the smaller Lifeblood or larger Godmaster and Grimm Troupe from Hollow Knight.</p>
<p>Said Pellen: "We were talking about the next project in general. We're not thinking about the size. We just started making new stuff and working on bits and pieces. We're still in this world, thinking about stuff to present to people."</p>
<p>Information will come "soon", but the pair wouldn't be drawn to a timeframe and said they'll have a more frequent cadence of communication as there's more to discuss.</p>
<p>Gibson surmised: "Yes, we're continuing to work on the game, we're pursuing the things that excite us."</p>
<p>This will certainly be exciting news for Silksong fans, too. "Pretty and charmingly mean-spirited, this is a game filled with revelations and genuine personality," reads our five star <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-review">Hollow Knight: Silksong review</a>.</p>
<p>In the same interview, the pair also discussed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modding-hollow-knight-silksong-is-totally-fine-say-team-cherry-but-studio-is-largely-happy-with-difficulty-balance">Silksong's imposing challenge and the use of mods to alter the difficulty</a>.</p>

            <p>Hytale, the seemingly doomed sandbox RPG has a release date at last, after the project was reacquired by one of its original co-founders. It will be launching into Early Access on the 13th January, 2026.</p>
<p>This news <a href="https://x.com/Hytale/status/1994421030991904777?s=20">was posted on social media via the official Hytale account</a> earlier today, alongside a disclaimer for those eager to hop in and try it out next year. Prepurchasing opens up on the 13th December, though the team has actually urged fans to pre-order the game with caution.</p>
<p>The reason? Rather than an Early Access release where all is polished and feature complete, Hytale instead seems to be launching with a ways to go.</p>

<p>The Hytale social media account states: "If you don't feel comfortable pre-ordering, please don't. This is true early access, meaning it's still very much unfinished and will be buggy for a while, but you have the team's commitment to make Hytale the game we've always wanted it to be. More details are coming soon. Thank you, everyone, for your support. Hytale has been through a long journey, and soon, we will be home."</p><p>Such transparency is both laudable and understandable, especially given the surge of community support for Hytale in recent months. The game hit rocky waters earlier this year when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-snaps-up-studio-behind-promising-minecraft-like-sandbox-game-hytale">its former publisher</a> Riot Games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-minecraft-like-hytale-cancelled-after-ten-years-in-development">pulled the plug on what was proving to be troubled development</a> for the game.</p>
<p>Following this, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-saved-riot-sells-cancelled-minecraft-like-game-back-to-its-original-co-founder">the game was saved by the aforementioned co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme</a> after negotiations with Riot Games. The result: a game that has been in development since 2015 is finally going to be playable, which is wonderful news.</p>

<p>Following Valve's controversial decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-responds-with-additional-context-following-horses-steam-ban-controversy">ban developer Santa Ragione's narrative horror game Horses from Steam</a>, rival storefront GOG - which <em>will</em> be selling the game when it launches next week - has weighed in, saying it wants "to give players the freedom to choose what they play, and [give creators] the space to bring their artistic work to them.".</p>
<p>Italian studio Santa Ragione - whose award-winning output includes Saturnalia and Meditteranea Inferno - announced Horses back in 2023. It's a three-hour horror adventure - blending monochrome visuals, live-action intermissions, and interactive sequences - that unfolds across 14 days on a farm where naked human "horses" are kept as livestock. It makes for some striking imagery as the game explores "the burden of familial trauma and puritan values, the dynamics of totalitarian power, and the ethics of personal responsibility".</p>

<p>However, Horses made headlines this week when its release date announcement was accompanied by the news it would be available on all PC platforms with the exception of Steam. It's a long story that Santa Ragione co-founder Pietro Righi Riva <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">discussed with Eurogamer in more detail</a> when the news broke, but the short version is Valve made the decision to ban Horses from its platform in 2023, saying it would not "distribute content that appears, in [its] judgement, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor."</p><p>Santa Ragione had a number of things to say about that. Firstly that it was a mischaracterisation of a brief mid-game scene - "not sexual in any way" - where a visitor to the farm lets his young daughter ride one of the horses, and secondly that the scene was altered, ageing the daughter into a 20-something woman, while the game was still in creative flux. Its belief is Horses would have passed Steam's approval process without issue if Valve - which has refused to re-examine the final build - had not requested an early version, and the fact no other storefront has taken umbrage with the game supports that.</p>
<p>And now, Steam rival GOG has weighed in on <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1994406374273318952?s=20">social media</a>, saying it's "proud to give Horses a home", and adding it "[believes] players should be able to choose the experiences that speak to them." In a seperate comment provided to Eurogamer, the storefront elaborated further, saying GOG will be distributing Horses because its platform "is the place on which we want to give players the freedom to choose what they play, and creators can have the space to bring their artistic work to them."</p>
<p>"At GOG, we aim to provide developers with a welcoming space for their projects and to make it simple for players to access the games they care about," it continued. "We're happy to give Horses a home... giving players another way to experience the game – and to support the Santa Ragione studio in this difficult time, we've decided to <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses">launch pre-orders on Horses today</a>."</p>
<p>Horses launches via <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses">GOG</a>, the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horses-004d87">Epic Games Store</a>, the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/horses">Humble Store</a>, and <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses">Itch.io</a> on 2nd December.
