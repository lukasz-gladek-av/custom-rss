            <p>Ashley Johnson, who portrayed Ellie in Naughty Dog's The Last of Us and its sequel The Last of Us Part 2, has shared her thoughts on the divisive second season of HBO's TV adaptation.</p>
<p>While the first season of The Last of Us was met with praise, the show seemed to falter a bit with season two. There were a few quibbles, with many debating whether or not the TV team was right to reveal Abby's motivations so early in the season, among other issues with pacing, character development and so on. </p>
<p>But, season two was always going to be a tricky board to tread. Even the award-winning The Last of Us Part 2 received some very vocal pushback on its release in 2020. So, what does Johnson make of the renewed discussions around The Last of Us following season two's release last year?</p>
<p>"I feel like with The Last of Us, people really love that story, including me, and it's very, very passionate fans. And sometimes that passion feels really great, and sometimes it feels not great," Johnson told <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/the-last-of-us-season-2-ellie-ashley-johnson-backlash">The Direct</a>. "But you know, I understand it. I understand loving something so much, and wanting it to be what you want it to be."</p><p>Johnson added it "can be hard sometimes", because "when you are making these things, and on your side of things, you're passionate about it, and excited about it, and hopefully those two things can meet". However, the actor noted that sometimes "they do not", and this can be difficult.</p>
<p>"I mean, anytime you're working on anything, you want people to like it, and you want people to love it as much as you," Johnson explained. "But I love The Last of Us in every form, and I am so happy that I get to be a part of [telling] that story."</p>
<p>As well as her part in bringing the games to life, Johnson also had a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lets-discuss-the-last-of-us-episode-nine">cameo in the first season of HBO's The Last of Us adaptation</a>, as Ellie's mother.</p>

<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation">Neil Druckmann announced he was stepping back from the series after The Last of Us season two</a>, in order to focus on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s gaming output, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-studio-naughty-dog-reportedly-mandated-crunch-to-ready-a-demo-for-intergalactic-the-heretic-profit">includes Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. Druckmann had previously worked on The Last of Us' adaptation as a co-showrunner, director, writer and producer. While he's returned to full-time video game development, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-will-retain-high-level-role-on-the-last-of-us-season-three-to-ensure-its-as-deeply-faithful-as-season-one">Druckmann has since said he will remain somewhat involved in The Last of Us' adaptation at a "very high level"</a> to make sure it's "as deeply faithful" as the show's first season was.</p><p>As for the future of the series, it is currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-previously-insisting-there-was-no-way-hbos-the-last-of-us-show-could-be-wrapped-up-in-3-seasons-it-looks-like-itll-be-wrapped-up-in-3-seasons">suspected the upcoming third season will be its last</a>. Since then, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-third-and-perhaps-final-season-adds-two-new-cast-members">Clea DuVall and Jorge Lendeborg Jr. will both join The Last of Us for the show's upcoming season</a>.</p>

            <p>One of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-future-of-the-games">Fallout Season 2's biggest shockers</a> was having Wasteland veteran <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-veteran-ron-perlman-says-he-was-paid-40-dollars-and-a-sandwich-for-his-voiceover-work-in-the-original-game">Ron Perlman</a> (who's done voice acting for the entire game series) show up in a quick cameo role as a mysterious CGI'd super mutant.</p>
<p><strong>Spoilers for Fallout's Season 2 finale ahead.</strong></p>
<p>After the last episode, which dropped last week, we didn't get any answers regarding this new player or where the teased "war" might be going. We know the Fallout universe has a lot going on beyond the current scope of the show, and while it seems we'll eventually get to see <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-ending-explained-your-biggest-burning-questions-answered">even the giant mech Liberty Prime</a> one way or another, we'd be surprised if the creatives manage to cram every iconic bit of the games into the live-action adaptation.</p>
<p>That said, co-showrunner and writer Geneva Robertson-Dworet revealed during <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/fallout-season-3-ron-perlman-super-mutant-wars">an interview for The Direct</a> the plan is to have more of Ron Perlman's super mutant helper in the show: "I hope people know that he is a larger character in this world, in our minds." She also went on to underline she's always seen him "as a big role" that's part of their tendency to hint at wars happening elsewhere in the Wasteland.</p><p>It might be a while before he shows up again though, as those conflicts "maybe aren't in the region of the Wasteland where our characters currently are." Perlman's green-skinned guy has been seen helping The Ghoul near New Vegas, however, so we'd be shocked if he is nowhere to be seen in Season 3 even if the larger war the showrunners are hinting at isn't on the immediate horizon.</p>
<p>First up, Lucy and Maximus will have to deal with the Legion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/oops-funko-pop-might-have-just-spoiled-a-fallout-season-2-plot-point">after its change in leadership</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://collider.com/fallout-season-2-finale-explained-colorado-location-geneva-robertson-dworet-frances-turner/">The Ghoul is heading to Colorado</a>... but that may also take a while to pan out.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/fallout-season-3-ron-perlman-super-mutant-wars">full chat with The Direct</a> is an interesting read that goes into more of the world-building ambitions of the team behind the show. For example, the powers that be aren't shying away from stating the Brotherhood of Steel might have a larger role moving forward and as we get to see other chapters.</p>
<p>It's a world of possibility out there, and as long as the show's ratings <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-prime-videos-sixth-biggest-season-of-all-time">remain healthy</a>, I'm sure both Bethesda and Amazon MGM Studios are happy to keep it going.</p>

            <p>Mewgenics, the latest release by Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel, launched yesterday. Within six hours the game sold over 150k copies, made back its development costs, and leaped to the top of Steam's Top Sellers list.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mewgenics-sells-over-150k-copies-in-first-6-hours-this-is-beating-expectations-by-quite-a-lot">Speaking to IGN</a>, Glaiel revealed that the game has already a bigger release than any of the expansions for The Binding of Issac, the prior game released by the duo and itself an indie darling.</p>
<p>Mcmillen revealed that prior to Mewgenics, The Binding of Issac: Rebirth sold 40k copies on its release date, while Mewgenics sold 152k in its first five hours. He added: "Isn't that kind of insane?" The original Binding of Isaac <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-binding-of-isaac-sold-700-000-copies">managed to sell over 700k copies in less than a year</a> after launch, an impressive figure that's on track to be beaten in short order.</p>

<p>Since its release yesterday, the game<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/686060/charts/"> leaped to a peak concurrent player count of 65,962 on Steam</a>. In addition, it has beaten out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>'s big relaunch on Steam's Top Selling page. That game is no slouch by the way, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-expansion-brings-players-surging-back">itself seeing new peaks not seen in years</a>.</p><p>Mewgenics, for those unaware, is a cat-focused tactical Rogue-like, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-is-an-infernal-machine-that-runs-on-cats">which Eurogamer previewed recently</a> with much acclaim and praise. In it, Christian Donland wrote: "If I have one point to leave you with - other than the fact that the soundtrack is rich with brilliant original songs - it's this: the core of Mewgenics may be simple and familiar, but the game that unfolds across all these runs is huge, and obviously so, even from my position about nine or ten hours in."</p>
<p>To celebrate the launch, both Mcmillen and Glaiel celebrated with a custom Mewgenics cake, which you can see below. Eurogamer has enquired what sort of cake this was, and will update this article when we receive a response.</p> <div>

            <p>The poorly-received Dino Crisis-like Code Violet has a sequel in the pipeline.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Code Violet, it's a third-person action horror game from TeamKill Media, which places you in the shoes of Violet Sinclair as she faces down "ferocious prehistoric dinosaurs and hostile forces". And, well, it hardly set the world alight on its debut earlier this year.</p>
<p>But, despite this less than enthusiastic response, TeamKill Media has revealed it's already started work on "the next chapter of Violet's story", citing the, erm, "overwhelming success" of Code Violet.</p>
<p>"We're actively progressing on several exciting projects, with more announcements and reveals coming your way very soon," the Code Violet team wrote, before stating it was now developing a sequel known as Code UltraViolet.</p>
<p>"We're incredibly excited about what's ahead and can't wait to bring you along for the journey," <a href="https://x.com/TeamKillMedia/status/2021293486377431222">the studio closed</a>. "Stay tuned!"</p>
<p>This is somewhat surprising to hear, given that Code Violet hardly won scores of praise from critics and players on its debut earlier this year. As noted by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/awful-ps5-dino-shooter-code-violet-will-get-a-sequel-for-some-reason">PushSquare</a>, TeamKill's latest release has an overall critic score of 29 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/code-violet/">Metacritic</a>, and a 2.6 user score. Meanwhile, over on the PS Store, it's got <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/UP5503-PPSA26528_00-0656994000407395">a 2.88 player rating</a> from confirmed buyers. Of those reviews, 36 percent only gave Code Violet one star (though, 31 percent awarded it the full five stars).</p><p>"Game is utter garbage. Needs to be removed from this planet, so no one else falls for this scam in purchasing it. PlayStation store should definitely refund everyone that has purchased it," reads a one star Code Violet user review on the PS Store.</p>
<p>Have you played Code Violet? And, if you have, are you keen to see a sequel?</p>

            <p>A revitalised <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> (formerly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>) is bringing players back, propelling the game to most-watched status on streaming service <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, and to being one of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">most played games on Steam</a> - comfortably above copycat hero-shooter Marvel Rivals. There was even a queue to log in to Overwatch when I played yesterday evening, which is something I've never seen before.</p>
<p>Currently there are <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/overwatch-2">nearly 100,000 people watching Overwatch streams on Twitch</a>, making it the most viewed game by some way, with nearly 30,000 more viewers than second-place game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a>. Meanwhile on Steam, Overwatch peaked at 165,000 players, putting it briefly in the top 10. It's currently 13th, nearly 10 places ahead of genre rival Marvel Rivals, which has trumped Overwatch on Steam for a long time.</p>
<p>Note, however, that Overwatch is not only available on Steam. The predominant platform for play is Battle.net, which is presumably where the bulk of the audience lies. Should the jump in activity on Steam reflect the jump in activity on Battle.net, then, the actual number of Overwatch players is presumably much higher.</p>
<p>The renewed Overwatch activity is due to an expansion-like release, The Reign of Talon, which arrived yesterday. It's the game's first expansion and heralds <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-big-plan-to-put-overwatch-back-on-top">the beginning of a new yearly expansion-era for Overwatch</a>, which Blizzard will release in addition to more regular Season updates.</p><p>Season 1 - the kick-off season for Reign of Talon - brings five new heroes to the game at once, which is an unprecedented amount for Overwatch, and Blizzard plans to add five more new heroes over the course of the year. These aren't the only changes to the game, though, with major user interface reworks and story-related changes present as well.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1r1segu/so_death_chandelier/">So… Death Chandelier???</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Synodii/">u/Synodii</a> in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/">Overwatch</a> </blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>But it's the new heroes that everyone is talking about - notably the new flying hero Jetpack Cat, who has the meta-shaking new ability to tow other characters through the air. All of the combo possibilities of this are currently being felt out. Among them, lifting a spinning, Ultimate-ing Reaper above a team to prevent them hiding behind cover; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1r1omoi/behold_the_jetpack_cat_reinhardt_duel/">airlifting the hammer-swinging Reinhardt through the air to duel other airlifted Reinhardts</a>; and discovering bizarre quirks such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1r1rsht/eliminated_someone_before_the_match_even_started/">being able to kill people before a match has officially begun</a>. People are also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1r1rog9/first_game_with_emre_first_potg/">getting to grips with the other new heroes, such as Emre</a>, and discovering how potent they can be. The question is how long Overwatch can keep this renewed momentum up for.</p>
<p>Not all of the new heroes have gone down well, though. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-responds-to-overwatch-anran-design-controversy">Controversy arose over the weekend around the visual appearance of new fire-wielding hero Anran</a>, whose final, cute in-game look seemed to contradict a more ferocious design used in previously-released animated shorts and comics for the game. Anran's face also appears very similar to a lot of other female characters in the game - an issue the community refers to as "same-face syndrome". Blizzard has said it's discussing her design with the intention of making changes to it.</p>

            <p>Konami has announced its next Silent Hill Transmission broadcast.</p>
<p>As shared by the company, we can all expect to hear more about what's in store for the Silent Hill series tomorrow, 12 February, at 4pm PT. That's actually the early hours of the 13th for those of us here in the UK, with everything kicking off at midnight.</p>

<p>As for what we can expect, the studio has said it will share the "latest news on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>".</p>
<p>Silent Hill: Townfall (my computer keeps trying to autocorrect that to Downfall, which is very annoying) is coming from Screen Burn (née No Code), the Glasgow-based developer of Stories Untold and Observation. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-townfall-is-a-new-entry-to-the-series-from-stories-untold-developer-no-code">first announced back in 2022</a>, though at this time not too much was revealed about the game, other than a mysterious trailer featuring a man talking over a walkie-talkie.</p><p>Soon after this reveal, some started to decode the trailer, and it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-townfalls-announcement-trailer-has-a-secret-message-hidden-inside-it">discovered an SOS signal was tucked between the 'THY FLESH IS WEAK' images</a>. There was also mention of Alessa, who is the little girl seen throughout Silent Hill during the first game and the name should be pretty familiar to anyone who's played the first or third installments, or watched the original Silent Hill movie.</p>
<p>So, will you be watching?</p> <div>

<p>Last year saw the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, which plopped players into the shoes of teenager Hinako. We awarded Silent Hill f four stars on its debut. "Silent Hill f's frustrating first-half is outweighed by a brilliant, delirious second that's well worth the initial slog," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-review">Silent Hill f review</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eidosmontreal.com/">Eidos-Montréal</a> is one of those veteran game studios that constantly appear in the news cycle, but always seem to be tied to some form of drama despite their pedigree. Luckily, Embracer Group has kept it running and working away on a handful of mystery projects, most of which have been scrapped.</p>
<p>Though the current buzz points to the developer now working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rumour-has-it-a-new-alien-game-is-on-the-way-and-its-being-described-as-shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-with-xenomorphs">an ambitious Alien video game</a> with heavy action-adventure elements, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-cancelled-lotr-game-by-eidos-montreal-with-a-telltale-like-story-first-look">this report from MP1st</a> deals with a cancelled Lord of the Rings project which never got too far. Late last year, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/tM8RcRXnHX8?t=2132s">Insider Gaming talked about this</a> already, so it's not the first time we'd heard about it, but that noise didn't take off.</p>
<p>MP1st now claims to have gotten their hands on concept art and early tests done for the game, which apparently didn't advance much before being binned. The project joins <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/legacy-of-kain-reboot-eidos-montreal/">the reported Legacy of Kain reboot</a> as games that haven't moved forward at Eidos-Montréal recently.</p>
<p>The images show painterly and colourful art depicting what's believed to be the Umbar region of Middle-earth, as pointed by recurring file names and some of the 3D screens introducing a better sense of how the game would've been structured, at least in that region. Apparently, the iconic Prancing Pony inn from the books and movies was part of the game as well, as it wouldn't have been restricted to the area south of Gondor and known for its pirates.</p><p>But perhaps the most interesting part of the report is the game would've featured card-based mechanics on top of an isometric view similar to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-rest-for-the-wicked-2024">No Rest for the Wicked</a>'s and a Telltale-like narrative approach. We lack more details, but I think it's safe to say Eidos-Montréal aimed to make a LOTR game that would've felt quite different from what we've gotten before.</p>
<p>The end of the report underlines the studio is now "deep in development" of a major project nicknamed "P11" that's third-person and open-world. Could that be the rumoured Alien title? Place your bets now.</p>
