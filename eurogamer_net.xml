            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s open beta has been the series' biggest beta test ever.</p>
<p>On Steam alone, the shooter has clocked up <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?sort=peak">473,632 concurrent players</a> - that's simultaneous players, not total - making it one of the weekend's most-played games, behind only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a>.</p>
<p>It's also now the twenty-second biggest game on Steam <em>ever</em>, topping the phenomenal clamour for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, which also ran a PC beta which hit a concurrent peak of 463,798 players on Steam back in February.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6, which is set to release on the 10th October, is giving folks a chance to hop in early this weekend and the next. Everyone who requested access to Battlefield 6's Labs tests has been given access to these weekend tests, which - it turns out - is a lot of people. Don't worry if you can't get on this weekend, though; <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1954200952455544937">you can still complete the Weekend 1 challenges next week</a>, too.</p>
<p>If you're still keen to trial the Battlefield 6 beta, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-you-can-still-get-a-battlefield-6-multiplayer-early-access-code">you may be lucky enough to get a code via some avenues that are still open</a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mju6jz/bfcomms_a_quick_note_on_about_queues_and_early/">Just be aware of the queues if you get one</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-multiplayer-takes-a-bold-risky-new-direction">Connor's already spent some quality time with the highly-anticipated shooter, writing</a>: "[Playing Battlefield 6] leaves me in a state of cautious optimism. I think the building blocks for a truly fantastic Battlefield game are here with Battlefield 6 - perhaps even an all-time great - but I need to see a little more, need to play a little more. I need to see where the dice fall, whether the gamble of bold gameplay changes land well - where the hivemind of Battlefield's playerbase find new strategies beyond the this-beats-that approach of old, say - or whether they simply muddy an otherwise potentially brilliant experience."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-battlefields-biggest-open-beta-ever-says-ea]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Looks like Ubisoft may have prematurely posted about the project on its website.</p>

            <p>A TV show based on Ubisoft's Far Cry franchise is allegedly in development at FX.</p>
<p>Confirmation came not via a leak but apparently from Ubisoft itself, which posted about the show on its <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/2YgRby0tgbIWL7K03LKN4t/far-cry-series-adaptation-in-the-works-at-fx">own site</a> before quickly redirecting it back to the main page again, albeit not quite quickly enough to have escaped the notice of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1mlalqt/far_cry_series_adaptation_in_the_works_at_fx/">Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>Those who managed to access the page before it was removed report Rob Mac (Rob McElhenney) (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Mythic Quest, Welcome to Wrexham) and Hawley (Fargo, Alien: Earth) are the Far Cry series' co-creators. Hawley will also reportedly serve as showrunner, while Mac is set to star in the show.</p>

<figcaption>Are The Far Cry Games Connected?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Zlh_eibKpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The series will be executive produced by Mac, Hawley, and Jackie Cohn for More Better Productions, Michael Garcia for 26Keys Productions, Nick Frenkel for 3Arts Entertainment, and Ubisoft's Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, and Austin Dill.</p>
<p>"This collaboration is really an embarrassment of riches," Boykin, who serves as Ubisoft Film &amp; Television head of film and television content. "Far Cry a psychological tailspin that doesn't shy away from the darkest and most absurd parts of humanity, which aligns perfectly with FX's bold and fearless storytelling style."</p>
<p>It's thought the show will be an "anthology drama", where "each season will be set in a new world with a different cast of characters following the video game franchise's signature standalone storytelling format".</p>
<p>For now all we can do is chalk this up to a rumour, but it does fit with Ubisoft's plans to expand its three tentpole franchises, Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry, for which Ubisoft launched a new subsidiary <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-new-business-for-assassins-creed-and-other-big-ips-with-116bn-tencent-investment">back in March after Chinese conglomerate Tencent invested €1.16bn in a minority stake in the new entity</a>.</p>
<p>Ubisoft's announcement followed several reports that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-new-venture-with-ubisoft-assets-report">a new venture was being considered using the company's assets</a>, including claims <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-considering-fresh-business-to-own-assassins-creed-and-other-big-franchises-co-owned-by-others-like-tencent">Ubisoft was mulling over the launch of a fresh business unit part-owned by outside companies</a>, noting such a tactic could potentially result in the new entity being valued higher than Ubisoft itself following years of falling share prices and a string of disappointing game launches.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/a-far-cry-tv-show-that-doesnt-shy-away-from-the-darkest-most-absurd-parts-of-humanity-is-reportedly-in-development-at-fx]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Tencent has quietly removed, edited, and/or replaced key art on the Steam page of its upcoming adventure game, Light of Motiram, just days after Sony filed a copyright lawsuit.</p>
<p>Towards the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-open-world-survival-game-looks-like-a-blatant-horizon-rip-off-with-added-palworld-elements">Tencent's development studio, Polaris Quest, revealed Light of Motiram</a>, a post-apocalyptic open-world survival crafting game featuring mechanised animal-like creatures that bore a remarkable resemblance to those in Guerrilla and PlayStation's Horizon series. </p>
<p>Fast-forward to July, and Sony announced it was suing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">allegedly ripping off PlayStation's Horizon video game franchise</a>, claiming Tencent had asked Sony for permission to license the IP, and pushed on with "slavish clone" Light of Motiram despite Sony's refusal.</p>

<p>While Tencent has not commented publicly on the lawsuit, however, changes recorded on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3319630/history/">SteamDB</a> show Light of Motriam's Steam page has been <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3319630/history/">quietly updated</a>. Not only have a number of screenshots and trailers been removed - including the cover image, which used to feature this <a href="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3319630/c8aeeb396b98aa8aa798c9e4b1ead91363c52f67/header.jpg">Aloy Alike image</a> but has since been updated to <a href="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3319630/18dd0467271a164c976e0ec01ee04976da3ae9d1/header.jpg">this instead</a> - but promotional images on the Steam store have also been swapped out (thanks, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/">The Game Post</a>).</p>
<p>The game's description has similarly been updated, too. It used to read, "In a world overrun by colossal machines, explore the vast open world, build your base of operations, advance technology, train Mechanimals, and take on formidable bosses. Starting from the primitive age, forge a new path of development. Defy the machination, survive with mechanimals."</p>
<p>Check the Steam page today, however, and it now states: "Make smart use of everything around you to stay alive and face off against formidable bosses, every step is fraught with danger and requires courage. Only by overcoming the challenges of survival can you carve out a place for yourself in this unforgiving land."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">Earlier this year, Sony announced an upcoming film adaptation of Guerrilla's games</a> was on the way.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-quietly-updates-slavish-horizon-clone-light-of-motirams-steam-page]]></content:encoded>
