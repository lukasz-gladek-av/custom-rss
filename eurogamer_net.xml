            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/infinity-nikki">Infinity Nikki</a> developer Papergames has ushered in the new year with word on a range of improvements and optimisations it's working on for the dress-up-themed free-to-play gacha hit.
</p>
<p>
According to a <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/news/72">freshly shared post on the Infinity Nikki website</a>, Papergames' plans for the open-world action-adventure have been formulated after gathering "millions of suggestions" from players. A significant chunk of these fall into the "optimisations" bucket, starting with improved game performance on mobile devices - which the developer says it recognises as a "significant challenge that must be addressed".
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, it's hoping to not only improve frame rates but introduce a 60fps mode on mobile, but it says these efforts to "push the performance limits of current mobile devices while using Unreal Engine 5... will require a long-term and continuous optimisation process."
</p>
<p>
"Optimising graphics is one of our top priorities," it adds. "Efforts to boost graphics quality, address lag, and optimise power consumption are ongoing for all devices."

<p>
Broader optimisation work is also promised, with Papergames highlighting improvements to Infinity Nikki's Purification aiming system - including fine-tuning of collision sensitivity - to make it easier to hit enemies at close range and with varying height differences.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, there's talk of precise tracking improvements for the game's mini-map so items tracked using the feature will be easier to locate. Papergames is also working on an overhaul of Infinity Nikki's prologue that'll address overly long processes and unclear tutorials it believes are preventing players from engaging with the world. "We don't want the 'first encounter' to be filled with memories of getting lost, confusion, frustration, and failure," it notes.
</p><p>
Additionally, PC key binding customisation is in the works, as are automatic high-score recommendations for outfits, and improved controls for the Whimcycle on mobile devices. These'll take the form of two new control schemes - a joystick and button combo, plus a single joystick mode - with players able to select their preferred set-up in the options menu. Sticking with the Whimcycle, Papergames has confirmed it's issuing an update so bikes - which will soon be available for use in areas beyond the Breezy Meadow - no longer vanish from beneath riders whenever they connect with water, and will instead respawn players in riding mode. Eurogamer's Lottie Lynn is particularly delighted with that one.
</p>
<p>
And finally, all material refresh times are being fixed to 4am daily. I've been reliably informed this should help make <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinity-nikki-how-to-get-silvergales-aria-outfit-craft-make">acquiring items for the likes of the Silvergale's Aria outfit</a> "slighty easier".
</p>
<p>
As for new features a little futher out, Papergames says a vertical photo mode is coming in "future versions", as is Esseling tracking, plus group photos and interactive poses with Momo. "We are committed to delivering more meaningful improvements," the studio concludes. "Let's light up the new year together with Infinity Nikki!"
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Jessica Orr had good things to say about Infinity Nikki in her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinity-nikki-review">four star review</a> last year, calling it a "true step forward for open-world gacha games" that "finally brings some much needed competition to the miHoYo monopoly."

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> today receives its fourth major update as early access continues, bringing a new bridge-building mechanic, bug fixes, and some experimental changes.</p>
<p>The bridge-building utilises the same road-building tool and arrives alongside two new maps, one of which includes a huge river, making bridges a necessity. Another watery addition is a stone well upgrade with increased water supply, while taverns can also be upgraded to level two.</p>
<p>Another new feature is an additional Overstock setting, which allows users to control the amount of extra goods placed in stalls or the tavern to exceed what's currently needed.</p>

<p>These additions come alongside a huge number of bug fixes, crashfixes, performance boosts, and more.</p>
<p>There are some experimental changes too, including a rework of cliffs to ensure they're less ambiguous (plus fixed pathfinding errors); changes to building costs to encourage more diverse resource use; amending food consumption to consume all types equally; and changing region strength selection so regions are picked from a finite pool to ensure necessary resources are available.</p>
<p>The full patch notes for this update, 0.8.024, can be found on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1363080/view/534338967351329253">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Manor Lords is available now on PC across Steam, GOG, Epic, Microsoft, and on PC Game Pass.</p>
<p>There's no date yet for its 1.0 release, though updates such as this prove developer Slavic Magic is hard at work.</p>
<p>"There's a confidence to Manor Lords that belies its one-person development, and what's there can be spellbinding, but it's a pastoral idyll that still needs significant development," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/manor-lords-early-access-review-beautiful-foundations-but-missing-important-pieces">Manor Lords early access review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>House of the Dead 2: Remake will rise from the grave in spring/Q2 2025.</p>
<p>Coming to Nintendo Switch, PC via Steam and GOG, Xbox, and PlayStation, the remake features remastered music - although the classic soundtrack is also available - as well as modernised graphics, "faithful to the original" gameplay, multiple endings and branching levels, plus co-op.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, House of Dead 2 is, funnily enough, the sequel to Sega's prolific 90s rail-shooter zombie series. In this instalment, you take on the lone role of secret agent James - either alone or in co-op mode alongside fellow agent Gary - with one single mission: to neutralise the dangerous denizens standing in your way.</p>
<p>As well as the features listed above, there will also be a boss mode in which you'll have to speedrun killing all of the game's bosses, and a training mode is available to help you hone your skills.</p>
<p>This is the second of Sega's zombie games to get the remake treatment. However, as Matt summarised for us this time last year, reception to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/house-of-the-dead-remake-heading-to-playstation-5-this-week">first House of the Dead: Remake's reception was pretty mixed</a>. With complaints highlighting control scheme issues and performance on last-gen consoles, so it'll be interesting to see how the second remake will be received.</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/house-of-the-dead-film-in-the-works-from-resident-evil-monster-hunter-director">Sega's The House of the Dead is also set for the big screen, with Paul WS Anderson</a> on board to write and direct.</p>
<p>Anderson will also serve as a producer, alongside his partner Jeremy Bolt. The duo have also worked on adaptations for the likes of Mortal Kombat (1995) and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> (2020), as well as multiple Resident Evil films.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
