            <p>Creepy archive-searching deduction game TR-49 has had the best launch of any of Inkle's many games, the studio revealed today, meaning it sold better than games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heavens-vault-review-a-rich-web-of-possibility">Heaven's Vault</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/a-highland-song">A Highland Song</a>, which took longer and far more resources to make.</p>
<p>"TR-49 is our best launch, ever, in 14 years," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jon.inkle.co/post/3mcyz4wpwtk2r">Jon Ingold, the creator of TR-49 and co-founder of Inkle, wrote</a>. "I admit I'm surprised!</p>
<p>TR-49 was made quickly, in nine months, he said, mostly as an experiment to learn open-source game-making engine Godot. It was also "an excuse to play with some actors", he added, highlighting the game's performative side that Inkle's text-based games usually feature only lightly. TR-49 is partly an audio drama.</p>
<p>"One thing I think IS cool," Ingold continued: "it's a 'one-sitting' game. 4 hours; $7. No commitment required." And one huge upside of that is "people SEE THE END!", Ingold wrote. "This is huge for me, personally."</p>
<p>It's a success that may affect the studio's future output, though it's worth pointing out that Inkle has done short games before. Overboard! and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/expelled-an-overboard-game-review">Expelled!</a> are both short, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-highland-song-review">A Highland Song</a> isn't what I'd call long. Nevertherless, I'm sure Inkle is considering using this one-sitting approach again.</p>
<p>"If we're going to make that a sustainable model we might need to be able to make things a little bit quicker, but I love the basic concept of 'compact games'," Ingold said.</p>
<p>TR-49 is a game about searching an archive in a strange machine, looking for things that don't exist in the outside world any more. It's a code-related deduction game, really, as you search around looking for clues for codes that will reveal hidden secrets within. It's really good. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tr-49-review">I gave TR-49 four stars in my Eurogamer review</a>.</p>

            <p>Arknights: Endfield, a new gacha action game released today, has temporarily halted PayPal transactions after multiple players were charged real money for in-game purchases they didn't make.</p>
<p>Some users quickly took to online community hubs like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Endfield/">the Arknight Endfield Reddit</a> show payments made on their PayPal accounts which they didn't authorise. Some screenshots include payments made in various global currencies, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Endfield/comments/1qjijsy/random_paypal_account_linked_to_my_account_i_just/">with some claiming that other player's Paypals were being registered to their fresh account</a>. The exact cause of this bug has not been confirmed as of writing by the developer Hyperglyph.</p>
<p>One user, Impossible Clover 818, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Endfield/comments/1qjs62z/did_anyone_get_refunded_for_the_paypal_nonsense/">created a post</a> on the Endfield Reddit titled: 'Did anyone get refunded for the PayPal nonsense yet? My whole balance got wiped'. They claim that £1,200 was "wiped" from their Paypal account, and less than an hour ago <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Endfield/comments/1qjs62z/comment/o11d2pt/?context=3">had been prompted to provide real-world identification</a> to access the account, due to 'suspicious activity'.</p>

<p>In a statement made <a href="https://x.com/AKEndfield/status/2014188503891099888">on the official Arknights Endfield social media account</a>, a statement explains that Hyperglyph is aware of the problem, and that it affects "a small number of purchases" made via PayPal, and that was an "inconsistency between the order and item delivery". It then asks impacted players to contact the company via email, and to provide their account server and ID for a refund.</p>
<p>The statement goes on to assert that all refunds are expected to be resolved "within four hours". Given it was posted 15-minutes ago as of writing, this should hopefully be resolved in short order.</p>
<p>When contacted for comment prior to this social media post, a representative of Hyperglyph provided the following to Eurogamer:</p>
<blockquote><p>We want to sincerely apologize to everyone affected by the PayPal payment issue that occurred shortly after launch. We understand how upsetting and concerning this kind of situation can be, especially when it involves purchases and personal payment details.</p>
<p>Here's what we want to clearly share with you:</p>
<ul>
<li>All affected PayPal purchases will be fully refunded. We've already begun processing refunds for impacted orders.</li>
<li>We do not store players' payment information. Payment details are handled directly by PayPal and are not saved in our systems.</li>
<li>This issue only affected some players on certain platforms when using PayPal. As soon as we became aware of the problem, we disabled PayPal payments within roughly two hours of launch to prevent any further impact.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the moment, PayPal payments will remain unavailable while we continue to investigate the root cause together with our partners. We won't re-enable the payment option until we're confident the issue has been fully resolved.</p>
<p>We're truly sorry for the stress and inconvenience this caused, and we're grateful for your patience while we work through this carefully. If you have additional questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly.</p></blockquote>
