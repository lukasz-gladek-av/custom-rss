Today brought our first look at gameplay footage from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>, courtesy of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-todays-pokemon-presents-broadcast-here">the Pokémon Presents presentation</a> - as well as a narrowed release window for the Switch 1 game.
</p>
<p>
Pokémon Legends Z-A will arrive in "late 2025", it was revealed - a little later than some were expecting. No mention at all was made of Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Pokémon Legends Z-A is scheduled to release in late 2025," said Takato Utsunomiya, chief operating officer of The Pokémon Company. "We hope everybody can wait just a little longer for their adventures in Lumiose City to begin."

<p>As we knew already, Pokémon Legends Z-A was shown to be an action RPG spin-off from the series' main games set in the Parisian-inspired metropolis of Lumiose City. The action looks set to take place entirely within the city limits, though there suburban wild areas with roaming Pokémon.</p>
<p>Today's trailer was devoid of any new Pokémon species or Mega Evolutions, though it did at least confirm the three Starter Pokémon you'll use in the game: Gold and Silver's Grass-type Chikorita and Water-type croc Totodile, plus Black and White's fire hog Tepig. 
</p>
<p>Presumably the evolved versions of all three will get to Mega Evolve - though we didn't see that today.</p>
<p>Also on show was a new battle system, where it looks like you can lead your monster around the battlefield, and where attacks will differ in power based on their range.</p>
<p>More to follow.</p></div>

Obsidian role-playing game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> now has an official mushroom kit, which you can use to grow a crop of colourful fungus at home similar to the infestation that covers your hero's face.
</p>
<p>
Not convinced? How about if we told you this creeping mass of plague-like fungi was designed to be enjoyed as a snack? Just peel the mushrooms from the Avowed-branded box, and pop one in your mouth. Delicious.
</p>
<p>
This official kit comes from mushroom mail order service North Spore, which sadly does not seem to ship to the UK. Maybe that's for the best.

US residents keen to grown their own plague (actually, perfectly edible oyster mushrooms of various colours) can order an Avowed kit online for <a href="https://northspore.com/products/organic-spray-grow-avowed-grow-kit">$30 plus shipping</a>. Each kit comes with a random colour selection included, which only reveals itself when the spores bloom.

Optionally, you can also download 3D printing details for a bear ornament to grow your mushrooms on, similar to the infected hulking enemies found within the game. Yummy.

<p>
Avowed looks to have done well enough for Obsidian, which has now hinted at more to come from its plague-ridden role-playing game. The game's director, Carrie Patel, was recently asked whether her next project would be something new - but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-director-hints-at-a-future-for-the-franchise">said it was likely she'd be back for more Avowed</a> - be that more content for the first game, or sequels.
</p>
<p>
"What Avowed lacks in gloss it makes up for with charm, depth and a playful heart," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Eurogamer's Avowed review</a>. "It's one of this year's most pleasant surprises."
