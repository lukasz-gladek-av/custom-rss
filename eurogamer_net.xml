            <p>Krafton has patched out a bug in its early access release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">InZoi</a>, which allowed players to run over children with a car and kill them.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/inZOI/comments/1jldd0w/i_dont_think_that_krafton_realizes_that_you_can/">post on the InZoi subreddit</a> titled "I don't think that Krafton realises that you can run over children in inZOI" had started making the rounds. Attached to this post is a clip from the game, showing a player hitting a child with the front of their car.</p>
<p>Once the car has hit the child, this child is then launched ragdolling across the ground in front of them, with the impact ultimately killing them.</p>
<p>While the developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-like-inzoi-has-16-different-types-of-deaths-so-watch-out-for-slippery-bathroom-floors">previously confirmed characters in InZoi could die from getting hit by a car</a>, with game director Hyungjun 'Kjun' Kim warning players they "might want to be careful" near the road, it was never said that children would also be subjected to this death.</p>
<p>Krafton has now addressed this bug. In a statement shared with Eurogamer, the Krafton spokesperson said:</p>
<p>"This issue was caused by an unintended bug that has been resolved in the latest patch. These depictions are highly inappropriate and do not reflect the intent and values of inZOI. We understand the seriousness of this matter and age-appropriate content and we are strengthening our internal review processes to prevent similar incidents in the future."</p>

<p>Our Matt has been playing InZoi, and while he appreciated its "expansive customisation" and "richly detailed worlds", he was a touch disappointed with Krafton's life-sim game.</p>
<p>"The trouble is, it's all so <em>soulless </em>– its flashiness failing to mask a lack of personality. Where The Sims feels tuned for maximum chaos and carnage (sometimes exhaustingly so), InZoi barely mustered a single memorable event in the six hours I played. I milled about its empty streets, trudged around its handful of notable landmarks, sang a song in a park, and unsuccessfully tried to strike up a friendship with strangers before returning home," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-25-years-of-the-sims-could-inzoi-be-about-to-steal-its-crown">Eurogamer's InZoi impressions feature</a>.</p>
<p>"By the time I'd tired of redecorating and had clicked on everything in my apartment at least twice, I was genuinely wondering how I was going to fill the rest of my virtual day as InZoi's clock – glacially slow even on its fastest setting - ticked on by."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> publisher Bandai Namco has released some player statistics from the game's network test last month, and it seems players were struggling to finish it.</p>
<p>The online co-op game takes place over three in-game days, defeating bosses each night to progress the next. However, the final boss of the cycle - Nightlord Gladius, Beast of Night - was only defeated 58,615 times.</p>
<p>The publisher hasn't released total player numbers, but looking at the <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-infographic">remaining stats</a> we can get an idea of how popular the test was.</p>

<p>For instance, a total of 23,627,489 attacks were used to save downed players. Considering it takes around three hits to revive a player in this way (sometimes more), that's about 7.9m revives.</p>
<p>Further, the mini bosses strewn across the world were defeated from between 99,000 times to 195,000 times, depending on how often they appeared over the day cycle.</p>
<p>Lastly, 37,957,453,867 runes were lost during the test, when not retrieved after death. That's a lot of death - and a lot of heartache.</p>
<p>In all, it seems players were struggling to get to grips with Nightreign. The shift to online co-op and a faster pace may have proven a challenge for players, whether through poor explanation from FromSoftware or just not enough time to master the game during the test.</p>
<p>And that's when players even managed to get on - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-first-network-test-suffers-server-issues-due-to-congestion">first of several tests over that weekend was a disaster</a>, with players completely unable to log into a match. This was resolved for the remainder of the weekend.</p>
<p>Of course, FromSoftware's games are known for being difficult. In particular, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> caused much debate with its difficulty level. Just give it time and somebody will be finishing Nightreign with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-beaten-with-an-actual-banana">banana controller</a>.</p>
<p>Personally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">I had a great time playing Nightreign</a> and enjoyed its new style of challenge, as well as working with others - though I had a decent chunk of time with it during the preview.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-announced-by-fromsoftware">Elden Ring: Nightreign is set for release on 30th May 2025</a> across PS4, PS5, Xbox consoles, and PC (Steam).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
