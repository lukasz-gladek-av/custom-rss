            <p>Supertrick Games, the developer of Let it Die sequel Inferno, which launches today, has issued a statement on the game's AI use following controversy from earlier in the week.</p>
<p>The controversy surrounded <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/made-with-ai-let-it-die-sequel-inferno-discloses-substantial-generative-ai-use">Let it Die: Inferno's AI disclosure on Steam</a>, which suggested substantial use of generative AI during development, across art, music, and voice, but it did not specify in detail exactly how AI had been used. The statement issued in response to the reaction provides that detail, and in general, the game's AI use seems less than suspected.</p>
<p>For example, the game does use generative AI to create the voices of two characters, but these characters are an AI-driven machine and a "mysterious life form", so the AI-generated voices were a deliberate, creative choice to fit the character, rather than a cost-cutting exercise.</p>

<p>"These specific cases use AI-generated voices intentionally to match the nature of the characters," the statement read. "These voices are not derived from or modeled after any human performers, ensuring no copyright concerns." Otherwise, "All in-game characters are voiced by human performers."</p><p>AI-generated art was used, meanwhile, "to generate rough base images" for background posters, InfoCast (news) insert images and in-game reading material, which the team's artists then "painted over, refined, and adjusted by hand". The AI tool also apparently helped the team observe copyright laws, although there's no explanatory detail on how.</p>
<p>Finally with regards to music, AI was used to begin the creation process for music you'll hear in the background in Iron Perch. Specifically, and I don't really understand this, so excuse my lack of sound creation technicalities, AI was used to generate stems, which I believe are collections of audio tracks, or mixes. "Once all stems were exported," the statement read, "few were manually edited, but most were rebuilt from scratch."</p>
<p>And that's it.</p>
<p>Let it Die: Inferno is the sequel to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-it-die-is-grasshoppers-refreshingly-different-return-to-form">eccentric and asymmetrical multiplayer game Let it Die</a>, by Suda51's studio Grasshopper - Supertrick was a co-creator. This new game ditches the asymmetrical multiplayer idea for direct, real-time multiplayer, in an on-trend PvEvP framework. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2576150/LET_IT_DIE_INFERNO/#app_reviews_hash">Initial reviews on Steam don't seem to be positive</a>, however, with a Mixed overall response.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a> has been banned in Russia, accused of distributing LGBTQ+ propaganda and terrorism-related extremist materials.</p>
<p>Roskomnadzor, the Russian watchdog for communications and censorship, described Roblox as "rife with inappropriate content that can negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children". It also flagged reports of sexual harassment of children.</p>
<p>"We respect the local laws and regulations in the countries where we operate," a Roblox spokesperson told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-blocks-access-us-childrens-gaming-platform-roblox-2025-12-03/">Reuters</a>, "and believe Roblox provides a positive space for learning, creation and meaningful connection for everyone."</p>
<p>The spokesperson added Roblox has "a deep commitment to safety and we have a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent harmful content on our platform."</p>
<p>Roskomnadzor has a track record of restricting access to Western media and tech it deems to be in breach of Russian laws, from Duolingo to WhatsApp and Telegram. Last week, the watchdog <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-threatens-full-ban-whatsapp-tass-reports-2025-11-28/">threatened to block WhatsApp entirely</a>.</p>
<p>Russia has of course long had anti-LGBT laws in place, in 2013 banning the "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships" to minors.</p>
<p>Yet Roblox also has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-accused-of-being-unsafe-environment-for-children">criticised for its questionable safety measures</a>, with a report last year claiming the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">platform had reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation</a>. This year, Roblox has been steadily improving its safety standards, most recently <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/roblox-requires-age-checks-limits-minor-and-adult-chat">requiring age checks for all those wishing to communicate through the platform</a>.</p>
<p>Still, Russia isn't the first country to ban Roblox. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-responds-to-platform-ban-in-turkiye">Türkiye also banned access to the platform last year</a> to "ensure the protection of our children".</p>
<p>"We've spent almost 20 years making Roblox one of the safest online platforms for our users, particularly the youngest, and ensuring the safety of our users is at the core of everything we do," said a Roblox spokesperson to Eurogamer at the time.</p>
<p>Most recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-boss-says-problem-of-predators-is-an-opportunity-for-the-platform-in-disastrous-interview-following-latest-child-safety-measures">Roblox boss David Baszucki appeared on the New York Times podcast Hard Fork to discuss safety measures</a>, but he described the problem of predators on the platform as an "opportunity", in what amounted to a disastrous interview.</p>

            <p>Dispatch studio AdHoc knew it was taking a risk releasing the game in weekly episodic installments, and was actually advised not to do it. However, the studio did it anyway, and the risk paid off.</p>
<p>AdHoc itself has been around for seven years, with its superhero workplace comedy being in full production for three of those. Dispatch is the studio's first game, so it was understandably a big deal when its first episodes were released back in October of this year.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>"Seven years, <em>one </em>game," AdHoc's CEO and executive producer Michael Choung reflected in a recent interview with <a href="https://newsletter.smartbrief.com/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=788256D6-9F75-4793-8D5F-28F96B1C91A8&amp;sid=7C18806E-AF5A-4F78-A29B-F02783429FF1">Knowledge</a>, before adding: "But what's inside that game is basically three feature-length premium animated films and a videogame, all meshing and rubbing up against each other."</p>
<p>The studio exec noted the team decided it wanted to go with a completely original narrative driven episodic format, and was not simply about making life easy for them. "And part of it was because we weren't really thinking about feasibility," Choung said. "We were just thinking in terms of creative and player experience."</p>
<p>But, while this approach worked for AdHoc and Dispatch, Choung admitted releasing the game in one go would have been "the conventional wisdom".</p>
<p>"Everyone was telling us not to do it," Choung said of the game's episodic format. "We had internal debates about it but the story was always structured that way." So while other release cadences were floated - such as bringing the game out in two halves or even one episode per week - the studio eventually settled on two episodes, once a week.</p><p>"A lot of the reasons for it we're now seeing the results of," Choung furthered. "There would just be a longer time period for it to be covered." The developer remarked that we have been seeing this kind of release schedule with TV series for decades now.</p>
<p>"We knew that it gives a 'the train is leaving the station, but not just yet - I can still make it' kind of feeling across weeks, and people catch on. When we look at concurrent user numbers across the drops, it's exactly that - it just kept doubling every week. Again, conventional wisdom says: whatever you guys do in the first week, the second week is going to be half that number. It was literally the opposite. Those things, we anticipated.</p>
<p>"I don't think we anticipated the scale of it."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>But while Dispatch has seen immense success with its release schedule, Choung admits this is not something every studio should now attempt, especially if there isn't the creative backbone to support it. "It's insane to do," he said. "From every metric, from a production perspective, no one should do this. If you think episodic alone is going to be the thing that dictates success for you, then good luck!"</p><p>The exec continued: "If the creative is strong, you can cut it up however you like, and it probably is going to make it through, even if it's a poor decision. If we'd said, 'We're just going to release the whole thing', it probably would have done ok. But it probably wouldn't have been as big as this… If you go episodic with a not-so-great story, you're flirting with people that aren't attracted to you whatsoever."</p>
<p>But while Choung cautioned releasing a game with an episodic format, he said if others did try, AdHoc would of course "be thrilled if it worked out".</p>

<p>Earlier this year, AdHoc announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">Dispatch had sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a>. Thanks to this success, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-dispatch-getting-a-second-season-well-thats-something-the-developer-is-definitely-going-to-think-about">the studio is now considering a second season</a> (perhaps one with more sex scenes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">given the "ravenous" response to the first season</a>).</p><p>Meanwhile last month, AdHoc said it has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/maybe-ai-is-a-creative-solution-if-you-arent-a-creative-person-dispatch-devs-take-a-firm-refreshing-stance-against-ai">no interest in using AI to replace voice actors or game development</a>. "AI feels like a production solution, not a creative one," creative director Nick Herman said, before adding: "Maybe it's a creative one if you <em>aren't </em>creative."</p>

Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser has recently being doing the rounds to chat about to his company Absurd Ventures, and his latest tidbit from his time at the Grand Theft Auto studio is the surprisingly revelation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> perhaps owes as much to Victorian literature as it does cowboy films.
</p>
<p>
"I binged on Victorian novels for that," he explains in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/dec/03/i-binged-on-victorian-novels-dan-houser-on-dickens-red-dead-redemption-and-redefining-open-world-games">new interview with the Guardian</a>. "I listened to the audiobook of [George Elliot's] Middlemarch walking to and from the office every day. I loved it."
</p>
<p>
As to why Houser turned to this perhaps unexpected source of inspiration, he explained, "I wanted [Red Dead Redemption 2] to feel from the writing perspective, slightly more novelistic. I thought that was a way of doing something new on the story side – and the game was going to look so pretty, the art was so strong, I thought the story had better really set it up."

It was his search for the right tone that ultimately led him not just to Middlemarch, but other Victorian fiction, including Sherlock Holmes. And as he noted elsewhere, big 19th-century novels perhaps have more in common with open-world games than is immediately obvious, bringing a "sense of slightly spread out storytelling" that's paralleled in the likes of GTA.
</p><p>
Houser, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-is-leaving-the-company-in-march">departed Rockstar Games in 2020</a>, formally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-returns-with-new-media-company-absurd-ventures">unveiled his new media company Absurd Ventures</a> in 2023. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-housers-new-studio-reveals-graphic-novel-and-audio-drama">currently working on A Better Paradise</a>, charting the "ill-fated development of an ambitious but addictive video game project that goes very wrong", which so far spans a novel and podcast series, with a TV series and game on the way.
</p>
<p>
It's also developing a new crime fiction universe, American Caper, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/meet-absurdaverse-gta-5-writer-dan-housers-next-big-project">Absurdaverse</a>, a "story-driven action-comedy adventure game".
