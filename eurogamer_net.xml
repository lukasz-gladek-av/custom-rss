Nintendo's wading into the baby and toddler market with a new toy, clothing, and "general goods" range it's pulling together under the My Mario banner. And there's even a toddler-friendly stop motion Mario series releasing to accompany the whole thing.
</p>
<p>
My Mario is described as a "series which parents and children can enjoy together", and includes a mix of Nintendo's own products alongside those of partner companies. That starts with Nintendo's new animated Mario series - titled It's Me, Mario! Stop Motion Shorts - which will exist on the My Mario website and other channels. Each free episode is around a minute long and focuses on stop motion Mario showing "a variety of expressions and movements".

Elsewhere in the digital realm is Nintendo's free Hello, Mario! app for smart devices and Switch. This'll let children muck around with Mario's face in a way that sounds quite a lot like Mario 64's iconic title screen - yank him and he'll "react in various ways based on the player's input, allowing parents and young children to play together and enjoy each reaction they see."
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, My Mario's website <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/my-mario/block/index.html">features a dizzying array of baby and toddler-appropriate paraphernalia</a>, including bowls and spoons, cute Mario-themed hoodies, t-shirts, picture books, bibs, pyjamas, blankets, plushies, nappy bags, socks, rattles, and other bits and bobs.

Nintendo's own biggie, though, is a series of wooden block sets, one with three pieces and the other with 30. The bigger set costs 19,980 yen (around £100) and comes with a variety of classic Mushroom Kingdom cuboids, including the question mark block, the brick block, and the music note block. It also includes wooden power-ups - a super mushroom, green shell, fire flower, and super star - plus a chunky green warp pipe, with the box itself opening out to reveal a mini diorama scene. And finally, there are wooden versions of Mario, Peach, Luigi, and Yoshi which, most notably, also double up as their respective amiibo figures for use in compatible games. So if you're still in the grip of amiibo collecting, you've now got something else to add to your list. That three block set, incidentally, costs 2,980 yen (around £15) and comes with Mario, a question mark block, and super mushroom.

All the above is included in Nintendo's first wave of My Mario products, which arrives in Japan on 26th August. My Mario will launch elsewhere in the world beginning in 2026.
