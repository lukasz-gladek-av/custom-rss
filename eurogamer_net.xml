            <p>The latest <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> patch has come with a handful of fixes for the sci-fi FPS, including substantial adjustments to various camo challenges proving troublesome for the cosmetically-minded player base. This includes a few weapon camos in Zombies, which were three-times-harder to unlock than intended.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-preseason-patch-notes">As explained on the official patch notes</a>, these troublemakers were some<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-ops-7-zombies-camo-challenges"> Zombie camos</a>, though the specific weapons / camos aren't listed. There were other cosmetics made easier to collect across different modes. Zombies mutilate challenges were bugged too, which has now been fixed.</p>
<p>The XR-3 ION had its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-ops-7-multiplayer-camo-challenges">multiplayer camo</a> requirements shifted to headshots rather than one-shot-kills, as the burst fire was making things a little hard. So all in all, if you're in the midst of the intense camo grind in Black Ops 7, some of its rougher edges have been smoothed out.</p>

<p>Crashing issues across all game modes have been addressed, which should hopefully improve overall stability. Especially given the amount of losable progress during endgame campaign runs, crashes have proven exceptionally frustrating to a slice of the playerbase in recent days.</p><p>In fact, one bug that would force boot some players from Endgame campaign matches if certain extraction conditions were met has also been fixed, another much-needed addition to the patch which will improve what is currently one of Black Ops 7's most daunting grinds.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has proven to be a lot of fun among those engulfed in its fast-paced action, but how popular it is remains a bit of a mystery. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-underperforms-on-steam-during-launch-weekend-but-does-that-mean-the-games-sold-badly">It seems to have underperformed compared to prior games, but accurate stats are hard to find</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-the-wake-of-battlefield-6-and-arc-radiers-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-suffered-a-much-smaller-launch-than-previous-cod-games">Activision has stated its pleasure at the game's reception in a public statement, hoping to reassure fans</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about Black Ops 7, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Eurogamer's review</a> covers the whole package. In it, reviewer Jeremy Peel remarks: "A shift away from single-player leaves Call of Duty with its most lopsided and homogenous entry in decades, though what it does offer is consistently good fun when accepted on its own terms."</p>

            <p>The brilliant Dispatch has reached another well deserved milestone.</p>
<p>The episodic superhero workplace comedy has now managed to move 2m copies. While developer AdHoc has <em>technically</em> celebrated the number of "players", the game is not available on any subscription service, so I would say this number also equates to sales.</p>

<p>Sharing the figure on social media, the studio wrote: "We're also sad there are no new episodes this week, but thank you to the two million players that have joined us so far.</p>
<p>"Wouldn't be here without you."</p>
<p>The team accompanied the post with an image of Robert's chonky dog, Beef, which you can see below. He is such a good boy (I have many Beef screenshots saved on my PlayStation). </p>
<p>Needless to say, I <em>loved </em>my time with Dispatch, so I am thrilled to see the game having such success. I am going to replay the last couple of chapters, though, because there is one bit of my ending I am not too happy about… but I won't spoil anything here (Bertie and Connor have been getting an earful, though).</p>

<p>Earlier this year, AdHoc announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">Dispatch had sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a>. Thanks to this success, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-dispatch-getting-a-second-season-well-thats-something-the-developer-is-definitely-going-to-think-about">the studio is now considering a second season</a> (perhaps one with more sex scenes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">given the "ravenous" response to the first season</a>).</p><p>Meanwhile just this week, AdHoc said it has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/maybe-ai-is-a-creative-solution-if-you-arent-a-creative-person-dispatch-devs-take-a-firm-refreshing-stance-against-ai">no interest in using AI to replace voice actors or game development</a>. "AI feels like a production solution, not a creative one," creative director Nick Herman said, before adding: "Maybe it's a creative one if you <em>aren't </em>creative."</p>

            <p>Just Cause developer Avalanche has closed its Liverpool studio, following the cancellation of Xbox exclusive Contraband earlier this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-developer-avalanche-studios-closing-uk-studio-in-workforce-restructure-following-cancellation-of-xbox-exclusive-contraband">Avalanche announced it had initiated "a collective consultation process"</a> back in September. It has now moved forward and closed its Liverpool studio, laying off 31 members of staff in the process.</p>

<p>The developer shared an update on its <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/updateliverpool">website</a> last night. "The exceptional talent, passion, and commitment from everyone leaving have impacted every project," reads the message from Avalanche.</p>
<p>"We are truly grateful for the dedication and invaluable contributions to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/avalanche-studios">Avalanche Studios</a> Group. Our focus remains on supporting the Avelanchers through this transition and to carry on making great games for our player communities."</p>
<p>Contraband - a 1970s co-op open world caper set in the fictional Southeast Asian world of Bayan- <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-developer-avalanche-announces-contraband">was first revealed in June 2021</a>, during the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase. "With Contraband, we're taking everything we've learned from 18 years of being in the forefront of open world games as well as bringing the knowledge from running successful live game services focusing on our player communities," Avalanche said at the time.</p>

<p>Contraband was subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-exclusive-contraband-reportedly-cancelled-as-avalanche-states-its-active-development-has-now-stopped">cancelled by Microsoft back in August</a> of this year, with the studio writing in a statement: "Active development has now stopped while we evaluate the project's future." The game's cancellation followed on from a string of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">other game and staff cuts across Microsoft's collection of worldwide studios in June</a>. </p>
<p>After these cuts, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-is-thriving-claims-ceo-doubling-down-on-ai-after-9000-employees-lost-jobs-in-latest-layoffs">Microsoft's CEO stated that "Microsoft is thriving"</a> as the company emphasised its focus on AI.</p>
