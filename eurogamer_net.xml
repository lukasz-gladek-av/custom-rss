            <p>The creator of viral Roblox game Steal A Brainrot is suing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> doppelg√§nger for allegedly copying its "artwork, objects, design, and game elements".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/937410050/Brainrot-Goes-To-Court">lawsuit</a> filed in California last week and reported by <a href="https://aftermath.site/brainrot-roblox-court">Aftermath</a>, Steal a Brainrot developer Spyder Games is accusing Fortnite's Stealing Brainrots of infringing its copyright after securing the rights to its creation in August.</p>
<p>In its legal paperwork, Spyder claims that since its launch in May 2025, Steal a Brainrot has been played almost six billion times, had a concurrent peak of 20 million players, and is "consistently one of the top three games on Roblox by player count", whereas Stealing Brainrots, created by Thomas Van Der Voort, wasn't uploaded to Fortnite Creative until July 2025.</p>

<p>Spyder is calling on the court "to stop defendant's unlawful conduct" and "recover the losses [it has] suffered and will continue to suffer, including any profits defendant has gained from this unlawful infringement".</p>
<p>Spyder is seeking a jury trial, actual damages, punitive damages, attorney fees, and a permanent injunction restraining the Van Der Voort from violating its rights under copyright law.</p>
<p>"The similarities are not merely the result of the games existing in the same genre or dictated by function," the lawsuit adds. "Defendant made conscious decisions to copy the creative choices and unique designs that were implemented in the game. The similarities between the game and the infringing game are not coincidental. They are the result of willful infringement by defendant in an effort to steal the market for plaintiff's game."</p>
<p>Steal The Brainrot, another Steal A Brainrot clone also available on Epic's platform, is officially licensed and therefore does not form part of this lawsuit.</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-creators-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items-to-make-more-money-but-are-creative-mode-offerings-like-steal-a-brainrot-what-players-want">Epic will soon allow Fortnite developers to sell in-game items from their Fortnite islands</a>, allowing creators to make more money. For one year from December 2025, developers will earn 100 percent of the V-Bucks value from sales - usually this is at 50 percent.</p>
<p>The news comes as Fortnite's Creative Mode of fan-made content is proving exceptionally popular, with the Fortnite version of Roblox meme game Steal A Brainrot clocking up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1mtklb7/oh_wow/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">more concurrent players</a> than Epic's official maps.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> publisher Krafton has declared itself an "AI-first company", announcing a move to "place AI at the centre of problem solving" via a "complete" company reorganisation.</p>
<p>The megacorp outlined its "transition to an AI-first company" in a Korean-language <a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-ai-first-%ea%b8%b0%ec%97%85-%ec%a0%84%ed%99%98-%ec%84%a0%ec%96%b8-1000%ec%96%b5-%ec%9b%90-%ec%9d%b4%ec%83%81-%ed%88%ac%ec%9e%90/">statement</a> posted to the official website that detailed the goals of its new strategy to "prioritise AI as a central and primary means of problem-solving", "fostering change in individuals and organisations, increasing company-wide productivity, and accelerating mid- to long-term corporate value growth".</p>
<p>"Starting today, Krafton will automate work centered on Agentic AI and fully implement an AI-centered management system where members focus on creative activities and complex problem solving," said Krafton CEO Kim Chang-han, as translated by machine. "We will leap forward as a company that promotes the growth of members and expands the organisation's areas of challenge through AI."</p>
<p>As part of this commitment, Krafton's earmarked around $69.7 million (100 billion Korean won / ¬£52.3 million) to invest in a GPU cluster, and support the multi-stage tasks required for "sophisticated reasoning and iterative planning". This, Krafton believes, will serve as a foundation for accelerating its AI tech, which it hopes to complete and have up and running in the second half of 2026.</p>
<p>Another $20.8 million (30 million Korean won / ¬£15.5m) will also be invested in its workforce to train its staff to use AI tools.</p>
<p>It'll be through this new infrastructure that Krafton believes it will strengthen AI R&amp;D and in-game AI services.</p>
<p>Krafton's position is not an outlier in the industry. Back in 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-intends-to-be-aggressive-in-applying-ai-says-ceo">Square Enix CEO Takashi Kiryu stated the company would be "aggressive in applying AI"</a>, with developers admitting they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-dabbled-with-ai-technology-for-foamstars">"dabbled" with AI</a> for the ill-fated shooter Foamstars, Professor Layton studio <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/20231213-24326/">Level-5</a> has used AI tool Stable Diffusion, and even <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/capcom-is-experimenting-with-generative-ai-to-help-generate-the-hundreds-of-thousands-of-ideas-needed-for-game-development/">Capcom</a> has admitted experimenting with generative AI too. <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/991/G999104/20250808042/">Sega</a> also has an in-house AI team.</p>
<p>In fact, a recent survey conducted by the Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association (CESA), the organiser of Tokyo Game Show, showed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI in their development</a>.</p>
