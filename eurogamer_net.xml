<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> arrives this June, but there'll be an opportunity to check out its sandy survival action ahead of its full launch. Developer Funcom has announced it's holding the game's "largest beta yet" in May, with keys being made available to "tens of thousands" of players.
</p>
<p>
Funcom <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/funcoms-open-world-survival-mmo-dune-awakening-gets-first-trailer">unveiled Dune: Awakening in 2022</a>, as part of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/conan-exiles-developer-funcom-lands-deal-to-make-dune-games">deal to make "at least" three games</a> set in the Dune universe. It whisks players to Arrakis for an open-world, multiplayer survival adventure drawing from Frank Herbert's sci-fi novels and Denis Villeneuve's film adaptations.
</p>
<p>
Dune Awakening has been in closed beta for over a year now, but with its full release now looming following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-delayed-for-last-minute-changes-from-beta-testers">brief delay</a>, Funcom is preparing one final, large-scale beta blowout that'll run from 9th-12th May. The studio is calling it Dune: Awakening's "largest beta yet... with a huge number of new players joining compared to previous closed betas".

<p>
It'll give players a chance to experience survival in the vast, wormy deserts of Arrakis, as well as "most of" Dune: Awakening's first story act - which Funcom says should equal around 20 hours of playtime. Unlike previous betas, there's no NDA to sign, and all gameplay can be shared.
</p>
<p>
To be in with a chance of taking part in the beta, players have a number of options. They can either <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/">visit Dune: Awakening's Steam page</a> and hit the 'Request Access' button, or tune into the Global LAN Party Broadcast on 10th May, which will include developer chat and more. Funcom says "tens of thousands" of keys will be handed out during the broadcast, and these can be used to gain immediate access to the Dune: Awakening beta weekend.
</p>
<p>
Dune: Awakening gets its full Steam launch on 10th June, and an Xbox Series X/S and PS5 release is due at a later date. It's looking pretty promising too; Eurogamer's Robert Purchese came away impressed after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-proves-mmos-can-still-be-interesting-and-try-new-things">going hands-on with it earlier this year</a>, writing: "You can live out your Dune fantasy in the most faithful recreation of Arrakis we've yet seen in a game, pausing as the ground shudders from a nearby sandworm, ducking for cover as a sandstorm blows in, and searching crevices for the secrets of the world hidden within.... keep an eye on this one."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-just-got-a-sneaky-teaser-by-capcom-fans-believe<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Capcom just dropped a clever Resident Evil 9 teaser right in front of our noses - or so fans believe.
</p>
<p>
Tilt your head and you can see the Roman numerals for the number nine - IX - appear in a video published today from Capcom that celebrates the success of its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a>.
</p>
<p>
As the video wraps up, we see a fresh paint on a sign added to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>'s iconic village scene, with writing that thanks fans for playing. But squint and the sign's shape is also a nod to what's next, fans think. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-casually-announces-next-resident-evil-game-from-resident-evil-7-director">Capcom already casually confirmed Resident Evil 9 was in development last summer</a> - with Resident Evil 7 director Koshi Nakanishi back at the helm.
</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Untitled-11_T8hJCMM.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

<p>
But details of Resident Evil 9 are otherwise scarce - we don't even know if Resident Evil 9, or IX, will be its title, though today's apparent teaser seems to suggest this may be the case. 
</p>
<p>
One report from veteran Resident Evil leaker Dusk Golem <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-will-be-open-world-leaker-suggests">suggested the next Resi game would feature more of an open-world</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We're making a new Resident Evil," Nakanishi said last year. "It was really difficult to figure out what to do after Resident Evil 7, but I found it, and to be honest, it feels substantial. I can't share any details just yet, but I hope you’re excited for the day I can."
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, if you tilt your head the other way, Capcom is already teasing Resident Evil 11. But that seems a little soon.

<p>An infographic accompanying the news specifically said this figure related to <em>sales</em> of the game, so it would appear this does not include those playing via Xbox's Game Pass subscription service.</p>
<p>This ultimately means more than half a million of us are currently dipping our toe into Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. And, rightly so, with Sandfall Interactive's debut title receiving scores of praise across the industry.</p>
<p>Our Ed enjoyed Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and complimented the game's artwork and combat in particular.</p>
<p>"Outside the core plot, there's a wonderful silliness - and self-deprecation - to Clair Obscur that, together with its outstanding art direction and unique battle mechanics, ensure the game is distinct," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Eurogamer's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a>. "It's an ambitious yet impressive debut from the studio that, despite a somewhat fanciful narrative, is a pensive examination of grief and the power of art."</p>
<p>If you are one of the many currently playing through Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, but need a little assistance, well then we have guides a plenty for you.
