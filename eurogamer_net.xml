            <p>
Were you one of those people who thought <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alien-isolation">Alien: Isolation</a> went on a bit too long? Would you have preferred it if the much-loved sci-fi horror wrapped things up after 46 seconds? If so, you're in luck: one enterprising modder has now released an "impossible" mod that slings a chronological spanner in the works so the game technically ends before it begins.
</p>
<p>
"In an attempt to please IGN," modder Matt Filer wrote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlicicqW9mY">on YouTube</a> (and if you don't know what that's about, all should become clear <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review">over here</a>), "this mod substantially shortens Alien: Isolation's playable length by introducing Xenomorphs to LV-426."
</p>
<p>
And here comes the science bit. What you're seeing in Filer's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlicicqW9mY">46-second video</a> below is an ordinarily Xenomorph-free flashback sequence that usually takes place a good few hours into Alien: Isolation. It's a scene that sets the main story - in which Amanda Ripley searches for her mother - into motion, and one that would create a hell of a paradox if, say, someone shoved in a murderous Xenomorph, causing the flashback crew to perish. "As a result of the inevitable fatalities," Filer continues, "Marlow's team never discovers Ellen Ripley's flight recorder, and subsequently never arrive on Sevastopol to cause the Xenomorph outbreak."
</p>

<p>
 However, the mod does a bit more than add a Xenomorph; it also shifts the flashback sequence to the very start of the game. That both prevents the paradoxical weirdness of having it pop up several hours after Amanda is already (now impossibly) doing her thing, and means that - depending how ruthlessly efficient the Xenomorph is feeling - the entire story "usually ends in under a minute". Or in the case of Filer's illustrative video, 46 seconds.
</p><p>
The mod, which can be <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/MattFiler/mods?gameId=1310">downloaded on Nexus Mods</a>, isn't <em>just</em> an amusing novelty; it also serves as an advert for Filer's <a href="https://opencage.co.uk/docs/">OpenCAGE</a>, an open source set of mod tools for Alien: Isolation capable of "asset import/export, level script modification/creation, core configuration edits, NPC and behaviour tweaks, weapon mods, and more!". And if you're curious what else it can achieve, Filer has helpfully released a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/alienisolation/mods/48">Thomas the Tank Engine mod</a>, as is now obligatory.
</p>
<p>
Sega recently confirmed an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alien-isolation-2-teased-by-creative-assembly-with-original-director-returning">Alien: Isolation sequel is in early development</a>, with the original game's director onboard. Unfortunately for everyone, Filer's mod now makes that a temporal impossibility, so expect reality to start collapsing in on itself anytime soon.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/papers-please-creator-lucas-pope-has-made-a-free-game-watch-style-haunted-house-caper-for-halloween.1024827/</guid>

            <p>
'Tis the night for ghosties and ghoulies and hiding with the lights off because you suddenly remembered you forgot to buy sweets for trick-or-treaters this Halloween (oops!). And what better way to celebrate the occasion than with a free Game &amp; Watch-style haunted house caper from Papers, Please and Obra Dinn creator Lucas Pope?
</p>
<p>
The wonderfully titled Moida Mansion is <a href="https://dukope.itch.io/moida-mansion">available to play right now on itch.io</a>, challenging players to slip into the titular spookhouse and find their fellow Adventure Club members - who've all been trapped after following their mascot turtle inside. "Now it's up to you," reads the gloriously retro-styled manual. "Sneak in and rescue them before it's too late!"
</p>
<p>
In gameplay terms, Moida Mansion is a relatively simple thing, tasking players with moving from room to room and cycling through the objects within to search each one. Searching might locate one of your Adventure Club pals, or it might reveal a secret passageway, or even a handy key. Or all that rummaging might attract the attention of the mansion's "monsta", in which case you'll either need to sneak or - if you cause a ruckus while it's nearby - run away.

<p>
For all its simplicity, though, Moida Mansion is oddly compelling, and I've just merrily spend the last 20 minutes dodging monsta and scouring the house to uncover its secrets. It's also surprisingly atmospheric (and just a little bit tense) for a game with rudimentary LCD-style visuals, virtually zero animation, and minimal sound. What's more, Pope builds an impressive amount of variety from a relatively limited number of visual elements - and better yet, the mansion changes each game. I would buy this thing immediately if it was real!
</p><p>
This isn't Pope's first Game &amp; Watch style effort, of course; the acclaimed designer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/papers-please-gets-game-watch-style-demake-to-celebrate-10th-anniversary">created a free demake</a> of Papers, Please last year, in celebration of the dystopian document thriller's 10th anniversary. More recently, he released his Playdate-exclusive puzzler Mars After Midnight - a "lovely, silly game about community", as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lucas-popes-new-playdate-puzzler-is-a-lovely-silly-game-about-community">Christian Donlan put it</a> back in March.

            <p>
Fireproof Games, the studio behind the acclaimed puzzle-adventure series The Room, has announced its first new title since 2021's The Room 4: Old Sins. It's a spooky, single-player VR puzzle-adventure called Ghost Town, and it's heading to PC, PSVR2, and Quest 2/3 next year.
</p>
<p>
Ghost Town unfolds in the London of 1983, charting the adventures of with turned ghost hunter Edith Penrose. "Life has been going well for Edith," Fireproof explains in its announcement. "The paranormal detective agency she runs with her flatmate has never been busier, she's almost up-to-date with her rent and the ghosts in her bathroom mirror have been less demanding than usual. But Edith's world is turned upside down when her brother goes missing and a mysterious new lead promises to reveal clues of his whereabouts."
</p>
<p>
Edith's journey first takes her to a remote Scottish island in search of a gifted clairvoyant, but Fireproof isn't saying much more about its story just yet. It does, however, share a few details on how Ghost Town will unfold in VR as players explore its world of "large navigable environments" and deal with fully motion-captured characters, both living and dead.

"Explore a variety of atmospheric locations with a controller in each hand and a torch to light your way," it explains. "Use the dexterity of your hands to overcome tactile puzzles, cast spells and even summon troubled spirits to move them on to the next world."
</p><p>
And that's about everything Fireproof is willing to say right now. Ghost Town will initially launch for <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/ghost-town/9531494193591052/">Meta Quest 2/3</a> in "spring" next year, with a <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10010082">PSVR2</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2496180/Ghost_Town/">Steam VR</a> release set to follow in the summer. Fireproof's wonderfully macabre The Room series has been a consistent delight over its numerous instalments (including 2020's excellent VR outing The Dark Matter) since launching over a decade ago, so Ghost Town's going straight on my wishlist.
