            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian has changed its stance on generative AI following backlash faced at the end of last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/">In a Reddit Ask Me Anything</a> hosted by the studio this afternoon, founder Swen Vincke said, "to ensure there is no room for doubt, we've decided to refrain from using gen-AI tools during concept art development". "That way there can be no discussion about the origin of the art."</p>
<p>It was the use of gen-AI in relation to concept art that people had been especially concerned about. Vincke, in an interview in December, which coincided with the studio's Divinity game reveal, seemed to suggest Larian was using gen-AI to develop concept art. Controversy erupted, prompting Vincke to clarify that information had been "lost in translation", and that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-in-translation-larian-boss-swen-vincke-generative-ai-backlash-divinity-ama">the studio was only using gen-AI to explore references for concept art</a>, not generate the images themselves.</p>
<p>Evidently, in the few weeks since, a decision has been made to remove all sources of ambiguity entirely. As if to reinforce this, Vincke's Reddit post led with: "there is not going to be any gen-AI art in Divinity". But the ambiguity hasn't been entirely dispersed.</p><p>Vincke said Larian is still exploring gen-AI use in other applications at the studio. "We continuously try to improve the speed with which we can try things out," he wrote. "The more iterations we can do, the better in general the gameplay is. We think gen-AI can help with this and so we're trying things out across departments. Our hope is that it can aid us to refine ideas faster, leading to a more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game.</p>
<p>"The important bit to note," he added, "is that we will not generate 'creative assets' that end up in a game without being 100 percent sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data. If we use a gen-AI model to create in-game assets, then it'll be trained on data we own."</p>
<p>Larian lead writer Adam Smith joined the thread to clarify that the 'no gen-AI' approach to art would also be true for writing in Divinity. "The stance applies to writing as well," he wrote. "We don't have any text generation touching our dialogues, journal entries or other writing in Divinity."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/divinity-will-be-a-turn-based-rpg-and-see-larian-unleashed-declares-ceo-swen-vincke-replacing-the-dd-system-with-one-made-for-a-video-game">Divinity was announced at The Game Awards 2025</a> with a dark and gory cinematic trailer showing a festival - centred around burning someone at the stake - going horribly, irrevocably wrong. It shares the same series name as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divinity-original-sin">Divinity: Original Sin</a> 1 and 2, of course, but it's a completely new, detached game, and Larian is cooking up a new turn-based RPG system for it.</p>

            <p>Game of Thrones author George R. R. Martin would probably be quite surprised by how the world of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> - which he helped developer FromSoftware create a backstory for - actually turned out in the end.</p>
<p>That's according to Elden Ring game director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a>, who has said that while Martin was part of the game's development in terms of laying foundations for its world-building and such, it was the studio's own narrative team that actually took what Martin devised and then built upon it. And, there are some cases where the team and Miyazaki built upon it so much, that Martin himself may not actually recognise it.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/12/16/the-soul-of-soulslike">Game Informer</a>, Miyazaki said "as a player walks through this world, [...] they have a very fragmented understanding of the lore, the surroundings, and the type of monsters, whereas I don't" (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/game-of-thrones-author-george-r-r-martins-starting-point-for-elden-ring-evolved-so-drastically-that-hidetaka-miyazaki-reckons-hed-be-surprised-how-the-open-world-rpg-turned-out/">Games Radar</a>).</p>
<p>As Miyazaki knew the world of Elden Ring in its entirety, the director therefore wanted to ensure that the important moments for those who did not have the same level of knowledge didn't get "lost". This saw the director bringing "the map and level design" of Elden Ring together, so it could "serve as a guide" which would "help players pick up more information and piece together what they think that world is", he explained.</p><p>But while Martin may be perhaps be surprised by how some of his lore building efforts evolved for the final release, Miyazaki doesn't have any regrets about the necessary changes which made Elden Ring an all-round experience for players. In fact, the director said Elden Ring even now remains "in a league of its own".</p>

<p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/george-r-r-martin-admits-he-hasnt-played-elden-ring-as-people-seem-to-want-this-winds-of-winter-book">Martin admitted he hadn't played Elden Ring</a>, despite providing backstory. Before its release, though, the author did say <a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2021/12/18/long-long-ago/">he thought Elden Ring looked pretty incredible</a>.</p>
<p>As for expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, Martin didn't provide any new material for FromSoftware. "Essentially it is the same as it was with the base game," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-fromsoftwares-largest-expansion-ever">Miyazaki told Eurogamer ahead of the DLC's release in 2024</a>.</p>
<p>"The DLC Shadow of the Erdtree is based on one part of that original mythos that he penned for us. It's not a brand new mythos that he's written specifically for Shadow of the Erdtree, he has not created something new which informed the design of the DLC. It's simply another part of the original story that we thought fit to tell as a new expansion."</p>
