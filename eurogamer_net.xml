            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/poppy-playtime">Poppy Playtime</a> developer Mob Entertainment is suing Google for failing to remove "scam" apps from the Google Play store.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/google-pirated-poppy.pdf">legal papers</a> filed on Wednesday (thanks, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/poppy-playtime-sues-google-for-failing-to-remove-copyright-infringing-scam-apps-250116/">TorrentFreak</a>), Poppy Playtime's creators accuse Daigo Game 2020 Inc. of releasing "scam" apps intentionally advertised with names like Poppy Playtime: Chapter 3 and Poppy Playtime: Chapter 4 well before the instalments had been officially released for mobile devices.</p>

<p>As well as blatantly using Poppy Playtime's name, promotional art also clearly uses Poppy Playtime's characters and screenshots from the authentic game's second chapter.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, Mob contacted Google numerous times over several months, but each time an erroneous app is removed, it simply pops back up again a day or two later.</p>
<p>The apps reportedly don't even download a copycat or derivative game, either.</p>
<p>"Mob Entertainment's trademarks and copyrighted material to trick consumers into spending up to $95 for a game prior to its release on Google Play. Instead, it asks users to pay $30 to $95 for the 'Guide wuggy playtime mod'," the complaint added.</p><p>"Google receives a direct financial benefit from the infringement by the users at least because users with devices containing the application are given an offer to purchase the Guide wuggy playtime mod for up to $95. If they make the purchase, Google then receives 15-30 percent of the proceeds."</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the scam game is still available to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PoPPyPlaytimeKing.BuggyChapterPlaytimeMOPckapter3&amp;hl=en">view</a>, and install, on the Google Play store. Unless players know, explicitly, who publishes the game, there's absolutely no way of telling them apart, particularly as it doesn't list a user score or link to user reviews.</p>
<p>Whilst the real game is a premium product and listed as having 10K+ downloads, the fake app has been downloaded over a million times.</p>

</figure>
<p>"Google forfeited the benefits of the DMCA's safe harbour provision for its infringement of Mob Entertainment's copyrighted works contained in the unauthorised 'Poppy Playtime: Chapter 3' and 'Poppy Playtime Chapter 4' applications," the court filing said.</p>
<p>"The unauthorised Poppy Playtime applications have tarnished Mob Entertainmentâ€™s Poppy Playtime [copyright] mark by associating it with poor quality applications that are nothing but bait-and-switch scams.</p>
<p>"Google's illegal, unfair, and fraudulent business acts and practices have caused Mob Entertainment to spend copious amounts of resources, including its employees' time, in a fruitless effort to attempt to get Google to remove applications committing copyright infringement, trademark infringement, fraud, and other unlawful and unfair business acts and practices."</p><p>Mob Entertainment seeks "actual damages in an amount to be determined in excess of $75,000", all of Daigo and Google's profits from the scam apps, court costs, and $150,000 in damages per work infringed. It is also hoping for an injunction to prevent Google and Daigo violating its trademark in the future.</p>
<p>This is the latest in a line of game developers who have called out digital game stores for not promptly dealing with intentionally misleading or copyright-infringing games.</p>
<p>Just last month, the creative director of indie hit Unpacking, Wren Brier, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unpacking-developer-calls-out-nintendo-after-reporting-cheap-fakes-on-its-eshop">called out Nintendo due to the prominence of copycat games on its Switch eShop</a>, and days later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-black-myth-wukong-copycat-games-are-popping-up-on-nintendo-eshop">fans spotted Black Myth: Wukong imitations, too</a>. The 2D platformer's gameplay and presentation are markedly different, but its promotional art and title could easily be confused with that of Game Science's blockbuster.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo believes that "the best direction" for Switch 2 is to ensure players are "able to play their already purchased Nintendo Switch software on the successor".</p>
<p>In the absence of any other studio coming forward to confirm they were developing games for Switch 2, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/my-kids-first-meeting-with-nintendo?open=false#%C2%A7item-some-switch-notes-a-day-after-the-big-announcement">Game File</a> asked Nintendo to expand on what third-party developers it was working with. The reply didn't really address the question at hand, but did provide a little insight into Nintendo's view of backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>"Nintendo Switch is played by many consumers, and we decided that the best direction to take would be for consumers to be able to play their already purchased Nintendo Switch software on the successor to Nintendo Switch," the company said.</p>
<p>"As a result of that thinking, Nintendo Switch 2 plays Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games, as well as both physical and digital Nintendo Switch games.</p>
<p>"Certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2. Details will be shared on the Nintendo website at a later date."</p>
<p>It's still not yet clear what "may not be fully compatible" means or what games won't make the cut. But the statement does, at least, intimate that Nintendo is acutely cognisant of the importance of backwards compatibility for players moving between Switch and Switch 2. Whilst Switch was not backwards compatible with Wii or Wii U, Wii U <em>was</em> backwards compatible with Wii games, just as the Nintendo 3DS was also able to run DS cartridges.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Here's everything we know so far about Nintendo Switch 2</a>.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is - assuming it doesn't get delayed for a third time - almost upon us, and in the run-up to its March release, Ubisoft is continuing its series of deep dives highlighting some of the ways this latest series entry will be breaking from tradition. And this time around, it's the turn of exploration, which is promising to be a little more player-driven and a little less like an explosion in a map marker factory.
</p>
<p>
In its <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4GKS1MvpHS3f7ebKWfxHmt/assassins-creed-shadows-deep-dive-into-exploration">latest blog post</a>, Ubisoft says Assassin's Creed Shadows makes "major changes and additions" to exploration in order to "foster a unique sense of discovery" as players roam the world. The aim, it explains, is to move away from an overabundance of 'hand-holding' map icons and markers toward an open world where information is "key [and] a form of reward". As such, rather than be immediately showered with points of interest, players will need to discover and earn information - either directly, through their spies, or via NPCs on their travels.
</p>
<p>
The world map, for instance, will initially only show region names and vague illustrative hints at potential key locations, with more details being revealed as players explore regions, sub-regions, and local landmarks. Notably, players will eventually earn scouts that can be sent ahead to reveal more precise location for quest objectives.

<figcaption>Synchronisation in Assassin's Creed Shadows.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp0v_S61cAY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
One of Assassin's Creed's most iconic exploration features is also getting an overhaul, with viewpoints - AKA synchronisation points - now behaving a little differently. In Shadows, synchronisation no longer uncovers a clutter of map icons over a large area, instead revealing nearby key points of interest that can be manually tagged and added to the compass. Ubisoft says the goal is to give players a "more intentional and active way to find their next adventure."
</p><p>
In a similar fashion, the classic companion eagle has now been jettisoned, and players will instead need to find a good vantage point to observe the surrounding area and plan their approach, manually searching out and tagging valuable items, enemies, and so on.
</p>
<p>
Also new are safe houses - known as "kakurega" - that players can acquire. These provide "safe" fast travel points (discovered viewpoints also unlock fast travel, but these are frequently in dangerous enemy zones), as well as other useful functions. Players can, for instance, refill rations, tools, and ammunition; access their gear stash; manage and accept contracts; replenish scouts, and manage allies that can be summoned for help.

<figcaption>And here's a look at Shadows' objective board.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faWrGLgBBAc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Elsewhere in Ubisoft's update, there's mention of Assassin's Creed Shadows' Objective Board - a version of the visual quest log previously seen in Mirage, which expands to show new targets and objectives as more characters and challenges are encountered. Or rather, it reveals clues pointing to the location of new opportunities, which players must piece together for more specific directions - unless they want their scouts to do the hard work for them.
</p><p>
Ubisoft also highlights Shadows' Pathfinder tool, which - given the inclusion of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-adding-the-ability-to-go-prone-has-prompted-a-rethink-of-the-series-usual-controls">more unclimbable scenery</a> this time around - is intended to help players avoid false shortcuts that would increase their travel time. When a quest is tracked and its location is revealed (or when players manually place a marker on the map), Pathfinder can be deployed while on horseback to draw a white line overlay on the ground showing the shortest route to a player's destination.
</p>
<p>
A few more exploration details can be found in <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4GKS1MvpHS3f7ebKWfxHmt/assassins-creed-shadows-deep-dive-into-exploration">Ubisoft's latest blog post</a> - and if that's left you sufficiently intrigued, Assassin's Creed Shadows is now due to launch for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on 20th March. Ubisoft recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">delayed the game's release yet again</a> (it was previously scheduled for 14th February) as it explores potential sales options.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> maker HoYoverse has agreed to pay $20m to settle a complaint - filed by the US Department of Justice on behalf of the Federal Trade Commission - accusing it of violating children's privacy laws and deceiving users over the true cost of obtaining rare loot box prizes.
</p>
<p>
As per the FTC's <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/genshin-impact-game-developer-will-be-banned-selling-lootboxes-teens-under-16-without-parental">announcement</a>, the complaint accused Singapore-based Cognosphere - which does business under the name HoYoverse - of actively marketing Genshin Impact to children and of collecting their personal information in violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA). The FTC claimed HoYoverse was aware children under 13 were using its service, but continued to collect their personal information - and share it with third-parties - without obtaining parental consent or complying with other COPPA requirements.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the filing claimed HoYoverse deceived players regarding the odds of - and true cost of - winning particularly sought-after "five-star" loot box prizes. The complaint argued Genshin Impact's loot box system - said to require players to "exchange real dollars for bundles of virtual currency that then have to be re-exchanged multiple times to open loot boxes" - is "complicated", "challenging", and "confusing", particularly for children and teens.

<p>
Furthermore, the filing claimed Genshin Impact's purchasing process "misleads consumers about the amount of money [they] spend on loot boxes on an ongoing basis, and the amount of money [they] would likely need to spend to obtain certain prizes". HoYoverse's event banners and influencer campaigns were also alleged to give players the impression they would have better odds of obtaining five-star prizes than was the case in reality.
</p><p>
In response, HoYoverse has agreed to pay $20m to settle the complaint - meaning it neither admits or denies the allegations - and will make changes to prevent children under 16 from purchasing lootboxes without a parent's express consent. The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Cognosphere-Attachment3-3.pdf">proposed settlement</a> - which must be approved by a federal judge - also prohibits HoYoverse from selling loot boxes using virtual currency without providing an option to purchase them with real money, and requires it to disclose loot box odds and exchange rates for multi-tiered virtual currency.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, HoYoverse is required to delete any personal information previously collected from children under 13 without parental consent, and to comply with COPPA going forward.
