            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-uk-ps5-rental-scheme-from-11month<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>You can now lease a PS5, along with the likes of a PS VR2 set and Sony's handheld remote player PlayStation Portal, here in the UK.</p>
<p>This leasing service debuted in Japan, and quickly became a hit. As Ed reported this morning, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-popularity-means-japans-ps5-rental-service-is-fully-booked">GEO's PS5 rental service in Japan is fully booked across its 400 stores nationwide</a>. It's been a monster (hunter) success, you could say.</p>
<p>And now, it is our turn. Sony's <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/leasing">PS Direct UK website</a> lets you rent a digital-only PS5 for £11/month, or a PS5 with a disc drive for £12/month. Stump up £19/month and you can rent a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>. If you want a PS VR2, it's £18.50/month - or £20/month if you want access to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-call-mountain">Horizon: Call of the Mountain</a> too. PlayStation Portal is £6.50/month.</p>

</figure>
<p>Those interested in going down the lease route can choose a 12, 24, or 36-month term contract, although there is also a rolling monthly option if that's more your thing. As for the products available through the service, you will be able to rent the following PlayStation items:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5 Pro Console</li>
<li>PlayStation 5 Digital Edition Console (model group - slim)</li>
<li>PlayStation 5 Console (model group - slim)</li>
<li>PlayStation 5 Digital Edition Console - Two DualSense Wireless Controllers Bundle (model group - slim)</li>
<li>PlayStation 5 Console - Two DualSense Wireless Controllers Bundle (model group - slim)</li>
<li>PlayStation Portal Remote Player</li>
<li>PlayStation VR2 Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle</li>
<li>PlayStation VR2</li>
<li>DualSense Edge Wireless Controller</li>
</ul>
<p>In a <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/support/leasing">FAQ section on the website</a>, Sony states all lease agreements are made exclusively with Raylo. "All transactions, communications, and support services related to your device lease will be provided directly by Raylo," the page reads. "If you've signed up to a lease through PlayStation leasing and you have any issues with your device or your lease, you should contact Raylo for support in the first instance."</p>
<p>It also states Raylo offers a fair wear and tear policy on the leased hardware.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Raylo offer a fair wear and tear policy," Sony states. "It's ok to return your device with obvious signs of use such as a couple of deep scratches, small dents, discolouration or changes in the paintwork."</p>
<p>So, are you tempted?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-making-rare-creature-previously-locked-to-city-events-available-to-all<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> developer Niantic has now announced official details for this summer's Go Fest event series, which will include the global release of a Pokémon previously locked behind paid City Safari meetups.
</p>
<p>
As detailed previously, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fest-2025-to-be-held-in-paris">Go Fest 2025 will hold in-person events in Paris, Jersey City and Osaka</a> through late May and June. These will lead to the game's global Go Fest, which is now confirmed to take place on 28th and 29th June.
</p>
<p>
Today, Niantic confirmed Go Fest this year will see the release of Crowned Sword Zacian and Crowned Shield Zamazenta, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-gos-next-mythical-pokemon-teased-in-go-fest-logo">which players had deduced from this year's leaked Go Fest logo</a>. In a surprise, the event's main Mythical creature will be Volcanion, however - not Megearna as previously suspected. 
</p>
<p>
And in another surprise, it's been confirmed that Pokémon Go Fest Global will include the wider release of Skiddo, the cute goat creature you'd previously need to travel to City Safari event to capture. 
</p>
<p>
Through 2023 and 2024, Skiddo was only available if you visited Seoul, Barcelona, Mexico City, Tainan, Jakarta, Hong Kong and Sao Paulo at specific times. 
</p>
<p>
2025's City Safari events - so far confirmed for Milan, Singapore and Mumbai - now feature donkey Pokémon Mudbray as their new exclusive, signalling a wider release for Skiddo was on the cards.
</p>
<p>
This year may well include other changes to Pokémon Go, depending on the outcome of the game's reported sale. Last month, it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fans-launch-campaign-to-protect-games-future-as-concerns-mount-over-sale">Niantic was planning to sell Pokémon Go to Monopoly Go maker Scopely</a> - a move which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-developer-close-to-selling-games-for-35bn-to-saudi-owned-monopoly-go-maker-report">stoked concern amongst players due to Scopely's aggressive monetisation strategy</a> seen after it has taken over other mobile games.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> maker Epic Games is suing a player accused of stealing and selling countless user accounts, and profiting further by flogging details of his tactics to other wannabe thieves.
</p>
<p>
Epic is seeking unspecified damages from Illinois Fortnite fan Isaac "i5aac" Strock for fraud, copyright infringement and unjust enrichment.
</p>
<p>
Strock is named in a <a href="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/2025-02-27-epic-v--strock-complaint-5a69b553b2a2.pdf">legal filing dated 27th February</a>, which <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-anti-cheat-update-february-27-2025">Epic Games has also publicised via a recent blog post</a> - its latest move to name and shame those who target Fortnite with unscrupulous practices.
</p>
<p>
"Strock is in the business of stealing access to other players' Epic Games accounts," Epic Games wrote in its court filing. 
</p>
<p>
"He uses illicit means to discover the players' usernames and passwords and in some cases even the login credentials for the players' email address associated with the players' Epic Games account. He then sells access to these accounts to the highest bidders."
</p>
<p>
Epic Games estimates Strock has sold "hundreds" of player accounts and says he has boasted online about reaping "thousands of dollars in profits".
</p>
<p>
Strock is said to have even offered a guide on how to cheat Epic Games' player support and steal more accounts - again, for a price. 
</p>
<p>
Epic Games detected Strock on multiple occasions trying to bamboozle its player support with requests to change log-in details and gain access to accounts with valuable cosmetics or that had already been pre-loaded with Fortnite in-game currency.
</p>
<p>
Strock also used email and password combinations acquired in data breaches via the dark web to further add to his stolen account haul, the legal filing states.
</p>
<p>
The online trade in Fortnite accounts is lucrative, and accounts with rare skins are highly prized. Epic Games notes that some individual accounts sell for over $1000 each.
</p>
<p>
"Strock's actions harm Epic and the Fortnite community," the company concluded. "Epic has spent substantial resources investigating and working to prevent Strock's conduct. Strock's conduct also directly harms Fortnite players who no longer have access to the accounts they spent time and money on.
</p>
<p>
"Epic is entitled to all remedies available at law or equity, including injunctive relief, compensatory damages and/or other equitable or monetary remedies."
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-sues-fortnite-cheater-takes-back-winnings-and-forces-them-to-post-humiliating-public-apology-video-as-a-stark-warning-to-others">Epic Games announced its victory against a Fortnite competitive cheater who had tried to sneak their way into the game's biggest tournament</a>. Epic took back the player's winnings, forced them to post humiliating public apology video and then donated the prize money to charity.

            <p>One of Japan's biggest retailers began offering a PS5 rental service last week, but it's already fully booked thanks in large part to the popularity of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>
<p>GEO began offering the service on 28th February, neatly timed with the release of Capcom's latest monster hunting game. It's surprisingly cheap too, with a week's rental at around a fiver and two weeks for under a tenner.</p>
<p>However, the availability is completely blocked out until mid-April across all regions, as <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japans-new-ps5-rental-is-massively-popular-with-service-fully-booked-across-all-regions/">Automaton</a> reported.

<p>Japanese players are notorious for maintaining the quality of their gaming tech, but I'm not convinced a similar service would work here in the UK. Too many sticky controllers.</p>
<p>GEO hasn't stated how many consoles are available for rental, but the service is being provided across its 400 stores nationwide - the fact it's booked up proves the service (and Monster Hunter Wilds) are extremely popular.</p>
<p>In fact, it's yet another example of the impact Capcom's game is having over in Japan.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Eurogamer reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-delectable-cuisine-causes-cheese-naan-sales-to-surge">cheese naan sales are on the rise thanks to Monster Hunter Wilds' delectable food scenes</a>.</p>
<p>One Tokyo-based Nepalese restaurant thanked Monster Hunter directly for boosting its cheese naan sales.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">Monster Hunter Wilds reached the highest concurrent player numbers on Steam for the series</a>, quickly reaching over 1.3 million players just a couple of days after launch. That's over four times higher than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a>, which reached more than 300,000 concurrent players.</p>
<p>Not only that, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">Monster Hunter Wilds is Capcom's fastest-selling game ever</a>, reaching over 8m units sold in just three days across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>"The most exhilarating and refined Monster Hunter yet, even if its attempts to balance the old and new don't always quite coalesce in its ongoing quest to please all audiences," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Eurogamer Monster Hunter Wilds review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Minecraft developer Mojang has announced a new Minecraft Live event, to be held on 22nd March at 6pm UK time, and teased that it will contain "new game drops".
</p>
<p>
Does this mean new "drops" in existing Minecraft games, or the dropping of new Minecraft games entirely? The event's brief teaser video does not say.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, however, the teaser does note that "exclusive movie content" is also on the way, separate to the ambiguous dropping mentioned above.

Mojang's Minecraft Movie tie-in is likely the A Minecraft Movie Hero Pack which leaked online last week. It contains character skins for the upcoming film's main roster - including a beardy Jack Black as Steve, and Aquaman in a pink jacket.

At <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-live-digital-showcase-returns-later-this-month-with-news-about-our-games-and-more">the last Minecraft Live, in September 2024</a>, Mojang announced it was ditching its singular big summer update for multiple updates spread throughout the year. The next of these, presumably, will be revealed later this month.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/295k-minecraft-fans-criticise-lack-of-new-content-in-stop-the-mob-vote-petition">Minecraft Live has also now ditched its long-running mob vote</a>, after the process for voting on new creatures became too controversial, and some fans complained about their choices getting sidelined.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-witcher-casts-first-game-exclusive-character<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The fourth season of Netflix's Witcher adaptation is on its way, and we've now got word of a new character for the show. That's not <em>too </em>exciting in itself, but this particular addition to the show marks a notable change. You see, this is the Netflix series' first game-exclusive character to pop up on the small screen.</p>
<p>Since its conception, Netflix's Witcher team has refrained from adapting anything particularly game-specific, sticking instead with characters and beasties based on Andrzej Sapkowski's novels and short stories. Of course, there has been the occasional reference back to CDPR's own Sapkowski-based works, such as Henry Cavill's Geralt taking a nice, steamy bath (see header image above).</p>
<p>That's changing for the show's fourth season, however, with the reported addition of actor Jack Myers. According to Witcher fan site <a href="https://redanianintelligence.com/2025/03/01/netflixs-the-witcher-casts-its-first-character-from-the-games/">Redanian Intelligence</a>, Myers - who has starred in the likes of The Crown and Call the Midwife, as well as lending his vocal talents to games such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> and Dying Light 2 - has landed the role of Roderick de Wett, a character from the original Witcher game.</p>

<p>Now, if you haven't heard of Roderick de Wett, don't worry - he didn't exactly have a huge role in the first Witcher. He was a Nilfgaardian Count, and member of the religious knightly order known as The Order of the Flaming Rose (or sometimes just The Order).</p>
<p>Roderick isn't an especially nice chap, and Geralt isn't a fan of his. To give you an idea of his personality, here is what his <a href="https://www.playgwent.com/en/decks/61e8445b4b99d146d6c747b9631a83ce">Gwent card reads</a>:</p>
<p>"Count de Wett is exceptionally loathsome and arrogant, but at least he enjoys a little dice poker on the side."</p>
<p>While Roderick only - thus far - appears in CDPR's video game, there is a potential link to Sapkowski's written Witcher work. A Nilfgaardian noble by the name of Joachim de Wett pops up in books Time of Contempt, The Tower of the Swallow and The Lady of the Lake. Meanwhile, <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Joachim_de_Wett#Trivia">Joachim's skull can also be found in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>. Given the name and both characters' backgrounds, it seems likely they are related in some way.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/ea-play">EA Play</a> offers trials of "select new games" and unlimited access to "a collection of top EA titles" for £5.99 a month, while the pricier Pro version offers day one access to full, premium editions of "select new games" and unlimited access to a "library of premium edition EA titles" for £16.99 a month.</p>
<p>But Split Fiction - released under the EA Originals label - won't be included in either tier as a "select new game". Hazelight's previous games <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/a-way-out">A Way Out</a> are both included.</p>
<p>"It certainly seems like false advertising," wrote one forum user. "This is so unfair, EA Play Pro even increased the price and we still can't get the latest games," wrote another.</p>
<p>The latest additions to the service are <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc24">EA Sports FC 24</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f1-24">EA Sports F1 24</a>. The available game trials are all sports games.</p>
<p>Another of EA's other most recently published games, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, is also not available on the subscription - though it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-in-playstation-plus-next-month">added to PS Plus this month</a>. A trial was included at launch, but is no longer available.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">Split Fiction received five stars in Eurogamer's review</a>.

            <p>
Until Dawn remake studio Ballistic Moon has reportedly "effectively closed", amid claims only a handful of employees "at most" remain - none of them developers.
</p>
<p>
Ballistic Moon, which is based in the UK, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-remake-studio-ballistic-moon-lays-off-staff-ahead-of-the-games-release-in-october">confirmed a round of redundancies last year</a>, saying it had made the "tough decision to significantly scale down our team to secure the future of our studio." However, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-effectively-closed/">new report by Insider Gaming</a> claims the studio quietly made a second round of redundancies toward the end of last year.
</p>
<p>
According to the publication's sources, roughly 40 employees were let go in October, with remaining staff kept on to provide post-launch support for Ballistic's Until Dawn remake. However, it's claimed these developers - equating to around 20 employees - lost their jobs in December, leaving only the studio's founders and "possibly" a handful of employees "at most". Reportedly, Ballistic's entire PR, marketing, and development teams are now gone.

<p>
"People are sharing bugs they've found in the game to make the team aware," a source told the publication, "but there is no one working on patch support for the game anymore."
</p>
<p>
Insider Gaming claims the job losses follow unsuccessful attempts by Ballistic's founders to pitch new projects, secure funding, and keep things "moving forward". It's also said discussions were had with Sony to secure funding for additional Until Dawn updates, possibly even another game, but they never reached fruition. Eurogamer has reached out to Ballistic for comment.
</p>
<p>
Word of additional redundancies at Ballistic comes as job cuts and studio closures continue across the games industry. February alone saw the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and Warner Bros. Games San Diego shut their doors</a>, with layoffs also confirmed at Marvel Rivals' US development team, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/callisto-protocol-studio-confirms-layoffs-as-former-employee-claims-most-of-the-devs-affected">The Callisto Protocol developer Striking Distance</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surgeon-simulator-developer-suffers-more-layoffs-says-it-will-scale-back-operations">Surgeon Simulator studio Bossa Games</a>. This week has also seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-layoffs-at-playstation-following-live-service-cancellations">further job losses at PlayStation</a> following the cancellation of multiple live-service games, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/still-wakes-the-deep-publisher-confirms-small-number-of-layoffs-as-its-sold-to-investment-firm">Still Wakes the Deep publisher Secret Mode confirmed a "small number" of layoffs</a>, following its sale to an investment firm.
