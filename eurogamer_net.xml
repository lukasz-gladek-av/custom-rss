            <p>The Highguard team has released another patch for its live-service hero shooter.</p>
<p>This update includes a new Warden, known as Ekon. Ekon is described as a "legendary Wildwalker" who is able to shapeshift into a direwolf. This means he doesn't need a mount, as he is the mount.</p>
<p>"When his mentor, and closest thing to family, goes missing in the lost land of Highguard, there is no monster or Warden this great predator will allow to stand in his way," developer Wildlight teases.</p>

<p>As well as this new Warden, the update - which welcomes in Highguard episode two - also adds a new map known as Skydrift which, as the name suggests, takes place above the clouds. From a quick glance at the artwork for this map (see further below), I get flashbacks to the sky islands in Legend of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, but with more structures dotted about.</p>
<p>Other quality of life improvements include the likes of being able to leave the party by clicking on party member's social card, Dead players no longer show up on the minimap and more.</p>

<p>Highguard was announced back in December, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">closing out Geoff Keighley's trailer-filled The Game Awards extravaganza</a> (which did also feature some awards). Coming from several former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">Highguard quickly had a large influx of players on its release earlier this week</a>, however there were a few complaints as well, with many disappointed with areas such as map size and the 3v3 game format.</p>
<p>Since this slightly rocky debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developers-defend-as-complaints-pile-up">other developers across the industry have voiced their support for Highguard</a>, with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded studio 1047 Games stating: "No game is perfect on day one."</p>

            <p>PC game-download store GOG has come under scrutiny for using generative-AI in marketing artwork, then for seeming to sit on the fence in an answer about whether it will keep using the tech in the future.</p>
<p>The piece of artwork was a banner advertising a 2026 sale, <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/5000_gog_patrons_and_an_ai_banner/post69?cjdata=MXxZfDB8WXww&amp;utm_campaign=cj&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=cj">which a GOG forum user, presumed to be a GOG artist, spoke out about</a> and confirmed was created with AI. This caused a stink and so gen-AI use was one of the topics GOG was immediately questioned about during <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gog/comments/1qu09vg/ask_the_gog_team_and_micha%C5%82_kici%C5%84ski_anything/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">an Ask Me Anything on Reddit</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>Managing director Maciej Gołębiewski - when asked about the negative reaction and whether GOG would move away from gen-AI use in the future - replied: "We're not planning on making absolute statements in either direction. AI tools are one of many technologies we test and try out, and in some contexts it genuinely helps us push the company (and the mission) forward.</p>
<p>"What we will change, though, is how and where those tools are used; we understand that using new technology doesn't mean skipping human judgment." His answer did nothing to cool or calm the crowd.</p>

<p>I followed this response up with GOG and Gołębiewski this morning but was told GOG wouldn't elaborate on what had been said. However, I did speak to Gołębiewski at length in January, in an interview about GOG's private acquisition, and gen-AI was one of the topics we broached.</p>
<blockquote><em>"Every technology at some point finds its way to be put to good use"</em></blockquote>
<p>Gołębiewski told me at the time: "We are not using it [gen-AI] as of right now, but we've seen instances where communities have used the AI or neural network to analyse all of the code that is available for a game - all of the repositories or the documentation that's available for a game - with an aim of making it run better or maybe making it run on a different operating system or different hardware. AI is pretty good at absorbing the context and then guessing some action points based on that context.</p>
<p>"We haven't done this in this form," he added, "but I'm sure that at some point the application of AI - not necessarily generative AI in terms of artworks or code or whatever - will be found for how this can be used to advance game preservation. Every technology at some point finds its way to be put to good use. It's just the road to that is usually windy, shaky, however you might call it. So we haven't yet, but I'm not saying we won't do it in the future. If this can be used to advance our mission, then we will do it."</p>

<p>GOG's founding mission - and continuing mission - is restoring and preserving classic games, whether they be old classics or more modern classics, and ensuring they can be played in their best form into the future without being locked behind DRM. This often requires a lot of work on GOG's end, hence the attraction of AI in helping alleviate some of that.</p><p>But GOG is a store that also sells newer games, both indie and bigger games, and that prides itself on a selective approach, and on being close to its audience and receptive to them. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-says-selling-horses-when-steam-wouldnt-was-matter-of-freedom">GOG earned plenty of respect by stocking provocative indie horror game Horses</a> last year, when other stores, like Epic and Steam, wouldn't. "We as a company are always ready to take a stand on the right values," Maciej Gołębiewski said to me about making that decision. It's a statement that seems to grate against what it's saying now about gen-AI.</p>
<p>GOG recently became a private company after having spent its entire existence as part of CD Projekt - the house of The Witcher games and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. And one of the positive potential ramifications of this is not being burdened by that huge game-making business, and therefore being more agile and able to take risks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-eyes-indie-game-publishing-something-it-couldnt-do-under-cd-projekt-red">new owner Michał Kiciński explained to me recently</a>. I wonder if this moment will be a telling one in the company's new era.</p>

            <p>The Exit 8 is one of the many video game series currently getting a film or TV adaptation, and ahead of its international cinematic debut in April, the team has released a new trailer for the subway-bound horror flick.</p>
<p>If it wasn't already on your radar, The Exit 8 became quite a cult hit on its initial release back in 2023. It's a walking simulator inspired by Japanese underground passageways, and while I admit that doesn't sound great at first, here's the thing: you are trapped in this seemingly endless passageway, and have to pay careful attention to your surroundings in order to find your way out. And, things get weird.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>This is the exact premise Exit 8's film adaptation will also lean on. "A man trapped in an endless sterile subway passageway sets out to find Exit 8. The rules of his quest are simple: do not overlook anything out of the ordinary. If you discover an anomaly, turn back immediately. If you don't, carry on. Then leave from Exit 8. But even a single oversight will send him back to the beginning. Will he ever reach his goal and escape this infinite corridor?" reads the film's official blurb.</p>
<p>We had a little look at what this film would be like last year, but now we have a new extended trailer, showing just how claustrophobic and nightmarish this looping plight will be for the poor chap - played by singer and actor Kazunari Ninomiya - who is doomed to wander the subway alone (well, kind of alone, if you catch my drift...).</p>
<p>You can check it out for yourself below.</p>

<p>Exit 8 (the film) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cult-japanese-horror-game-the-exit-8-gets-first-film-trailer">debuted in Japan last year</a>, but is now reaching audiences further afield with its 10th April release date.</p>
<p>Genki Kawamura directed the adaptation, following his work as producer on anime film Suzume, directing and writing the 2022 film Hyakka, and even producing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-pokemon-and-ed-sheeran-collaboration-is-coming-out-next-week">Ed Sheeran's Pokémon music video for Celestial</a>.</p>

            <p>MachineGames' most recent release may be the brilliant Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, but the studio is of course also known for its Wolfenstein games. And, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-doesnt-sound-like-weve-heard-the-last-from-machinegames-wolfenstein-series">following an earlier hint that the studio wasn't finished with its nazi-busting series</a>, we now have more concrete word on the fate of MachineGames' Wolfenstein trilogy.</p>

<p>This word comes from studio director Jerk Gustafsson, who was chatting with Eurogamer's sister site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/machinegames-on-being-part-of-microsoft-going-back-to-the-office-and-wolfenstein-3">GamesIndustry</a> about MachineGames' 15 year legacy. During this conversation, Gustafsson admitted that because of the time it takes to make a video game in this day and age, he may only have a few more projects left in him before the end of his career.</p>
<p>"There's so many things that I would like to do, but I'm also getting a bit older, so I don't have that many games left in me," he said. "It takes a long time to make a game now, and let's say that we release one every four years, then maybe two more, maybe three if I'm lucky."</p>
<p>So, could one of these hypothetical projects be Wolfenstein 3? While Gustafsson was careful with his answer, he did say this:</p>
<p>"Our intention has always been to go back to Wolfenstein. We wanted to finish the trilogy. And when we do that, that is something that I don't want to comment on. It can be now, it can be later, but we're not done with it. That's what I can say."</p>

<p>As for the more immediate future, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-and-indiana-jones-switch-2-release-dates-leak-ahead-of-nintendo-direct">MachineGames is set to release Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on Switch 2 later this year</a>. Like I have said, this game is brilliant, and I loved being able to whip crack my way across the globe with Indy.</p>
<p>"Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones, The Great Circle is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">original five star Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review from 2024</a>.</p>
<p>There's also a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wolfenstein-is-the-next-game-series-to-get-an-adaptation-for-tv">Wolfenstein TV series in the works</a>, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation">Bethesda's Todd Howard is staying tight-lipped on how things are progressing</a>.</p>

            <p>A new report has claimed that Gears of War E-Day is eyeing a release window in the second half of 2026, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-combat-evolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a> tentatively targeting a launch some time this Summer.</p>
<p>This report, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/874303/microsoft-xbox-roadmap-2026-notepad">written by The Verge's Tom Warren</a>, claims that Microsoft wants both Gears of War E-Day and Fable to dodge the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, with Tom Warren writing: "I understand Microsoft has a good idea of when both should launch, but it's also keen to avoid being too close to Grand Theft Auto VI's November 19th date."</p>
<p>The report also touches on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> Remake, which The Verge reports is in "active development". The article also states that Bethesda wants the game to reach a similar bar of quality as the Oblivion Remake, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-in-the-shadow-of-skyrims-mountains-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-still-matters">which was well-received in part due to its faithfulness and level of polish</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, The Verge reports that Double Fine's The Kiln is aiming for an April release, and new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> content is due for a reveal soon. All of this comes with a caveat, with Warren sensibly writing: "Don't be surprised if any of these game dates slip or change -- such is the reality of video game development."</p><p>If these release windows are accurate, which they may very well be (The Verge has a solid track record with this stuff), then Microsoft certainly has a packed 2026. Fable, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fable-finally-gets-a-release-window-following-xbox-developer-direct-will-launch-in-autumn-2026">which we already know is due to launch some time this Autumn</a>, recently got a dedicated showcase in an Xbox Developer Direct. There's also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>, set in Japan and landing on the 19th May.</p>
<p>If these dates and release windows are accurate, what do you reckon of Xbox line-up this year? Let us know in the comments!</p>
