Xbox studios boss Matt Booty has said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">the wait for PlayStation 5 owners to play Bethesda's hit new Indiana Jones game</a> is "as much a production decision as it is anything else".
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-developers-super-thrilled-its-headed-to-playstation">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-tech-review">which by all accounts is excellent</a> - is out now on PC and Xbox, including via Game Pass.  A Playstation 5 launch was publicly confirmed back in August, though won't actually arrive until the spring of 2025.
</p>
<p>
So, why the wait? Was six months not enough time to get a PS5 version running well enough? Or was the decision purely business related - that, this side of Christmas, it was an advantage to still keep Indy off Xbox's main console competition?

<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-preview-video-game-plot-details-1236233902/">Variety</a>, Booty began by reiterating a line we've heard from Xbox chief <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> previous - that every game's launch on PlayStation or Nintendo consoles is an individual decision.
</p>
<p>
"We are very much making the [exclusivity and windowing] decisions on a game by game basis," Booty said. "And each of our studios is in a little bit of a different position."
</p>
<p>
For Indiana Jones, Booty suggested the extra time taken to launch the PS5 version was designed to ensure its original release for Xbox arrived as a "great experience".
</p>
<p>
"There's also the production timeline on a game, so the decision on spacing comes there first," Booty continued. "We want to make sure there's a great experience for our Xbox players, and then the gap between [when it becomes available on PlayStation] is as much a production decision as it is anything else."
</p>
<p>
That said, Booty did finish by noting Indiana Jones was "a game that was in production before we acquired Bethesda, even", which is an interesting point to raise. Was it not in development for PS5 back then?
</p>
<p>
Back in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-hasnt-pulled-any-games-from-playstation-following-redfall-ps5-reports">Microsoft said it hadn't "pulled any games from PlayStation"</a> after a kerfuffle over comments from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/redfall">Redfall</a> game designer Harvey Smith, who said Microsoft's stance on Redfall's development was "no PlayStation 5" after its takeover.
</p>
<p>
Of course, this was in the era before Xbox multi-platform publishing was as much of a thing - a stance that only shifted earlier this year when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-just-topped-europes-ps5-download-charts">Sea of Thieves, Grounded, Hi-Fi Rush and Pentiment</a> arrived on Nintendo and Sony platforms.
</p>
<p>
So, which Xbox franchise joins PlayStation next?
</p>
<p>
"Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones, The Great Circle is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Eurogamer's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review</a>.

            <p>FromSoftware's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> expansion Shadow of the Erdtree won't be eligible for BAFTA's Best Game award, as it's reserved for full games only.</p>
<p>There's been plenty of debate around whether expansions should be considered award-worthy, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/expansion-packs-new-game-seasons-dlcs-remakes-and-remasters-are-eligible-for-this-years-the-game-awards">The Game Awards in particular noting they are eligible</a>.</p>
<p>BAFTA has taken a different approach, though, confirming to Eurogamer its Best Game award is only for full games, but DLC and other updates are part of the consideration in the Evolving Game category.</p>

<p>"Our Best Game category specifically recognises full games which have released for the first time in the past year," a BAFTA spokesperson told Eurogamer. "DLC, along with other updates and enhancements made to games originally released before 25th November 2023, are part of the consideration in our Evolving Game category."</p>
<p>The news comes as <a href="https://www.bafta.org/stories/best-video-games-2024">BAFTA releases its longlist</a> of nominated games for next year's awards ceremony, with 58 games on the list up for 17 awards.</p>
<p>All games on the list were released between 25th November 2023 and 15th November 2024. Remasters are not eligible for consideration; full remakes are eligible only in craft categories.</p>
<p>DLC is eligible as part of the Evolving Game category and certain craft categories.</p>
<p>It's a noteworthy choice, considering this week's The Game Awards has Shadow of the Erdtree nominated in multiple categories, including Game of the Year. The Game Awards did clarify to Eurogamer there has been no specific change in rules this year, though the public announcement of DLC eligibility was only recently added to its website.</p><p>Shadow of the Erdtree is currently a finalist in the public-voted Players' Voice award, against <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuthering-waves-tier-list-best-characters-9436">Wuthering Waves</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenless-zone-zero-tier-list-best-characters">Zenless Zone Zero</a>. Many comments have noted the prevalence of ongoing gacha games and a DLC dominating the category.</p>

<p>BAFTA will avoid this. From its longlist, 10 are up for Best Game: Animal Well, Astro Bot, Balatro, Black Myth: Wukong, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Helldivers 2, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Metaphor: ReFantazio, Thank Goodness You're Here!, and Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2.</p>
<p>"The BAFTA Games Awards longlist is our opportunity to celebrate a wide range of outstanding games ahead of the BAFTA nominations on 4th March next year," said Tara Saunders, chair of BAFTA's Games committee. "Today we're shining a light on 58 games, as voted for by our wonderful BAFTA members - 1300 industry professionals whose work brings games to life."</p>
<p>Baldur's Gate 3 was the big winner from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-takes-home-best-game-and-four-more-awards-at-this-years-baftas">last year's BAFTA Game Awards</a>. Cyberpunk 2077 won the award for Evolving Game, thanks in part to its Phantom Liberty expansion.</p>
<p>Eurogamer will of course have its own Game of the Year list shortly, in which DLC and expansions will likewise not be eligible. Sorry folks!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
