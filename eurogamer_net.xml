            <p>
Apple is appealing the €500m (£429m) fine it received from the European Union in April over the restrictions it places on app developers wishing to use alternative purchase methods, insisting the punitive measure is "far beyond what the law requires".
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-slapped-by-500m-eu-fine-for-app-store-practices-that-deter-alternative-payments-third-party-stores">European Union hit Apple with the fine</a> after accusing the company of violating its Digital Markets Act (DMA), a <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en">piece of legislation</a> intended to ensure major tech platforms behave fairly and in a way that doesn't stifle competition. Specifically, the EU had taken issue with Apple's "anti-steering" practices, which restrict iOS app developers' ability to link to alternative purchase methods away from its own App Store, where it takes a 30 percent cut.
</p>
<p>
At the time the fine was announced, the European Commission (the EU's executive branch) said the restrictions Apple imposed on app developers meant they weren't able to "fully benefit from the advantages of alternative distribution channels outside the App Store", while customers were similarly unable to "benefit from alternative and cheaper offers as Apple prevents app developers from directly informing consumers of such offers". Apple was then given 60 days to "remove the technical and commercial restrictions on steering and to refrain from perpetuating the non-compliant conduct in the future", or it would face further fines.
</p>
<p>
Apple responded by claiming it was being "unfairly targeting" by the EU, and that the measures it was being asked to implement were "bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free." It also promised to appeal the fine.
</p>
<p>
And that appeal is now underway. As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/07/apple-appeals-eu-fine-app-store">reported by The Guardian</a>, Apple called the €500m fine "unprecedented" in a statement announcing its appeal to the EU's general court today, insisting it goes "far beyond what the law requires." The company added its appeal will demonstrate the European Commission is "mandating how we run our store and forcing business terms which are confusing for developers and bad for users." Apple reportedly also accused the commission of unlawfully expanding the definition of steering to include the ability for developers to promote offers inside an app, in addition to being able to link to an external website.
</p>
<p>
Apple (which also <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/ga/ip_24_1161">recieved a €2bn EU fine in March</a> for its "abusive" App Store rules) overhauled its App Store guidelines last month in a bid to curtail further action by the EU, introducing two new commission tiers for in-app purchases. At Tier 1, Apple will take a five percent commission, while only providing basic App Store features to developers, including app reviews and privacy labels. The likes of automatic app updates and automatic app downloads are not included. Tier 2, meanwhile, is the default tier and offers access to all App Store services for a 13 percent commission on in-app purchases.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, from 1st January next year, Apple is introducing a new Core Technology Commission of five percent on all digital goods and services sold on the App Store and alternative marketplaces. This replaces the company's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-returning-to-ios-says-epic-as-apple-agrees-to-alternative-app-marketplaces-in-eu">earlier, controversial Core Technology Fee</a>, which the EU also criticised in March, saying it "disinsentivised" App Store developers from using alternative app distribution channels and "failed to comply" with Apple's obligations.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, European Commission tech boss Henna Virkkunen said the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-tech-tariffs-us-brussels-trade-commissioner-maros-sefovic/">EU wasn't prepared to negotiate on the rules</a> outlined in its Digital Markets Act, Digital Services Act, and AI Act, despite pushback from the Trump administration and US tech companies.

            <p>Fans eager to hear more about the next <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider game</a> are still being kept rather in the dark, with Lara Croft popping up in a number of other game collaborations instead of her own standalone adventure.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a> wrapped back in 2018, Lara has appeared in the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-animated-tomb-raider-series-is-returning-for-season-2-and-laras-teaming-up-with-an-old-pal">Netflix's animated series</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.brawlhalla.com/news/lara-croft-joins-brawlhalla-patch-3-57">Brawlhalla</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-dutys-lara-croft-mixes-classic-and-reboot-tomb-raider-designs">Call of Duty</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raiders-lara-croft-coming-to-dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lara-croft-coming-to-in-magic-the-gathering-as-a-mechanically-unique-card">Magic the Gathering</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lara-croft-tumbles-into-fall-guys-with-tomb-raider-crossover">Fall Guys</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLFpqOJIdTN/?igsh=a3U0NHFzNDR1dW4x">Pinball FX</a>, and now even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-tanks">World of Tanks</a> as a part of a themed Battle Pass chapter. She's <a href="https://worldoftanks.eu/en/news/general-news/battle-pass-special-july-2025/">again being voiced by Keeley Hawes here</a>, in my opinion the best Lara.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lBQNNFi1AQ">new trailer for World of Tanks</a>, which you can see below, does give Tomb Raider fans like myself another look at Lara's unified design. As a reminder, the Tomb Raider team has said it will be uniting the original Tomb Raider games with the recent 'Survivor' trilogy reboots - which began in 2013 - in its next mainline game.</p>

<p>Lara's look in World of Tanks reflects this unification. Her style in the latest Tomb Raider collaboration takes most of its inspiration from the 'Classic Lara' look of old, with her tank top and braid taking pride of place, but she also has her jade necklace from the last three mainline games.</p>
<p>As well as Lara, Jonah from the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy is featured, as is - somewhat to my surprise - Amanda Evert. Amanda first cropped up in Tomb Raider Legend as a former friend turned antagonist of Lara's. Her look in World of Tanks is perhaps most different from her original design, with the goth aesthetic toned down quite significantly. Personally, I have questions about why she is there at all, given her timeline is the Legend Timeline, which is the second game timeline in the Tomb Raider series.</p>
<p>But this question aside, as a fan of Tomb Raider <em>games</em> rather than Tomb Raider collaborations, I really do wish we were being fed more than just Lara Croft in other franchises. I understand the need to keep the character relevant, but at this rate Lara is at risk of being featured more in games that aren't Tomb Raider than games that are. Truth be told, I am becoming increasingly frustrated by the comparative silence around <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-announces-next-tomb-raider-game-made-in-unreal-engine-5">the next mainline Tomb Raider game</a>.</p>

<p>In 2022, Amazon said it would provide its "full support" to Crystal Dynamics, as it works on "the biggest, most expansive" series entry to date. Then, in August last year, Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-huge-huge-task-but-things-are-going-well">development on the upcoming Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon was "going well"</a>. Since then, however, developer Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-announces-layoffs">has been subject to layoffs</a>, and nothing more has been officially said of the next Tomb Raider entry for some time.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Embracer alluded to a AAA release on its docket, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-plans-to-release-76-different-games-in-the-next-year-despite-previous-layoffs-and-studio-closures">the company previously expected to debut in FY 25/26 but will "likely need a few more quarters to polish"</a>. Therefore, this particular game will likely release the following fiscal year. While Embracer did not specify which game under its umbrella it was talking about, I suspect it was Tomb Raider.</p>
<p>I really hope the Tomb Raider series can continue on successfully without the need to pimp Lara out to other franchises every couple of months. But right now, I am not too sure.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/lara-croft-is-popping-up-everywhere-except-in-a-new-tomb-raider-game]]></content:encoded>
