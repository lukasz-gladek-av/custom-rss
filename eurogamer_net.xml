<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> developer Rocksteady has quietly suffered another round of layoffs, this time just before the end of 2024.
</p>
<p>
Half a dozen staff impacted by the redundancies have spoken to Eurogamer to confirm the job losses, under condition of anonymity to protect their careers. 
</p>
<p>
Roles impacted include members of Rocksteady's programming and artist teams, as well as more QA staff. 
</p>
<p>
The job losses follow an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms">earlier round of redundancies at Rocksteady that Eurogamer first reported back in September</a>, when the company's QA team was nearly halved in size from 33 to 15 people. One staff member made redundant at the time said they had discovered they'd lost their job in the middle of their paternity leave.

<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Warner Bros. for comment on this latest round of layoffs, but has so far not received a response. The publisher previously did not publicly acknowledge September's layoffs, either.
</p>
<p>
2024 was a difficult year for Rocksteady, as the company continued to support Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League with the remainder of its post-launch content schedule despite low player numbers.
</p>
<p>
Warner Bros. previously said it had lost around $200m (Â£160m) on the game. Currently, it's unclear what Rocksteady will work on next.
</p>
<p>
In early December, the developer acknowledged <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deathstroke-kicks-off-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-final-announced-season">it would not continue updating Suicide Squad with any new content in 2025</a>, though servers will remain online for the forseeable future.
</p>
<p>
The commercial failure of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has seen staff lose jobs on the other side of the pond, also. December also saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gotham-knights-developer-warner-bros-games-montreal-slashes-99-jobs">job losses at Batman: Arkham Origins and Gotham Knights studio Warner Bros. Games Montreal,</a> where 99 jobs were reportedly eliminated. The majority of these positions are believed to have been supporting Rocksteady with additional content for Suicide Squad.

            <p>Horses - the cursed horror game from Saturnalia developer Santa Ragione and directed by Andrea Lucco Borlera - is still coming, it is just taking a little longer to get out of the gates than first anticipated.</p>
<p>Horses sees players take on the role of a summer worker at a farm. This sounds safe enough, and after all, it's only for two weeks - but there is something much darker and downright unsettling lying beneath the surface.</p>
<p>"Will you survive the summer, or will the farm claim yet another victim? In any case, we're sure your summer working experience will be truly unforgettable..." reads the official blurb.</p>

<p>Horses was initially announced back in 2023, with a suitably unsettling trailer which showed off the game's silent movie-like style and a host of naked humans with horse masks on their heads. At this time, it was slated for a release in 2024 which, obviously, has been missed.</p>
<p>Thankfully though, Horses has not been silently cancelled. Santa Ragione has confirmed to Eurogamer the upcoming game will now be released this year, and a demo is also on the cards.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately we had to delay the game to 2025," studio director Pietro Righi Riva told me. "[We're] not ready to talk about the reasons for the delay yet, but will absolutely keep you posted. By end of Q2 2025 we'll have a date for both the demo and the full release of the game."</p>
<p>So, stay tuned for more information on Horses soon.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-indie-preview-special-edition">Chris had a go with Horses last year</a>, calling it "magnetically sinister" following time with the game.</p>
<p>"It's a simpler thing in practise than some of Santa Ragione's previous games - effectively you are waking up and slowly carrying out simple, if escalating strange tasks each day, like watering plants, feeding the dog, or, erm, burying bodies, as a story takes shape around you - but the magic here is in the atmosphere and tone," he wrote.</p>
<p>"It's also a rare attempt at using actual, suspended meaning in a game. You'll need to bring something of your own to the farmhouse table here, and meet this thing halfway."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> creator Gareth Damian Martin has said their warm-hearted series of sci-fi video games will end with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</a>, which releases 31st January. However, Citizen Sleeper as a series of games won't necessarily end there.</p>
<p>The intention, as Damian Martin laid it out to me in a recent interview, is to create a full tabletop role-playing version of the game, and thereby handover future adventures in the series to the TTRPG space that has so inspired it.</p>

<p>Responding to whether that would be it for Citizen Sleeper games after the sequel, Damian Martin replied: "I think it is for video games. I'll leave myself a backdoor somewhere that I can climb through and dig it out the grave again... But no. I think especially the ending - and I hope people feel this when they reach the ending - I really felt like, okay, this is me saying the final word on it. I really like where I'm leaving it. I'm really happy with that.</p><p>"But Citizen Sleeper has meant a lot to a lot of people and so I'm not about to leave that behind," they added. "The next big project for me will be to work on a Citizen Sleeper tabletop game in full, but I need to find the right collaborator and I need to work that out, and I need to do that alongside other stuff. So that's something that will be a more long-term project."</p>
<p>Martin has collaborated on tabletop projects before. Their game <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lonearchivist/iow-tidebreak">In Other Waters was adapted for tabletop via a collaboration with Lone Archivist</a>, and <a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/cyclesoftheeye">Citizen Sleeper was adapted into a solo, tarot-based tabletop game</a> with Alfred Valley's help, so there's a strong precedent there.</p>
<p>The video game Damian Martin will make next is actually the game they were pitching to their publisher Fellow Traveller before development on Citizen Sleeper 2 began. It was only the runaway success of Citizen Sleeper 1 - now at one million players and counting - that derailed those plans, turning Martin's head towards add-on content and, eventually, a sequel.</p>
<p>"I was actually already pitching my next game, which was not Citizen Sleeper 2, to my publisher," they said. "That's actually going to be the next game."</p>

<p>Citizen Sleeper 2 arrives to much anticipation on 31st January. Demos have already given us a glimpse of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-2-goes-even-harder-on-its-rpg-roots-with-its-bold-new-twists-on-its-tabletop-dice-rolls">a game that's quite different from Citizen Sleeper 1</a>, with a much stronger sense of tension in it and more developed, and distinct, role-playing systems. The changes work brilliantly; this could be special.</p><p>The development cycle, however, hasn't been easy. Personal challenges, as well as the pressure of living up to expectations, have made life difficult, as I discovered speaking with Damian Martin. Success, as much as we court it, can be hard to deal with.</p>
<p>Look out for my full Citizen Sleeper interview soon.</p>
