            <p>Netflix's Assassin's Creed adaptation - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-announces-assassins-creed-live-action-series">which was first announced in 2020</a> - is finally moving forward.</p>
<p>The long-in-the-works adaptation based on Ubisoft's games is being helmed by Roberto Patino (DMZ, Westworld, Sons of Anarchy) and David Wiener (Halo, Homecoming, The Killing), who will serve as creators, showrunners, and executive producers on the show.</p>

<p>"We've been fans of Assassin's Creed since its release in 2007," Wiener and Patino told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-1236463572/">Variety</a>. "Every day we work on this show, we come away excited and humbled by the possibilities that Assassin's Creed opens to us. Beneath the scope, the spectacle, the parkour and the thrills is a baseline for the most essential kind of human story - about people searching for purpose, struggling with questions of identity and destiny and faith."</p>
<p>Continuing, the duo said Assassin's Creed is "about power and violence and sex and greed and vengeance", but above all that "this is a show about the value of human connection, across cultures, across time" and "what we stand to lose as a species, when those connections break".</p>
<p>Said Wiener and Patino: "We've got an amazing team behind us with the folks at Ubisoft and our champions at Netflix, and we're committed to creating something undeniable for fans all over the planet."</p>
<p>According to the official blurb for Netflix's take on Assassin's Creed, the series will be "centered on the secret war between two shadowy factions - one set on determining mankind's future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will. The series follows its characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny". That all sounds suitably Assassin's Creed-y.</p>
<p>In addition to Wiener and Patino, Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin and Austin Dill of Ubisoft Film and Television will serve as executive producers for the Assassin's Creed series along with Matt O'Toole.</p>
<p>"We are so excited to work alongside Roberto, David, and our Netflix partners to bring this beloved franchise to series," said Boykin. "We look forward to delivering an experience that speaks to the heart of what fans love about Assassin's Creed, while introducing its unforgettable worlds and timeless themes to new audiences worldwide."</p>

<p>Once upon a time, Die Hard writer Jeb Stuart was attached to Netflix's Assassin's Creed project. However, in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-assassins-creed-adaptation-loses-die-hard-writer-jeb-stuart">Stuart stepped away from the series due to differing visions between himself and the show's executives</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-anime-announced-by-netflix-castlevania-creator">Assassin's Creed anime was announced by Netflix in 2017</a> from Adi Shankar, creator of the popular Castlevania animated series.

            <p>
Silent Hill and Siren creator Keiichi Toyama has confirmed he and his team at Bokeh Game Studios is working it's next project, and it won't be a sequel to horror oddity Slitterhead.
</p>
<p>
Toyama shared the news in an <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202507/47230">interview with Famitsu</a> (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/silent-hill-creator-keiichiro-toyama-is-already-working-on-his-next-game-and-its-not-a-slitterhead-sequel/">Automaton</a>). "I can't reveal the exact details," he explained, "but we have started working on our next title... Once again, we have to pour in all our efforts as a studio and prove that we are up to the task... However, we're still in the beginning phase, so I believe we'll be able to reveal more details [about the new project] somewhere in the future."
</p>
<p>
One thing the new game won't be, however, is a sequel to last year's Slitterhead. The idiosyncratic, horror-tinged action-adventure launched to a mixed critical reception, and Toyama admitted to Famitsu the team had been aiming for a lot more sales than it eventually received. And, while he acknowledged its "cult favourite" status, he also speculated its reception might ultimately have been down to confusion over whether it was supposed to be a horror or action game.

<p>
Commercial success isn't the team's only goal, Toyama stressed, and it remains determined to take on new challenges. That's despite personal concerns around his advancing age. "As for how long we'll be able to continue," he explained, "it becomes a difficult topic especially if we take my age into consideration. However, I believe that moving forward, I also have to pass the baton to the next generation. As a studio, we're still midway to reaching our goal."
</p>
<p>
Toyama isn't the only renowned developer to publicly ponder their age in recent years, of course. In January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-ponders-advancing-age-and-how-long-he-can-stay-creative-as-death-stranding-studio-enters-crunch">wrote</a> he "[couldn't] help but think about how much longer I'll be able to stay 'creative'", adding: "Every day feels like I'm racing against the clock." And speaking to The Guardian in 2023, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/dec/30/nintendo-shigeru-miyamoto-interview-mario-zelda-switch-pikmin-splatoon">Shigeru Miyamoto joked</a>: "More so than retiring, I'm thinking about the day I fall over... In this day and age you have to think about things in a five-year timespan, so I do think about who I can pass things on to, in case something does happen."
</p>
<p>
Back to Toyama, Eurogamer contributor Vikki Blake was won over by the "singular and unapologetically strange" Slitterhead in her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slitterhead-review">four star review last year</a>, so it'll certainly be interesting to see what Bokeh does next.
