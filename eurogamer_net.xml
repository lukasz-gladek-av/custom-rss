            <p>Resident Evil Requiem's dual protagonists will represent two styles of gameplay, which its developers describe as like "jumping into a cold bath after a hot sauna".</p>
<p>At last night's The Game Awards, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprising-absolutely-no-one-leon-s-kennedy-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-in-new-gameplay-trailer">Capcom revealed Leon Kennedy will indeed be playable</a> in the next mainline entry of the horror series, after plenty of fan speculation and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-leak-confirms-leon-will-be-in-resident-evil-requiem-after-all">leak earlier in the week</a>. Since then, director Akifumi Nakanishi and producer Masato Kumazawa have shed more light on how the dual protagonists will differ.</p>
<p>"Grace is 'the biggest scaredy-cat in Resident Evil history'," Nakanishi told <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-dual-protagonist-system-will-be-like-repeatedly-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna-we-ask-the-devs-about-leons-role-and-re4-style/">Automaton</a>, while "Leon is a seasoned veteran, so seeing how those personalities interact is part of the fun."</p>

<p>He also confirmed the two characters are "almost equally split", with a similar structure to 3DS game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-revelations">Resident Evil Revelations</a>.</p>
<p>"I've said before that Leon isn't well suited to horror," said Nakanishi. "Since quiet sections where you cower before monsters don't fit him, his chapters focus on intense, adrenaline-pumping action. Grace's sections, on the other hand, are the scarier ones. We're really emphasising the difference in their experiences this time."</p><p>He continued: "It's almost like having two games with completely different types of tension mixed together. Early on, we worried players might not be able to keep up, but now we feel that the contrast gives the game a unique rhythm, like jumping into a cold bath after sitting in a hot sauna. It was important to combine the slow and fast segments well, and Grace and Leon turned out to be the best combination for that. Leon also has lots of new actions, giving you a strong sense of release compared to Grace's sequences."</p>
<p>As such, Grace's sections resemble <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a>, while Leon's will be closer to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>. After all, these are arguably the two most popular games in the series.</p>
<p>Confirmation of the two characters and their differing gameplay styles also speaks to the "tension and release throughout the game" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-requiems-director-explains-how-in-one-crucial-way-it-is-the-most-extreme-title-in-the-series-yet">Nakanishi previously told Eurogamer</a>. "That's something that I think Resident Evil is really unique with among horror games," he said. "We don't just scare you - we offer you a chance to release that tension by overcoming it all."</p>
<p>Nakanishi also spoke to Automaton of Leon's design, who's been refined into an 'ikeoji' - slang for a cool and attractive older man. "There are plenty of Leon fans inside the company too, after all," said Kumazawa.</p>
<p>Added Nakanishi: "Also, this is Leon's first return to Raccoon City since Resident Evil 2, so seeing how he responds to the 'place where it all began' now that he's older is another major point of interest."</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem will be released next year on 27th February across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> and Steam. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-re-engine-resi-switch-2">Resident Evil 7 and Village will also be coming to Nintendo's console</a>.</p>

            <p>UK trade union Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has responded once again in the continuing war of words with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> developer Rockstar, this time describing the studio's latest statement, on its controversial firing of 34 employees, as an attempt to "reverse engineer a rationale for the dismissals."</p>
<p>The IWGB's statement comes after several back-and-forth claims between the two parties. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-developer-rockstar-is-still-insisting-its-controversial-firing-of-employees-had-nothing-to-do-with-unions">Rockstar's own, most recent response</a>, issued yesterday, saw the studio claim the employees in question had "distributed and discussed confidential information (including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles) in a public forum, in breach of company policy and their legal obligations," and that "claims that these dismissals were linked to union membership or activities are entirely false and misleading."</p>
<p>That in turn came<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-rockstar-games-staff-were-fired-for-sharing-internal-company-messages-on-an-employee-and-union-only-discord-server-new-report-suggests"> after a report from People Make Games in late November</a>, which claimed the workers were fired for conversations which took place on an invite-only Discord server for employees and IWGB union members. Most conversations held there were focused on salaries, bonuses, and other HR issues, the report said - topics protected by the Equality Act of 2010 and relevant to the union members.</p>
<p>The employees were initially fired for what Rockstar called "gross misconduct", before it was then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">accused of union busting</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff">subjected to a lawsuit from the IWGB</a>.</p>
<p>The IWGB's latest full response reads:</p>
<blockquote>"Rockstar's latest statement is littered with falsehoods and disinformation - they have given multiple, conflicting reasons to explain why the workers were fired, as if attempting to reverse engineer a rationale for the dismissals. Once again, they have chosen to mischaracterise workers speaking about their working conditions in a private forum as "leaking information". It is hard to understand this statement as anything but a desperate attempt to deflect from the global scrutiny they have come under over the last month. From the UK Prime Minister in the House of Commons, to the game developers across the world erupting in protest - all eyes are on Rockstar and their lawless attack on the people who make them their billions."</blockquote>
<p>The likely trigger for this statement from Rockstar - which had previously refused to comment on the People Make Games report - and the ensuing IWGB response is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-developer-rockstars-firing-of-union-staff-deeply-concerning-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer mentioning the situation in parliament</a> earlier this week. There, he called the firing of Rockstar's employees "deeply concerning" and promised MPs would look into it.</p><p>"Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we're determined to strengthen workers rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union," Starmer said. It was the second time the issue had come up in UK parliament, after it was raised by Christine Jardine, Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for Edinburgh West, back in November.</p>
<p>Notably, the UK's Labour government had made workers rights a key part of its election manifesto, and is currently aiming to push its flagship employment rights bill through the House of Lords. That context places an additional spotlight on Rockstar, while in the last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-workers-europe-fight-back-against-exploitation-ai-layoffs-historic-milestone-union-efforts">protests have taken place both in the UK and abroad in support of the fired Rockstar staff</a>.</p>
