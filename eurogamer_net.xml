            <p>When 2025 wrapped up, Obsidian's open-world fantasy RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Avowed</a> had been overlooked on many end-of-year lists. Despite garnering <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/avowed/">favourable reviews</a> overall and delivering a type of Elder Scrolls-inspired experience that stands on its own, it wasn't a massive hit. Later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outer-worlds-2-review">The Outer Worlds 2</a> landed with similar results. Meanwhile, the mostly continuist survival crafting adventure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-2-wobbles-while-walking-a-line-between-frustration-and-brilliance">Grounded 2</a> was enjoying lots of success.</p>
<p>According to Feargus Urquhart, head of Obsidian Entertainment, a lot can be learned from the studio's busy 2025 and the end results. Jason Schreier's latest for <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/xbox-studio-behind-grounded-outer-worlds-is-charting-new-path">Bloomberg</a> reveals what him and other prominent figures at the company have to say. About last year's RPG behemoths, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, the veteran openly explained: "They're not disasters... I'm not going to say this was a kick in the teeth. It was more like: 'That sucks. What are we learning?'"</p>
<p>Of course, there's an immediate read to be made after two triple-A giants failed to meet their targets and a scrappy, still-in-early-access survival crafting game landed Obsidian a big win. Urquhart says this situation has pushed the studio to "think a lot about how much we put into the games, how much we spend on them, how long they take." In the case of Avowed, the game ended up taking "nearly seven years" to put together, with a reboot to pivot away from making a mix of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny">Destiny</a> (multiplayer included) happening two years into the creative process. "I don't think there’s a team on the planet that could execute on this," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> director Josh Sawyer stated.</p>
<p>While the press and gamers alike have been saying for a while the Western games industry should course-correct back into a more sustainable model, that kind of huge change doesn't happen overnight, especially if those at the top want bigger returns. "I don't think anybody really likes five-, six-, seven-year dev cycles," added Brandon Adler, director of The Outer Worlds 2. I'm now thinking about Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-6">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> for no reason.</p>

<p>In spite of everything, Obsidian, has managed (so far) to succeed where many have failed under the scrutiny of Microsoft's Xbox division... which is also under pressure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-push-for-high-xbox-profit-margins-behind-job-cuts-publishing-on-playstation-and-cancellation-of-projects-like-perfect-dark-claims-report">as the tech giant demands better profit margins</a>. The trick might be a good cadence of releases since the acquisition happened back in late 2018. With easy wins on a budget like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pentiment-review-a-sixteenth-century-mystery-that-blossoms-with-intrigue-and-human-warmth">Pentiment</a> or the two Grounded games, it's easy to offset the bigger disappointments. "You need to keep having at-bats, because at some point, if you can consistently make good stuff, you'll get those breakout hits," said Marcus Morgan, VP of Operations at Obsidian.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/xbox-studio-behind-grounded-outer-worlds-is-charting-new-path">full piece</a> is well worth a read and shines some light on Obsidian's past, present, and future. It's hard to predict what might be next for its veteran teams, but personally, I'd say news about a more realistic vision for the RPG maker are encouraging.</p>

            <p>Funcom has released Chapter 3 for Dune Awakening today, bringing with it a host of new experiences and gameplay overhauls for players to enjoy. But can this update, described as the "biggest" the game has ever seen, reignite the excitement seen around it's launch?</p>
<p>Let's dive into what's been added to the game with Chapter 3. There's an increase on faction levels, allowing those who complete missions with their chosen faction to gain additional levels. The Landsraad endgame has been revamped too, allowing players to choose a Great House to complete missions for, which should invigorate the system somewhat.</p>
<p>There's also a specialisation system added to the game. Earning XP progresses you through a chosen specialisation, allowing players to pick a playstyle and dedicate themselves to it. Explorers can choose a path and be rewarded with unlocks that better serve that playstyle, such as traits and technologies.</p>

<p>These technologies include augmentations, which can be added to tier 6 armour to increase their power further. Schematics for these can be found in new Testing Stations added to the game, and augmented gear can be freely traded among players to encourage more interaction between players pursuing different progression paths, though some work on the crafting specialisation is needed to make these.</p><p>There are also new missions to complete, new locations on the Overland map, a removal of water and fuel requirements when traveling across the Overland map, and five new challenge locations for players to test their mettle and progress through Landsraad challenges. There are also five new Testing Stations to explore, and a new major story chapter for narrative-focused players to dive into.</p>
<p>As for combat, two new weapons have been added: the Pyrorocket and dual-wielded knives. The rapier, an original weapon type, has also been totally reworked with new attacks and defensive abilities.</p>
<p>Finally, for those who lapsed from the game and found their base taxed to ruins, these base taxes have been totally removed. Power requirements for bases are still required to maintain your digital home-away-from-home, but the money drain is no longer an issue. A new suite of cosmetics rewards have been added, as well as a returning player package to help people get back into the swing of things.</p>
<p>Finally, the deep desert has been changed once again. The shield wall has been moved further up to make those initial segments safer to explore, and ramps have been added to make ground vehicle travel more tenable.</p>
<p>Is this enough to tempt you back into Dune Awakening? Let us know!</p>

            <p>Amazon really seems to be knocking it out of the park with the casting for its live-action God of War series.</p>
<p>It was recently announced that Alastair Duncan has been cast as the wise Mimir, whose head Kratos often wears around his waist. If you think Duncan's name sounds familiar, that's because he also voiced Mimir in 2018's God of War and its sequel, Ragnarök.</p>

</span> </p>
</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>As well as Duncan, actors Danny Woodburn and Jeff Gulka have been cast as God of War's talented blacksmith brothers, Brok and Sindri.</p>
<p>Woodburn is a veteran actor with a track record of appearing in numerous fantasy series, such as Conan the Adventurer, The Witcher, Charmed and Willow. If you're a Seinfeld fan, however, you likely know him best as the recurring character Mickey Abbott. Gulka, meanwhile, starred as Gibson Praise on The X-Files and as Charlie in Stargate-SG1, to name just two.</p>
<p>You can read the character descriptions for Mimir, Sindri and Brok (thanks, <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/god-of-war-series-alastair-duncan-mimir-brok-sindri-1236645903/">Variety</a>) below:</p>
<p><strong>Mimir:</strong> Mimir is a cheery fellow from Celtic lands with an expansive intellect, a quick wit and a good head on his shoulders. Never at a loss for words, Mimir is the self-described "Smartest Man in the World". He served as an advisor to Odin the All-Father, who ultimately banished Mimir to confinement in the trunk of a tree, forever cut off from the people he loves and anything that could nourish his mind. In the wake of his banishment, Mimir seeks atonement for the terrible deeds he committed in the All-Father's name.</p><p><strong>Brok:</strong> Brok is a legendary dwarven blacksmith who was alienated from his community when he helped build a super-weapon. He is brash, irreverent, and gruff – the complete opposite of his uptight brother and fellow blacksmith, Sindri, with whom he has a contentious relationship. Gamers will know Brok as the beloved weapons dealer with an unrivaled artistry for creative, foul-mouthed curses.</p>
<p><strong>Sindri:</strong> Sindri is a renowned dwarven blacksmith whose incredible weaponry is sought after across the realms. Neurotic, helpful, and extremely germophobic, Sindri is the complete opposite of his cranky, foul-mouthed brother and business partner, Brok.</p>

            <p>As good as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>' first 2026 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-shares-early-2026-roadmap-escalation-content-updates">roadmap</a> looks, one of the latest crazes in the online extraction shooter has nothing to do with hunting down other players or banding together against the oppressive robotic threat. People are collecting rubber ducks, <em>lots of them</em>.</p>
<p>Why focus on meaningless rubber loot over everything else? Let me preface this by saying everyone loves to find an excellent gun or blueprint, but upgraded stashes have a fun side effect which is that you can show off your favourite loot <a href="https://deltiasgaming.com/arc-raiders-how-to-customise-your-raider-den/">in the raider's room</a>. Embark Studios has also added <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/arc-raiders/Duck_Locations:_Bird_City_Guide">collectible rubber ducks that you can find all over</a>, making them the perfect collectibles. It reminds me of the short period when <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/splatoon/comments/xbaqik/people_really_like_the_moai_head_huh/">everyone was putting moais inside their lockers in Splatoon 3</a>. Hilarious stuff.</p>
<p>You know an online game has <em>the juice</em> when players start wholesome trends like these and don't spend all their time optimizing the fun out of it. Embark appears to aware of this saga, so <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2018656701893738739?s=20">Arc Raiders' latest update</a>, pushed on 3rd February, makes the Bird City map condition for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/arc-raiders/Buried_City">Buried City</a> more common.</p>
<p>What does this mean exactly and how does it connect to the coveted rubber birds? Well, the new map condition dropped after the Cold Snap event which covered Speranza in snow. As part of the return to normalcy, birds are flocking back to the Buried City, and you can often queue into the Bird City version of it, which has more feathered animals and boosted loot rates; look for nests on top of chimneys too.</p><p>Birds (the real ones) aren't your friends though. Like in other open-world games with strong stealth elements, they'll fly away in large groups when approached and in response to loud noises. You can imagine why this is a problem in a game where everyone and everything on the surface can kill you in an instant.</p>
<p>Rubber ducks are part of the boosted loot during this map condition, however, so the new "for funsies" meta is raiding the Buried City over and over again to snatch all the different toys as if they were Arc Raiders' version of limited-edition Funko Pops... or Tubbz.</p>
<p>In any case, it's heartwarming to see players chasing anything other than endgame loot and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/are-you-a-little-too-good-at-arc-raiders-the-new-solo-vs-squad-mode-might-be-for-you">more high risk, high reward experiences</a> inside a game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-40-hours-and-counting-arc-raiders-has-me-convinced-extraction-shooters-are-brilliant">as tense as Arc Raiders</a>. Maybe we can take Scrappy the Rooster topside soon, too. Let's start pitching that.</p>
