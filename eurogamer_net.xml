            <p>Don't Nod - the studio behind the likes of Jusant, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> 1 and 2, and Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage - has revealed its next game.</p>
<p>It's known as Aphelion, and, in a change for the studio, will be Don't Nod's first human story in space. The developer promises a "powerful" experience on the game's 2026 release, across Xbox Series X/S, Steam, and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>"Set in a near-future where Earth is on the brink of collapse, Aphelion is an emotional journey to the edge of our Solar System to survey a planet that may be humanity's last hope," reads the official blurb. "As astronaut Ariane Montclair, crash landed on the newly discovered Persephone, players must brave harsh landscapes, master survival tools, and navigate reality-bending phenomena on a desperate mission to reunite with her wounded partner, Thomas Cross." You can check out a trailer below.</p>

<p>The game is being developed in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA), which will help ground Aphelion and its depiction of space exploration in "real scientific knowledge and humanistic values", Don't Nod has said.</p>
<p>"For fifty years, ESA has combined rigorous space science with the boundless imagination of science fiction to explore solutions to our planet's greatest challenges. Aphelion captures that spirit - where research meets imaginative vision - to inspire the next generation to carry Europe's space ambition into the future," said Nadia Lüders, ESA Partnership &amp; Brand Licensing Officer.</p>

            <p>
An extended look at Clockwork Revolution was shown at today's Xbox Games Showcase, which is "coming in due time".
</p>
<p>
The steampunk RPG shooter has already drawn comparison to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> games and in this new gameplay trailer we see plenty of gadgets and time-bending powers.
</p>
<p>
There's also a good look at its clockwork steampunk aesthetic, with plenty of humour too. Characters include "the pissed-off doll" and "the knob", among others.

<p>
The game is being developed by inXile Entertainment, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-saints-row-developers-join-clockwork-revolution-development">help from former Volition developers under the studio name Shapeshifter Games</a>. Volition - known for the Saints Row series - was closed in 2023 due to the poor performance of its most recent game.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date yet for Clockwork Revolution, though it'll be out on Game Pass from day one. It's coming to PC and Xbox Series X/S.

<p>
"In the past few years, we've been honoured to see how Planet of Lana has touched players worldwide, from its cinematic world to its heartwarming story and action-packed gameplay," said Adam Stjärnljus, creative director at developer Wishfully. 
</p>
<p>
"Our team learned a lot from creating the first game and we always knew that Lana and Mui's story wasn't over, so we've created a whole new adventure for players, packed with creative puzzle sequences and surprises around every corner. We can't wait for players to join our dynamic duo once again, and unravel the mysteries of Novo's world."
</p>
<p>
The sequel promises more clever puzzle solving, as well as refined stealth mechanics, new agility-challenging action sequences, and a profound sci-fi story.
</p>
<p>
The original Planet of Lana received a positive reaction on its release. "A beautifully crafted side-scroller with a restless puzzle imagination," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-of-lana-review-pace-poise-and-something-more">Planet of Lana review</a>.

            <p>
With its July arrival almost upon us, Activision has announced a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> demo, but it's a pre-order exclusive, making it very much the opposite of 'try before you buy'.
</p>
<p>
As we learned previously, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is a ground-up remake of the beloved skating games, and brings a range of "modern upgrades" - including "new skaters, gnarlier tricks, an even sicker soundtrack", alongside new parks (a water park, pinball table, and movie studio are confirmed), plus cross-platform online multiplayer for up to eight skaters.
</p>
<p>
Multiplayer includes the new HAWK mode, which sees players dropping letters in hard-to-find spots then racing to find as many as they can within the time limit. There's also the sandbox-y Free Skate mode, plus a range of different activities within the Competitive playlist: Trick Attack, Score Challenge, Combo Mambo, Combo Challenge, and Graffiti.

<p>
As for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4's expanded playable roster, it now includes Rayssa Leal, Chloe Covell, Zion Wright, Jamie Foy, Nora Vasconcellos, Margielyn Didal, Yuto Horigome, Zion Wright, Aurélien Giraud, and Andy Anderson. Additionally, there's an appearance from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle's Michelangelo, who arrives as an unlockable "secret" skater.
</p>
<p>
Actvision has also confirmed the return of Create-A-Skater, alongside an upgraded version Create-A-Park, which introduces new props - including speed boost pads and musical notes - and the ability to add custom goals. Players fond of documenting their skating highlights can also make use of a new photo mode.
</p>
<p>
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Switch, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a>, PC, and Game Pass when it launches on 11th July.
</p>
<p>
As for that demo, it's out today on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, and features the Foundry and College parks, skaters Tony Hawk and Rayssa Leal, plus a limited selection of songs. However, you'll need to pre-order the full game in order to access it.
