            <p>The GameChat function on Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> will include a couple of very welcome accessibility features to make it easier for players to communicate.</p>
<p>Both text-to-speech and live captions will be included, as shown in new videos on social media (thanks, OatmealDome).</p>
<p>The former means players will be able to type messages on a virtual keyboard which are then read by the system. The original Switch does support USB keyboards, but it's unconfirmed if the new console will too.</p>

<p>As for live captions, the console is able to transcribe speech into a chat box at the side of the screen during GameChat.</p>

GameChat supports text-to-speech. If enabled, you can type in text and the system will read it for you.

While not explicitly confirmed, USB keyboards should be supported too (the Switch 1 already supports them for text input).</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:tf7tjgkrqwai2kbxpx2dbr6k/post/3lpcewgnfao2p?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p></div>— OatmealDome (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:tf7tjgkrqwai2kbxpx2dbr6k?ref_src=embed">@oatmealdome.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:tf7tjgkrqwai2kbxpx2dbr6k/post/3lpcewgnfao2p?ref_src=embed">16 May 2025 at 16:49</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

            <p>Early access for Fantasy Life i on Xbox Series X/S version has been delayed.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://x.com/FANTASYLIFE_EN/status/1924089583471562809">dropping an unexpected head's up</a> about a possible delay earlier today, developer Level-5 has now confirmed that today's early launch on Xbox Series X/S will not go ahead as planned due to an "ongoing technical issue on Xbox's end".</p>

<p>"Early Access for the Xbox Series X|S version of Fantasy Life i, originally scheduled to begin at 3:00 PM GMT on May 18, has unfortunately been delayed due to an ongoing technical issue on Xbox's side," the developer said on social media. "As of now, the issue remains unresolved and players are still unable to play on Xbox platforms.</p>
<p>"We truly want players to dive into [Fantasy Life i] as soon as possible and it's incredibly frustrating for us that we cannot yet make that happen," the statement added. "We are continuing to work closely with the relevant teams to restore access as soon as possible, but are currently unable to provide a specific time for when Early Access will begin. We will share updates on this account and our official website as soon as we have more information."</p> <div>

<p>The team said it would be "reviewing possible measures to compensate for the delay" and will "share more" once details are confirmed. The statement closed on confirming the issue does not affect early access on Steam or PS4/5.</p>
<p>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time will launch for all players across PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S (hopefully), Switch, and PC via Steam on 21st May. We first got word of Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time during a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-1">Nintendo Direct in February 2023</a>. At the time of its announcement, the game was set to release in 2023, but it later saw its launch nudged back.</p>
<p>Away from Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/professor-laytons-new-adventure-turns-him-into-lukes-protege">Level-5 also has a new Professor Layton game in the pipeline</a>. It's known as New World of Steam and will place the Professor as something of a newcomer himself, in a story which moves the series' action to America.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Fall Guy director David Leitch is in talks to direct the movie adaptation of Gears of War.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/gears-of-war-movie-david-leitch-director-1236212544/">Hollywood Reporter</a>, Leitch is in negotiations to direct and produce the film with Kelly McCormick and their 87North production company in partnership with game developer, The Coalition. We already knew Jon Spaihts, whose Dune screenplay was nominated for an Oscar, is also on board as script writer.</p>

<p>Netflix did not comment on this latest development but has previously said this will be an adaptation of the Gears of War "video game saga", suggesting it'll be more faithful to the source material than Universal's stalled effort.</p>
<p>Netflix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-live-action-movie-and-animated-series-in-the-works-at-netflix">announced</a> it had acquired the rights to adapt Gear of War into a movie in November 2022, following earlier unsuccessful attempts by New Line Cinema to get a live-action adaptation off the ground. That version, first trumpeted in 2007, had abandoned all pretence of being set in the game's universe by 2019, when the project became permanently stuck in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-movie-is-still-go-gets-screenwriter">development hell</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-e-day-dev-the-coalition-drafts-in-people-can-fly-as-partner-studio">People Can Fly is working with The Coalition on the next Gears of War game, Gears of War: E-Day</a>. Late last year, we learned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-is-so-back-as-original-voice-talents-are-confirmed-for-gears-of-war-e-day">John DiMiaggio and Carlos Ferro are reprising their roles as Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago</a> in Gears of War: E-Day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-movie-could-be-picked-up-for-multiple-millions">bid numbers in the "multiple millions"</a> were reportedly on the table for the adaptation of EA's fan-favourite co-op adventure, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
