            <p>
Raf Grassetti - principal artist on 2018's God of War and, later, art director on its acclaimed sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> - has announced he's starting a "new chapter" at The Last of Us developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>, following the closure of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s "AAA" studio in October.
</p>
<p>
Grassetti joined Sony Santa Monica in 2013, rising through the ranks to become studio art director in 2022. However, he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-god-of-war-art-director-joins-halo-veterans-new-netflix-project">announced his departure</a> last May, revealing he'd joined Netflix Games to work on a new AAA title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-halo-infinite-creative-head-joseph-staten-joins-netflix-games">alongside Halo Infinite creative head Joseph Staten</a>, former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> executive producer Chacko Sonny, and ex-Coalition technical director Jerry Edsall.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, that project proved to be short-lived. Netflix announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-closes-aaa-internal-studio-led-by-halo-creative-head-joseph-staten">pulling the plug</a> on its development - and disbanding the studio - this October, without ever revealing what the team had been working on over the preceding 18 months.
</p>

<p>
Since then, it's been speculated Staten has rejoined Halo Studios, given the company closed its job listing for a creative director around the time of his Netflix departure. And Grassetti has now revealed his own return to old haunts as part of a "new chapter", albeit in this instance swapping one renowned Sony studio for another.
</p><p>
"I'm super excited to be joining the amazing crew and project over at Naughty Dog, and to be back to Playstation," Grassetti <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DDXFHncpzt3/">wrote on social media</a>. "I'm joining [Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann] and his team as art director, to help create the next big thing! A huge thanks to everybody who was involved in making this happen and all my friends from sister studios. I'm hyped and can’t wait to share more about it! Cheers!"
</p>
<p>
As to what Grassetti'll be working on at Naughty Dog, that remains shrouded in secrecy. The studio hasn't released a new game (discounting remasters) since 2020's The Last of Us Part 2. Its most recently announced project was its standalone The Last of Us multiplayer game - but that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">cancelled in December</a> last year.
</p>
<p>
At the time, Naughty Dog teased it was working on "more than one ambitious, brand-new single player game", and it seems likely one of these will be The Last of Us Part 3, given the huge success of HBO's The Last of Us TV adaptation and Neil Druckmann's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-3-could-be-one-more-chapter-to-this-story-says-co-creator-druckmann">recent suggestion</a> there's "probably one more chapter to this story". There's also been speculation the studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-think-naughty-dog-left-a-clue-about-its-next-project-in-the-last-of-us-part-1">working on a fantasy-themed title</a> - but as to where Raf Grassetti might currently be focusing his energies in his new Naughty Dog role, that remains to be seen.

            <p>
Seven months after announcing development of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-development-has-finally-wound-down-after-three-and-a-half-years">officially ended</a> - and a little over a year since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-getting-fully-functioning-metro-system-in-next-weeks-21-update">last major 2.1 release</a> - CD Projekt has revealed its open-world sci-fi RPG is getting more "cool stuff" in a suprise new update soon.
</p>
<p>
CD Projekt <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1866150925678657589">broke the news on social media</a>, revealing Cyberpunk 2077's 2.2 update will be detailed more thoroughly in a <a href="https://t.co/Pd1ztyTLTu">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://t.co/TOS9HhqLi9">YouTube</a> livestream airing Tuesday, 10th December, at 4pm GMT. As to what the update will include, that remains a mystery, but global community director Marcin Momot went some way toward managing expectations in a <a href="https://x.com/Marcin360/status/1866161075281863141">separate post</a>.
</p>
<p>
"A lot of questions about whether <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> support and NG+ are coming with Cyberpunk 2077 Patch 2.2," he wrote. "The answer is no. We do have some other cool stuff in the oven and we'll talk about it tomorrow during the stream — we hope you'll like it too!"

<p>
This isn't the first time CD Projekt has poured cold water on fan hopes for a PS5 Pro spruce-up, of course. The studio confirmed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-says-no-plans-for-cyberpunk-2077-upgrade-patch-on-ps5-pro">had "no plans" to release an update for Sony's console</a> back in November. But if PS5 Pro and New Game Plus are out, what could 2.2 bring?
</p><p>
It's likely it'll primarily focus on fixes and minor quality of life updates for issues identified during CD Projekt's work on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-is-bringing-cyberpunk-2077-to-macs-early-next-year">Cyberpunk 2077's Mac port</a>, which arrives next year. Anything more substantial seems doubtful, given the majority of the studio is currently focused on its new Witcher game - now officially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-has-entered-full-scale-production-cd-projekt-confirms">in "full-scale production"</a> - but we'll know more tomorrow.
