            <p>
The Rogue Prince of Persia will receive an enormous new update, Second Act, next week on 21st November, that looks like it'll function as something of a full relaunch. 
</p>
<p>
This roguelite take on Ubisoft's historical action series from some of the developers behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a> arrived in early access back in May this year to a warm reception.
</p>
<p>
Now, developer Evil Empire is adding the game's biggest update yet, which will revamp the game's visuals and double the game's size. You can take a look at the changes in the new Second Act trailer below:

<p>
Writing on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2717880/view/4508758658863071521">Steam</a>, Evil Empire describe the update as a "glow-up" for the game, with additional detail and tweaked colour palettes. Most notably, the Prince is no longer purple
</p>
<p>
"This change was made as the purple tone just didn't fit with the new direction," Evil Empire wrote. "We find that the art direction is now a much better fit with the game's genre, setting/story and the Prince of Persia series as a whole." Which is fair, as the Prince is not purple anywhere else.
</p>
<p>
Other content added in the Second Act update includes more biomes, bosses, a fresh story act and additional quality of life improvements such as multiple save slots.
</p>
<p>
"I think it works because the game has a charismatic star," Chris Donlan wrote of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-definitely-still-room-for-the-rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia upon its early access launch</a>. "Not charismatic in what he says, perhaps, but in what he does and how he moves. I just love to watch him run."
