Nintendo has finally revealed the release date of its forthcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-live-everything-announced-as-it-happens">Switch 2</a> console.
</p>
<p>
The Switch 2 will be released on 5th June. More details to follow.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo revealed the news at today's Switch 2 Direct, alongside a look at the launch line-up - including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-announced-as-switch-2-launch-title-complete-with-24-player-races-new-modes-and-more">brand new Mario Kart World</a>.

<p>Showing off the new console, Nintendo finally gave us a look at the new C-button, which initiates Game Chat to communicate with others while playing. To assist, a Nintendo Switch 2 Camera is being released alongside the console.</p>
<p>Console game sharing has been included, so players can play together on separate consoles using just one copy of the game. This even works with Game Chat, though is only compatible with certain games.</p>
<p>So what's new in Switch 2?</p>
<p>The LCD screen is 7.9 inches wide, with double the pixels of the original Switch. It's 1080p and offers up to 120fps and HDR support.</p>
<p>The Joy-Con 2 attach magnetically and have larger control sticks. Mouse controls have been confirmed, usable across both controllers.</p>
<p>The console's built-in speakers have been enhanced, while the console has a built-in microphone for voice chat - complete with noise-cancelling technology to filter out other sounds. 3D audio will be possible with headphones (in supported games) and with the built-in speaker via a later update.</p>
<p>The console also has two USB-C ports at the top and bottom, used for the new camera or for charging in tabletop mode.</p>
<p>Internal storage will be 256GB - that's eight times more than the original Switch. Reading and writing data will be faster too.</p>
<p>The dock will offer 4K support and HDR support in TV mode. It also has a built-in fan to keep the console cool and performance stable.</p>
<p>The game cards look the same as Switch but are red and with faster speeds. The console will be compatible with microSD Express cards for high speed data transfer. Original Switch microSD cards will not be compatible.</p>
<p>Lastly, the new Pro Controller will include the C-button as well as new GL and GR buttons on the handles and an audio jack for headphones.</p>
<p>For those wishing to transfer data between Switch and Switch 2, this will be achievable with a Nintendo Online account to transfer save data, digital games, and more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has shared fresh details on its next entry in the Mario Kart series.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">new Mario Kart game was first teased back in January</a>, during the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-live-everything-announced-as-it-happens">Switch 2</a> console announcement. At this time, though, Nintendo kept details pretty slim. Sure, we had some fun speculating about what was shown in that very brief clip, with fans pointing out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kongs-new-look-in-switch-2-mario-kart-approved-by-former-rare-artist">Donkey Kong had a new look</a>, there were 24 places on the starting line and what also appeared to be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-9-fan-speculation-points-to-fuel-tank-gameplay">suggestion players will need to conserve fuel while navigating the chaos that is Mario Kart racing</a>. But, actual concrete details from Nintendo itself, well, there really wasn't much.</p>
<p>That has all changed today, though, thanks to Nintendo's dedicated Switch 2 Direct. Rather than just being a little teaser to round out a different teaser, today's presentation gave us a full-fat look at what is now officially called Mario Kart World.</p>

<p>Along with returning faces such as Mario, Luigi, Toad and Peach, this upcoming game will also include chaning weather, and - rather excitingly - the ability to drive basically anywhere. There will also be grinding, and wall running (of sorts, you are still in a vehicle).
</p>
<p>As for the courses, there is a healthy dose of all new raceways, and the abilty to just roam about. As for that roaming, the trailer showed jet skis and snowmobiles for getting around on. Also, mistake me if I am wrong, but was Peach on a bike in a dress?
</p>
<p>Mario Kart will release on the same day as Nintendo Switch 2, but I guess that date will come later.</p>
<p>
A dedicated Mario Kart World Direct is also coming on 17th April, at 2pm UK.</p>
