            <p>Summer Games Done Quick 2025 has closed, raising $2,436,614 - £1.8m - for Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières.</p>
<p>Thousands of people stopped by the week-long event held in Minnesota, with "many more" watching via the charity's Twitch channel as participants took on some of the most popular speedruns including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sekiro-tips-and-tricks-6009">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a>, Balatro, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-maker-2">Super Mario Maker 2</a>, Blue Prince (see below), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/beat-saber">Beat Saber</a>.</p>

<p>"Another highlight included the AEW Fight Forever segment, where the audience raised signs and roared with growing excitement as if watching a real wrestling match," the organisers said in a press statement.</p>
<p>Game Done Quick’s next event is the all-women and femmes speedrunning showcase Flame Fatales, coming on 7-14 September. The all-new Games Done Queer will run from 31 October to 2 November, and Awesome Games Done Quick returns 4-10 January in Pittsburgh, PA.</p>
<p>Last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-years-agdq-included-someone-speedrunning-elden-ring-bosses-with-a-saxophone">Awesome Games Done secured an incredible $2,556,305</a> - that's £2.1m - for the Prevent Cancer Foundation at the start of the year. The week-long fundraiser wrapped up with a speedrun of Super Metroid after attracting over 2000 in-person attendees and "tens of thousands" of viewers on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-games-done-quick-2025-raises-18m-for-doctors-without-borders]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> developer Unknown Worlds' parent company, Krafton, has issued another statement, this time confirming that an internal milestone document leaked online is authentic.</p>
<p>As Matt explained for us last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> became the unexpected focus of industry drama last week when Krafton <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-leadership-replaced-by-krafton-despite-looming-early-access">announced it was 'replacing' three key members of Unknown Worlds' leadership team</a> - including studio founder and original Subnautica director Charlie Cleveland - with Steve Papoutsis, CEO of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> studio Striking Distance. At the time, Krafton insisted it had "sought to keep the... co-founders and original creators of the Subnautica series involved in the game's development", despite their departure.</p>

<p>Fan pushback was swift, and the situation only grew murkier after Bloomberg reported Cleveland, as well as Unknown Worlds' chief executive officer Ted Gill and special projects director Max McGuire, had all been "pushed out" amid Krafton's sudden decision to shift Subnautica 2's early access launch from its announced "2025" window into 2026.</p>
<p>It was also claimed the move - which Unknown Worlds' ousted leadership reportedly did not support - would mean the studio was unlikely to meet the revenue targets that would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-delayed-by-publisher-krafton-just-months-before-alleged-250m-payout-to-developers">unlock a promised $250m bonus for the development team</a>. Shortly thereafter, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-drama-escalates-ousted-developers-launch-legal-action-as-krafton-accuses-them-of-abandoning-project">Unknown Worlds' ousted leaders announced legal action against Krafton</a>.</p>
<p>Then, just ahead of the weekend, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/">pages from an internal review document</a> also popped up online. According to the leaker, it "clearly shows the state of the development progress and why Krafton and the Subnautica team disagreed on the release schedules".</p>
<p>The document purports to show where the development of Subnautica 2 was deemed to be versus expectation at this point in the development cycle. It criticises the as-is position, saying "while the game includes a variety of content, it currently lacks the freshness and volume expected of a sequel", and "falls short of meeting the high expectations of the OWSC and the Asian market". It also clearly states it expects a "content volume increase of over 30 percent compared to v1.0".</p>
<p>At the bottom of the second slide, the author - which remains unknown - states: "compared to the originally planned EA launch specifications, the current target content volume has been reduced or adjusted across various elements such as biomes, creatures, equipment/progression, and features. Due to a gap between the current state and the content volume assumed during the initial launch planning, it is necessary to reassess the release timeline and roadmap".</p>
<p>Rather than refute the leak, however, Krafton has confirmed the document is real, saying it was approving the credibility of the report because that would "minimi[se] speculation and ensur[e] accurate communication with players".</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/">A leak from a credible source regarding the milestone review of Subnautica 2</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Complete_Bread_4924/">u/Complete_Bread_4924</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/">Subnautica_2</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

<p>"Krafton is issuing the following statement in response to growing speculation surrounding the development of Subnautica 2," Krafton said in a statement to Eurogamer. "This statement aims to offer clarity and context regarding the current situation.</p>
<p>"The document that has been circulating on social media and reported by various outlets is indeed part of an internal milestone review conducted as part of the Subnautica 2 project. Krafton has confirmed that portions of it have been leaked and are now being widely shared across online platforms and within the fan community. Krafton recognises the confusion this has caused.</p>
<p>"Given these circumstances, Krafton has determined that transparent communication is necessary and has chosen to confirm the authenticity of the document," the publisher added. "Krafton believes that minimising speculation and ensuring accurate communication with players must take precedence.</p>
<p>"Milestone reviews are conducted regularly in collaboration with Krafton's creative studios across all projects. These reviews help assess development progress, define clear objectives, and ensure that each project aligns with Krafton's standards in both creativity and quality. This process is central to Krafton's commitment to delivering polished, high-quality games at the right time.</p>
<p>The statement closed with Krafton's claim that it will "continue working closely with Unknown Worlds to ensure that Subnautica 2 meets the expectations of players who have supported the franchise over the years."</p>
<p>There has, as yet, been no formal response from the former leadership team.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/in-latest-subnautica-2-twist-krafton-confirms-this-leaked-internal-review-document-is-real]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-new-resident-evil-game-has-been-announced">Resident Evil Survival Unit was only unveiled last week</a>, but already franchise owner Capcom is pulling back the curtain to give us our first look at the mobile strategy game.</p>
<p>Survival Unit is being co-developed by Aniplex Inc and Joycity Corporation, with Capcom working in "close collaboration" with the studios to "ensure authenticity and quality". A free-to-play title, Capcom reckons it will "offer a fresh, mobile-first gameplay experience that diverges from the traditional survival horror format of the main series".</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-survival-unit-is-a-global-multiplayer-experience-set-in-a-parallel-universe-featuring-leon-jill-and-the-resi-4-merchant">IGN</a> explains it, Survival Unit's story begins with your character's recovery as an Umbrella Corp test subject. In a bid to fight back, you'll meet and recruit Resident Evil characters, upgrading their skills and inventories with the now customary visits to the Merchant.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Survival Unit may be set in a parallel world and explore a new storyline, but players can expect to bump into familiar faces from across the main series, too, and make up their ultimate dream team, including series stalwarts Leon Kennedy and antagonist, Albert Wesker, as well as Jill Valentine, Claire Redfield, and Barry Burton.</p>
<p>You can also connect, and compete with, other players and set up and manage a base of operations in the guise of a mansion that long-time fans may recognise.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Survival Unit is expected to release in 2025, but we don't yet have a solid date.</p>
<p>As for the other recently-announced Resident Evil game, Resident Evil Requiem? Anticipation is evidently high, as Capcom recently announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-already-looks-set-for-massive-success-as-it-hits-significant-wishlist-milestone">over a million of us have already added Resident Evil Requiem to our wishlists</a>.</p>
<p>We got our first look at Resident Evil Requiem last month, when Capcom <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-officially-unveiled-coming-february">introduced us all to Grace Ashcroft and a destroyed Raccoon City</a>. The developer once considered having Leon Kennedy take on the protagonist role for Requiem, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leon-kennedy-actually-quite-a-bad-match-for-horror-says-resident-evil-9s-director">in the end decided he was "actually quite a bad match for horror"</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-survival-unit-stars-a-bunch-of-your-favourites-including-leon-jill-claire-and-the-real-mvp-barry-burton]]></content:encoded>

<p>While no specific time scales were provided for when players can expect an improvement to the Switch 2 launch title, the team is reportedly "working on some of those performance issues right now" and continue to do so "over the summer".</p>

<p>“So for Hitman, the team is working on some of those performance issues right now, and they are addressing it over the summer,” franchise director Jonathan Lacaille told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/io-addresses-hitman-switch-2-performance-issues-and-says-fixes-are-on-the-way/">VGC</a>.</p>
<p>“It's, of course, good learning for us to bring to First Light as well – so all of this will be learnings we bring to the next title."</p>
<p>While the news may not contain a specific timeframe or much detail, it should be good news nonetheless for those struggling to play the game on Nintendo's latest handheld. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HiTMAN/comments/1lroncb/i_hate_the_switch_2_port/">Some</a> are reporting issues with interactionable objects, opening doors, and crashing, while <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HiTMAN/comments/1lnz7bo/switch_2_performance/">others</a> complain of "horrible" frame dips and stuttering.</p>
<p>ICYMI, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-hitman-co-op-mode-with-stone-and-knight-is-in-the-works-at-io-interactive">developing a co-op mode for Hitman: World of Assassination</a>. Announced last month, the mode is still relatively under wraps, but does feature two names you may recognise: Stone and Knight. These two popped up in the Hitman Sniper mode.</p>
<p>On this co-op mode's release, players will be able to pop into "exciting missions" from the Hitman world with their pal by their side, "challenging" how players approach things now they are going in as one of a pair.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/io-interactive-is-working-on-some-of-those-nintendo-switch-2-performance-issues-right-now]]></content:encoded>
