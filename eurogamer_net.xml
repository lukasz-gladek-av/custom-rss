<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged">Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged</a>, the newly remastered edition of developer Revolution Software's classic point-and-click puzzle adventure, finally has a Switch release date following its recent delay, and will launch next Thursday, 7th November.
</p>
<p>
Shadow of the Templars first released in 1996 (a Director's Cut remaster arrived in 2009), charting the adventures of American tourist George Stobbart - later with assistance from photo-journalist Nicole Collard - as he becomes embroiled in a global conspiracy after witnessing a bombing on the streets of Paris, perpetrated by a man dressed as a clown. It deftly weaves historical fact and fiction into a thoroughly engrossing, occasionally thrilling whole that quickly earned it fans, and it's been considered a classic of the point-and-click genre ever since.
</p>
<p>
Revolution Software's Reforged edition of the game launched for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation back in September, introducing a variety of upgrades, including "beautiful" re-drawn 4K backgrounds, re-animated sprites, enhanced audio, and other quality of life improvements. Its Switch release, however, got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged-delayed-on-nintendo-switch">last-minute delay</a> in order to "ensure the quality of play remains equally high across all versions of the game".

<p>
Six weeks later, and Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged finally has a release date of 7th November on Switch's eShop, where it'll cost £24.99/€29.99/$29.99. In a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/revolution-software/broken-sword-reforged-collectors-edition/posts/4238562">message shared on Kickstarter</a>, Revolution noted the Switch version will include all fixes and enhancements made to the PC version since launch, with other Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PS5 set to receive them "very soon".

As for what's next, a sixth game in the Broken Sword series, Parzival's Stone, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/broken-sword-parzivals-stone-is-a-new-entry-in-the-classic-point-and-click-adventure-series">announced last year</a>. It sees George and Nico caught up in a terrifying conspiracy featuring Nazi treasure hunters, brutal mediaeval histories, and Quantum Physics, where ruthless technology entrepreneurs, corrupt government agencies, and billion-dollar global energy corporations are battling for possession of a manuscript pointing to the secret location of the mythical thousand-year-old Grail - just perhaps not the one we're used to hearing about. Parzival's Stone was originally due to launch in 2024, but was delayed to an unspecified future point earlier this year.
