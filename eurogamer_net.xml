Extremely OK Games - the studio behind beloved 2018 platformer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/celeste">Celeste</a> - has announced the cancellation of its "2D explor-action" project Earthblade, calling the news a "huge, heartbreaking, and yet relieving failure".
</p>
<p>
Extremely OK <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/celeste-dev-announces-new-game-earthblade-with-vibe-revealing-teaser-art-and-music">unveiled Earthblade back in 2021</a>, sharing some mood-setting teaser art and a musical snippet. A full reveal <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/celeste-devs-show-first-look-at-earthblade">arrived a year and a half later</a>, offering an early glimpse of a side-scrolling platformer - blending elements of combat and exploration - that would see an "enigmatic child of Fate returning at long last to Earth".
</p>
<p>
At the time, the project was expected to arrive in 2024, but Extremely OK <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/celeste-developers-next-game-wont-be-out-this-year">confirmed a delay last March</a>. And while it didn't commit to a new release window, it moved to assure fans progress was not "stagnant" and that the team was "still excited to work on it".

<p>
Today, however, the studio has announced Earthblade is no more. In a <a href="https://exok.com/posts/2025-01-22-earthblade-final-update/">lengthy post shared on the Extremely OK website</a>, studio director Maddy Thorson went into some of the factors leading to the project's cancellation. These include a "disagreement about the IP rights of Celeste" which, as painted in today's announcement, saw Thorson and Noel Berry on one side and studio "founding member" Pedro Medeiros on the other.
</p><p>
Thorson says the issue was eventually resolved following a "very difficult and heartbreaking process", but noted the outcome resulted in Medeiros' departure from the Earthblade project after "both parties... agreed in the end that we should go our separate way".
</p>
<p>
This, in turn, prompted the remaining members of Extremely OK to "take a serious look at whether fighting through to finish Earthblade was the right path forward". And while the project "had a lot going for it", according to Thorson, "it was also not as far along as one would expect after such a protracted development process."
</p>
<p>
"Noel and I also began to reflect on how the game has felt for us to work on day-to-day," Thorson continued, "and realised that it has been a struggle for a long time. Sure, working on one project for so long is bound to become a slog, but this feels like a deeper problem. Celeste's success applied pressure on us to deliver something bigger and better with Earthblade, and that pressure is a large part of why working on it has become so exhausting."
</p>
<p>
"Pedro isn't to blame for this," Thorson stressed. "In fact the split with him has given us the clarity to see that we have lost our way, and the opportunity to admit defeat. I feel many ways about it, but one big feeling is undoubtedly relief."
</p><p>
With Earthblade officially no more, other members of the team have also "moved on". However, Thorson and Berry now plan to "take all of the (many!) lessons we've learned... wipe the slate clean, and refocus ourselves back to smaller-scale projects." As a result, the duo are "prototyping again and exploring at our own pace, and trying to rediscover game development in a manner closer to how we approached it at Celeste's or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/towerfall">TowerFall</a>'s inception."
</p>
<p>
"We are happy to return to our roots," Thorson concluded, "and reclaim some joy in our creative process, and see where that takes us."

            <p>
EA has lowered its financial forecast for its current fiscal year, pointing to the 'underperformance' of EA Sports FC 2025 - which it says accounts for the "majority" of the shortfall - alongside lower-than-expected interest in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>.
</p>
<p>
As noted in EA's <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Pre-Announces-Preliminary-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx">revised outlook</a> for the year ending 31st March 2025, the company was previously forecasting a  "mid-single-digit growth in live services net bookings". However, it now expects a "mid-single-digit decline", blaming the "majority of the change" on EA Sports 2025 - which saw a "slowdown in momentum" following its release in September.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, EA has reported lower-than-expected interest in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, saying BioWare's fantasy RPG "engaged" approximately 1.5m players during the quarter - a number it describes as being "down nearly 50 percent from the company's expectations."

<p>
All this means the publisher now anticipates net bookings of approximately $2.21 billion for its third fiscal quarter and an updated range of $7-7.15 billion for fiscal year 2025.
</p>
<p>
"During Q3, we continued to deliver high-quality games and experiences across our portfolio, EA CEO Andrew Wilson wrote in a statement accompanying today's revised guidance. "However, Dragon Age and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a> underperformed our net bookings expectations." Even so, Wilson says, "We remain confident in our long-term strategy and expect a return to growth in FY26, as we execute against our pipeline."
</p><p>
Despite Dragon Age: The Veilguard failing to meet EA's business expectations, BioWare's latest was well-received by critics when it launched in October 2024. "It's warm and welcoming, funny and hopeful, gentle when it needs to be, and of course it's epic," Eurogamer's Robert Purchese <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">wrote in his five star review</a>. "The Veilguard is spectacular. BioWare is back."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell was less enthused by EA Sports FC 2025, however. "Another year where the annual tweaks settle in such a way as to recreate, or reposition, the same old problems that have been here since the beginning," he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc-25-review">wrote in his three star review</a>. "This is EA Sports FC 25. I love it. I hate it. It'll probably be like this forever."

            <p>
Two and a half years after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-confirms-new-the-witcher-game-in-development">announcement</a>, CD Projekt finally gave it the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">big reveal treatment</a> late in 2024, confirming Ciri to be the focus this time around. And now Doug Cockle - voice of former series protagonist Geralt of Rivia - has had his say, calling the switch to a new main character, a "really, really interesting move for all kinds of reasons".
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-talks-ciri-fan-reaction-playable-geralt-coyness-and-if-the-game-will-honour-your-previous-choices">shortly after The Witcher 4's reveal</a> last year, CD Projekt called Ciri's promotion to lead "really exciting" in terms of the opportunities it opened up, "by just virtue of who she is [and] what we can do with her in terms of the gameplay as well." And it turns out that's a sentiment Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle shares.
</p>
<p>
"I'm really excited," he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekts-decision-to-go-with-ciri-as-protagonist-for-the-witcher-4-a-really-interesting-move-for-all-kinds-of-reasons-geralt-actor-says">recently revealed to IGN</a>. "I think it's a really good move. I mean, I always thought that continuing the Saga, but shifting to Ciri would be a really, really interesting move for all kinds of reasons. But mostly because of things that happen in the books, which I don't want to give away because people, I want people to go read. So yeah, I think it's really exciting. I can't wait. I can't wait to see what they've done."

<p>
Of course, Cockle is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-of-town-that-was-definitely-doug-cockles-white-haired-monster-hunter-in-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer">now confirmed to be returning as Geralt</a> in The Witcher 4, despite the character's demotion - although it's not currently clear how substantial a role he'll play. The actor had already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-voice-actor-confirms-he-will-be-part-of-the-witcher-4">let slip he'd be "part of" the new game</a> last August- earning himself a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doug-cockle-got-slapped-by-cd-projekt-for-saying-geralt-is-in-the-witcher-4-but-not-as-the-main-character">bit of a slap on the wrist</a> from CD Projekt - and it was finally made official when Geralt popped up at the end of December's reveal trailer to utter a gravelly, "See you on the path".
</p><p>
Unfortunately for impatient sorts, The Witcher 4 is likely still some considerable way off (CD Projekt's hasn't even announced a release year yet), but fans can, at least, get a fresh Cockle fix much sooner. The actor is reprising the role of Geralt of Rivia in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-doug-cockle-starring-animated-witcher-movie-sirens-of-the-deep-gets-february-arrival-date">upcoming animated movie The Witcher: Sirens of The Deep</a>, which joins the streaming service on 11th February.
