            <p>Former Xbox president Sarah Bond thanked former CEO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> and congratulated his successor, Asha Sharma, in a letter sent to all staff as news broke that she was leaving after eight years with the company.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/today-marks-an-exciting-new-chapter-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-retiring-amid-major-leadership-shakeup-that-sees-microsofts-coreai-president-taking-over-roll">Xbox CEO Phil Spencer announced his retirement from Microsoft after nearly 40 years yesterday</a> (21st February), amid a major leadership shakeup for the gaming brand that'll see Microsoft's current president of CoreAI, Asha Sharma, take over the role, and Xbox president Bond depart the company.</p>
<p>In a message shared via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sarahrbond_sharing-with-gratitude-the-note-i-sent-to-activity-7430753683912531968-YEXj/">LinkedIn</a>, Bond said she will "remain on as a Special Advisor to Asha to help ensure a smooth transition," but stressed, "this is the right time for me to take my next step, both personally and professionally". She did not share what those next steps would be.</p>
<p>"I've had the privilege of spending time with [new CEO] Asha over the last few weeks as we've planned for this transition, and I've seen firsthand her deep commitment to our players, developers, and brand," Bond said.</p>
<p>"She brings deep technology and commerce experience, along with a strong track record of building and scaling platforms that the world uses. Xbox deserves this. I'm excited to see her lead this next chapter for our team."</p>
<p>Bond added: "I'm incredibly proud of what we've built together over the past eight-plus years. PC and cloud gaming are growing faster than ever, our next console is well underway, and together we've helped lay the foundation for a more open gaming platform that spans devices and reaches players around the world."</p>
<p>She closed on thanking Spencer for his "mentorship and friendship over the years", and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella for "his sponsorship and support throughout my time at Microsoft".</p>
<p>In her first email to staff as CEO of Microsoft Gaming, Sharma wrote, "I feel two things at once: humility and urgency. Humility because this team has built something extraordinary over decades. Urgency because gaming is in a period of rapid change, and we need to move with clarity and conviction."</p>
<p>Spencer said: "Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team."</p>

            <p>Original Saints Row design director Chris Stockman has declared the Saints Row franchise is "dead".</p>
<p>Last November, Stockman revealed he wanted to revive the open-world crime series following the poorly received 2022 reboot – developed after he had left Volition – and claimed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-saints-row-designer-says-unloved-2022-reboot-missed-the-mark-but-the-big-news-is-embracer-wants-him-to-pitch-a-revival">publisher Embracer Group had reached out to hear more</a> about his ideas.</p>

<p>Fast forward a few months, however, and Stockman is now less confident, responding to a fan on Discord that IP holder Embracer has "ghosted him" and "has zero ability to do anything with [the franchise]".</p>
<p>"[H]onestly, I think the franchise is dead, unfortunately," Stockman said in reply to a commenter who'd shared their dismay that the last canon game was released "a decade ago".</p> <div>

<p>"I get the sense that Embracer has zero ability to do anything with it," he added. "I wish things were different. I tried my best to offer a path forward, but they've ghosted me."</p>
<p>Stockman's comments come <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-reboot-developer-didnt-know-what-they-were-building-saber-ceo-says-criticising-shuttered-team">after the CEO of Saber Interactive had some pretty damning words to say about the reboot</a> and its developer, Volition, after it was shuttered in 2023 as part of then-parent company Embracer Group's previously announced "restructuring" programme.</p>
<p>"They didn't know what they were building," Matt Karch said. "They didn't have any real direction. It couldn't last," Karch said. "And so, who's going to fund them for the next game after that disaster?"</p>
<p>I found the 2022 game to be a very mediocre affair <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-2022-review-a-snappy-but-slightly-uneven-reboot">when I reviewed it back in 2022</a>, calling it a reboot that "won't set the world alight, but there's a punchy game here with some pleasant surprises".</p>

            <p>
Xbox CEO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has announced his retirement from Microsoft after nearly 40 years, amid a major leadership shakeup for the gaming brand that'll see Microsoft's current president of CoreAI, Asha Sharma, take over the role. Additionally, Xbox president Sarah Bond will depart the company.
</p>
<p>
"Last fall, I shared with [Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella] that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life," Spencer - who joined Microsoft in 1988 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-named-new-boss-of-xbox">became the boss of Xbox in 2014</a> - wrote in an email to staff. "From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we've built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It's a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead."
</p>
<p>
“Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team," Spencer continued. "She brings genuine curiosity, clarity and a deep commitment to understanding players, creators, and the decisions that shape our future. We know this is an important moment for our fans, partners, and team, and we're committed to getting it right." Spencer added he'll remain in an advisory role "through the summer".
</p>
<p>
As part of his retirement announcement, Spencer also confirmed the departure of Xbox president Sarah Bond, who he said had "decided to leave Microsoft to begin a new chapter." He called Bond's work "instrumental during a defining period for Xbox", wishing her "the very best in what comes next". Bond joined Xbox in 2017 and was named Xbox president in 2022. As for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> head Matt Booty, he's received a new role amid Xbox's significant executive overhaul, and will now work closely with the newly appointed Sharma as executive vice president and chief content officer.
</p><p>
In her first email to staff as CEO of Microsoft Gaming, Sharma wrote, "I feel two things at once: humility and urgency. Humility because this team has built something extraordinary over decades. Urgency because gaming is in a period of rapid change, and we need to move with clarity and conviction."
</p>
<p>
"I am stepping into work shaped by generations of artists, engineers, designers, writers, musicians, operators and more who create worlds that have brought joy and deep personal meaning to hundreds of millions of players," Sharma continued. "The level of craft here is exceptional, and it is amplified by Xbox, which was founded in the belief that the power of games connect people and push the industry forward... We are stewards of some of the most loved stories and characters in entertainment and bring players and creators together around the fun and community of gaming in entirely new ways."
</p>
<p>
Sharma also made what she called "three commitments", referencing "great games", the "return of Xbox", and the "future of play". On games, she said Microsoft - which has made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">sweeping cuts across its gaming division in recent years,</a> including layoffs and team closures - will "empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas." She also promised to "take risks" and "enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most."
</p>
<p>
On the return of Xbox, Sharma said the company would "celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are... Gaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware. As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise." Sharma did not explicitly reference the "next-gen hardware" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-gen-xbox-confirmed-in-development-following-rumours-microsoft-would-stop-making-consoles">announced by then-president Sarah Bond last year</a> amid reports Microsoft was ending console development.
</p><p>
On the future, Sharma spoke of the "reinvention of play", pledging to "invent new business models and new ways to play" that will "meet the moment". This will include the building of "a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories". Additionally, she promised the team will "not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us."
</p>
<p>
"The next 25 years belong to the teams who dare to build something surprising, something no one else is willing to try, and have the patience to see it through," Sharma concluded. "We have done this before, and I am here to help us do it again. I want to return to the renegade spirit that built Xbox in the first place. It will require us to relentlessly question everything, revisit processes, protect what works, and be brave enough to change what does not. Thank you for welcoming me into this journey."
</p>
<p>
In a separate email to staff, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said Sharma would bring "deep experience building and growing platforms, aligning business models to long-term value, and operating at global scale, which will be critical in leading our gaming business into its next era of growth." He also thanked Spencer for his "extraordinary leadership and partnership".
