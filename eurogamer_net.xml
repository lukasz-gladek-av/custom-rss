            <p>EA has finally given us our first look at its upcoming Star Wars strategy game, Star Wars: Zero Company.</p>
<p>The single-player turn-based tactics game by Bit Reactor and Respawn was confirmed back in 2022. It's described as a "gritty and authentic original story set in the twilight of the Clone Wars".</p>
<p>Here it is in action:</p>

<p>You play as Hawks, a customisable former Republic officer, and will command an elite squad of "cunning operatives through a gritty and authentic story set in the twilight of the Clone Wars". As an unconventional outfit of professionals for hire hailing from across the galaxy, Zero Company must set aside their differences to overcome nearly impossible odds and take on an emerging threat that will consume the galaxy if left unchecked.</p>
<p>The campaign includes tactical operations and investigations "across the galaxy", whilst between missions, you will develop a base of operations and gather intelligence through a network of informants to stay one step ahead of Zero Companyâ€™s adversaries. You'll be able to create and customise your squad of recruited operators while "getting to know a cast of newly authored Star Wars characters".</p>
<p>"Our vision for Star Wars Zero Company is grounded in gameplay design pillars that weave in the immersive Star Wars galaxy with engaging turn-based tactics gameplay," said Greg Foertsch, CEO and creative director at Bit Reactor.</p>
<p>"It's our aim to deliver a game with an original Star Wars story from the Clone Wars era that has meaningful outcomes from player choices, and deep turn-based tactical combat with an approachable and cinematic presentation."</p>
<p>As yet there's no release date, but EA advises it's shooting for a 2026 release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>As we reported earlier this week, Star Wars: Zero Company is a collaboration between EA's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn Entertainment</a> and developer Bit Reactor, a studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firaxis-veterans-form-new-studio-bit-reactor-to-focus-on-turn-based-strategy">founded in 2022 by veterans of XCOM and Civilization developer Firaxis Games</a>. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-three-new-star-wars-games-in-development-at-respawn">one of three new Star Wars titles announced by EA at the time</a>, the others being a follow-up to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, which released in 2023 - and a Star Wars first-person shooter which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-further-lay-offs-this-time-likely-to-affect-around-670-employees">has since been cancelled</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
