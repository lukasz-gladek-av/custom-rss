            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> creator Kinetic Games will be creatively involved in the recently announced film, and, the studio has told Eurogamer, it will begin seeding lore across the game in order to develop a story for it.</p>
<p>"Yeah, we are involved in the creative side of it as well," the game's creator, Daniel Knight, told me as part of a longer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-story-of-phasmophobia-how-the-witcher-3-inadvertently-saved-the-ghost-hunting-game-that-sold-25-million-copies">Phasmophobia interview</a>. "We do want to make sure it is a Phasmophobia film and it's what everybody will expect going in. We're not just making a ghost-hunting film. It will be a Phasmophobia-themed film, and it's our job to make sure it's what everybody wants."</p>
<p>But as people pointed out in reaction to the film's announcement, the game doesn't really have a story. It follows a series of procedurally generated ghost hunts that take place across apparently unconnected properties. How does that translate into a film?</p>

<p>"There's some very minor story parts in the game right now," Knight responded. "We do have a lore update planned as well. We were planning on doing that before the whole film stuff came about.</p>
<p>"We'll do our own lore and story for the game and design it in a way where it's a puzzle for people to figure out," he added. "There's not going to be any story mode or campaign or anything like that. You're just going to be poking around in different locations. And that will be used for the film stuff as well."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-has-earned-itself-a-movie-adaptation-from-m3gan-and-five-nights-at-freddys-production-company-blumhouse">The Phasmophobia film was announced in June</a> as a collaboration between Kinetic and Blumhouse (M3gan, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a>), and production company Atomic Monster (Annabelle, The Nun, The Conjuring). But apparently Blumhouse wasn't the first film studio to express interest.</p>

<p>"We had a few different studios reach out," Knight told me. "We had quite a lot of interest. Even shortly after release, we had quite a big studio reach out," he said. I asked him who this was but he couldn't remember; I pursued this and genuinely seemed unable to recall the name. "We had quite a few over the years," he added, "and then Blumhouse reached out and we're all fans of all their horror films, and they were the perfect fit.</p>
<p>"A lot of them all play the game as well," he said. "I think it'll be like they will take the game stuff into the film, rather than the other way around."</p>
<p>It's been an extraordinary five years for Knight and Kinetic Games since Phasmophobia was released. Still only in Early Access, the game has sold more than 25 million copies - a new grand total Knight gave me when we spoke. The recent console releases and major Chronicle update have rejuvenated player activity in the game, and now all eyes turn to 2026 and the major 1.0 release, which is so significant, Knight said you should feel like you're playing a new game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-story-of-phasmophobia-how-the-witcher-3-inadvertently-saved-the-ghost-hunting-game-that-sold-25-million-copies">The full story of Phasmophobia</a>, from near-miss to extraordinary success, is live elsewhere on Eurogamer now.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-will-begin-seeding-lore-to-build-story-for-the-film]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Nintendo and Universal Pictures have registered the copyright for a Donkey Kong film, suggesting the forthcoming Mario sequel and Legend of Zelda film could be followed by Nintendo's gorilla.</p>
<p>Few details are currently known, beyond the existence of the <a href="https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/rmm_voyager_V01503556900000">copyright itself</a>, but the news is in line with a response from Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa in a recent <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf">investor call</a>.</p>
<p>Furukawa was asked about the future of the "visual content business" - films, essentially. The president replied the company has been "working on initiatives beyond our dedicated video game platforms for several years" and that it's "deeply involved in production".</p>

<p>He added: "Although we cannot discuss our plans beyond The Legend of Zelda movie at this time, we are working on various other projects."</p>
<p>It seems a Donkey Kong film will be the next project.</p>
<p>A Donkey Kong film would certainly make sense. To begin with, the gorilla is a prominent character in The Super Mario Bros. Movie, voiced by Seth Rogan, and will likely feature in the sequel - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-super-mario-movie-title-quietly-announced-then-quickly-removed-by-nbcuniversal">expected to be called Super Mario World</a>.</p>
<p>Then there are the theme parks, which have expanded from just the Mario universe to include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> releasing as a launch period game this week for Nintendo's new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> console, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>All of which is to say Nintendo is putting great emphasis on Donkey Kong at present, meaning it's understandable why a Donkey Kong film would be prioritised as the next project after Mario and Zelda.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">Mario sequel film is set to release in April 2026</a>, while the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-has-delayed-its-legend-of-zelda-film">Zelda film was recently delayed to March 2027</a>. There's no indication as to when the Donkey Kong film will be released but, perhaps Spring 2028 if they're a year apart?</p>
<p>Nintendo confirmed ahead of its release that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-donkey-kong-bananza-is-being-made-by-the-mario-odyssey-team">Donkey Kong Bananza is being made by the Mario Odyssey development team</a>.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on">hands-on with Donkey Kong Bananza recently</a>, stating "it's clear to me that the Nintendo developers in Japan have paid an enormous amount of attention to the entirety of Donkey Kong's history - and the result is a Nintendo Japan game that has a rare energy".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-film-copyright-registered-by-nintendo-as-gorillas-prominence-continues]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ken Levine has revealed his upcoming game, Judas, will be an "old-school" and "traditional" single-player adventure.</p>
<p>It's been 11 years since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a>, and on the surface, Judas seems to be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> game in all but name, with gunplay and elemental powers in an offbeat alternate universe setting. And while that is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ken-levines-new-game-looks-like-bioshock-in-space">essentially what trailers</a> have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levines-judas-glimpsed-again">shown us of the game so far</a>, Levine has now confirmed that his upcoming game will indeed feel "old-school" given its focus not on live service or online play, but "telling the story and transporting the player".</p>

<p>"I grew up playing single-player games," Levine said. "And I grew up before [...] certain types of monetisation existed. I'm not here at all to say this is bad, or this is good, right? That's not really my thing. I know the kinds of games I like to make, and so we never made a game... like, Juas is a very old-school game," Levine told Nightdive's Lawrence Sonntag in a recent interview (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/bioshock-creator-says-audiences-reward-single-player-games-that-dont-have-other-methods-of-monetization-like-baldurs-gate-3-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-and-clair-obscur-expedition-33/">GR+</a>).</p>
<p>"You buy the game and you get the whole thing. There's no online component. There's no live service, because everything we do is in service of telling the story and transporting the player somewhere.</p>
<p>"We're very fortunate. This is no diss on any developers who have done that, because look, games are expensive to make, and we're very fortunate to work at a company where they believe in us enough that they say, 'Okay, you've been working on this thing for a long time, it's gonna cost a reasonable amount of money, and we're not gonna push any of that stuff on you.'"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creators-next-game-judas-to-be-released-by-march-2025">We initially expected Judas to launch by the end of the last financial year</a> - April 2025 - but as yet, we still don't have a release window, let alone a firm date.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ken-levines-judas-is-old-school-you-buy-the-game-and-you-get-the-whole-thing]]></content:encoded>
