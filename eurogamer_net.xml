            <p>Actor Doug Cockle, who is known to many as the gravelly voiced Geralt of Rivia in CD Projekt Red's The Witcher games, has again said he was "sad" to see Henry Cavill step away from the same role in Netflix's series. However, he believes Liam Hemsworth "holds up pretty well" in the show's fourth season.</p>

<p>Hemsworth was first announced to be joining the cast of Netflix's The Witcher adaptation in 2022, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-4-henry-cavill-replaced-as-geralt">Cavill said he would be "laying down [his] medallion and [his] swords"</a> when the third season wrapped. Many were upset by this decision, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-voice-actor-sad-about-henry-cavill-leaving-the-witcher-netflix-show">even Cockle himself said he was disappointed to see Cavill go</a>.</p>
<p>But now, reflecting on the Geralt cast change once more, Cockle has said that while Cavill was certainly "a fantastic Witcher", having seen the latest season of Netflix's series, he also thinks Hemsworth is pretty good too.</p>
<p>"I think Liam holds up pretty well," Cockle told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/fantasy-shows/geralts-game-actor-says-he-was-sad-to-see-henry-cavill-go-but-that-liam-hemsworth-holds-up-pretty-well-in-the-witcher-season-4-hes-made-it-his-own-character/?s=31">GamesRadar+</a>. "He's different. He's made it his own character, and that's what he should have done as an actor, and I think he's done a fantastic job." Cockle added he is looking forward to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-5-will-be-its-last">fifth and final season of Netflix's Witcher adaptation</a>, and "seeing where it goes".</p><p>Back in April last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witchers-video-game-voice-star-weighs-in-on-netflix-adaptation">Cockle admitted there were some choices made by Netflix during the adaptation's run so far he didn't understand</a>. However, he also appreciated the need "to give different mediums their space". The show's "gotta have room to be its own thing", Cockle said at the time.</p>

<p>Cockle is set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-of-town-that-was-definitely-doug-cockles-white-haired-monster-hunter-in-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer">reprise his role of Geralt in The Witcher 4</a>, which will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">feature Ciri as its lead</a>. CD Projekt previously confirmed its next Witcher game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-after-2026-so-could-it-be-a-next-generation-game">won't be launching until after the end of 2026</a>, suggesting it might even be a next-gen release.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, it was revealed that Karel Kolmann - a key member of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> development team - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-bolsters-the-witcher-4-team-with-key-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-talent">had made the jump to CD Projekt to work on The Witcher 4</a>.</p>

            <p>Renowned British indie studio Inkle - the creator of Heaven's Vault, the Steve Jackson's Sorcery! series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/a-highland-song">A Highland Song</a>, and many other glistening treasures - has just announced a new game. It's called TR-49 and it's part audio-book, part narrative deduction, based around a found-footage idea of cracking codes from a series of previously undiscovered and secret World War 2-era books.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-of-the-obra-dinn-review-prepare-to-be-transported">superb historical detective game The Return of the Obra Dinn</a> is name-dropped as an inspiration.</p>
<p>The story for TR-49 goes that Inkle co-founder Jon Ingold had a great-uncle who worked at Bletchley Park, that historic home of codebreaking in Britain where pioneering computer scientist and mathematician Alan Turing worked, and where the legendary Enigma Machine was developed to crack German codes.</p>
<p>Ingold was clearing out his uncle's attic and while doing so stumbled on strange electronics and a pile of books, which he'd never heard of and that he could find no trace of online. And it's these books - these 50 books - that will form the meat of the game, as we decipher their garbled text to work out what they're about.</p>

<p>Actors Rebekah McLoughlin (The SCP Archives, Eternal Threads), Paul Warren (A Highland Song, The Séance of Blake Manor) and Phillipe Bosher (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, Doctor Who) will bring the story to life. TR-49 will be released in January.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-highland-song-review">Inkle's latest game was A Highland Song</a> a side-on Scottish hiking game infused with poetry and music and folklore, and the magic of the setting it's based in. "A Highland Song is about what it feels like to be lost in the mountains. Not even lost, in fact. Just to be in the mountains, to have the privilege to exist there just for a bit, to experience them directly and extensively and know them as a process of living," wrote Chris in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-highland-song-review">A Highland Song review</a>.</p>
