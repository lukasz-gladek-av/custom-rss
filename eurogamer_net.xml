            <p>
Photos of the upcoming Xbox-branded handheld made by Asus have been spilled online.
</p>
<p>
The images show two versions of the Asus ROG Ally 2, with a a regular white-coloured version as well as a black-coloured variant that includes a dedicated Xbox button. 
</p>
<p>
As spotted by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-rog-ally-2-and-rog-ally-2-xbox-edition-gaming-handhelds-leaked">Videocardz</a>, this leak comes direct from the US FCC's official certification of the hardware, and appears to be our first look at Microsoft and Asus' "Project Kennan" handheld plans.

<p>
Microsoft is set to officially reveal Project Kennan in the coming months - the company's annual June showcase seems a fair bet - and detail more about the system. 
</p>
<p>
It remains to be seen how powerful the hardware's technical specs are, and to what extent it will be able to play the full Xbox back catalogue.
</p>

<p>
On the surface, however, the device looks somewhat similar to the Steam Deck and other existing handheld PC hardware. Analogue sticks sit at either side of a screen, with a D-pad on one side and ABXY face buttons on the other. The black-coloured model's small Xbox button can be seen on its upper left side.

<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/xboxs-project-kennan-pc-gaming-handheld-leaks-in-new-photos-alongside-the-rog-ally-2">Windows Central</a> reports that the device is now being tested openly at Microsoft's US headquarters, ahead of its public unveiling. 
</p>
<p>
But with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">Xbox prices going up worldwide</a>, the big question is - how much will Project Kennan eventually cost?

            <p>A new video with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> director Naoki Hamaguchi suggests the full <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">FF7</a> remake series is heading to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>At the reveal for Nintendo's new console, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-is-coming-to-switch-2">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade would be released on Switch 2</a>, though there's no release date just yet. However, that's just the first part of the planned trilogy, with Rebirth (part two) already out on PS5 and PC.</p>
<p>The latest Creator's Voice video from Nintendo features Hamaguchi expressing his excitement at developing for a Nintendo console. But what's most interesting are his frequent references not just to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>, but to the whole series.</p>

<p>Discussing the new console's technical specs, Hamaguchi states he felt "it would have enough power to run the Final Fantasy 7 remake series" he's creating. Later, he notes this is his first time creating a game for a Nintendo system, adding: "And the fact that it happens to be the Final Fantasy 7 remake series, considering the original game gave me the opportunity to pursue a career in the games industry, makes me feel like it was fate."</p>
<p>At the end of the video, Hamaguchi gives the closest comment yet to confirmation of the full trilogy coming to Switch 2: "And with the release of the Final Fantasy 7 remake series on Switch 2, it would make me very happy if two generations connect and share a bond over the characters."</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth remains a console exclusive on PS5, but it would appear a port for the Switch 2 could well be in development. Finally, Queen's Blood on the go!</p>
<p>It begs the question though: what about Xbox? And further: what does this mean for part three? Will that also be a timed console exclusive on PlayStation, or can we expect a simultaneous release on other consoles too?</p>
<p>It's all part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Square Enix's multiplatform strategy</a> it began "aggressively pursuing" in 2024 after both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and Final Fantasy 16 failed to meet sales expectations</a>.</p>
<p>And while Final Fantasy 7 is the more popular, could Final Fantasy 16 also be released on Switch 2 in future?</p>
<p>As for part three of the Final Fantasy 7 remake series, series producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-story-completed-producer-very-satisfied-as-development-continues-without-delay">Yoshinori Kitase confirmed at the start of the year its story has been completed</a>. However, it's still unknown when it will be released - and on which platforms.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> publisher EA has praised the game's "hugely successful launch", as developer Hazelight celebrates another sales milestone.</p>
<p>As part of its <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q4-and-FY25-Results/default.aspx">report for the 2025 fiscal year</a>, EA said Split Fiction was a key part in leading the company to a "strong finish" alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a>.</p>

<p>"Q4 marked a strong finish to FY25, with broad-based momentum across the portfolio positioning the business for accelerated growth," said EA CFO Stuart Canfield. "As we enter FY26, we remain focused on disciplined execution as we build toward a slate of groundbreaking upcoming releases."</p>
<p>Soon after EA released its report, Hazelight announced Split Fiction has now sold 4m copies since its debut earlier this year.</p>
<p>"So many of you have picked up Split Fiction already, it’s amazing…" the <a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1919852640189456892">studio wrote on social media</a>. "Seeing the fun you have with our game and the love you show for Mio, Zoe and each other warms our hearts here at Hazelight."</p>
<p>It also made a playful wink wink, nudge nudge remark about "so many hot dogs made", but I won't say any more about that right now... It really is a moment best experienced first hand (wink wink, nudge nudge).</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Hazelight</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the first 48 hours of release, Split Fiction sold an impressive 1m units. By the end of its first week, the studio announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">Split Fiction had sold another 1m units</a>.</p>
<p>Not simply content with these figures, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-has-broken-not-one-not-two-but-three-world-records">the game subsequently broke three world records</a>, becoming the most played local co-op video game on Steam, the most sold local co-op video game within 48 hours of release, and most sold local co-op video game within one week of release.</p>
<p>And, it doesn't seem likely Split Fiction will lose any moment any time soon. A film adaptation of Split Fiction is already in the works, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sydney-sweeney-to-star-in-split-fiction-film-written-by-deadpool-wolverine-team">Sydney Sweeney set to both star and produce</a>. The upcoming film is being directed by Jon M Chu, whose previous works include last year's musical hit, Wicked.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-is-a-switch-2-launch-title">Split Fiction will be a Switch 2 launch title</a> when the console releases next month. So, we can pretty much guarantee that the game will sell even more pretty darn soon.</p>
<p>"Fantastic from start to finish, Split Fiction is one of the most inventive and joyful co-op games to date, and a testament to the power of human imagination," Katharine Castle wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">Eurogamer's Split Fiction review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
EA has confirmed its next Battlefield game is still on track to launch before next April, with a full reveal due this "summer", following several months of invite-only playtests.
</p>
<p>
EA CEO Andrew Wilson shared the news of Battlefield's imminent reveal as part of the company's <a href="https://news.ea.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q4-and-FY25-Results/default.aspx">Q4 and financial year 2025 earnings report</a>. "As we look to the future, we're confident in our ability to execute across a deep pipeline," he wrote, "beginning this summer with the highly anticipated reveal of Battlefield, a pivotal step in delivering on our next generation of blockbuster entertainment."
</p>
<p>
The publisher also recommitted to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-expected-to-release-before-april-2026">previously announced FY26 release window </a>for Battlefield, meaning the game is still on track to launch before April next year. Back in February, Wilson suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be">EA might be willing to delay its next Battlefield</a> if "some things happening in the year" meant that "wasn't a great window for us" - seemingly an oblique reference to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">since been delayed into May next year</a>.

<p>
EA has previously shared some lofty goals for its next Battlefield, saying it wants it to be the "biggest [series  entry] we've ever made." To that end, it's been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">running invite-only playtests</a> since March as it seeks to "get the community back on [its] side" following the poorly received <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> - which quickly became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-is-now-one-of-steams-worst-reviewed-games-of-all-time">one of Steam's worst-reviewed games of all time</a> after its launch in 2021, and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-admits-battlefield-2042-flopped-but-would-have-been-less-than-10-percent-of-annual-revenue-anyway">later acknowledged to have flopped</a>.
</p>
<p>
While EA's recent Battlefield playtests have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reminds-battlefield-players-things-taking-place-in-labs-may-or-may-not-make-their-way-to-the-final-game">resulted in a flurry of leaked footage</a>, little has been officially revealed beyond the fact it's set in the modern day, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">bring back traditional classes and more focused maps</a> after the unpopular changes made in Battlefield 2042. There've also been suggestions, based on landmarks sighted in the single bit of concept art shared last year, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-sleuth-seemingly-identifies-location-teased-in-next-games-first-bit-of-concept-art">the series might be heading to Gibraltar</a>. But with a full reveal due this "summer" - perhaps at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-dates-confirmed">this year's Summer Game Fest</a> - there shouldn't be too long until we learn more.
</p>
<p>
Before then, however, EA <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1919754055284314568">has announced plans</a> to "continue scaling Battlefield Labs testing globally", saying it'll begin inviting more players across Europe, North America, and select areas of Asia throughout May. These playtest will include new content, as well as further testing of weapon balancing, damage values, plus "movement and combat pacing mechanics".
</p>
<p>
Away from Battlefield, EA has confirmed its free-to-play Skate reboot is similarly due to launch before April 2026. Previously, developer Full Circle said it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-wont-be-playable-offline-to-offer-a-massively-multiplayer-sandbox-thats-always-online-and-always-evolving">remains committed to its 2025 early access release window</a>, although a more specific date is yet to be shared.
