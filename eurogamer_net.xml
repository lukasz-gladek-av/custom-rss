            <p>After a few playful teases earlier in the week, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> team has officially announced its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> collaboration.</p>
<p>"A demon begins his HUNT," reads the blurb on Capcom's collaboration trailer, which you can check out for yourself below. Cap-come and have a go if you think you're hard enough (or something like that).</p>

<p>So, what exactly does this Capcom collab - which is slated to arrive in Monster Hunter Wilds on 28th May - include? Well, players will soon be able to get their hands on the free Akuma hunter layered armour, which comes with some special fist-focused actions, as well as a Blanka-chan Palico layered armour which doesn't look at all strange, no sir-y.</p>
<p>To get hold of these Street Fighter inspired goodies, players will need to complete a new side mission known as Ultimate Strength. This is only available for those at Hunter Rank 21 or higher. Don't fret if you aren't quite there yet, though. Once the collaboration arrives later this month, it'll be a permanent addition to the game.</p>
<p>In order to get the ball rolling with this new mission, players will need to have a chat with Quinn at the Oilwell Basin Base Camp.</p>

<p>Along with these freebies, the studio is also releasing separate cosmetic collaboration DLC, but these will need to be purchased. "Please note: these paid DLC items are sold separately and are not available as a pack," Capcom emphasised.</p>
<p>This DLC will include a Chun-Li outfit and a Cammy outfit for Alma, as well as a Blanka-Chan Doll pendant, new gestures and more.</p>
