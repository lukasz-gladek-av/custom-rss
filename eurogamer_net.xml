            <p>Today is the one-year anniversary of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-music-track-list-every-game-song-system">Nintendo Music</a>, the well-received app for smart devices that gives you access to some of the most notable OSTs from the publisher's history. At launch, the app provided us all with a way to listen to music from the likes of Animal Crossing New Horizons, Wii Channels, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-fox-64">Star Fox 64</a>, Metroid, Mario Kart, and more.</p>
<p>Over the past 12 months, we've seen Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-of-gamings-most-memorable-tunes-is-now-available-on-nintendo-music">slowly but surely adding more music</a> to the app, bringing franchises like Fire Emblem, Kirby and more into the service. In a world of muddy legal rights and in which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-donkey-kong-credits-furore-says-it-values-contributions-that-all-staff-make">Nintendo doesn't particularly like handing out full credit to devs that worked on its games</a>, Nintendo Music represents something quite pure, and - importantly - helpful for fans of older games.</p>
<p>But when it comes to physical releases of its music, Nintendo has always been a bit more protective. Yes, it is possible to get some Nintendo OSTs on CD in the West, but it's always been a bit of a chore - these releases have either been tied to promotions, packed-in with games at retail (such as the release for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/zelda-skyward-sword">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</a> back in 2011), or locked behind MyNintendo points redemptions, or similar. The company has long seemed reticent to provide fans with a legal and approachable way to own physical versions of its music. Until this week.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Nintendo and Laced Records <a href="https://store.nintendo.co.uk/en/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-soundtrack-limited-edition-8xlp-box-set-000000000010018665">announced a collaboration</a> that will see the record company launch a couple of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> vinyl soundtrack collections - the first time, ever, that the 136-year-old company will issue products like this outside of Japan.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Mouth-watering, isn't it? | <span>Image credit: <cite>Laced Records</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Releasing 19th June, 2026, Laced and Nintendo are bringing multiple versions of the Breath of the Wild soundtrack to market. The collections come in the form of both two- and eight-LP sets, and will retail at <a href="https://www.lacedrecords.co/products/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-limited-edition-deluxe-double-vinyl">£36 (or $50)</a> and <a href="https://www.lacedrecords.co/products/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-deluxe-x8lp-boxset">£145 ($195)</a>, respectively. The two-disc set will contain a curated tracklist of 34 songs, whilst the bigger eight-disc set will house a massive 130 tracks from the game. The songs are arranged by mood and theme, meaning each side should present a soundscape and tone familiar to anyone that's played through Link's Hyrule adventure.</p><p>"When I founded Laced over 10 years ago, I could have only dreamt about partnering with such an iconic game company as Nintendo," says Danny Kelleher, founder and CEO of Laced Records. "To bring these beautiful vinyl products to life for The Legend of Zelda franchise has been a dream come true for me and the team at Laced. We worked closely with Nintendo to ensure these vinyl releases were of the highest quality, from the design and packaging to sequencing the tracklists for the two LP and the eight LP.</p>
<p>"The fan and video game vinyl community response has been incredibly positive. After months of hard work behind the scenes with Nintendo, it's a real honour to finally share these products with the world."</p>
<p>I'm sure it's been no small feat getting Nintendo on-board with this deal; the fact that a relatively small British company has managed to get Nintendo to play ball on a release like this is a watershed moment, and perhaps - <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2025/10/29/breath-of-the-wild-vinyl-nintendo-music/">per comments given to the Washington Post</a> by Bill Trinen, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a>’s vice president of player and product experience - represents Nintendo testing the market ahead of more releases in a similar vein.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>"As we're looking at Nintendo and our intellectual property, one of the things we've really started to zero in on is there's a lot more opportunity around music and we've got a broad music library," Trinen said to the outlet. Official Pokémon vinyl, anyone?</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>One of my most prized records. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As for Laced, as an avid collector of video game music and records, I can say that the company produces incredibly well-made products, and its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hotline-miami">Hotline Miami</a> OST collection is one of the records I'm most protective of in my collection. Laced's Tekken 3 print is just behind it (at least when it comes to VGM). The asking price may be quite steep, but I think the quality is there, and - for any of you waxheads out there - this stuff tends to accrue value at a ludicrous rate, too, so it's always going to be a decent investment.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing where this collaboration takes us. The gaming audience, in particular, seems hungry for ownership of its purchases, and a move towards more readily-available physical media can only ever be a good thing, as far as I'm concerned. I'll be watching this space with anticipation.</p>

            <p>Don McGowan is an attorney who knows what he's talking about when it comes to understanding what Microsoft might do following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-microsoft-be-able-to-stop-the-white-house-using-ai-generated-halo-imagery-to-depict-trump-as-master-chief-and-to-promote-and-recruit-for-ice-depressingly-i-doubt-it">the Trump administration's provocative use of the Halo IP</a> on social media this week. He was a senior attorney at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> for three years. He was also chief legal officer at The Pokémon Company for a decade - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-pokemon-company-confirms-that-no-its-imagery-was-not-granted-for-use-in-disturbing-us-department-of-homeland-security-video">another brand recently abused by the Trump administration</a>. McGowan, currently a partner at KUSK Law and principal at Extreme Grownup Services, has given me an insight into what Microsoft's current thinking might be.</p>
<p>Quickly if you don't know: we're talking about The White House tweeting an AI-generated image of Trump as Halo protagonist Master Chief, and the Department of Homeland Security tweeting an AI-generated Halo image promoting ICE, which showed Halo spartan soldiers on a Warthog jeep on a Halo ring world alongside a call to destroy the Flood - a thinly veiled and deplorable reference to illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Understandably, such use of the Halo IP has caused fierce backlash, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-administrations-use-of-halo-ought-to-offend-every-halo-fan-regardless-of-political-orientation-says-key-series-designer">including strongly worded reprimands from the original creators of the Halo series and games</a>.</p>
<p>But the question has remained, all through this week, what Microsoft intends to do about it, because it hasn't said or done anything noticeable yet. "If I were Microsoft looking at this situation I would game-out the benefits and drawbacks of making this an issue," McGowan told me.</p><p>"One of Microsoft's biggest customers is the US government. Think of how many Windows licenses, Azure instances, Office 365 licenses, etc. the government has. Why would Microsoft take a step that puts those at risk? Microsoft has a dedicated federal government sales team, which means if that customer goes away, so might those jobs.</p>
<p>"It's always worth remembering how companies see themselves to understand what they're trying to do," he explained. "Microsoft is a business software company (Nintendo is a consumer electronics company and Sony is a bank). As in: The list of brands Microsoft wants most to protect probably doesn't have Halo on it, and the customers with whom it wants to protect its reputation are institutional customers. The tail doesn't wag the dog. This might lead to a reduced customer base for Xbox but that's less of an existential problem than fighting with a government."</p>
<p>Were this situation left to McGowan to deal with - and bear in mind it's been 17 years since he worked at Microsoft - he told me the first thing he'd do is have someone make a call to the government and have a friendly word.</p>
<p>"I would have Fred Humphries, the head of [Government Affairs at Microsoft], make a call to someone friendly in the Administration and say hey, could you do us a solid and use someone else's IP for a while? That might be challenging because the obvious substitute IP is Call of Duty and that's theirs also, but still."</p>
<p>There are already clues this might have happened in <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1983604918239031569">the Department of Homeland Security's pivot to  using imagery from The Lord of the Rings films</a> instead of Halo.</p>
<p>"What I wouldn't do is anything public," McGowan added. "I might let <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> say something like 'we wish they wouldn't have done that' in an unrelated interview. But that's as far as I'd go."</p>

<p>There's also a related question of precedent here. We saw a few months ago the usually litigation-quick Pokémon Company seemingly do nothing about the egregious use of Pokémon in an ICE promotional video. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-flood-are-evil-space-zombie-parasites-and-are-not-an-allegory-to-any-group-of-people-original-halo-devs-hit-out-at-homeland-security-ice-recruitment-ad">McGowan told IGN</a> recently he wouldn't have touched this either, were he still working there, "and I'm the most trigger-happy CLO [Chief Legal Officer] I've ever met", he said.</p><p>Does Microsoft's apparent inaction here, in addition to The Pokémon Company's apparent inaction, open the door for other parties to use these IPs as they see fit, too? Does it create an argument of some legal weight whereby someone can say 'hey they did it worse'?</p>
<p>"I'm a big believer that people and companies have the right to be capricious," McGowan told me. "Letting someone do a thing doesn't obligate you to let everyone do that thing, and so if you see a thing you don't have to stop it.</p>
<p>"Copyright isn't trademark where there's a legal obligation to stop people from infringing," he explained. "You can let someone infringe your copyrights without issue, except that a future judge might not give huge damages for future infringement on account of judges are people. But letting [Customs and Border Patrol, which is part of the Department for Homeland Security] do this has no legal impact in the future."</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> community is on the hunt for Easter eggs, with one persistent player managing to clip inside a hidden room attached to the in-game shooting range.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ok2yig/hidden_room_in_the_shooting_range/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Posted on the Battlefield reddit</a>, user Mobile_Cyberdemon_as showed off the process required to get past the door marked 'keep door closed'. Facing the door, look to the left and you'll see a small rubbish bin on the floor. By going prone on top of this bin at just the right angle, you can clip through the wall and access the hidden room.</p>
<p>What's inside the room isn't particularly exciting, with only some furniture and a helmet or two littered around, but nonetheless it raises the question of why it's there in the first place? It could just be a layover from a previous design of the shooting range, certainly. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ok2yig/comment/nm7oq32/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Though some players believe it could indicate a future expansion to the shooting range</a>, perhaps for vehicles.</p>

<p>Others have pointed out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ok2yig/comment/nm7ri9z/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">that the stripy background you can see on the walls of this hidden room looks the same as the background when you customise a weapon</a>, meaning <em>this</em> could be where the customisation actually takes place in-game. It's entirely possible, it's common for separate screens like weapon customisation to take place in the environment out of sight via usual means as to avoid lengthy loading screens.</p><p>This marks the first big discovery in Battlefield 6's inevitable hunt for Easter eggs, a practice that has flourished for years given every game in the series' hidden treasures sprinkled throughout the games. For example, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-mirrors-edge-easter-egg-in-battlefield-2042s-new-map">in Battlefield 2042 there was a Mirror's Edge Easter egg</a> tucked away on the map Flashpoint. Players were able to find a pair of red running shoes by a crane, a clear nod to a gaming classic.</p>
<p>So while this hidden shooting range room isn't the treasure trove players were hoping for, it is regardless a step in the right direction. Who knows, maybe with some more snooping, this room could reveal additional secrets… Or maybe it's a cool red herring. Only time will tell!</p>

            <p>Epic Games has announced that Sidekicks are coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, little pets that you can bring with you into the battle royale as well as other in-game experiences within the Fortnite platform.</p>
<p>These sidekicks are essentially another form of cosmetic that players can earn and, of course, buy. They are customisable, and can even be given cute little accessories. The first sidekick to come to the game is Peels, a small yellow banana dog who'll be present in the next battle pass starting the 1st November.</p>
<p>If you're not feeling Peels, there's another bunch coming in November as part of the in-game shop. This includes Bonesy, Spike, and Lil-Raptor. Epic Games has also teased that some type of cat sidekick is set to come to Fortnite in the near future too, so there should be plenty of options. And that’s before we get to the inevitable IP tie-in stuff that’ll be sure to rear its head in the future.</p>

<figcaption>Here's a new tutorial video for the sidekicks coming to Fortnite.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N0m9H13pGM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Sidekicks do not provide any in-game advantage, though they can be interacted with thanks to new sidekick emotes coming to Fornite. They also can "react to the world around you", though how exactly that works remains a mystery as of writing.</p><p>One quirk of the sidekick features is that a sidekick can only be customised one time after they're acquired, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/fortnite-battle-royale-c-202300000001636/gameplay-c-202300000001721/how-do-i-customize-the-appearance-of-my-sidekick-a202300000021343">as declared on the Epic Games help website</a>. You can, however, buy the same sidekick multiple times, and can own several copies of the same sidekick as long as their customisation options are different. So, for example, you can own one red Lil Raptor, and one green Lil Raptor. You cannot own two green Lil Raptors.</p>
<p>Who doesn't love pets in video games? Even if they are just cosmetics when you really think about it, a little fella running alongside you, doing tricks or dancing on command? It's a surefire way to please people, and on Epic's part, a nice way of tempting folks to spend a little extra this month on Fortnite.</p>
