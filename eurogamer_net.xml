        <p>"We will be working over the next few weeks to find all of our team new homes."</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Jar of Sparks, the Seattle-based "AAA" studio established by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> head of design Jerry Hook back in 2022, has halted work its currently unannounced first title as it searches for a new publishing partner, and that's it's looking to "find all of our team new homes" as a result.
</p>
<p>
When Jar of Sparks was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-design-jerry-hook-leading-new-netease-studio-jar-of-sparks">initially unveiled</a> in July 2022, it was described as a first-party developer for Chinese publisher NetEase that would focus on creating the "next generation of narrative-driven action games". Little has been heard from the studio since then, but Hook - who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinites-head-of-design-jerry-hook-leaves-343-industries">announced his departure</a> from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/343-industries">343 Industries</a> and Microsoft back in May 2002 - has now <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/jar-of-sparks/posts/">shared a statement on LinkedIn</a>, suggesting Jar of Sparks' future is uncertain.
</p>
<p>
"Earlier today," Hook wrote, "we notified our team that Jar of Sparks will be halting work on our current title as we search for a new publishing partner who can help bring our creative vision to life. Throughout this journey, our passionate, driven, and innovative team took bold risks and pushed boundaries, striving to create something truly new and exciting for the industry. We couldn’t be prouder of the groundwork we’ve laid together."
</p>
<p>
"As we prepare for this next step," Hook continued, "our talented team members will be exploring new opportunities... From the day we formed Jar of Sparks to this very moment, this team has accomplished remarkable feats—proving that a small, focused, and dedicated group can achieve great results. We thank each of them for their courage, skill, and friendship."
</p><p>
Jar of Sparks' announcement doesn't mention layoffs explicitly, but a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jerry-hook-1807781_earlier-today-we-notified-our-team-that-activity-7282186867880407040-fNNK">separate post from Hook</a> says the studio "will be working over the next few weeks to find all of our team new homes as we close our first project", suggesting the majority of staff will be departing following today's news. Eurogamer has reached out to Jar of Sparks for clarification, and to NetEase regarding its current relationship with the studio.
</p>
<p>
"Thank you to everyone who supported us throughout our journey here at Jar of Sparks," the statement concludes. "We look forward to updating you all with our next step in our journey."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shows-off-conceptual-immersive-gaming-tech-that-lets-you-stand-in-a-tv-box-and-sniff-the-last-of-us<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Curious to know what wild ideas Sony might be pondering for the future of gaming? Well, you're in luck: it's just unveiled new conceptual technology designed to ramp up immersion by sticking players inside a TV box and squirting smells into the room. So if you've ever wanted a whiff of Kratos after a hard day's slaying, your dreams are now one step closer to reality.
</p>
<p>
Not that Sony's Future Immersive Entertainment Concept (as it's officially known) is likely to be coming to living rooms anytime soon. As its name suggests, this is very much a CES 2025-focused proof-of-concept, showcasing just one possible future avenue for more immersive gaming, and not something even remotely close to production. It is, though, kind of neat, in a wildly gimmicky kind of way - taking some already existing ideas (all-encompassing displays, atmospherics whiffs, and so on) then reimagining them with cutting edge tech.
</p>
<p>
Essentially, Sony's Future Immersive Entertainment Concept is a giant cube of LED panels that completely surrounds the players inside. As they explore the game world - that of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s The Last of Us in the case of Sony's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jnhpsJe4bQ">new showcase trailer</a> - players are bombarded with  "audio, haptics, scent, and atmospherics" designed to draw them further into the experience.

<p>
Additionally, it's possible to wield physical tools that interact with the world on-screen, and we're shown a flashlight that only illuminates whatever it's being pointing at, as well as various weapons. The downside to all this, of course, is that it's really only convincing with static scenes (plus you'd need an arena-sized living room and a big wad of cash to accommodate it), but the upside is it could finally let you whiff the fruity fungal bouquet of a mouldering Clicker. <em>Yum</em>.
</p><p>
Some might argue a more immediately viable solution for greater gaming immersion would be VR, but Sony doesn't appear to be in any particular rush to do anything meaningful with PSVR2 - so your closest equivalent to its The Last of Us immersive concept right now is probably standing in the kitchen with the lights off and getting someone to pelt you with mushrooms.
</p>
<p>
If all the above sounds like an excessively energetic way to get your The Last of Us fix, you could also just plop yourself in front of the TV ready for season two of HBO's acclaimed live-action adaptation, which was recently confirmed to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-2-trailer-teases-two-of-the-games-most-impactful-scenes">airing this April</a>. PC owners can also get <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-finally-gets-itself-a-pc-release-date">stuck into The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a> at the same time (3rd April, more specifically), but there might be a bit of a wait for new The Last of Us stuff given that Naughty Dog its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">currently working on sci-fi hack-and-slasher Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.

            <p>
While some handheld gaming PC manufacturers are busy cornering the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/acer-unveils-dubiously-portable-nitro-blaze-11-handheld-gaming-pc-with-1095-inch-screen">comically large form factor market</a>, Lenovo has slipped in to announce several new - and considerably more portable - devices of its own, including the Legion Go 2 and a handheld utilising SteamOS.
</p>
<p>
Starting with the Legion Go 2, that's Lenovo's currently still-in-prototype second generation handheld gaming PC, which - alongside its built-in kickstand and ergonomically improved detachable controllers - sports an 8.8-inch OLED display with VRR support, and comes equipped with either the upcoming AMD Ryzen Z2 or Ryzen Z2 Extreme. It can also sport up to 32GB of RAM and 2TB of SSD storage, to further boost its beefy credentials.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, there's no hint of a release window or price for the Legion Go 2 just yet, with Lenovo instead choosing to focus its attention on its other newly announced handheld gaming PC: the more modest, and more imminently available, Legion Go S.
</p>

 </a>

<p>
The Legion Go S offers a sleeker alternative to Lenovo's existing Legion Go, doing away with the former's detachable controllers in favour of a more rounded all-in-one design. It features an 8-inch, 16:10 IPS LCD multi-touch screen (with a 120Hz variable refresh rate and 1920 x 1200 resolution), alongside hall-effect thumbsticks, a redesigned D-pad, and dual stage triggers.
</p><p>
As for the insides, Legion Go S includes either an AMD Ryzen Z2 Go or Z1 Extreme processor, and can be equipped with up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD. All this lives inside a 299mm x 127.6 x 22.6 shell and weighs upwards of 730g - around 90g heavier than Steam Deck. Lenovo tells <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">The Verge</a> it's targeting two to 2.5 hours of battery life for demanding games.

<p>
Lenovo's first Legion Go S model begins shipping this month, costing £649.99/$729.99 with the Z2 Go processor, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. It'll be followed in May by a slightly lower-specced £600/$599.99 variant, featuring the Z2 Go, 16GB RAM, and 1TB storage. Both machines utilise Windows 11, but Lenovo is also working on a SteamOS-powered Go S, making it the first authorised third-party handheld gaming device to utilise Valve's operating system. This is the cheapest of the bunch, costing $499.99 with the Z2 Go, 16GB RAM, and 512GB storage - and The Verge reports it should also arrive in May.
</p>
<p>
For anyone with an eye on the slightly more distant future, however, Digital Foundry has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-amd-announces-next-gen-ryzen-z2-apus-for-gaming-handhelds">taken a look</a> at AMD's newly announced trio of next-gen Ryzen Z-series APUs - the kind that'll be packed into Lenovo's second generation Legion Go 2 - if you're curious to learn more.
