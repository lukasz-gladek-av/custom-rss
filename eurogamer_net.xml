            <p>
With Indiana Jones &amp; the Great Circle and Doom: The Dark Ages both waiting in the wings, Microsoft confirmed another of its first-party titles making the jump to PS5. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> is coming to Sony's console this "spring", and new content for all platforms is also on the way.
</p>
<p>
Forza Horizon 5 originally released back in 2021, taking the acclaimed open-world racing series to Mexico - or at least a fictional island amalgam, drawing extensive inspiration from the country's landmarks and features. Eurogamer called it "another gorgeous and enveloping pocket holiday" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-5-review-the-ultimate-big-tent-driving-game-cruises-to-mexico">our Recommended review</a>, highlighting its racing's "enviable tightrope-walk between structure and player freedom".
</p>
<p>
Which is to say it's another great former Xbox console exclusive for PlayStation owners to get acquainted with. Forza Horizon 5's PlayStation release will support cross-play with other platforms, and includes the same content as the PC and Xbox versions - with additional Car Packs and its two expansions, Hot Wheels and Rally Adventure, also available for purchase.

<p>
Additionally, Microsoft has <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-5-comes-to-ps5">announced a free new content update</a> for all platforms, albeit one without a current ETA. Horizon Realms, as it's known, promises to give players the "chance to explore a curated collection of some of the community's favourite previously released Evolving Worlds", alongside some other "surprises".
</p><p>
Forza Horizon 5's leap to PS5 comes after Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-confirms-multiplatform-future-is-here-to-stay">confirmed its new multi-console release strategy</a> last year. 2024 laid the foundations with the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, Grounded, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, and Pentiment on PlayStation, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, Doom: The Dark Ages, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2 so far confirmed for 2025.
</p>
<p>
The start of this year also brought reports pointing to other Xbox games bound for PlayStation, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-reportedly-getting-halo-and-another-big-xbox-game-with-microsoft-set-to-be-a-very-big-supporter">PS5 versions of Halo: The Masterchief Collection and Flight Simulator</a> claimed to be on the way. Previously, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said there were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">no "red lines"</a> when it came to the games Microsoft was willing to port to Sony's console.

            <p>
Sony has announced it's very nearly time to bid a fond farewell to those PS5 themes it released in celebration of PlayStation's 30th anniversary last year. But the good news is it has plans to bring them back following a "fantastic response" from players.
</p>
<p>
Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-playstation-30th-anniversary-ps5-update-turns-your-console-retro-for-a-limited-time">released a number nostalgia-laden PS5 themes</a> last December, featuring visuals and sounds intended to evoke memories of different console eras. There was one for PlayStation 1, PS2, PS3, and PS4, plus a theme more broadly celebrating the PlayStation brand's big three-oh.
</p>
<p>
The party, however, is almost over, with Sony having now confirmed all its limited-time anniversary themes will cease to be available from Friday, 31st January. Announcing the news on social media, it thanked fans for the "fantastic response" to the themes.

<p>
In fact, the response appears to have been good enough that Sony's had a bit of change of heart regarding the classic console themes' temporary nature. It also revealed it'll be making the designs available again "in the months ahead", just as soon as it's finished "doing some work behind the scenes" to bring them back.
</p><p>
Alongside those retro themes, PlayStation's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-30th-anniversary-celebrations-include-digital-soundtracks-and-a-board-game">30th anniversary celebrations</a> also saw the release of some strikingly designed, PS1-inspired <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-and-digital-edition-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-consoles-announced">limited edition PS5s</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-to-release-free-to-play-my-first-gran-turismo-to-celebrate-playstations-30th-anniversary?view=comments">free-to-play version of Grand Turismo</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-death-stranding-and-the-last-of-us-star-in-playstations-nostalgia-fuelled-30th-anniversary-thank-you-video">nostalgia-heavy thank-you video</a>. Eurogamer also got in the celebratory mood with our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-30th-anniversary">PlayStation 30th anniversary theme week</a>, which is well worth a browse.
