            <p>Last year, Camouflaj and Oculus Studios released a Batman-flavoured VR release in the form of Arkham Shadows, and it looks like the teams are taking another bite of the apple.</p>
<p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://www.culturecombine.com/post/exclusive-interview-mark-rolston-talks-aliens-shawshank-and-spider-man-3-at-fan-expo-chicago-2025?ref=uploadvr.com">Culture Combine</a>, which was spotted by <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-voice-actor-confirms/">UploadVR</a>, Commissioner Gordon's actor confirmed a sequel is in the works.</p>
<p>Actor Mark Rolston was chatting about his career, and the difference between approaching games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> and Spider-Man 2.</p>
<p>"In the Blade Runner game, I was a voiceover, but for Spider-Man, I do complete motion capture, voice, and everything," the actor told the publication, before slipping this little nugget of information into the conversation:</p>
<p>"Same thing with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-shadow">Batman Arkham Shadow</a> VR game. We're about to start another one of those. I play Commissioner Gordon."</p>
<p>So, there you have it!</p>
<p>Our Ian rather enjoyed Batman Arkham Shadow in its release last year. "Batman Arkham Shadow can feel rough around the edges at times, but it's still a more than worthy entry to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-games-order">Arkham series</a>, and an essential Quest 3 experience," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Eurogamer's four star Batman Arkham Shadow review</a>.</p>

            <p>
Roblox has announced it will expand its age estimation requirement to all users of the platform who access its communication features by the end of the year.
</p>
<p>
Back in July, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-introduces-new-safety-features-including-an-ai-to-estimate-a-teenagers-age-through-video-selfies">platform introduced new safety features</a>, including an AI used to estimate a user's age through video selfie. Now, in a new statement, the company plans to roll out age verification for all users, through facial age estimation, ID age verification, and verified parental consent.
</p>
<p>
Roblox also plans to limit communication between adults and minors, unless they know each other in the real world.
</p>
<p>
"These added layers of protection will help provide users with access to developmentally appropriate features and content," reads the <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/09/roblox-to-expand-age-estimation-to-all-users">statement from chief safety officer Matt Kaufman</a>. "We hope this move sets a standard that other gaming, social media, and communication platforms follow."
</p>
<p>
In addition to age estimation, Roblox has made a number of other advancements in its safety features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing Trusted Connections, as per its <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/07/advancing-safety-on-roblox-with-age-based-communication">previous update</a>, to safeguard communication</li>
<li>Using its open-source AI system Roblox Sentinel to detect early signs of child endangerment</li>
<li>Improving voice and text filters</li>
<li>Rolling out new technology to detect specific servers where large numbers of users are breaking rules</li>
<li>Refining its avatar detection model to scan for player characters breaking rules</li>
</ul>

<p>
Since January 2025, Roblox has shipped over a hundred safety initiatives in an effort to prove its commitment to child safety.
</p>
<p>
This is in response to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-accused-of-being-unsafe-environment-for-children">numerous reports of questionable safety</a>, for which Roblox has long been criticised.
