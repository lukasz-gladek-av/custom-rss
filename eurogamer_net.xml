            <p>Ubisoft has shared its Winter Roadmap for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.</p>
<p>The roadmap includes a community parkour challenge, as well as full manual jump, a detailed stats page and critical hit visual improvements. These particular upcoming additions all arrive tomorrow, 17th February.</p>
<p>Ubisoft has said Shadows' upcoming detailed stats page will be ideal for "all the min-maxers out there". As for that manual jump being added to Parkour, players will need to enable Advanced Parkour Options in the gameplay settings to get this chap working.</p>
<p>If you are curious about that aforementioned community parkour challenge, here is what <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3159330/view/535499747044098727">Ubisoft</a> has to say about it all:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>How to participate</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Create your perfect one-shot run</li>
<li>Think flow, style, momentum. Choose a unique location or craft the coolest combo you can imagine. Your clip must be: One unedited shot, 45 to 60 seconds long and set anywhere in the world of Assassin's Creed Shadows</li>
<li>Upload and share: Upload your run to YouTube before March 8th, then share it on X using #ACShadowsParkourChallenge.</li>
<li>Get noticed: You might become one of the lucky few that'll be showcased across Ubisoft social media or win cool prizes!</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Then looking ahead to next month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> players can expect the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-post-launch-roadmap-features-regular-new-story-missions-parkour-updates-new-game-plus">Assassin's Creed Shadows' Claws of Awaji expansion</a> on 10th March. This expansion introduces a new region, as well as a new weapon and abilities, new outfits and legendary gear, a new enemy faction and bosses, and a new chapter of Shadow's story. Ahead of its release elsewhere, Ubisoft said this expansion would add over 10 hours of content to the game.</p>
<p>Last up for this batch of winter events, all players can look forward to livestreams and giveaways to celebrate the game's first anniversary on 20th March.</p>

<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows had a strong debut on its release last year, and in July Ubisoft celebrated five million players (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-ubisoft-hints">which also made up 2bn stealth kills and 38 million animals petted</a>). That number will of course be higher now, thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/want-to-know-how-assassins-creed-shadows-works-on-switch-2-ubisoft-details-console-specific-features-and-more">Shadows' Switch 2 release in December</a>.</p><p>It hasn't all been good news for the Assassin's Creed franchise and Ubisoft, though. In October, then-Assassin's Creed leader Marc-Alexis Côté left the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-formation-of-tencent-subsidiary">following the formation of the new Tencent-backed subsidiary</a> Vantage Studios. It soon transpired that Côté "did not walk away" but was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-assassins-creed-boss-clarifies-he-did-not-walk-away-from-series-but-was-asked-to-step-aside-by-ubisoft">asked to "step aside" by Ubisoft</a>. In January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-cote-sues-ubisoft">it was reported Côté was suing Ubisoft</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in franchise news, Netflix's Assassin's Creed adaptation is finally picking up some momentum, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-announces-assassins-creed-live-action-series">having been initially announced several years ago</a>. The show is set to star Toby Wallace, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-assassins-creed-adaptation-lands-first-lead-cast-member-in-euphoria-and-eden-actor">with the Eden actor said to play a co-lead in Netflix's Assassin's Creed series</a>.</p>

            <p>Some upcoming skins for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> which initially had edgy skull masks appear to have been drastically changed to look a bit more realistic, judging by community findings.</p>
<p>These skins, <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1x4zaBaEKK/?spm_id_from=333.1387.collection.video_card.click">which you can see in their original glory on Bilibili</a>, are a mix between standard military face paints donning stylised combat gear and straight up My Chemical Romance vibe skull masks over military headgear. Those latter skins drawing the ire of a portion of the Battlefield 6 playerbase, especially those who want the game to stay grounded.</p>
<p>"They're all garbage. I just want new playable content, new mechanics and equipment, more vehicle customization, and a customizable class ability system like in BF4," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r2slm0/comment/o4z2kj1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">wrote user Kejdurapa on the Battlefield Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>However, luckily for those with a similar taste to the pro-realism Battlefield crowd, additional screenshots released in the following days <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r6727r/most_of_upcoming_skins_have_changed/">appear to show these same skins toned down in edginess drastically</a>. This either indicates an overhauled version of these same skins, or perhaps an alternative version for those same skins.</p><p>As you can imagine, those previously aggravated Battlefield enjoyers are now very pleased indeed. "That's more like it, not the clown show that was in season 1," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r6727r/comment/o5o0ewb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">wrote Ali-S earlier today</a>. Their sentiment was shared by one eaeb4, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r6727r/comment/o5o1jg0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">who wrote</a>: "This is a big improvement across the board. Some people might like some of the skull mask designs but we don't need it on every other skin.</p>
<p>You may be thinking, who cares, right? A few skins look to have been changed in a live service shooter. Well, it's worth noting that Battlefield 6 was sold to players on the back of its realistic approach, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-live-action-trailer-is-its-biggest-jab-at-call-of-duty-yet-makes-a-point-out-of-blowing-up-zac-efron">making direct comparisons to its major competitor Call of Duty and its wackier approach to modern military warfare</a>.</p>
<p>This was true even in pre-release interviews. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield">Lead developers told Eurogamer the game would</a> "stray true to Battlefield" when asked about its approach to cosmetics, indicating a desire to keep things away from the wilder fantasies created elsewhere. These skull masks, as well as some prior DLC released in Battlefield 6, have strained such statements.</p>
<p>Whether things like these skull-faced cosmetics will be buried forever, or if a hint of the absurd will continue to creep into Battlefield 6, is a question for the future. What isn't a question is where the Eurogamer Battlefield 6 review is - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">it's right here</a>.</p>
