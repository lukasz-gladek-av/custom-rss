            <p>Remedy has announced the content and update plan for its three-player co-op Control spinoff, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>.</p>
<p>"It has been approximately four weeks since we launched FBC: Firebreak. During that time, we have released four patches that improve the game and partly address your feedback. Now that the game is live, our community plays a big part in shaping the future of the experience. This is just the start," Remedy has said, stating the frequency of its updates will now slow as the team gears up for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-multiplayer-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-has-two-major-updates-planned-for-this-year">first major update due this September</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of that September launch, though, the studio has a few points it will be focusing on in the coming months. These are: understanding the game, upgraded gunplay, new ways to play and more things to do.</p>

<p>On the 'understanding the game' front, Remedy said it wants to improve the onboarding process and playable tutorial level, with the developer admitting many players leave within the first hour out of frustration. "You feel ineffective and confused as to what to do," Remedy acknowledged. "This needs to be improved."</p>
<p>When it comes to Firebreak's gunplay, the studio wants to give more control to players as to how weapons progress, and so it will introduce a mod system down the line.</p>
<p>"We don't plan to become a game with 100 guns because we don't believe that's the right focus for our experience. That said, it's important for us to deliver on meaningful variety, so we are adding three new heavy guns to round out your arsenal," Remedy furthered.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Remedy</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Major changes to the way players access Jobs - and to the content of Jobs themselves - are also on the way to FBC: Firebreak. This will offer players "more ways to play" as well as a "more surprising and exciting way of getting there".</p>
<p>Next up for this round of communication is Remedy's 'More things to do' objective. "When we think about content variety, we aren't just looking at how much is there, but also what it's like to replay what is there," the studio said. "Always knowing what to expect is counter to the fantasy of being a crisis responder. So, while we still want you to know what type of experience you're stepping into, we want to mix up what specific things you need to do there to proceed through zones (especially zones 1 and 2), making runs a lot more dynamic and surprising."</p>
<p>With that in mind, Remedy is now looking at what randomisations it can add to the mix, including things like placement of key items and ammo stations as just two examples.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Remedy</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As for that major update in September, that will bring a brand new Job for players to try out. This will, in the words of Remedy itself, require you to "identify and eliminate and hopefully not eat strains of mould" using something the team has dubbed internally as The Sushi Train.</p>
<p>"As we hope has become clear, we are pushing a lot of improvements and changes into the game for our first Major Update," Remedy said.</p>
<p>"We are extremely excited about these changes and about delivering even more than we'd originally been planning, but changes now also mean changes later. We need to see what's working for you and to hear from you again before we can be certain that we're prioritising the right things," it concluded.  "So, while we are still planning on the next major update in the winter, and the next one after that, the specific focuses and features are a lot more nebulous."</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreak-review">Eurogamer's FBC Firebreak review</a>, we awarded it three out of five stars, writing: "A bold approach to the concept of work marks this game out as a singular enterprise."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreak-team-acknowledges-onboarding-frustrations-assuring-things-will-change]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sucker Punch's upcoming PlayStation 5 exclusive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> is getting its own official popcorn bucket, but it's proven so popular it has already sold out online.</p>
<p>The bucket itself was available to pre-order from <a href="https://t.co/Kre862VVjF">AlamoMart</a>, and is shaped like a traditional Japanese rice basket. It was released for pre-order to coincide with Alamo Drafthouse's "curated" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/way-samurai">Way of the Samurai</a> film programme, which will showcase five films that helped define the genre. This series of films will <a href="https://x.com/alamodrafthouse/status/1945892543234805970/photo/1">be hosted in August</a> at select Alamo Drafthouse theaters.</p>

<p>Anyway, the hand painted Ghost of Yōtei Popcorn Bucket, as it is known, itself retailed for $40. That's around £30 here in the UK, though not factoring in any shipping costs. It was designed by Sony's own artists, and has a 100oz capacity.</p>
<p>"Elevate your movie snack game with the limited-edition Ghost of Yōtei Popcorn Bucket," the description reads, with Alamo Drafthouse calling it "the perfect keepsake for any aspiring warrior".</p>
<p>A perfect keepsake it may well be, but even though the popcorn bucket was only revealed last night, it has already sold out online. Sorry for any of you who were looking forward to reaching into a Ghost of Yōtei-themed food vessel, but that chap just simply isn't available any more. I have popped my email address into the 'Notify Me When Available' tab, so will let you know if this changes.</p>

            <p>The next round of Everdark Sovereigns will be added to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> on 31st July, with four enhanced Nightlords available to beat.</p>
<p>In a nod towards live service updates, these <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-update-brings-new-challenges-and-a-welcome-live-service-twist">extra challenging Everdark Sovereigns were added to the game on a rotating basis last month</a>, with three added individually over three weeks. Then, last week, FromSoftware announced these would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-nightfarers-youll-get-another-chance-to-beat-elden-ring-nightreigns-sovereign-super-bosses">rotate again before new additions arrived</a>.</p>
<p>Now we know the enhanced Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast and Fissure in the Fog will arrive on 31st July - so that's immediately after the current rotation concludes.</p>

<p>While not confirmed, presumably these will be added to the game one at a time on a rotating basis over the course of four weeks. And after that? Perhaps they'll come round again.</p>
<p>Still, what players are really after is a duo mode. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">FromSoftware confirmed at the start of last month the mode is on the way</a>, but no further details have been provided.</p> <div>

<p>We also know DLC is on the way and due before the end of the year, but it's unknown when or what this will include. While more content will be very welcome, it's somewhat frustrating this isn't being doled out more frequently.</p>
