            <p>The Last of Us Part 2 made its PC debut just yesterday, but already the game has been cracked.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-last-of-us-part-2-pc-steam-playstation-cracked/">The Gamer</a>, video game pirates have found a way to get the game off Steam - its legitimate PC storefront - for torrenting, less than 24 hours since its release. Posts on social media reveal that the game is available from unofficial sources.</p>

</figure>
<p>This means that while The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered itself has 15,885 players on Steam at the time of writing, there are likely some players elsewhere given its unofficial PC availability - though it's hard to tell how much pirating has impacted sales so far.</p>
<p>The Last of Us 2 Remastered <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?compare=1888930,2531310">currently has a concurrent player peak of 23,350</a> on Valve's platform. To compare, The Last of Us Part 1 - which was released on PC in 2023, in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-knows-the-last-of-us-part-1-on-pc-hasnt-delivered-the-naughty-dog-quality-you-expected">rather sorry state</a> - has a Steam concurrent player peak of 36,496.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry took The Last of Us Part 2 out for a spin on PC ahead of its release. "It's a better game on launch than Part 1, but with some frustrating elements and a buggy feeling that's hard to shake," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-the-last-of-us-part-2-a-better-pc-port-but-not-a-great-one">Alex Battaglia wrote following his time with The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered on PC</a>.</p>
<p>"Beyond the disappointingly high GPU requirements, the biggest complaint here are the frame-time spikes that occur even on high-end kit, which seems incongruous with the game's cinematic presentation."</p>
<p>Still, it doesn't look like any of Part 2's issues are going to get memed in the same way <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-many-pc-glitches-are-being-turned-into-memes">The Last of Us Part 1 did on its own PC release</a>.</p>

            <p>Nintendo's upcoming Switch 2 console doesn't actually run the original Switch's games natively, as the two hardwares are incompatible.</p>
<p>One of the first things that we knew for absolute certain about the Switch successor was that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">it would be backwards compatible</a>. "At today's Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch," company president Shuntaro Furukawa said in November.</p>
<p>But, while this means Switch 2 owners will still be able to play most of the games from the original Switch's library, this isn't possible because the two consoles are compatible at a hardware level, which would have been handy. Rather, it's all possible thanks to a workaround Nintendo has managed to implement.</p>

<p>During a recent <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4/">Ask the Developer Q&amp;A</a>, Nintendo's Kouichi Kawamoto said the Switch 2 team always wanted the new system to play the original console's games, but "were told there'd be technical challenges" getting it to work.</p>
<p>"When we first started Switch 2 development, the focus was on enhancing its performance as hardware, namely, expanding its capacity," added Takuhiro Dohta. "So, compatibility was a lower priority."</p>
<p>But, it was still something the team wanted to ensure, and in the end the Switch 2 developers settled on "the challenge of using new technology to run Switch games".</p>
<p>Said Dohta: "If we tried to use technology like software emulators, we'd have to run Switch 2 at full capacity, but that would mean the battery wouldn't last so long, so we did something thatâ€™s somewhere in between a software emulator and hardware compatibility."</p>
<p>The team goes through many checks to make sure original Switch games run smoothly on Switch 2, but the developers noted "it might not be that all Switch games run perfectly" in time for the console's launch this summer.</p>
<p>This method of playing older games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-and-other-games-have-compatibility-issues-with-switch-2">explains why a few titles have some compatibility issues</a>, though fixes are in the works. And while only one Switch game is completely unplayable on Switch 2, others will still require the use of original Joy-Con due to specific controls or peripherals.</p>
<p>"But we will continue our efforts so that we can support as many Switch games as possible," Kawamoto said.</p>
