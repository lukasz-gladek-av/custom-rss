            <p>While <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s cute character designs may suggest something light and effortless, do not be fooled. Silksong is not an easy game to play. In fact, it is darn difficult, requiring plenty of precision, be it platforming of fighting.</p>
<p>Thankfully, developer Team Cherry has popped a number of benches throughout Silksong, where the game's protagonist Hornet (and the player), can take some weight off and recover from the perils that have come before, before heading once more out into the fray. Except, when the team hasn'tâ€¦</p>
<p>You see, many players have come to realise that Team Cherry has in fact planted at least one trick bench in the depths of Silksong, that doesn't really play fair (<strong>please read no further if you do not want to know where</strong>).</p>

<p>Silksong's trick bench can be found in Hunter's March, which itself is found off The Marrow. As with many other areas in Silksong, it is tricky. It's an area you can do early on, but should probably come back to with more upgrades to actually have a better chance of getting through. Needless to say, when you get to a bench, you will likely feel a sense of relief, and want to finally pause and take a breather. Except this trick bench will scupper that breather, and when Hornet sits on it she will activate a spike trap that will whop a load of health off. Ouch!</p><p>A post on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> reddit titled <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1nb3721/i_have_no_words_this_is_the_most_anger_i_have/">'I have no words. This is the most anger I have ever felt for any game ever. I had one mask'</a>, with an accompanying picture of the offending bench, has been commented on by many other players who feel a similar amount of anguish (though largely in good humour).</p>
<p>"I was like 'finally, a bench', sat down at two masks and let go of my keyboard.. Died," one reply reads. "My partner was spectating the whole thing and we just laughed for five minutes.</p>
<p>"Damn, the developer had <em>fun </em>making this game for seven years."</p>

<p>Thankfully, you can disable the trap, and the trick bench then becomes a regular safe bench. If you head to the left side of the bench before sitting on it, you will come across a lever. Swing Hornet's needle at it, and you will deactivate the spikes (phew).</p>

            <p>It's 9th September - I feel like a human calendar - and we're back with another coagulation of all of today's gaming news and events.</p>
<p>Today's question is: 'Borderlands 4 - are you planning to play it?' Because it's creeping up on us: this major new instalment is out on Friday (12th). And I'm curious: is there excitement among you for it? (I'm low-key trying to gauge who I can play with.)</p>
