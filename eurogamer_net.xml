            <p>
Developer Funcom has apologised to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> players and pledged to restore missing vehicles and items after a recent patch inadvertently deleted bases and other equipment.
</p>
<p>
Dune: Awakening, you might recall, recently made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-deep-desert-pve-expansion">significant changes to its end-game</a>, introducing a substantial number of PvE-focused areas to its ever-shifting Deep Desert area following player complaints. During a subsequent update, several PvE-designated areas were inadvertently switched to PvP, and Funcom released a patch on Monday swapping them back.
</p>
<p>
However, as it's now revealed in a <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/developer-update/">new post addressing the issue</a>, these changes weren't supposed to come into effect until the next Coriolis cycle, when the Deep Desert is reset and reshaped by raging sandstorms. As a result of their premature deployment, players who'd set up camp in the impacted areas suddenly found their bases gone and their hard-earned end-game resources and equipment missing. Annoyance, as you might imagine, ensued.

"This was an oversight in our development process and internal communications," Funcom explained in its developer update. "We're incredibly sorry that this happened and we want to acknowledge that this should have been handled better. We've changed our internal processes as a result of this and will be better in the future."
</p>
<p>
The studio has also pledged to restore all lost vehicles and items "to the best of [its] ability", noting that impacted players should see their reimbursed items, materials, and vehicle components appear in Dune: Awakening's in-game Claim Rewards tab by the end of this week. 
</p>
<p>
Funcom's post also addresses a number of additional issues it's currently tackling, including item and vehicles losses resulting from other bugs. "At launch we lacked the tooling and logging to identify and reimburse all circumstances of item loss," it explains. "But we have been working on improving our tools so that we can better reimburse players for vehicle losses due to bugs. There is a backlog of customer support requests, so we beg your patience when waiting for tickets to be resolved." It adds the team is "working to address the root causes of the item loss" and has a "dedicated team focused on mitigating vehicle/item loss on server crashes, disconnects, server mesh transfers, and travelling between maps."

<p>
And finally, Funcom notes its primary focus over the  coming weeks and months will - in addition to addressing critically gameplay issues and introducing quality of life improvements - be to remove identified exploits, including third-party cheat engines, client hacks, and in-game exploitation of game mechanics.
</p>
<p>
"We have zero tolerance for the type of player behaviour that has an impact on the experience of other players," it explains, "and we will continue to focus on ensuring that players can enjoy the game as it is intended." The studio reminds players to report cheats and exploits using the "available reporting channels", and notes it's already "taken action on several hundred players who have abused exploits, cheats and hacks", with "more waves of bans" on the way.
</p>
<p>
As for the game itself, it's a good 'un, teething troubles aside. "[It's] a case study in how to adapt a beloved body of work right," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-review">Eurogamer's Connor Makar wrote in his review</a>. "At a time when triple-A game development tends to play it safe, I'm sure there was real pressure to sand down some of Dune: Awakening's many quirks. I'm very glad that didn't happen."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The soundtrack for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> includes only 10 tracks from the original two games, after Tony Hawk himself wanted to emphasise music discovery.</p>
<p>The full soundtrack was <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/uk/en/blog/2025/06/tony-hawk-pro-skater-three-four-full-soundtrack">revealed at the start of June</a> by publisher Activision, but ahead of the game's full release this week, reviews have criticised changes to the soundtrack and its lack of songs from the original games.</p>
<p>Out of the 69 songs across both Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4, only 10 from the original games have been included. Instead, in some instances, a different song from the same artist has been used - the remainder are new to the series.</p>

<p>Those 10 returning songs are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Faction - Skate &amp; Destroy</li>
<li>Gang Starr - Mass Appeal</li>
<li>JFA - Beach Blanket Bongout</li>
<li>RUN-D.M.C. - My Adidas</li>
<li>Motörhead - Ace of Spades</li>
<li>Del the Funky Homosapien - If You Must</li>
<li>AFI - The Boy Who Destroyed the World</li>
<li>Adolescents - Amoeba</li>
<li>CKY - 96 Quite Bitter Beings</li>
<li>Bodyjar - Not the Same</li>
</ol>
<p>One major reason for not including certain songs may be licensing issues.</p>
<p>However, in the same blog post revealing the soundtrack, Christopher Wilson, VP of production at Activision Publishing stated: "We wanted to keep the feel of the original games but also introduce new artists and songs."</p>
<p>He added: "Throughout the project, Tony added tracks and suggested using different songs from artists that were featured on the original games.</p>
<p>"The soundtrack is meant to be a love letter to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> franchise, skateboarding in general, and be an opportunity to showcase music that falls outside of the mainstream."</p>
<p>Wilson's comments <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-was-tony-hawks-choice-to-pick-some-different-songs-by-the-same-artists-in-pro-skater-34-remake">mirror those of Hawk himself</a>, who previously stated on an Instagram post it was his choice "to pick some different songs by the same artists featured in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">THPS3</a>+4 OST".</p>
<p>"I'm hoping that discovery is half the fun, and a big reason that these soundtracks resonated in the first place," he said. "So listen and enjoy the ride."</p>
<p>Still, the soundtracks to all the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games are iconic, reflecting the musical tastes of the early 00s. The changes have left some fans disappointed, in response to reviews by critics.</p>
<p>Also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-reportedly-intervened-to-get-bam-margera-in-pro-skater-3-4-remake-after-activision-said-no">returning for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is skater Bam Margera</a>, after Hawk intervened.</p>
<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be released on 11th July across Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS4, PS5, Switch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, and PC (Steam, Battle.net, Microsoft). It's available in early access now for those who pre-ordered.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4s-soundtrack-includes-only-10-tracks-from-original-games-as-focus-shifts-to-new-music]]></content:encoded>
