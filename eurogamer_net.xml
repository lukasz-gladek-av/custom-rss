            <p>It looks like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> launch game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> will have a reverse mode for the first time.</p>
<p>Previous games in the series have included Mirror Mode as an unlockable extra, which flips tracks horizontally for a new challenge.</p>
<p>However, characters have been spotted racing in reverse in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5wuhtJfj54&amp;t=51s">Japan-only advert</a> for the new game, suggesting a reverse mode will finally be included.</p>

<p>The advert includes footage of characters racing around the Mario Bros. Circuit in the opposite direction, when compared to footage from Nintendo's Treehouse Live stream (thanks <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/it-seems-that-you-can-play-courses-in-reverse-in-mario-kart-world/">NintendoSoup</a>).</p>
<p>It's unknown yet how racing in reverse will be included in the game - perhaps as a separate option following completion of 150cc - but the footage appears to show a Grand Prix race rather than Knockout Tour, judging by the UI.</p>
<p>Of course, with Mario Kart World being an open world game, players will be able to drive in all directions in Free Roam, so it would make sense Nintendo would make use of this for its Grand Prix.</p>
<p>It's not long to wait now until we'll be able to play Mario Kart World for ourselves. It launches alongside the Switch 2 on 5th June - that's next week!</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-was-first-developed-for-the-original-switch-but-60fps-only-possible-on-switch-2">Nintendo shared an interview with Mario Kart World's developers</a>. They confirmed the game was originally in development for the original Switch, but the open world design was better suited to the new console running at 60fps.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-reportedly-already-out-in-the-wild-but-needs-a-day-one-update-to-function">Switch 2 consoles are reportedly already out in the hands of players</a>, but it requires a day one update to function.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>In the run up to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s release next week (next week!), Nintendo has released a new video highlighting the changes N64 classics will have on the console's debut.</p>
<p>Those with a Nintendo Switch Online plus Expansion Pack subscription are able to play classic games from the N64 days, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask">Majora's Mask</a>, Pokémon Snap, and a personal favourite, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/goldeneye-007-review">GoldenEye 007</a>.</p>
<p>And soon, those on Switch 2 will be able to play these games, and then rewind them when things don't go quite as planned (what, that has never happened to me), pop on a CRT screen filter and remap the controls. You can check out how this all looks via the video below.</p>

<p>While those on the original Switch consoles won't be able to utilise that rewind feature or the  CRT screen filter, they will be able to remap the controls when this update goes live.</p>

<p>As to when all this is happening, that would be next Thursday, 5th June. That's the day Switch 2 releases.</p>
<p>In the meantime while we wait patiently for next week, you can check out the full run down of games available on Nintendo's subscription service via our handy guide: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-online-games-available-to-play-right-now">All Nintendo Switch Online games available to play right now</a>.</p>
<p>As for the Switch 2, while it is not technically available just yet, some have managed to get their hands on the console early. Last night, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-reportedly-already-out-in-the-wild-but-needs-a-day-one-update-to-function">footage was shared online of someone unpacking their new console</a>, however they were unable to play it due to it requiring a day one update to function. Nintendo obviously didn't seem best pleased with this video making the rounds online, and soon removed the footage from the internet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
With a little over a week to go until <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s arrival, some customers are already claiming to have received their consoles - but anyone hoping to play ahead of release are apparently out of luck, as units reportedly won't function without a day one update.
</p>
<p>
As spotted <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/someone-got-their-hands-on-a-nintendo-switch-2-early-and-the-videos-already-been-taken-down">by IGN</a>, YouTuber Ali Almarzooqi initially uploaded an eight-second video showing them opening their Switch 2 box - or at least a convincing replica - to reveal the console within. Unfortunately, it didn't take long before the video was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpbiOytojJc">yanked as a result of a copyright claim by Web Capio</a>, a company that markets itself as selling "anti-piracy solutions."
</p>
<p>
In a since-nuked comment thread below the video, Almarzooqi (AKA a2dubai) responded to a viewer asking for "more video please" by explaining, "Nintendo locked the Switch 2. It needs [an] update to function, so I'm waiting for June 5th to unlock it.".

<p>
Notably, this doesn't seem to be an isolated incident. Gaming news and deals poster Wario64 revealed they'd received correspondence - seemingly included corroborating images - from another Switch 2 customer who'd received their console early. "I have no permission to post pics," Wario64 <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1927441748923457581">wrote in a post on social media</a>, "but can share that when they try to boot a Switch 1 game, a message prompts 'Please connect to the internet and update your system.' Needs update to boot a game."
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time we've heard word of a big launch-day patch for Switch 2, either. The Game Business' Chris Dring <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-media-outlets-will-not-have">recently reported</a> some press have been told they won't get the console for coverage before release due to a "significant day one patch". This, presumably, is the very same update currently thwarting early receivers from playing their games ahead of schedule. It's currently unclear if the update is simply coming in hot or if it's a deliberate ploy by Nintendo to prevent legitimate gameplay appearing online ahead of launch.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2, of course, arrives next Thursday, 5th June, and you can read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">everything we know about the machine</a> - and its launch day games - elsewhere on Eurogamer.

            <title><![CDATA[More claims of Apple dedicated iOS gaming app surface as company acquires first game studio]]></title>
            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/more-claims-of-apple-dedicated-ios-gaming-app-surface-as-company-acquires-first-game-studio</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/more-claims-of-apple-dedicated-ios-gaming-app-surface-as-company-acquires-first-game-studio.1200003/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/more-claims-of-apple-dedicated-ios-gaming-app-surface-as-company-acquires-first-game-studio<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
A new report has lend further credence to last year's claims Apple is working on game-focused iOS app that'll integrate store, social features, achievements and more - with the company now said to be "seeking to sell gamers and developers on the idea that it’s a leader in the market."
</p>
<p>
Word that Apple was looking to expand its gaming strategy with a dedicated iOS app first surfaced last year, when news site 9to5 Mac reported efforts were underway at the company to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-reportedly-working-on-new-game-focused-ios-app-integrating-store-social-features-achievements-and-more">combine the functionality of iOS' App Store and its long-defunct Game Center service</a> - which previously offered a centralised place to view likes of challenges, leaderboards, and achievements before the app was removed from iOS in 2016.
</p>
<p>
And now, eight months later, Bloomberg has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-27/apple-to-debut-dedicated-gaming-app-within-days-of-switch-2-s-arrival">corroborated 9to5's story with a similar report</a>, saying Apple is looking to preinstall the new gaming app on iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV set-top boxes later this year. There's also talk of a Mac version, capable of displaying games downloaded outside of the App Store. As in 9to5's earlier report, Bloomberg - citing "people with knowledge of the matter" - says the app will serve as a launcher for games and centralise in-game achievements, leaderboards, communications, and other activities.

<p>
It'll reportedly also feature internally produced editorial content highlighting new games available within the app, which will include those from the App Store's game section and the company's Apple Arcade game subscription service. Bloomberg says the app is due to launch as part of Apple's next iOS version, iOS 19, and will be showcased during the company's Worldwide Developers Conference on 9th June ahead of a September arrival.
</p>
<p>
Apple's push to create a prominent games destination for iOS users does, of course, follow the EU's mandate last year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-returning-to-ios-says-epic-as-apple-agrees-to-alternative-app-marketplaces-in-eu">Apple must allow sideloading and alternate marketplaces</a> on its devices to comply with the Digital Markets Act. Since then, a number of third-party marketplaces have taken advantage of the EU's new rules, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-game-store-and-fortnite-now-available-in-eu-on-ipad">most notably the Epic Games Store</a>.
</p>
<p>
A new game-focused iOS app from Apple would mark another small step in the company's slowly evolving gaming strategy, which has so far included the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">launch of its Apple Arcade games subscription service in 2019</a>, new tools to help developer easily port their Mac games to iOS, and even a push to woo major publishers like Capcom and Ubisoft onto its platform in recent years - although efforts to sell full-price AAA games such as Resident Evil 7, Death Stranding, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> to iOS users have reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-has-reportedly-flopped-on-ios-with-under-2000-sales">proved disappointing</a>.
</p>
<p>
Reports of Apple's new app come as the company announces its first video game studio acquisition. It now owns RAC7, the two-person studio responsible for Apple Arcade hit Sneaky Sasquatch - although an Apple spokesperson <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/apple-acquires-rac7-sneaky-sasquatch/">told Digital Trends</a> the move was a "unique circumstance", as it saw an opportunity to help the team grow its game further.
