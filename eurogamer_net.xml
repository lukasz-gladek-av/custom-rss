            <p>Toshiyuki Itahana, character artist for the Final Fantasy series, including games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-crystal-chronicles">Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>: Dawntrail, has left <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://note.com/itahana/n/n277aa9cc7148?sub_rt=share_pb">Writing to fans online</a>,  Itahana expressed that he decided to leave Square Enix last year after the 25th anniversary of the Final Fantasy series, feeling both "a strong sense of accomplishment" and that it was the "right moment" to move on.</p>
<p>Itahana revealed in the same post that he intends to move forward as a freelance illustrator and character designer, stating he's currently learning from senior freelance illustrators as well as asking fans of his to support him moving forward.</p>

<p>Itahana concluded the message by thanking fans who experienced his work so far, writing: "To everyone who played the games I worked on at Square Enix, and to all those I had the pleasure of working with over the years, thank you very much. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude, and I sincerely hope for your continued support in the future."</p><p>It's certainly an interesting time for the Final Fantasy franchise. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-major-shareholder-fundamental-reassessment-final-fantasy-future">Not only have major shareholders recently urged for a reassessment of the series</a>, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-do-you-want-to-happen-to-the-final-fantasy-franchise-youve-got-a-few-days-to-tell-square-enix-directly">Square Enix is asking fans directly what they want to see with Final Fantasy moving forward</a>. We may be in the verge of an era of great change with the series, who can say.</p>
<p>Regardless, with Itahana's departure Square Enix is waving goodbye to one of its most beloved artists. One that's likely to get a lot of work as a freelance in the future.</p>

            <p>Alicia Vikander's turn as Lara Croft in 2018's Tomb Raider adaptation is having a bit of a renaissance it seems. The film, which is largely based on the rebooted Survivor timeline, recently popped up on the Netflix top 10 films list, seven years (give or take) since its initial release.</p>
<p>Most recent Netflix data reveals Tomb Raider is sitting at number nine for global film releases, ahead of the more seasonal Jingle Bell Heist, making it one of the most watched films worldwide between 22nd and 28th December.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10">According to Netflix</a>, Tomb Raider has so far enjoyed two weeks on the streaming service's top 10 for films, with over 4m views. That equates to 8.2m hours watched.</p>
<p>The rest of the top 10 is made up of seasonal favourites such as Dr. Seuss' The Grinch or more recent releases like Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery. K Pop Demon Hunters is, of course, still in there as well.</p><p>So, why the sudden interest in Tomb Raider? Well, there are a number of factors that have likely had an impact on its renewed popularity. Netflix could have seen an uptick in Tomb Raider viewers as this year marks the series' 30th anniversary. Yep, the first Tomb Raider came out in 1996, which is wild because I am still only 21, so not sure how that works…</p>
<p>Another reason could be the announcement last month that two new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider games</a> are in the pipeline. The first, known as Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fully-fledged-from-the-ground-up-tomb-raider-remake-announced">from the ground up remake of the original Tomb Raider</a>, with Flying Wild Hog handling development with Crystal Dynamics. This chap is due to be released some time this year, though we don't have an exact date yet.</p>
<p>The second game, meanwhile, is coming from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon, and is known as Tomb Raider: Catalyst. This will be an all-new series entry, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-where-tomb-raider-catalyst-sits-on-the-series-timeline">which takes place after Tomb Raider: Underworld</a> (that's the game where Lara pops along to Helheim whilst wielding Thor's hammer, Mjolnir). Catalyst <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards">will see the globe-trotting Lara Croft heading to Northern India</a>, and is due to be released in 2027.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alicia-vikanders-tomb-raider-sequel-in-limbo-following-amazon-buyout">a sequel to Vikander's Tomb Raider film was being planned</a>. However, in 2022, it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alicia-vikander-no-longer-lara-croft-as-tomb-raider-movie-series-sits-in-limbo">MGM had lost the rights to the Tomb Raider films</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Amazon is working on a live action Tomb Raider TV series, with Sophie Turner as Lara Croft. Filming is expected to kick off later this month. Other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-series-adds-white-lotus-star-to-the-cast">cast members include Sigourney Weaver and Jason Isaacs</a>.</p>
<p>Weaver will play a character called Wallace on the show's release, and has stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-scripts-are-incredible-and-very-funny-sigourney-weaver-confirms-she-will-play-wallace-in-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Tomb Raider scripts are "incredible, and very funny, very charming, very witty"</a>.</p>
