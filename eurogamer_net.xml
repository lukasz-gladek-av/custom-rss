            <p>Exactly a year after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-acquires-15bn-stake-in-epic-games-making-games-and-entertainment-universe-in-fortnite">Walt Disney Company announced it was acquiring a $1.5bn USD stake in Epic Games</a> and launched a multi-year partnership to create an "expansive and open games and entertainment universe connected to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>", the Fortnite x Disney collaboration event has reportedly moved into a "stable" build.</p>
<p>Whilst it remains unclear, what, exactly, the collaboration will be, noted Fortnite leaker HypeX said the status change likely comes because "they probably made a lot of progress and moved into the next roadmap milestone".</p>

<p>At the time the collaboration was announced, explicit mention was made of Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and Avatar, with users able to "create their own stories and experiences, express their fandom in a distinctly Disney way, and share content with each other in ways that they love".</p> <div>

<p>Since then, fans have gone on to form their own theories - or wishlists - including the suggestion by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ik9odz/comment/mbkt5e8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">some</a> that we could see a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disney-infinity">Disney Infinity</a>-esque mode added to the Fortnite, or some kind of persistent "Disney Metaverse" to explore.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, hopefully we won't have to wait too much longer for the finer details.</p>
<p>HypeX also confirmed over the weekend that Fast &amp; Furious x Fortnite skins are also "coming soon".</p> <div>

            <p>Following the lengthy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-psn-is-still-down-after-12-hours">PSN outage this weekend</a>, Capcom has assured PS5 players that it will hold an additional Monster Hunters Wild open beta test "at a future date".</p>
<p>With only two open beta tests planned for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> ahead of its release at the end of this month, PS5 players have not only missed out on playtime over the weekend, but also participation bonuses. Capcom also hasn't been able to adequately test its systems and servers, either.</p>

<p>"PS5 hunters, thanks for your patience and understanding during this weekend’s PSN service issues," Capcom said in a statement posted to social media earlier today.</p>
<p>"To account for reduced [open beta test 2] play time due to the outage, we are considering running OBT2 for an additional 24 hours at a future date. Exact details and timing are TBD, so please stay tuned."</p> <div>

<p>As yet, Capcom hasn't specified when the additional beta test will run, but we'll keep you posted.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-next-open-betas-will-let-players-fight-flagship-monster-arkveld-for-the-first-time">The current beta test</a> kicked off at 3am UK time on 7th February (7pm 6th February PT) and will close tomorrow at 3am.</p>
<p>The second runs from 13th-16th February at the same times. Cross-platform multiplayer is enabled for both tests, and players can transfer their characters (but not their progress) to the full game. Participants also get a bonus pendant and an item pass that'll unlock in the full release. Additionally, Monster Hunter World and Iceborne owners will receive Palico equipment and a Hunter Profile name plate if they pick up Wilds.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 28th February.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
