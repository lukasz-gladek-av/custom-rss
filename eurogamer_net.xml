            <p>NetherRealm has confirmed there will be no more additional story chapters or characters "from this point on".</p>
<p>In a statement posted to X/Twitter, the studio said that despite "hearing players' requests for continued game support of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a>", "there will not be additional DLC characters or story chapters released". It will, however, "continue to support Mortal Kombat 1 through balance adjustments and fixes".</p>

<p>"It's disappointing because there's no thorough QoL, no online lobbies, &amp; locked away skins....you truly gave us an unfinished $140 game," <a href="https://x.com/Mikemetroid/status/1926025851734196480">replied</a> one player. "An extreme low from WB/NRS. What changed over there???"</p>
<p>As for that "next project" NetherRealm refers to? Well, no-one's entirely sure as it's not been formally confirmed as yet, but that's widely thought to be Injustice 3. Let's watch this space.</p>
<p>Some fans aren't surprised by the announcement, however. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-mortal-kombat-1-definitive-edition-has-fans-thinking-warner-bros-has-quietly-wrapped-up-development">NetherRealm Studios released its surprise Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition on Switch, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC earlier this month with minimal fanfare</a>, bundling together the main game, its Khaos Reigns story expansion, Shang Tsung, two Kombat Packs featuring additional fighters and Kameo characters, some in-game currency, and a selection of skins. Animality finishing moves have also been added in a free update for all players.</p>
<p>"The arrival of the definitive edition meant it was over with the previous games, so... I guess that was it," noted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1kmhhqw/this_means_its_over/">one poster on the Mortal Kombat subreddit</a> at the time, a sentiment largely shared across the playerbase.</p>
<p>Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition costs £55/$70 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, while Switch players can pick it up for $60. There's also a £50/$60 Definitive Edition Upgrade ($50 on Switch) for Mortal Kombat 1 owners wanting to get everything in the new version without purchasing each bit of DLC separately.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time has had an unexpectedly strong start for a sequel to a fairly obscure 13-year Nintendo DS game. And developer Level 5 has now thanked fans for their enthusiasm, pledging to release free DLC in response to its "global success".
</p>
<p>
The Girl Who Steals Time, for context, is a sequel to Level 5's Fantasy Life - a sort of job-focussed mash-mash of life sim and RPG - which enjoyed modest critical and commercial success when it launched for Nintendo DS back in 2012. Eurogamer's celebrated its "abundance of features" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fantasy-life-review">our 6/10 review</a> at the time, but noted the result was often "less than the sum of its parts".
</p>
<p>
But in this post-Stardew Valley world - where you can't watch an indie showcase without seeing a dozen new village sims jostling for attention - the newly released Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals seems to resonated with audiences. It's garnered a positive early critical reception and even surpassed 45K concurrents on its first day on Steam (that's more than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> managed) - and Level 5 is now celebrating its launch with news of more to come.

<p>
"Due to the game's global success and the warm support from players around the world," it <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250523_01/">wrote in a message on its website</a>, "we have decided to release a free DLC that includes new recipes as well as expanded content under the title 'Update the World!'."
</p>
<p>
Level 5 hasn't shared much in the way of specifics, but it promises "new content designed to make use of high-rarity weapons obtained from Treasure Groves and other sources", as well as "even more opportunities [for players] to showcase their gear". The studio says it's working to release the DLC "as soon as possible", and will provide further details at a later date. It sounds like there's even more on the way too; "We will continue to update and improve Fantasy Life i," it adds, "so that players can enjoy its world more comfortably and for an even longer time." 
</p>
<p>
Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is available now on Steam, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and Switch, with a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> version coming later this year.
