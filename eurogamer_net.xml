            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> is the latest video game confirmed to be getting a TV adaptation.</p>
<p>As first reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/life-is-strange-tv-series-amazon-charlie-covell-luckychap-1236509181/">Variety</a>, Amazon Prime Video has greenlit a live-action Life is Strange show. It'll be led, produced, and penned by The End of the F***ing World writer, Charlie Covell, alongside Story Kitchen executive producers, Dmitri M. Johnson, Mike Goldberg, and Timothy I. Stevenson.</p>

<p>"Story Kitchen has always believed that Life is Strange deserved to be more than just a game – it's a cultural touchstone," said Story Kitchen's Johnson and Goldberg.</p>
<p>"After a decade-long journey, we're honoured to be bringing this beloved story to Amazon MGM alongside our incredible partners at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, our brilliant showrunner/writer Charlie Covell, and the amazing team at LuckyChap. Together, this thoughtfully assembled dream team is ready to share Life is Strange with the world in an entirely new way!"</p><div>

<p>"It's a huge honour to be adapting Life Is Strange for Amazon MGM Studios," Covell added. "I am a massive fan of the game, and I'm thrilled to be working with the incredible teams at Square Enix, Story Kitchen, and LuckyChap. I can't wait to share Max and Chloe's story with fellow players and new audiences alike."</p>
<p>Square Enix studio heads Jon Brooke and Lee Singleton said, "For years we've had so many people asking us to create a Life is Strange TV show, and we're so pleased to finally partner with Amazon MGM Studios, who we trust will do an incredible job bringing our universe to life."</p>
<p>The franchise's most recent release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposures-first-two-chapters-are-mostly-good-but-making-fans-pay-extra-to-play-early-is-a-huge-mistake">Life is Strange: Double Exposure, launched amidst a major backlash from fans</a> upset at how the game handled the ongoing storyline of returning protagonist Max Caulfield, and the impact of players' choice at the beginning of Life is Strange 1.</p>
<p>The situation turned uglier when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-fans-upset-after-square-enix-removes-reddit-posts-featuring-leaked-content-anonymous-developer-comments">Square Enix removed leaked development material from a popular Life is Strange fan subreddit</a>, even though commenters provided proof they worked at Deck Nine and claimed Double Exposure's story changed due to feedback from Square Enix itself. Square Enix said it had acted to remove the content based on "appropriate legal requirements" for "intellectual property violations".</p>

            <p>From next week, anyone who pre-ordered their <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> Premium Edition via the PlayStation Store will be refunded.</p>
<p>Community developer DebbieElla told players the refunds were coming as part of recent "adjustments", and confirmed we'll get "all the details" on the changes on 17th September.</p>

<p>As we reported last week, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 publisher Paradox is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/good-the-grubby-paid-clan-plan-for-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-being-adjusted">rethinking its plan to charge for two of the six playable clans in the game</a> following community feedback. The news came after publisher Paradox announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-all-these-years-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-gets-an-actual-proper-release-date">the release date for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>, 21st October, along with pricing details for the game. It was then we learned the company intended to charge £20 extra to access two clans in the game, via a Shadows and Silk content pack.</p><p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-chinese-room-defend-bloodlines-2s-paywalled-vampire-clans-we-have-been-expanding-it-from-where-we-originally-planned-to-land-it">According to developer, The Chinese Room</a>, these two clans represented content developed beyond what was originally planned for the game after it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-chinese-room-is-developing-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">inherited development of Bloodlines 2 </a>from Hardsuit Labs. Consequently, The Chinese Room's reasoning was this was additional content developed for the game, so it would sell it as such at release. But not anymore.</p>
<p>Now, in a Discord post, DebbieElla writes: "We are working hard on the adjustments that we promised, and we will be able to tell you all the details on 17th September. Making significant changes like this involves many moving parts, and we want to make sure that we get it right with this change.</p>
<p>"Anyone who pre-ordered the Premium Edition through the PlayStation Store will be contacted and refunded starting Monday 8th September. You'll be able to pre-order your Premium Edition copy later again, before the release on 21st October. Please note that this is an intentional first step in our planned course of action leading up to 17th September to deliver the best possible experience for you at launch."</p>
<p>The post closed on thanking players for their patience, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vtmb/comments/1n9bbhr/comment/ncm9z9o/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">later messages from DebbieElla</a> confirm this only applies to this particular edition sold for PlayStation – purchases on other platforms are unaffected.</p>
<p>Some are now <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vtmb/comments/1n9bbhr/comment/nclwom0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">hoping</a> this signifies all clans may be available in the base game, but as one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1n9bf6u/comment/ncoly53/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">points</a> out, however, "taking the clans out of the deluxe editions is the easy part. The hard part is trying to figure out what else they can put in there".</p><p>In his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-action-than-rpg-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-struggles-to-convince-after-a-few-hours-play">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 preview</a> a few weeks back, Bertie wrote: "[T]his is a sequel to a cult RPG after all, and one based on a major tabletop RPG to boot. In this case it feels valid to crave a little more role-playing, a little more texture and depth to the game's people and conversations. And so for now, a question mark remains".</p>
