            <p>A Silent Hill remake has just been announced during Konami's Press Start showcase.</p>
<p>The game will be created by Bloober team in collaboration with Konami. As of writing, the only confirmed is that the game is "in development".</p>
<p>The brief reveal trailer was paired alongside the Silent Hill 1 intro theme, further confirming that this is the original game in the legendary horror series being remade.</p> <div>

<p>This remake of the original 1999 game by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>, the developer responsible for the excellent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>. That game received ample critical and commercial success, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">in Eurogamer's own review of the Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, Vikki Blake noted: "Against the odds, Bloober Team has delivered a remake that both expands <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> in just the right places, and gives careful attention to what it preserves."
</p>
<p>This will be the first time Silent Hill 1 has gotten the remake treatment, although it was reimagined back in 2009 with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-shattered-memories-review">Silent Hill: Shattered Memories</a>. That game, released on the Wii and later ported to the PS2, was an interesting spin on the game that started it all. 
</p><p>
Bloober Team is also working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloobers-cronos-the-new-dawn-gets-release-window">which got a release date announcement at Summer Game Fest only a few days ago</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ratchet-clank-rift-apart">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a>, which was initially released four years ago (four years ago!), has a prototype mini game hidden away so well within it, that apparently nobody found it.</p>
<p>Senior designer Grant Parker showed the mini game off during a live stream on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, though developer Insomniac has since shared the clip on its social media. </p>
<p>
During this Rift Apart stream, Parker explained how to find the Easter egg for a prototype mini game, which would have allowed players to ride the mechanical bull inside Zurkie's (a bar-like establishment).</p>

<p>Like I said, the developer is pretty sure no one has discovered this Easter egg for themselves yet, and having listened to him explain it I can't say that I am surprised. To check it out, players need to head towards the entrance of Zurkie's, where they will see two signs beside the doorway informing patrons not to bring weapons inside. These are the key to unlocking the bull riding Easter egg.</p>
<p>What you have to do is shoot the left sign five times, then the right one four times, before shooting the left one 13 more times. Nothing will happen, or so it would seem as there isn't any mystical bell or anything like that that suddenly chimes to let you know you have uncovered something secret. There is literally "no confirmation, or anything," Parker explained in the video. However, if you mosey on into Zurkie's and head to the bull, you will get a prompt: Hold L2 to Ride Mechanical Bull.</p>
<p>You can check out the "super duper early" prototype mini game via the embed below. "It's just something fun that I thought I'd leave in the game," Parker said.</p> <div>

<p>Eurogamer was full of praise for Rift Apart on its PlayStation 5 release in 2021, with our Chris calling it "another lesson in laid-back, unpretentious fun".</p>
<p>"It's just pure craft, pure fun, pure video games - all the brilliant, bizarre ideas this studio has just thrown at the wall and all of them sticking. The only thing it lacks - apart from maybe a tiny bit of restraint - is pretence," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-review">Eurogamer's Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart review</a>. "There's no self-seriousness, no po-faced melodrama, no insecurity about the form. A game that's happy to be a game, in a familiar, cuddly shape.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The Chinese Room's impressively choreographed oil rig horror <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes the Deep</a> is making a return, in a brand-new bit of story DLC that'll pick up the action almost a decade after the events of the main game. It's called Siren's Rest, and it's coming to all platforms on 18th June.
</p>
<p>
Still Wakes the Deep's original story transported players back to 1975 and the wonderfully realised Beira D oil rig, located somewhere off the coast of Scotland in the churning North Sea. Eventually, it became clear that unknown forces had dubious designs on the Beira D's crew, and thus began a very difficult day in the life of electrician Cameron McLeary.
</p>
<p>
If you haven't played the main game, you might want to stop reading here, as introducing Siren's Rest requires revealing the fate of Beira D and its crew. You see, Still Wakes the Deep's story DLC time jumps forward over a decade to 1986 when a specialist diving team journeys to the site of the oil rig, now far below the waves. Armed with a cutting torch, crowbar, and camera, this new team is attempting to piece together the final moments of the Beira D, but it just might transpire those unknowable forces aren't quite done playing just yet.

"The Beira D is now a groaning steel catacomb interred in the inky depths of the North Sea," The Chinese Room teases in its announcement. "What really happened that December day in 1975, when communications to the mainland were severed and the rig sank without a trace? What answers can be given to families who still grieve, ten years on?"
</p>
<p>
Siren's Rest, which will supposedly offer around 1.5-2 hours of playtime, has a new writer in Sagar Beroshi (they previously served as narrative designer on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>), and a brand-new cast to go with its brand-new crew. Lois Chimimba (Doctor Who, Shetland) stars as protagonist Mhairi alongside Lorn Macdonald (Bridgerton, The Lazarus Project) and David Menkin (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>), and Kate Saxon is once again on voice directing duties, which bodes well given the stellar performances in the main game.

I wasn't entirely sold on Still Wakes the Deep's design <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/still-wakes-the-deep-review">when I reviewed it last year</a>, but there was no questioning its often astonishing artistry - and I'd be lying if I said the haunting fate of the Beira D's crew hadn't stuck with me. So I'm genuinely intrigued to see how Siren's Rest expands on what's come before with its new team and some 80s swagger.
</p>
<p>
Still Wakes the Deep's Siren's Rest DLC launches for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam and Epic) next Wednesday, 18th June, and it'll cost £9.99/€12.99/$12.99 USD.
