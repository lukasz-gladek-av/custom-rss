            <p>Team Cherry has shared an update on its Kickstarter campaign, with some key delivery details including that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> Nintendo Switch to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> upgrade pack will be free in the eShop.</p>

<p>In the same post, Team Cherry noted that codes sent out to its Switch backers will be sent via email, and not be redeemable until the game has launched in their territory. If you are unsure when that is, yesterday the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-wont-release-bang-on-midnight-on-4th-september-so-maybe-dont-take-the-whole-day-off">developer announced that Hollow Knight Silksong will release at 3pm UK time this Thursday</a>. You can <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight/posts/4473863">find out more about Silksong's key delivery details via Kickstarter</a>.</p>
<p>There are now only two more days to go until Hollow Knight Silksong makes its debut, after what to many has felt like eons of waiting patiently (and I am sure in some cases, not so patiently) for.</p>
<p>If you are interested in Silksong, but aren't planning on purchasing it right away, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9v2TJV_yws">our Zoe will be hosting a Silksong stream on Thursday</a>. Be sure to tune in.</p>

<p>Last month, our Dom braved the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> queues to go hands-on with Silksong, and came away impressed with its high challenge and how Hornet's movement differs from the original game's Knight. You can check out their thoughts in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gamescom-queues-over-an-hour-and-reddit-in-overdrive-hollow-knight-silksong-hype-has-outpaced-everything-from-opening-night-live">Eurogamer's Silksong preview here</a>.</p>
