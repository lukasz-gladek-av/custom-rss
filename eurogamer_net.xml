            <p>Hot off the heels of his turn as Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison in A Minecraft Movie, Jason Momoa is reportedly in talks to star in another video game adaptation.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/street-fighter-movie-eyes-jason-momoa-noah-centineo-more-1236407261/">Deadline</a> sources, Momoa is currently in talks for a role in Legendary’s live-action Street Fighter movie, based on Capcom's fighting series. As for who Momoa may be playing should these talks prove successful, that for now remains unknown.</p>
<p>As well as Momoa, Andrew Koji (Bullet Train), Noah Centineo (Warfare) and WWE wrestler Roman Reigns (Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw) are all said to be in talks for the Street Fighter adaptation.</p>

<p>Back in February of this year, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-film-gets-new-director-still-set-for-2026">Kitao Sakurai would direct the upcoming Street Fighter film</a>, with Capcom "deeply involved" in the adaptation as well.</p>
<p>The film is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/live-action-street-fighter-movie-gets-2026-release-date">set for a release next year</a>, on 20th March, having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-film-and-tv-rights-bought-by-legendary-entertainment">first been announced back in 2023</a>. Further details for now remain thin on the ground, but it sounds like production could soon be ramping up, so stay tuned for more. Personally, I would love to see cameos from Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue (but I am not holding my breath).</p>
<p>As for Momoa, well, he is probably riding high on the success of A Minecraft Movie right now. The live-action adaptation, which also starred Jack Black, became a meme-filled hit on its release in April. The film generated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">$301m worldwide on its first weekend</a>, and has been such a success that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">there are already talks about a sequel</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bungie once considered a subscription model for its online shooter Destiny, but the idea was "vehemently shut down" by management.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> went free-to-play in 2019, but players need to pay for the most recent DLC expansions. There's also a store for paid cosmetics.</p>
<p>Other MMOs, such as World of Warcraft or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>, run on a subscription model, where players pay a monthly fee for access. According to a new report, Bungie considered this but management decided against it.</p>

<p>The news comes as part of a report into the current state of Bungie, following word last week that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">Bungie morale is in "free fall"</a> following the fallout of stolen assets used in its next game, Marathon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7wZ2tpjrmE">YouTuber and journalist Destin Legarie</a> has spoken to former employees this week. Bungie management were described as "toxic and shut down creatives on a core level", with one former employee stating: "If [management] didn't think of it, it wasn't worth doing."</p>
<p>In this context, when one employee brought up the possibility of a subscription model, it was reportedly "vehemently shut down".</p>
<p>In another example, management was concerned the glowing Trials of Osiris PvP armour was too attractive, which would impact sales of armours in the Eververse store. Decisions by management "prioritised monetisation over player experience", a former Bungie employee said. Another added: "Everything happening to Bungie is because of greed."</p>
<p>One former employee surmised: "Bungie's problems stem from a lack of player empathy, disconnected leadership, and a corporate-first culture."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Bungie for comment.</p>
<p>In 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-ceo-criticised-for-spending-millions-on-classic-cars-as-calls-for-leadership-changes-escalate">Bungie CEO Peter Parsons was criticised for spending millions of dollars on classic cars</a>. This news followed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">a round of layoffs where 220 staff</a>, roughly 17 percent of the company's workforce, lost their jobs.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">Bungie admitted to including designs in Marathon without the artist's consent</a>. And this wasn't the first time Bungie had made this mistake.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">showed off Marathon back in April</a>. It's a PvP extraction shooter set to release on 23rd September this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Embracer - the Swedish conglomerate which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">bought up and then proceeded to lay off countless studios and employees</a> - still plans to release "76 different games during FY 2025/26".</p>
<p>These games will be a mix of "new IPs, sequels, and remasters", according to the <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q4-january-march-2025-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-1077-million/">company's latest financial report</a>.</p>
<p>Upcoming releases from Embracer studios include Metal Eden, Gothic 1 Remake, Reanimal, Fellowship, Wreckreation, the next SpongeBob SquarePants game, Norse: Oath of Blood and Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core. Embracer also has a number of games it is yet to announce.</p>

<p>The company stated its AAA game releases "continue to be key financial drivers across specific years and quarters". It highlighted upcoming releases <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killing-floor">Killing Floor</a> 3 and Amy Hennig's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, the latter of which is being developed by Skydance Games and published by Plaion. </p>
<p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra was once tapped for launch some time around Christmas this year, but was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amy-hennigs-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-into-next-year">recently delayed into 2026 in order to "add more polish"</a> and ensure players get "the best possible experience" on release.</p>
<p>"We are expecting Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra to drive notable revenues but to have lower margins due to shared economics with several other partners," Embracer wrote.</p>
<p>Embracer also alluded to a third AAA release on its docket, which the company previously expected to debut in FY 25/26 but will "likely need a few more quarters to polish". Therefore, this game will likely release the following fiscal year (I wonder if this is Tomb Raider).</p>
<p>"We expect this specific game to have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-nears-2m-sold-as-troubled-publisher-embracer-celebrates-success">financial dynamics more similar to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>," Embracer said.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>In addition to releasing those 76 games in the coming year, Embracer will also spin off Coffee Stain Group into a standalone company by the end of 2025. </p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-announces-plan-to-split-into-three-companies-including-middle-earth-enterprises-and-friends">Embracer announced its split into three companies</a>: Coffee Stain and Friends, Middle-earth Enterprises, and Asmodee Group. Now Coffee Stain, known for the likes of first-person open-world factory building game Satisfactory, will separate.</p>
<p>"This strategic move will allow Coffee Stain Group to focus on its core strengths as passionate game developers and publishers, focused on delivering high quality experiences," Embracer said.</p>
<p>Middle-earth Enterprises will be renamed Fellowship Entertainment as a result, and will unite "top creators and intellectual properties" to "build unforgettable experiences for the fans".</p>
<p>Said Embracer: "The strategy is to transform into one powerhouse group with game development and publishing at its core, complemented with transmedia capabilities within IP licensing, comics, merchandise, film and distribution."</p>
<p>After a huge acquisition spree several years ago, Embracer subsequently shed thousands of staff and shuttered studios such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-studio-volition-has-been-closed-down-effective-immediately">Saints Row developer Volition Games</a>, after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-shares-plummet-after-proposed-2bn-partnership-collapses">major $2bn investment fell through</a>.</p>
<p>More recently in March, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-groups-eidos-montreal-studio-lays-off-up-to-75-employees">Embracer-owned Eidos-Montréal announced it was laying off "up to" 75 members of staff</a>, saying it didn't "have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-randy-pitchford-seeks-to-justify-80-real-fans-comment<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Earlier this week, Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford made headlines, when a comment he had made on social media started making the rounds online. The comment was in response to one potential Borderlands 4 buyer, who in a post on X said "this game better not be 80 dollars". Pitchford then gave a slightly tone deaf reply, saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/80-for-borderlands-4-too-costly-randy-pitchford-says-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen">"real fans" would find a way to get their hands on a copy of the game no matter how much it cost</a>.</p>
<p>Pitchford's comment was met with a certain amount of backlash, and now the Gearbox head has shared another post in a bid to unmuddy the waters.</p>
<p>"If you want the truth, here it is," he wrote, with an accompanying video from an earlier interview where he was asked how much Borderlands 4 would retail for. Here, the Gearbox exec admitted he did not know how much Borderlands 4 will cost.</p>

<p>"It's an interesting time, right," Pitchford said. "On one level, we've got a competitive market place. The people who make those choices want to sell as many units as possible, and they want to be careful about people who are price sensitive. So, there are some folks who don't want to see prices go up, even the ones deciding what the prices are."</p>
<p>He went on to state that there are also "other folks accepting the reality that game budgets are increasing, and there's tariffs for the retail packaging" to consider.</p>
<p>"It's getting gnarly out there, guys," Pitchford said, adding Borderlands 4 has "more than twice" the development budget of its series predecessor. He reiterated that he really doesn't know the price, but when pre-orders go live, that's when we will all know how much Borderlands 4 will cost.</p>
<p>"Here's the philosophy we have, whatever the price is: we're entertainers. Yes, we want to get more resources so we can make bigger and better games - there is a reason why Borderlands 4 is so awesome," the studio head went on. "It's because you guys showed up and supported <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a>. And, we had the budget, we could more than double the budget and feel confident in that."</p>
<p>He said as a group of "artists", the studio wants everyone to be able to get their hands on Borderlands 4. "We want to make it as easy as possible for everybody to enjoy what we are creating" and that everyone who plays a Gearbox game feels like they "got the better end of the bargain".</p>
<p>In the video, Pitchford said "we're going to have a price set soon, and it might be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rising-game-prices-would-happen-sooner-or-later-says-former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida">new price that Nintendo and Microsoft have led with</a>" or "it might be that we stay back". Either way, "it's going to be the people at the publishing house that decide that".</p>

<p>
In a <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1925396048828404016">subsequent post on X</a>, Pitchford addressed his earlier social media comment. </p>
<p>"In seriousness though, nobody likes being taken for granted and it was not my intent. I'm humbled by the love and support everyone has shown the team as we push hard to get this amazing game in your hands," he wrote. </p>
<p>"They're crushing it, and I can't wait for everyone to play what's going to be the best Borderlands ever! Regardless of where the price lands, it's going to be worth it and then some. Back to work for me!"</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 is set to launch across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on 12th September, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-forward-perhaps-because-2k-knows-exactly-when-gta-6-is-coming-out">Take-Two announced it was bringing its release forward</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> will receive difficulty options in a free update due alongside its forthcoming DLC, Overture.</p>
<p>As a Soulslike game, Lies of P is certainly challenging. But the new difficulty options will ensure both the base game and the DLC are more approachable for newcomers.</p>
<p>"We wanted to make sure a wider audience of players could play the game," said game director Jiwon Choi (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lies-of-p-is-getting-difficulty-options-to-make-the-soulslike-more-accessible/">VGC</a>), adding the team had had "a lot of feedback" from players and the game's developers.</p>

<p>"So by making development adjustments and introducing these difficulty options, we can offer the experience to different types of players. This broadens the base."</p>
<p>The default difficulty for Lies of P will be named "Legendary Stalker", while two easier modes will be added named "Butterfly's Guidance" and "Awakened Puppet".</p>
<p>If you're after even more challenge, though, the game is also receiving a Battle Memories mode where players can replay bosses through five tiers of difficulty, including ultra hard modes.</p>
<p>What's more, a Death March boss rush mode will challenge players to take down as many bosses as possible with a limited pool of health and items.</p>
<p>Both of these modes will have bespoke rewards yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Lies of P: Overture is a prequel to the base game that was initially teased in 2023 following the game's release, along with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-sequel-confirmed-as-game-director-teases-dlc">confirmation a sequel is in development</a>. It was then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-prequel-dlc-revealed-named-overture">officially revealed earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>As a prequel, the DLC will follow the protagonist puppet during the final days of the city of Krat. It will feature new weapons such as slashing claws, a gunblade, and a ranged bow.</p>
<p>Lies of P: Overture will be released at some point this summer.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Eurogamer spoke with Choi about FromSoftware's forthcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, though the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-to-remain-single-player-despite-refreshing-elden-ring-nightreign-says-director">Lies of P team is focused solely on creating a single-player game</a>.</p>
<p>"I've tried [Nightreign] and it was very refreshing and new," he said. "So that obviously gave me the impression that they're good developers, they always push their boundaries, their imagination and vision, and it shows. In turn, that for some reason motivated me to deliver the Overture experience as good as it could be."</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> and Dark Souls creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a> has frequently discussed the high difficulty level of his games. Ahead of Elden Ring's release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-souls-creator-hidetaka-miyazaki-discusses-elden-ring-difficulty">he stated it would be more approachable than previous games</a>, and then last year said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/turning-down-elden-rings-difficulty-would-break-the-game-itself-says-miyazaki">turning down the challenge would "break the game itself"</a>.</p>
<p>Souls fans have long debated whether difficulty options should be included, but it's great to see other studios implementing what FromSoftware hasn't so far.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
