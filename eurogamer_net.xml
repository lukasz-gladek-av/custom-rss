            <p>A new teaser trailer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys-2">Five Nights at Freddy's 2</a> has been revealed.</p>
<p>The trailer itself shows Josh Hutcherson's security guard Mike back following the ordeals of the first film. It also gives us a look at Balloon Boy (who popped up in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> post-credits scene).</p>
<p>"Anyone can survive five nights. This time, there will be no second chances," the trailer blurb reads, promising viewers a "blood-chilling new chapter of animatronic terror". You can check out the new trailer for Five Nights at Freddy's 2 below.</p>

<p>Five Nights at Freddy's 2 is set for release on 5th December, because nothing says festive fun like a massive animatronic bear trying to do you in.</p>
<p>Last year, Hutcherson - who has also starred in The Hunger Games - said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-nights-at-freddys-2-movie-is-much-bigger-and-scarier-than-its-predecessor">second Freddy-themed movie is "much bigger" and "scarier" than its predecessor</a>.</p>
<p>"We're finding the balance right now of building this world and expanding it in a really cool way but also making sure the characters stay really grounded," Hutcherson said in October. "That's something that I really think that we all fought for in the first film, because this world that was created in Five Nights at Freddy's, it's so out-there."</p>
<p>Along with Hutcherson, returning cast members include Matthew Lillard, Piper Rubio and Elizabeth Lail. Meanwhile, Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 is directed by returning filmmaker Emma Tammi, with Jason Blum - known also for the likes of M3GAN and the Halloween series - to produce alongside the game series' Scott Cawthon.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a> has topped a BAFTA poll to find the most influential video game of all time.</p>
<p>The 1999 Dreamcast release may have struggled commercially at launch, but it has provided the blueprint for open world games ever since, received a cult following, and was followed by two sequels.</p>
<p>It's perhaps a surprise choice for the public-voted poll, with creator Yu Suzuki stating he was "deeply honoured and grateful" for Shenmue's win. "At its inception, we set out to explore the question, 'How real can a game become?', aiming to portray a world and story unprecedented in scale and detail," he said. "This distinction serves as a powerful reminder that the challenge we embraced continues to resonate with and inspire so many people even today. It is truly the greatest of encouragement."</p>

<p>He even teased there's more to come as the story remains incomplete.</p>
<p>The top five games in the poll are all classics worthy of the title. Following Shenmue are Doom, Super Mario Bros, Half-Life, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> (my own personal choice).</p>
<p>The rest of the top ten also includes greats like Minecraft, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a>, and The Sims.</p>
<p>But there's one outlier in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>. Whether <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review">it's a good or bad game is one thing</a>, but can a game released just two months ago in February 2025 really be considered that influential, especially when compared to others in the list?</p>
<p>"We made Doom to push boundaries and ignite imaginations, and it’s amazing to see its legacy still resonating over 30 years later," said Doom co-creator John Romero. "Doom's lasting impact is also thanks to the incredible community that embraced it, modded it, speedran it, and kept it alive across generations - this recognition is a tribute to them as much as the game itself."</p>
<p>"We're honored to hear that players felt that both Half-Life 1 and 2 should be included in the list of influential video games," said Valve. "When we set out to make them, like all developers, we had big dreams. Like what if the game didn't immediately crash your computer upon load? So, unsurprisingly, the legacy of these games was the last thing on our minds when we were in the thick of development. For the Half-Life games to become both meaningful to players and foundational to our medium is, frankly, humbling. We can only hope that everyone who has enjoyed them over the years has as much fun with our future efforts."</p>
<p>Shenmue fans will surely be happy to see the game recognised, especially after the news last year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-3-gets-new-publisher-sparking-multiplatform-hope">Shenmue 3 has a new publisher</a>, sparking hopes of a multiplatform release. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-fans-rent-times-square-billboard-campaigning-for-fourth-game">Fans even rented a Times Square billboard to campaign for a fourth game</a>.</p>
<p>Last year BAFTA ran a similar poll ahead of its BAFTA Games Awards, with Lara Croft voted the most iconic video game character.</p>
<p>The top 20 most influential video games of all time in the BAFTA poll are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shenmue</li>
<li>Doom</li>
<li>Super Mario Bros.</li>
<li>Half-Life</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</li>
<li>Minecraft</li>
<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</li>
<li>Super Mario 64</li>
<li>Half-Life 2</li>
<li>The Sims</li>
<li>Tetris</li>
<li>Tomb Raider</li>
<li>Pong</li>
<li>Metal Gear Solid</li>
<li>World of Warcraft</li>
<li>Baldur's Gate 3</li>
<li>Final Fantasy VII</li>
<li>Dark Souls</li>
<li>Grand Theft Auto 3</li>
<li>Skyrim</li>
<li>Grand Theft Auto</li>
</ol>
<p>This year's BAFTA Game Awards will take place next week on Tuesday 8th April.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-receives-most-nominations-at-this-years-bafta-games-awards">Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 has the most nominations</a>, but Best Game will be a tussle between Black Myth: Wukong, Helldivers 2, Thank Goodness You're Here!, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Astro Bot, and Balatro.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Judging by reactions online across the world, the cost of the Switch 2 and its software has proven to be controversial. Perhaps Nintendo knew this, considering it didn't include the price in the actual <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">Direct presentation</a>.</p>
<p>Here in the UK, the console will cost £395.99, or £429.99 bundled with Mario Kart World, when it launches on 5th June. That's compared to the £280 launch price of the original Switch, and £310 launch price of the OLED.</p>
<p>It's the increase in the cost of games themselves, though, that's proven most shocking. Mario Kart World, for instance, will cost £74.99 for a physical copy, or £66.99 digitally. That's an increase from £49.99 for most brand new original Switch games.</p>

<p>Donkey Kong Bananaza, meanwhile, is slightly cheaper: £66.99 for a physical copy and £58.99 digital. There's the Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour game too, which will cost 990 yen <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/aahea/index.html">according to the Japanese website</a> - that's around a fiver.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-physical-releases-will-just-have-a-download-key-on-the-card">some Switch 2 physical game cards won't actually include the full game</a>, but include a download key instead. As for the difference between physical and digital pricing, this appears to be a shift towards pushing digital games - especially with the addition of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-unveils-virtual-game-cards-thatll-let-you-share-you-digital-switch-and-switch-2-games">sharable Virtual Game Cards Nintendo revealed last week</a>.</p>
<p>Still, accounting for inflation, the Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle works out cheaper in the UK than the original Switch with a copy of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a> in 2017.</p>
<p>To directly compare the consoles alone, £280 for the original Switch works out at £367.40 today with inflation, still cheaper than Switch 2. However, throw in the big launch game and it's a better deal - an original Switch with a separate copy of Breath of the Wild cost £340 at launch in 2017, which works out at £446.13. That's pricier than the Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle.</p>
<p>Over in Europe, the Switch 2 console costs €469.99, or €509.99 for the Mario Kart World bundle. That's equivalent to the cost in the UK.</p>
<p>It's a different story in other parts of the world, however.</p>
<p>In Japan, for instance, Nintendo will be selling a region-locked console at a lower price, in a bid to stop importers due to the weak yen.</p>
<p>The Japan-only console will cost 49980 yen (around £258.95), but will only play Japanese games in Japanese language, with a Japanese Nintendo account.</p>
<p>A more expensive Switch 2 with multilingual support will also be available at 69980 yen, around £362.57. That's still slightly cheaper than in the UK, though doesn't account for import costs.</p>
<p>As for the price of Mario Kart World in Japan, it'll be 9980 yen compared to the cost of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> on the original Switch at 6578 yen. As Dr. Serkan Toto, CEO of Kantan Games, wrote on social media, that's 52 percent more expensive, which is a higher jump than the 33 percent rise from $60 to $80 in the US.</p>

<p>As for the console itself in the US, it costs $450, but there are fears this could rise to as much as $600 if impacted by new tariffs from the Trump administration.</p>
<p>Tariffs - taxes charged on products when they enter the country - could be as much as 46 percent on products from Vietnam, which is where the majority of Switch 2 manufacturing has taken place, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438">Kotaku</a> has reported.</p>
<p>David Gibson, analyst at MST Financial, confirmed to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a781c853-3fed-4dfc-b940-4137546180de">The FT</a>: "Export data combined with finished product codes confirms that Nintendo shipped finished Switch 2 [from Vietnam] across five days in January for a total of 383,000 units with all of them going to the USA."</p>
<p>He added: "I suspect this occurred to test the distribution system and get ahead of the risk of tariffs. I expect the numbers to have ramped-up significantly in February and March."</p>
<p>Wrote Niko Partners director of research and insights <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1907545230699610327">Daniel Ahmad on social media</a>: "Nintendo shifted its manufacturing to Vietnam to avoid tariffs and with today's reciprocal tariff announcements they're likely going to end up paying tariffs anyway."</p>
<p>Ahmad <a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-partners-take-on-nintendo-switch-2-reveal/">continued in a blog post</a>: "The higher cost of the console in the US compared to Japan is likely a calculated move on Nintendo's part, driven by tariff impacts, the weak Japanese yen and local market conditions. Japan accounted for nearly 25 percent of global Nintendo Switch unit sales, with Nintendo offering a cheaper Switch 2 SKU in this market to stimulate early adoption and maintain momentum.</p>
<p>"While the company has shifted some of its manufacturing to Vietnam to offset US tariffs on China, the looming threat of reciprocal tariffs prior to the Switch 2 showcase will have also forced Nintendo to consider a higher price for the rest of the world. The reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Japan have come in higher than expected, and Nintendo will feel the impact of this if the tariffs go into full effect. That being said, we think it's unlikely that Nintendo will raise the price of the console at this point, but it's also unlikely to see a price drop in the next 5 years."</p>
<p>Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis also suggested to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive">IGN</a> Nintendo "probably had a range of pricing for the US market in play up until the last minute due to the uncertainty on import tariffs", which is why the price wasn't included in the Direct.</p>
<p>However, analysts don't believe the pricing will impact sales of Switch 2 initially.</p>
<p>"Based on what we're seeing across the market, sales to higher-income or more affluent households likely won't be impacted by this pricing," Circana analyst Mat Piscatella told IGN. "And, of course, we have the price insensitive super enthusiasts that will do and pay whatever it takes to acquire the Switch 2 at launch. Therefore, because of the limited quantities that will be available during the launch year, I do not anticipate this pricing to hinder year one sales volumes.</p>
<p>"The true test will come in year two, as supply is likely to become more readily available, and the addressable market will be forced to widen. So, we'll have to see what happens over the next 9-12 months."</p>
<p>And compared with Sony's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> at £699.99 and Valve's Steam Deck OLED at £479.00, the price of Nintendo's new console still appears reasonable.</p>
<p>Of course, this all depends on whether consumers are able to pre-order, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-pre-orders-will-prioritise-players-with-the-most-switch-playtime">Nintendo is enforcing strict criteria on pre-orders</a> from its own Nintendo store in a bid to reduce scalping. That's based on playtime and the requirement of a Nintendo Online account.</p>
<p>In the meantime, multiple online UK retailers have already gone live and sold out of Switch 2 stock, without the need to meet Nintendo's criteria.</p>
