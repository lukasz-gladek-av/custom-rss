            <p>
Bungie has admitted that an external artist's work has been used within upcoming game Marathon without consent. 
</p>
<p>
The issue came to light yesterday following recent playable alpha tests of Marathon, from which an artist recognised their designs had been used.
</p>
<p>
"The Marathon alpha released recently and its environments are covered with assets lifted from poster designs I made in 2017," artist <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923067988871147605">Fern Hook wrote on social media</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"Bungie is of course not obligated to hire me when making a game that draws overwhelmingly from the same design language i have refined for the last decade, but clearly my work was good enough to pillage for ideas and plaster all over their game without pay or attribution."

<p>
Responding via its less-visible <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217324384903262">Marathon Dev Team social media account</a>, Bungie wrote that it had "immediately investigated" Hook's claim and found that, yes, a former artist at the company had swiped the designs.
</p>
<p>
"This issue was unknown by our existing art team, and we are still reviewing how this oversight occurred," Bungie wrote. "We take matters like this very seriously. We have reached out to 
[Hook]  to discuss this issue and are committed to do right by the artist.
</p>
<p>
"As a matter of policy, we do not use the work of artists without their permission," Bungie continued, stating - if it needed to be said - that the developer does not endorse plagiarism. 
</p>
<p>
"To prevent similar issues in the future, we are conducting a thorough review of our in-game assets, specifically those done by the former Bungie artist, and implementing stricter checks to document all artist contributions," the publisher concluded.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time Bungie has faced claims of using artists' work without permission - with multiple instances coming to light regarding designs for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>.

"I don't have the resources nor the energy to spare to pursue this legally but I have lost count of the number of times a major company has deemed it easier to pay a designer to imitate or steal my work than to write me an email," Hook concluded.
</p>
<p>
"In 10 years I have never made a consistent income from this work and I am tired of designers from huge companies moodboarding and parasitising my designs while I struggle to make a living."
</p>
<p>
Bungie's Marathon reboot is set to launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 23rd September.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> will release on PC on 11th June, but its availability on Steam has been blocked in over 120 countries, surprising even the game's developer.</p>
<p>Shift Up shared news of the release <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1923048769245020481">on social media</a>, but a number of fans responded with Steam screenshots showing the game is unavailable in their region. Shift Up responded to confirm the PC version does not require a PSN account and appeared surprised in the replies at the games unavailability.</p>
<p>Checking <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/1294088/info/">SteamDB</a>, it appears Stellar Blade has been restricted in over 120 countries. Most of these are where Sony's PSN is unavailable.</p>

<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> was review-bombed last year following a PSN requirement, which led to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">game being pulled from sale in 177 countries</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">company quickly u-turned its decision</a> following the backlash.</p>
<p>It would appear Stellar Blade is experiencing a similar issue, although Shift Up has stated a PSN account is not required. However, a free bonus costume will be offered when a PSN account is linked to Steam.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Sony for clarification.</p>
<p>The Steam listing does state that Denuvo has been incorporated, much to the annoyance of some fans.</p>
<p>News of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-out-on-pc-next-month-according-to-leaked-trailer">Stellar Blade's PC release date leaked earlier in the week</a>, but has now been confirmed on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/15/stellar-blade-launches-june-11-on-pc-specs-and-features-revealed/">PlayStation Blog</a>.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a>'s already a bit of a winner, but Obsidian Entertainment has pledged to make its acclaimed RPG even better over the remainder of 2025. As per the studio's latest development roadmap, a new game plus, photo mode, and more are all on the horizon, and that's alongside the additions now available in its newly-released 1.4 update.
</p>
<p>
Avowed's 1.4 patch is available now for PC and Xbox Series X/S, introducing a range of tweaks and improvements. Top of the list is a new Arachnophobia safe mode, for players wanting to experience the game without the creeping threat of spindly legs and eight piercing eyes. This option can be switched on via the accessibility menu and replaces spider enemies with round, floating - and delightfully rainbow-hued - orbs.
</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>
That's alongside a range of quality of life improvements including mouse and keyboard support for Xbox, additional gold and crafting materials, and unique gear improvements. Obsidian has also highlighted a number of changes introduced based on community feedback: critters can now be defeated, with a chance they'll drop loot; time can be advanced by waiting at the Party Camp; new optional settings enable players to view chests on the minimap or cancel Bow and Arquebus power attacks; Soul Pads now dispel illusions, and there are fog of war improvements too. Full <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134717-patch-14-notes/">patch notes are available on Obsidian's forum</a>. 
</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>
So that's that for update 1.4, but Obisidian has also now confirmed <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/1-4-update">more's on the way as 2025 continues</a>. The studio has so far outlined two additional updates for the year, one coming this summer and another this "fall". Avowed's summer update will, for instance, include cooking and crafting improvements, new NPC abilities and behaviours, new active and passive abilities, new unique weapons and armour, plus custom map markers.
</p>
<p>
Then, as the nights start drawing in and the scent of autumn fills the air, Avowed players can look forward to some pretty significant new additions. A new game plus mode is top of the list, followed by a photo mode, and a new weapon type. Obsidian is also teasing new character presets, more Godlike feature presets, and the ability to change appearance in-world.
</p>
<p>
"We also want to acknowledge our players in Korea, Japan, and French-speaking regions," the studio adds in its latest blog post. "We know how important it is to experience a game in your preferred language, and we are actively working on localised versions for Korean and Japanese, along with ongoing improvements for French. We're committed to delivering these updates as soon as they are ready, and we deeply appreciate your patience and support as we make sure they meet the quality you deserve."
</p>

<p>
It's a good time for Avowed fans, then, as Obsidian continues to finesse its already excellent fantasy RPG. "Avowed has been more generous than I thought it would be - in length, in heart, in depth," Robert Purchase wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Eurogamer's Avowed review</a> earlier this year, "and it never loses sight of being a game, of being an adventure, of taking you places you would never normally go, or of simply providing a few dozen hours of unabashed escapism. I think it's one of this year's most pleasant surprises."

            <p>
Police in Greater Manchester have secured a haul of stolen Pokémon cards worth £250k, and arrested a man linked to their discovery.
</p>
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn05x7rnjxno">BBC News</a>, a police spokesperson announced the arrest by quipping: "Gotta catch 'em all ;)"
</p>
<p>
Helpfully, the cards still had their original price labels attached - something the police will now look to use as they return the cards to their rightful owners.
</p>
<p>
Including in the stolen stock are individually graded cards worth over £500 each, including a shiny Silver Tempest Lugia V (£560), shiny Team Rocket Dark Charizard (£350) and shiny Japanese McDonald's Pikachu promo (£450).
</p>
<p>
"An interesting warrant in Hyde yesterday morning, supported by your neighbourhood policing teams," Greater Manchester's Tameside police wrote in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GMPTameside/posts/pfbid029b1nEhJWreGkir62g61Rk8uBVgVNCF59Mkh4Mh946cgPHWaEw8piJTMHqo4wncjEl">post on Facebook</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"Seizure of thousands of stolen, high-value Pokémon cards with an estimated worth of over £250k. Attempts will now be made to return the cards to the original owners. One male arrested. Gotta catch 'em all ;)"

<p>This week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-cards-are-back-in-mcdonalds-happy-meals">Pokémon cards returned to McDonald's in the UK</a> - with a focus this year on Dragon-type creatures. The fast food restaurant's annual promotion has proven popular enough in the past that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/not-even-mcdonalds-pokemon-happy-meals-are-safe-from-scalpers">Happy Meals have been bought in bulk</a> to acquire (and then scalp) the cards, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mcdonalds-to-limit-pokemon-happy-meal-toy-purchases-in-uk">prompting some outlets to restrict purchases</a>.</p>

            <p>Playtests for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> have been more positive than the first game, but creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> isn't "interested in appealing to the mass market".</p>
<p>The first Death Stranding game was certainly divisive, but speaking to Edge Magazine Kojima discussed how he takes on board player feedback.</p>
<p>"Of course, I want people to play my game, so I must listen to them to a certain extent," he said. "But also, I'm not interested in making something that appeals to everyone."</p>

<p>With the previous games, Kojima explained that in playtests four out of 10 people would love it and six would say it's terrible. "For me, I think that's a good balance," he said.</p>
<p>The sequel, however, is bringing in a more positive response. "Sony is pleased, of course, but I do wish it was a bit more controversial," said Kojima. "Blockbuster films need an 80 percent approval rating - I don't want to make games like that. I'm not interested in appealing to the mass market, or selling millions of copies. That's not what I'm aiming for."</p>
<p>Kojima later admitted a lot of people still expect him to create something like Metal Gear, the series he's best known for. That has resulted in the forthcoming game Physint.</p>
<p>"Of course, I have lots of new ideas that I want to create," he said. "But when I became sick during the pandemic, I realised that a lot of people wanted me to make something like Metal Gear. That's when I had the idea for a new espionage game. I reflected, and thought the idea was good. I took it to Sony and they were incredibly supportive. We explored many options, and we agreed on doing Physint."</p>
<p>Indeed, from my own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-death-stranding-2-preview-how-a-big-dollop-of-metal-gear-is-expanding-kojimas-bizarre-epic">preview of Death Stranding 2</a>, there's definitely a strong influence of Metal Gear in the increased focus on combat and stealth mechanics.</p>
<p>"There are so many people all over the world asking me to make another Metal Gear, so I added more options for combat," Kojima said during the preview. "When I was working out those mechanics, I was a little worried because many of the staff that worked with me on Metal Gear still work here, and we kept saying to each other, 'Does this feel too much like Metal Gear?' It wasn't on purpose."</p>
<p>Beyond Physint, Kojima is spending time considering the legacy of his studio, Kojima Productions, and what it will create next.</p>
<p>"I gave a USB stick with all my ideas on it to my personal assistant - kind of like a will," he told Edge. "Perhaps they could continue to make things after I'm gone, here at Kojima Productions... This is a fear for me - what happens to Kojima Productions after I'm gone. I don't want them to just manage our existing IP."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-has-a-concept-for-death-stranding-3-but-wont-make-it-himself">creator already has ideas for endless Death Stranding sequels</a>, but won't be making them himself.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will release on PS5 next month, on 25th June.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> is now less than three weeks away from release, which means Nintendo is feverishly filling in the few remaining blanks ahead of the console's arrival. And that finally includes specific details on what each of its previously announced free Switch 2 upgrades for the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/zelda-links-awakening">Link's Awakening</a>, Pokémon, Mario, Arms, and more will do on launch day.

Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-will-have-paid-upgrades-for-certain-switch-games-bringing-enhanced-frame-rates-and-more">announced two different types of Switch 2 upgrades for previously released Switch games</a> as part of its big April news blowout: paid upgrades promising substantial new features or content alongside presentational enhancements, plus free upgrades specifically focused on the likes of enhanced performance and GameShare support.

At the time, Nintendo announced 12 original Switch titles - including Arms, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, and Pokémon Scarlet - would be receiving free upgrades on its new console, but stopped short of providing specific details. That's all changed thanks to an <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/games-with-free-updates/">update on its website</a>, so here's everything we now know owners of the original Switch editions can expect when playing the games on Switch 2 starting 5th June:
