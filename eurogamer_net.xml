            <p>All of the notable Grand Theft Auto games have been set in fictional versions of American cities, but there was once an expansion pack that showed us a glimpse of somewhere else. Somewhere, if you're me, very close to home: London.</p>
<p>In 1997, an expansion pack was released for the original Grand Theft Auto game that remade its world to look like London in the Swinging Sixties - specifically, in 1969. Cue lots of colourful Minis and mini-skirts and mods and bob haircuts and garish pastel colours. It was fun, and it was enough of a glimpse to keep the question of whether Rockstar might ever return to London, for a full-fat GTA instalment, alive for many years after.</p>
<p>But that dream-balloon has popped now, with <a href="https://youtu.be/o3gbXDjNWyI?si=tLh2Pqo2iIIJZ4as">Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser telling Lex Fridman</a> that the Grand Theft Auto series has become too characterised by Americana to be set anywhere else.</p>
<p>"There's a reason why GTA kept coming back to Miami, New York, Los Angeles," Houser said. "They're all very good for what you laid out..." Houser was referring to Fridman's description of Miami being a place where huge wealth exists next to extreme poverty, of it being a place of everything: glitz, glamour, immigration, drugs and organised crime - the whole lot. A melting pot.</p>

<p>London arguably has that but it doesn't have other important ingredients. One of those ingredients Houser described as larger-than-life characters, because GTA games, he said, are exaggerated slices of life. A GTA experience would be like "a psychotic version of a Dickens book", he said, smiling. But a bigger problem is a lack of available guns here - a weapon Grand Theft Auto games depend upon.</p><p>"For a full GTA game: we always decided there was so much Americana inherent in the IP it would be really hard to make it work in London or anywhere else," Houser said. "You needed guns, you needed these larger-than-life characters. It just felt like the game was so much about America, possibly from an outsider's perspective, but that was so much about what the thing was that it wouldn't have really worked in the same way elsewhere."</p>
<p>Dan Houser left Rockstar in 2020 to create a new studio called Absurd Ventures, which is making a couple of open-world video games - one set in a science-fiction world called A Better Paradise, and the other within a comedy satire setting. A Better Paradise book has been released but other than that, we don't know anything about these games.</p>
<p>Given how long ago Houser left, he has had nothing to do with the making of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, which will be a notable change for the GTA series. Houser was usually the person who'd come up with the story the games would be based on, then hold the team to that creative vision as the game went forward.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I find it fascinating to hear Houser reflect on past GTA projects, particularly on the pressure the studio felt making them, because Rockstar often projects an aura of invincibility at the time.</p>
<p>"GTA 4 was very pressured because there had been all this pressure on the company - the company nearly imploded several times due to Hot Coffee," Houser said, referring to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/who-spilled-hot-coffee">the infamous reinstated-by-modders sex mini-game that people found in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a>. "It was extremely tough. So I think that felt very stressful. GTA 3, the company was basically broke, but I was young and I didn't really care. I wasn't living in the grown-up world yet. All of them had their own pressure."</p><p>But even years later in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, the company's most recent major work, there was enormous pressure on Houser and the studio. "With Red Dead 2, we were behind schedule, we were over budget so much I didn't want to think about it, and you're making a game about a cowboy dying of TB, and the game's not coming together," he said. "Turns out a lot of people doubt you at that moment; it's not a lot of fun. That was a lot of pressure."</p>
<p>I suspect that therein lies <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-is-leaving-the-company-in-march">the reason he ultimately left Rockstar</a>, after taking an extended break following completion of the Red Dead Redemption 2 project. His brother Sam Houser, however, remains there, as president of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>.</p>

            <p>
Original Saints Row design director Chris Stockman has revealed he wants to revive the open-world crime series following the poorly recieved 2022 reboot, and claims publisher Embracer Group has reached out to hear more.
</p>
<p>
Stockman departed developer Volition (which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-studio-volition-has-been-closed-down-effective-immediately">closed in 2023</a> as part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-has-reduced-its-workforce-by-over-1800-people-in-the-past-year">devastating layoffs across Embracer</a>) in 2007, shortly after Saints Row 1's release. Following stints at Human Head Studios and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/zynga">Zynga</a>, he founded VR-focused studio Bit Planet Games, known for the likes of Ultrawings and The Battle of Sol. But nearly 20 years after Saints Row 1's release, Stockman reckons he still knows what makes the series work - and it wasn't in the recent reboot.
</p>
<p>
"There's a level of expectations for a Saints Row game, and [developer Volition's reboot] missed the mark on all of them", Stockman <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2025/10/saints-row-creator-interview-gta-vi">recently told Esports Insider</a>. "When I found out that they were rebooting Saints Row, I spoke to an old friend of mine who was my old boss for Saints Row 1. He was the producer, and I was learning about what they were doing, and I thought, 'Man, this is a terrible idea.' What is it trying to be? You're rebooting it, but why are you rebooting it? There's a lot of characters in the series that people love. It wasn't Saints Row at all. Just call it something else at that point."
</p>
<p>
In the same interview, Stockman encouraged Saints Row owner Embracer to reach out, saying, "If you're listening to this, contact me. Let's go. I can bring much of the old band back together who worked on Saints Row 1. I could turn that IP around with a decent budget. They don't even have to fund it. I could get other outside people to fund it. I could turn the franchise around. I know I could." And it seems Embracer is curious to learn more.
</p><p>
"Guys and Gals, I have hopeful news!," Stockman <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintsRow/comments/1ok2dh3/ive_been_asked_to_a_create_a_pitch_for_a_saints/">wrote on the Saints Row subreddit</a>. "I've been asked to create a pitch for a Saints Row reboot! I can't say anything more than that but my dreams for this game just became a little more than just dreams!" Stockman <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/saints-row/prequel-pitch-original-director">later told PCGamesN</a>, he'd contacted Embracer himself after the original interview "created a bit of a fervour", and discovered "there is interest" within the company. "A pitch has been requested."
</p>
<p>
As for what Stockman has in mind for a potential revival, he "won't say much" at this point as he want to "keep my cards close to my chest, for now." However, he's keen to "bring the Saints Row franchise back to its roots", believing it has "strayed way too far away from that." He's also confirmed he's not envisaging it as a VR game and that he won't be bringing back the series' (at this point pretty iconic) giant dildos if Embracer bites. "I would've never put that abomination of a weapon in", he added on Reddit.
</p>
<p>
And despite Stockman's current caginess, his earlier Esports Insider interview might reveal a little of what he's got in mind. "What I would have done [for the reboot] was to take the franchise back to the 70s and do a period piece," he explained, "a prequel of how the gangs from the first one started. You're running around with a crew of teens that ended up as the main characters for the first game. You could really go all in on the 70s theme with big Afros, bell-bottoms, and the music of that whole period. I'd have taken it into a different direction so you’re not competing with the modern-day GTA games."

            <p>A collection of Japanese publishers including Bandai Namco, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, and others have come together as part of CODA (Content Overseas Distribution Association) to request Open AI cease training AI video generation tool Sora 2 on their collective creative works.</p>
<p>The statement to Open AI, <a href="https://coda-cj.jp/en/news/817/">made public via a statement published on the CODA website</a>, state that CODA, requests that CODA members works are not used for machine learning without prior permission, and that Open AI responds sincerely to claims and inquires from CODA members regarding copyright infringement related to Sora 2's output.</p>
<p>The statement also mentions Sora 2's opt out policy, that being that copyrighted works will be used by Sora 2 unless copyright owners specifically opt out themselves. Coda emphasises that this goes against Japanese copyright infringement laws in which permission is required beforehand. Coda also noted that: "there is no system allowing one to avoid liability for infringement through subsequent objections."</p>

            <p>It's been a long-running mystery why Rockstar's PlayStation-exclusive spy game Agent never materialised. It was announced with much fanfare in 2007, then proceeded to never show up again. But Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser has finally provided an adequate answer. Simply put, he and Rockstar couldn't find a way to make an open-world spy game work.</p>
<p>"We worked a lot on multiple iterations of an open-world spy game and it never came together," <a href="https://youtu.be/o3gbXDjNWyI?si=Sd4dXzJqaE1DVzWD">Houser told Lex Fridman in a rare and revealing podcast</a> interview. Houser said there were roughly five different iterations of Agent, including one set in the 1970s Cold War era and another set in the modern day.</p>
<p>But wherever and whenever Rockstar tried setting Agent, it couldn't make the idea of an open-world spy game work. "I don't think it works," Houser said. "I concluded - and I keep thinking about it; sometimes I lie in bed thinking about it - that what makes them really good as film stories makes them not work as video games.</p>

"You've got to go here to save the world, you've got to go there and stop that person being killed <em>and then </em>save the world... And an open-world game does have moments like that when the story comes together, but for large portions it's a lot looser and you're just hanging out and doing what you want."</p><p>What makes the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption games work so well as open worlds is their in-between time - the time you have to cruise around, either on a horseback or in a car, listening to the radio or watching the world go by. In those games, you do your own thing. "That's why it works well being a criminal: because you fundamentally don't have anyone telling you what to do," Houser said.</p>
<p>The minute you put that into a spy game, however, you slacken the line of tension you need running through the spy framework to give missions jeopardy. "As a spy that doesn't really work because you have to be against the clock," Houser said. It's a fundamental issue - one Rockstar couldn't overcome. "For me, I question whether you can make a good open-world spy game," he said.</p>
<p>It's a question I'm sure Hitman developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has had to reckon with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-james-bond-preview-hitman-uncharted-comparisons">while plotting blockbuster James Bond game 007: First Light</a>, though IOI's expertise is not in open worlds but sandbox mission approaches. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-rockstar-north-dev-talks-agent-abandoned-zombie-game-in-fascinating-new-blog">Agent apparently began life as a demo for the Grand Theft Auto 4 engine</a>, a Rockstar developer revealed a couple of years ago, and it showcased a hang glider and a car that turned into a submarine. A fuller, more linear game was then apparently green-lit, which would take us to classic spy movie locations such as the French Riviera, a Swiss ski resort, and Cairo. And the story would culminate with a big shootout with lasers in space. That idea was apparently in development for a year and a downhill skiing section was developed, but the game didn't get much further. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-has-abandoned-its-agent-trademark">Rockstar eventually abandoned its trademark for Agent in 2018</a>.</p>
