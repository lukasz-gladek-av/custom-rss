            <p>The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin has addressed those criticising Bella Ramsey for not looking older as Ellie in the show's upcoming second season.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-last-of-us-season-2-craig-mazin-interview-1236169252/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Mazin said he understands "the difficulty that some people have where they say, 'She looked like she was 14 in season one. She still looks roughly the same to us, even though now she's 19'."</p>
<p>Mazin added he appreciates Ellie in The Last of Us Part 2 does look "much older" than she did in the first game. However, when it comes to the show, he isn't "interested in the physical aspect" of Ellie's appearance.</p>

</figure>
<p>"Some people do change quite dramatically and some people don't," Mazin said. "I've been looking at Bella's face for years while editing, and I can see that she's certainly grown. I'm interested in the emotional maturity, and the change in personality."</p>
<p>The Last of Us showrunner added he has "watched Bella grow and become independent and start to find her own two feet separate and apart from her parents", stating it's also about "how do I figure out how to be my own person now and test that full independence?"</p>
<p>This is something he "[feels in] Ellie completely" when it comes to Ramsey's portrayal of the character.</p>
<p>"So, I understand where people are coming from, but when they watch this year, I think they're going to see the difference," Mazin closed.</p>

            <p>The anonymous creator of Balatro, LocalThunk, impressed passersby at last month's Game Developer Conference with his card skills, but nobody recognised him.</p>
<p>Balatro won several awards at GDC's Game Developers Choice Awards, including Game of the Year, Best Design, Best Debut, and Innovation Award. As a result of the nominations, the game had a booth on the show floor.</p>
<p>LocalThunk himself played the game there, but managed to retain his anonymous status despite impressing onlookers at the booth.</p>

<p>"One of my fav moments from GDC - they had a booth set up to play Balatro since it was an award nominee. I watched for a bit then I gave it a go myself. Crushed a white stake run," the developer wrote on Bluesky.</p>
<p>"Someone approached me as I was about to leave. 'Wow you must have played this before!'</p>
<p>"'I guess you could say that'."</p>
<p>He added: "Also this was actually the first and only time I have seen strangers play my game in real life. Have yet to see Balatro in the wild. So as far as I'm concerned y'all are just Truman Show-ing me."</p>

<p>As with previous awards shows, Playstack Communications Director Wout Van Halderen collected Balatro's wins on LocalThunk's behalf.</p>

<p>"Don't get me wrong - this has changed my life in a lot of amazing ways," he said. "I'm so grateful. But I do miss that time before. It was just a hobby that recharged my batteries. Sometimes I think, 'Maybe I would've been happier if I had never released this game to the public.'"</p>

            <p>First it was rumoured, then it was implied, and now it seems all but officially confirmed that the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> Joy-Con will boast mouse functionality on the console's release.</p>
<p>A brief video shared on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">Nintendo's newly minted Today app</a> counting down to tomorrow's Direct shows the Switch successor in various configurations. A console can be seen docked in front of a nice looking flat screen (devoid of kids' fingerprints, unlike mine) and one console is in its handheld mode with the Joy Con attached either side.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while a pair of Joy Con have been slipped into Nintendo's handy little controller grip, two others lie loose to the side of another Switch 2 screen. Well, I say lie. One is lying on its back, as you would place an OG Switch Joy Con when not using it, but the second one is perched on its side.</p>

<p>This placement lends further credence to earlier reports of that aforementioned mouse functionality.</p>
<p>We got a look at what was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-trailer-appears-to-confirm-joy-con-mouse-functionality">perceived to be the Switch 2's mouse functionality</a> when Nintendo unveiled its upcoming console in January. During the brief teaser, two Joy Con could be seen being pushed along a flat service, their wrist straps out the back like little mouse tails.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there appeared to be some kind of attachment that gives the side of the Joy-Con a smooth edge.</p>

            <p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will retain its controversial sexual content from the original release, as revealed in its ESRB rating.</p>
<p>As with the original release of Metal Gear Solid 3, the forthcoming remake will be rated M for Mature. And it will retain the "Peep Demo Theatre" too.</p>
<p>Reads the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40362/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater/">rating summary</a>: "The game contains some suggestive/sexual content: a man groping a woman's breasts; close-up cameras angles of deep cleavage; a character briefly groping a man's crotch; a Peep Demo Theatre allowing players to view cutscenes of a female character's body from a first-person perspective."</p>

<p>The Demo Theatre was an unlockable extra from the Subsistence version of the game onwards, which allowed players to view cutscenes while controlling the camera. The Peep Demo Theatre was one such cutscene that, once unlocked via multiple playthroughs, allowed players to see female spy Eva in her underwear.</p>
<p>In the main game too, players can press a button during cutscenes to see Snake's first-person viewpoint. This can provide an advantage, but in some scenes his gaze settles on more suggestive imagery.</p>
<p>While some players may have expected some of this sexual imagery to change in the remake for a more modern audience, the rating makes it clear the remake will stick closely to the original release.</p>
<p>The rating summary also details the amount of violence in the game. "Combat is highlighted by realistic gunfire, cries of pain, and blood-splatter effects," it reads. "Some close-quarter combat allows players to slit enemies' throats, resulting in large spurts of blood. Cutscenes depict further instances of violence/blood: a restrained character beaten and electrocuted; a character shot in the eye; a character on fire shot several times."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eaters-difficulty-is-being-adjusted-to-match-its-control-styles">remake will offer two styles of controls</a>, based on the original game and new modern controls, with difficulty altered accordingly.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will release on 28th August, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-announced-complete-with-a-butt-slapping-ape-escape-monkey">complete with the Ape Escape-themed minigame from the original game</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida has called NieR: Automata the "game that changed everything", as it was responsible for reviving the Japanese games industry on its release.</p>
<p>Speaking to Japanese outlet <a href="https://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/series/rt/2001799.html">AV Watch</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-he-was-ordered-not-to-worry-about-overseas-reviews-by-games-producer/">Automaton</a>), Yoshida discussed how during the PS3 era, sales of Japanese games had declined and increasingly studios there were chasing "overseas tastes".</p>
<p>That changed with NieR: Automata in 2017, released for the PS4. "I think <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/yoko-taro">Yoko Taro</a> created it without paying any mind at all to making it sell overseas, but it was a tremendous success," said Yoshida.</p>

<p>The game proved Japanese studios could find success by creating Japanese-style games. "With NieR, everyone realised this," said Yoshida. "That it wasn't just something they could do, but something they had to do."</p>
<p>As such, Japanese studios strove to "create based on their own culture and what they knew", realising this was the appeal of their work overseas.</p>
<p>"I think that the Japanese game industry revived after NieR, so much so that you could talk about pre-NieR and post-NieR eras. Simply put, I think that was the title that made everyone want to pursue Japanese-style games," said Yoshida.</p>
<p>NieR creator Yoko Taro himself responded on social media, thanking Yoshida for the praise but crediting producer Yosuke Saito, who "ordered" him to make a game "that targets the Japanese market, without worrying about overseas reviews".</p>
<p>"Or, to put it more precisely," said Taro, "I remember being told something like 'Yoko, you can't make games for overseas, so (at least) try to make it for Japan'."</p> <div>

<p>Saito then replied: "What I said at the time went more like this: Since we're Japanese people, there's no need for us to go out of our way to cater to people overseas. Surely, we'll be able to attract at least a million players among all the people out there who genuinely want to play a Japanese game made by a Japanese person (the one and only Yoko Taro)."</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nier-developers-join-forces-for-new-project-that-might-be-nier-it-might-not-be-nier">Saito teased a possible new NieR project</a> alongside Taro, though nothing further has been said since. "I've been talking about wanting to do something with Yoko and Okabe for some time now," he said at the time. "I'll have something a bit more put-together to say in the not-too-distant future, so please stay tuned. It might be NieR, it might not be NieR. [Laughs] That's about all I can say for now."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-is-superior-to-nier-automata-says-yoko-taro">Taro also compared NieR: Automata to Stellar Blade</a>, stating: "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> is a really amazing game. I'd say that it's much better than NieR:Automata."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The official landing page for Ghost of Yōtei got a little update yesterday, with some new information on Sucker Punch's upcoming game tucked in there.</p>
<p>Straight off the bat, along with some more story details, the developer has remained committed to its 2025 release window on PS5. There had been some speculation the studio and PlayStation may nudge it back a touch to make way for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be">a game many expect will dominate the gaming landscape when it releases this autumn</a> (unless it gets delayed).</p>
<p>In terms of story, while we knew Ghost of Yōtei's protagonist Atsu had a revenge mission of some kind, we now have a little more background as to why.</p>

<p>Here's what the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/ghost-of-yotei/">updated Ghost of Yōtei synopsis reads</a>:</p>
<p>"300 years after the events of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, a new warrior – Atsu – rises from the ashes of her homestead.</p>
<p>"Filled with fury and determination, Atsu will hunt down those responsible for the death of her family and exact her revenge. Every odd job and bounty will provide the coin she needs for her journey. But how she fights, survives, and evolves the legend of the Ghost, will be up to you."</p>
<p>Along with the fact we now know Atsu is seeking revenge for her ravaged home and family life, that mention of "every odd job and bounty" has also sparked some intrigue. It sounds like Ghost of Yōtei may include a bounty mechanic, and perhaps have some kind of in-game economy, which would spice up the game's world a touch.</p>
<p>The developer previously said it was going to ensure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-follow-up-will-have-a-less-repetitive-open-world">Ghost of Yōtei had a less repetitive open world compared to its predecessor</a>, with criticisms for Ghost of Tsushima often directed at its somewhat repetitive activities.</p>
<p>Back in October, Sucker Punch's creative director Jason Connell said: "One challenge that comes with making an open-world game is the repetitive nature of doing the same thing over again. We wanted to balance against that and find unique experiences."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reveals-ghost-of-yotei-the-follow-up-to-ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Yōtei was first unveiled at a PlayStation State of Play last year</a>.</p>
<p>"To create something fresh but familiar, we looked beyond Jin Sakai’s story and the island of Tsushima, and shifted our focus to the idea of the Ghost instead," wrote Sucker Punch communications manager Andrew Goldfarb at the time. "At Sucker Punch we love origin stories, and we wanted to explore what it could mean to have a new hero wearing a Ghost mask, and uncovering a new legend.</p>
<p>"This led us to Ghost of Yōtei: a new protagonist, a new story to unfold, and a new region of Japan to explore."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
