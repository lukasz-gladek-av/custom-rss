            <p>As Rare - known for the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, Banjo-Kazooie and  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a> - gets ready to celebrate its 40th anniversary, a third-party licensed controller themed around the developer's legacy has leaked online.</p>
<p>The controller itself has been built by gaming peripherals manufacturer 8BitDo, and officially licensed with Rare and Xbox. It features Hall Effect sticks, 'Pro Back Buttons' and has an integrated charging dock (via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1mh6981/new_wireless_8bitdo_controller_leaked_on_amazon/">reddit</a>). </p>
<p>The controller is compatible with Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Android and iOS, and - according to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Controller-Gaming-Console/dp/B0FHQ6P7TQ">Amazon listing</a>, which has gone live prior to any official announcement from the studio itself - this release will mark 8BitDo's first 2.4G wireless Xbox controller.</p>

<p>"A legendary collaboration for a legendary milestone," reads the controller's Amazon page. "Wrapped in signature blue and gold, this special edition features symbolic patterns, game-inspired silhouettes and playful Easter eggs - a tribute to the legacy Rare brought to life."</p>
<p>Those aforementioned silhouettes include bananas (a nod to Donkey Kong), feathers ( Banjo-Kazooie), tentacles (Sea of Thieves) and more. You can see how it looks via the images below.</p>
<p>Amazon's sales page has the controller listed for $89.99, and at the time of writing it appears it will be only available across the pond in the US. Eurogamer has asked Microsoft for comment.</p>

<p>This controller leaked on the same day Rare itself shared an anniversary post on social media, celebrating 40 years in the business.</p>
<p>"From devoted Rare gamers to single-series stalwarts, we want to show our appreciation for anyone who's visited even just one of our worlds," <a href="https://x.com/RareLtd/status/1952327433010491560">it wrote</a>, with an accompanying piece of art showing characters from Rare's games all gathered together in a theatre (see below).</p>
<p>"For keeping an assorted ragtag of creatives working magic in the Midlands, only two words will do: THANK YOU."</p>

<p>Of course, it has not been an easy time for Rare recently. Just last month, the studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">fantasy adventure Everwild was cancelled following layoffs at Xbox</a>. Everwild was first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rare-announces-everwild-its-next-big-new-ip">revealed in late 2019</a>. At this time, the game was said to be the next "large" project from Rare, and one that would co-exist with the ongoing development of Sea of Thieves.</p>
<p>Soon after Everwild's cancellation, it was revealed Rare's most seasoned creator Gregg Mayles - known for directing the likes of Banjo-Kazooie and Sea of Thieves, as well as his work on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a> and many more games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-and-banjo-kazooie-director-gregg-mayles-reportedly-leaving-rare-after-35-years">had left the studio after more than 35 years</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/its-been-a-rough-year-for-rare-but-at-least-xbox-is-celebrating-its-40th-anniversary-with-a-licensed-controller]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
There's great news if you've been looking forward to smacking Captain America in the face. Guilty Gear developer Arc System Works has announced PlayStation 5 closed beta dates for its upcoming superhero tag team fighter Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls.
</p>
<p>
Announced back in June, Marvel Tōkon is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-is-a-superhero-tag-team-fighter-launching-next-year">bringing 4v4 superhero battling to PS5 and PC</a>, with players able to fight as "reimagined" versions of classic characters including Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Doctor Doom, Storm, Ms. Marvel, Star-Lord, and Ghost Rider. Each has a bespoke set of attacks inspired by their comic book abilities and powers, and there's also talk of varied stages, "intuitive" gameplay mechanics, and more.
</p>
<p>
And it turns out PlayStation 5 owners don't have too long to wait before they can put Marvel Tōkon through its paces. Arc System Works has confirmed the fighter's console-only closed beta runs from 5th-7th September, and registration is open now.

<p>
According to <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls/#closed-beta/">PlayStation's sign-up page</a>, players who're selected to participate in Marvel Tōkon's upcoming closed beta will have access to six playable fighters - specifically Captain America, Iron Man, Ms. Marvel, Star-Lord, Storm, and Doctor Doom - and will be able to battle across three areas of the Marvel's New York City stage. Also included is a chibi-inspired 64-player lobby, a Spectator Mode, and a tutorial mode.
</p>
<p>
Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls doesn't yet have a release date but it's due to arrive on PlayStation 5 and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) sometime next year. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-is-heading-to-evo-with-first-playable-build-and-gameplay-deep-dive">recently showed up at EVO 2025</a> and first impressions have been positive.
