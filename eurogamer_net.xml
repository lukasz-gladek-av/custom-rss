<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> didn't get off to the smoothest of starts, but eight years after its controversial launch, Hello Games' exploratory space sim has reached a significant milestone, finally gaining enough favourable player reviews on Steam to shift its overall rating to "Very Positive".
</p>
<p>
When No Man's Sky released back in August 2016, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-isnt-going-over-well-on-steam">player sentiment was such</a> that it quickly found itself damned with an "Overwhelming Negative" rating on Steam. It took two years and a number of significant updates for No Man's Sky to secure enough positive reviews that its average tipped over to "Mixed", and then a further three years after to that to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-five-years-no-mans-sky-has-finally-hit-mostly-positive-reviews-on-steam">reach an all-time user review average of "Mostly Positive"</a> in 2021.
</p>
<p>
As Hello Games' Tim Woodley explained at the time, "Each percentage point becomes exponentially harder to earn as you move up the ratings. Moving from 20 percent positive to 21 percent positive may only require a few hundred positive reviews whereas moving from 69 percent to 70 percent needed 10,000 positive reviews. This is why it's so rare for games to change their All-Time rating and why we'd assumed that we might never be able to."

<p>
Another three years - and a total of 35 free content updates - later, No Man's Sky has finally achieved the seemingly impossible, turning its initial "Overwhelmingly Negative" rating <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/">into "Very Positive"</a>. That means 80 percent of its 245,857 Steam reviews are positive - which is to says it's secured 196,686 blue thumbs up versus 49,171 red thumbs down. Addressing the milestone, studio boss Sean Murray <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1861859832187211963">wrote</a>, "Holy shit you guys - it happened. ALL REVIEWS: Very Positive. Thank you, thank you, thank you. You have no idea what this means to us."
</p><p>
No Man's Sky's next challenge, then, will be to nudge into the prestigious "Overwhelming Postive" category inhabited by the likes of Sekiro, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5">Persona 5</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, Hades, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a>, the Silent Hill 2 remake, and Half-Life: Alyx. That's a significantly tougher goal, however, requiring 95 percent of life-time reviews to be positive. In other words, assuming No Man's Sky doesn't receive a single negative review from this point forward, it'll need a total of 983,420 positive reviews - or 786,734 more than it has now. By which point the <em>actual</em> universe might be 16 minutes away from obliteration.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, the shift to "Very Positive" is still an incredible achievement, and testament to the incredible work Hello Games has put into its space sim over the last eight years. No Man's Sky's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-rolling-out-cross-save-support-from-today-as-ps5-pro-enhancements-arrive">most recent update</a> released earlier this month, introducing cross-save support, PlayStation 5 Pro enhancements, and the return of Mass Effect's Normandy. It's the sixth major update this year, following on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-the-cursed-is-a-spooky-expedition-for-halloween-set-in-a-collapsing-reality">October's spooky The Cursed</a> (which, among other things, introduced flying saucer ships for players), while other 2024 additions have included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-gets-reel-in-new-aquarius-fishing-update">fishing</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-orbital-update-overhauls-space-stations-today">refreshed space stations</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-borrows-some-of-light-no-fires-fancy-tech-for-a-planetary-overhaul-in-latest-update">massive world generation overhaul</a>.
</p>
<p>
Up next for Hello Games is its procedural planet adventure Light No Fire, which we've not had an update on since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-studio-unveils-procedural-fantasy-planet-adventure-light-no-fire">last year's reveal</a>. Perhaps we'll finally see more during December's The Game Awards, but regardless, it sounds like No Man's Sky journey is far from over.

            <p>
Larian would like you to know it's still not done with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. The studio has now revealed what's next for the multi-award-winning RPG, with cross-play, a photo mode, and 12 new subclasses all set to launch next year.
</p>
<p>
As detailed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4461474037375172735">over on Steam</a>, Larian currently has "one more major patch" in the works for Baldur's Gate 3 - officially known as Patch 8 - and it's set to introduce "some of the most eagerly awaited features", starting with cross-play.
</p>
<p>
Baldur's Gate 3 already supports cross-progression, of course, enabling players to pick up from where they left off regardless of the platform they move to. From next year, however, they'll also be able to team up with players from other platforms, seamlessly adventuring their way across western Faer√ªn with pals on PlayStation, Xbox, Mac, and PC.

<p>
"Once the update is live," Larian explains, "you'll be able to invite your friends to join your cross-play lobby directly, regardless of platform and find available multiplayer lobbies with friends on other systems using the Larian Network."
</p>
<p>
Patch 8 also introduces a new photo mode, featuring a "whole slew of options to let you customise and edit your in-game photography, with various levels of freedom depending on whether you're using it while adventuring, or during combat, dialogue, and cinematic scenes."
</p><p>
Players can, for instance, turn on a camera reticle and composition grid at the press of a button, while lens settings include adjustments for field of view, exposure, depth of field, and focus. It's also possible to hide characters you don't want to appear in shot - whether they be players, party members, NPCs, or enemies - and Larian is also including facial expressions and over 40 static and animated poses (each with their own variations!) that can be applied to characters prior to taking a shot. And that's still not quite everything, with photo mode also featuring post-processing effects - including contrast, saturation, highlights, brightness, and vignette - plus a selection of stickers and frames to add those final flourishes.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the biggest additions in Patch 8, though, are those new subclasses, with Larian introducing one for each of Baldur's Gate 3's existing classes - meaning the Bard, Barbarian, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Fighter, Monk, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer, Warlock, and Wizard are all represented. The new subclass names are listed below, but you'll be wanting to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4461474037375172735">read Larian's full post</a> for some detailed descriptions on each.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Bard - College of Glamour</li>
<li>Barbarian - Path of Giants</li>
<li>Cleric - Death Domain</li>
<li>Druid - Circle of Stars</li>
<li>Paladin - Oath of the Crown</li>
<li>Fighter - Arcane Archer</li>
<li>Monk - Drunken Master</li>
<li>Ranger - Swarmkeeper</li>
<li>Rogue - Swashbuckler</li>
<li>Sorcerer - Shadow Magic</li>
<li>Warlock - Hexblade</li>
<li>Wizard - Bladesinging</li>
</ul>
<p>
Larian says it'll be stress-testing Baldur's Gate 3's Patch 8 ahead of release in order to get player feedback. "The goal," it explains, "is to go beyond our internal testing and help us catch things before they can become an issue once a patch has been released." The stress test begins in "early January", and those wanting to get involved - it's open to players on Xbox and PlayStation, as well as PC - can register their interest beforehand, so expect further details soon.
</p><p>
So that's a bunch of good news for Baldur's Gate 3 players following this week's good news for Larian - which reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-mammoth-success-drives-larian-to-bumper-207m-pre-tax-profit-for-2023">posted a ‚Ç¨249m (¬£207m) pre-tax profit for 2023</a>, in no small part thanks to the runaway success of its smash-hit RPG.
