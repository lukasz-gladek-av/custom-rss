Sandbox matchmaking sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/date-everything">Date Everything!</a> has a final release date, after previously pushing back its earlier (and more romantic) 14th February launch plans.
</p>
<p>
Date Everything! will now arrive for PC, PlayStation 5, Switch and Xbox Series X/S on 17th June, publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/team17">Team17</a> confirmed today.
</p>
<p>
A romance game where you can hook up with anthropomorphic versions of pretty much anything in your flat - chairs, toilets, washing machines and more - Date Everything! tasks you with cosying up to as many things/people as possible to fill your Date-A-Dex (just don't tell The Pok√©mon Company).

There's more detail, from Felicia Day, on how the game's "Dateviator" glasses work in the release date trailer above.
</p>
<p>
A key draw to the game is its star-studded cast of video game voice actors being roped in for cameos, including Felicia Day as well as Laura Bailey, Ashley Johnson, Ashly Burch, Matt Mercer, Troy Baker, Roger Craig Smith, Ben Starr and dozens more.
</p>
<p>
If all of that sounds like your cup of tea, well, there's only two more months to wait. And if you really love cups of tea, you can probably date those too.
