            <p>Archetype Entertainment has finally unveiled a first look at gameplay of its forthcoming sci-fi RPG Exodus.</p>
<p>The game was first revealed at last year's The Game Awards and was notable for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matthew-mcconaughey-to-make-his-video-game-debut-in-sci-fi-rpg-exodus">starring Matthew McConaughey in his first video game role</a>.</p>
<p>A year later and we finally have a better idea of how exactly it will play, thanks to a new gameplay trailer (below) - it's got alien planets, third-person space shooting, and a very very angry bear.</p>

<p>In short, it's looking a lot like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> running on current platforms: from its shooter gameplay to its sci-fi aesthetic and narrative focus.</p>
<p>That's not surprising considering the studio's BioWare pedigree. This is the debut game from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-bioware-vets-working-on-story-driven-sci-fi-game-at-new-wizards-of-the-coast-studio">Archetype Entertainment</a>, co-founded by BioWare veterans James Ohlen (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age: Origins</a>) and Chad Robertson (Anthem).</p>
<p>The game will be published by Wizards of the Coast.</p>
<p>Further details on Exodus were provided in a livestream following the trailer's reveal with both Ohlen and Robertson.</p>
<p>In particular, details on its setting were shared. It takes place in a post-Earth exodus scenario (hence the name, presumably), where humanity has explored star systems and created advanced civilisations, as well as genetically modified creatures. That explains the bear, then.</p>
<p>There's competition between the human colonies, too, creating a web of various relationships and alliances players will need to navigate.</p>
<p>A key element will be Livestone, a hybrid of mineral and vegetation created by the Celestials that can be controlled by certain humans - I'm guessing the player protagonist will be one of them.</p>

<p>Time dilation is also a major focus, with the passage of time moving at different speeds across the universe. For instance, players will make personal and civilisational choices in their journey to other star systems, and while this may only be weeks for their character their homeworld will be significantly changed once they return due to differences in time.</p>
<p>Missions will be led with two companions - and yes, there will be romance.</p>
<p>We still don't know, though, who Matthew McConaughey will be playing.</p>
<p>So if you're done with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> and you're itching for some space adventure ahead of the next Mass Effect game, Exodus should have you covered.</p>
<p>That said, Exodus still doesn't have a release date. However, there's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-episodes-of-amazons-secret-level-anthology-hints-at-a-rich-visual-picknmix-but-is-that-enough">themed episode in Amazon's Secret Level series</a>.</p>
<p>As for the next Mass Effect, project director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-wont-dabble-with-stylised-visuals-like-dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-says">Michael Gamble said it won't feature stylised visuals</a> like the latest Dragon Age. "Mass Effect is photorealistic and will be as long as I'm running it," he said.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Secret Level is set to return for a second season, following its debut on Amazon last week.</p>
<p>The animated anthology is inspired by video games, with episodes dedicated to the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a>, Pac-Man, and Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
<p>Details of the second season are under wraps, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/secret-level-season-2-amazon-prime-video-1236251726/">Variety</a> reported, though Secret Level is the most-watched animated series debut of all time on Amazon's Prime Video streaming platform.</p>

<p>Exact viewership numbers have not been released, though Luminate estimates the series was watched for 155.3m minutes in the US during its first week - that's around 1.4m views as per its 109-minute runtime.</p>
<p>The series covers gaming past, present and future, from the iconic Mega Man to Amazon's MMORPG New World, to forthcoming space opera Exodus.</p>
<p>It's perhaps become best known for its Concord episode, which follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">Sony's decision to shut down the online shooter</a>.</p>
<p>"I don't feel bad that it's a part of the show," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-episode-in-amazons-secret-level-series-shows-potential-of-world-and-characters-says-creator">series creator Tim Miller told Rolling Stone</a>, "because I think it's an episode that turned out really well, and you can kind of see the potential of this world and the characters. If it's the remaining vestige of that product, I hope the developers feel that it's in some way worthy, just a little bit, of the blood, sweat, and tears they put into it."</p>
<p>Miller also directed the first Deadpool movie and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> animated anthology Love, Death &amp; Robots.</p>
<p>Ahead of the release of Secret Level, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-episodes-of-amazons-secret-level-anthology-hints-at-a-rich-visual-picknmix-but-is-that-enough">Eurogamer sampled the first four episodes</a> to see how the series fares.</p>

            <p>Amir Satvat was the recipient of the first 'Game Changers' award at The Game Awards last week, but has since received "countless hateful messages", "disturbing comments" and antisemitic remarks about his wife.</p>
<p>Satvat received the award for his work helping laid-off employees across the games industry to find new work. The award was host <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>'s way of addressing the "significant and unprecedented industry-wide layoffs", which he admitted the show struggles to address "in a constructive way".</p>
<p>Satvat has helped to place nearly 3000 people into jobs, and was described at the awards show as "career Santa Claus". Yet since last week, he's been subjected to abuse online due to his current work at Chinese tech conglomerate <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>.</p>

<p>"Over the past four days, I have received countless hateful messages targeting me personally, alongside hundreds more on YouTube and Twitter," Satvat wrote in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amirsatvat_fellow-members-of-the-games-industry-i-need-activity-7274667576159350787-Zzpw?utm_source=li_share&amp;utm_content=feedcontent&amp;utm_medium=g_dt_web&amp;utm_campaign=copy">LinkedIn post</a>.</p>
<p>"People have made disturbing comments about my family - I am only not sharing those comments because they are disgusting, but I will share some other sample comments. My wife and me have been targeted with anti-Semitic slurs. Several videos mocked my comments suggesting I sounded autistic - riffing on it for their audience's amusement."</p>
<p>Due to his work as a business development director at Tencent, Satvat has been accused of being some sort of agent or plant exploiting the community, or that he's a fraud, he wrote.</p>
<p>However, he explained his community work began in November 2022 before he started at Tencent in August 2023. Before this he worked for Amazon, but again his community work was separate.</p>
<p>"I didn't / don't work on mergers and acquisitions at Tencent or Amazon," Satvat continued. "This stems from one innocent, erroneous mention of what I do in a Level Infinite article, since corrected to show I only work on investments."</p>
<p>He has also never laid employees off.</p>
<p>"They simply didn't mention Tencent at TGA because it had nothing to do with this community and they wanted to focus on how we drove this ourselves," he said.</p>
<p>"I've been accused of creating 'jail-worthy fraud' and mocked for 'just making one spreadsheet people enter info into', usually by people who spent all of eight seconds looking at our site with no understanding of the work we do or the impact we've had. We have 15 resources across five different resource homes and there is a lot of depth to our community, as any of you who have used it know."</p>
<p>He surmised: "This can happen to you too when you sacrifice over 2,000 hours of your time to help the industry - this is the 'reward' for two years of service."</p>
<p>Finishing the post, he said he would now "return to our mission of positive, public service".</p>
