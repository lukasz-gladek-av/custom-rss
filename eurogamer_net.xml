            <p>On its release, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>: Tarnished Edition will include two new classes for players to choose from when they set off for the Lands Between.</p>
<p>This upcoming edition of the game was first revealed last month, when developer FromSoftware announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">Elden Ring would be coming to Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>At this time, the team said new armour, a new Torrent appearance customisation feature and "more" would be available for Elden Ring players, and while this edition was announced for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, FromSoftware confirmed the additional content will also be available on other platforms as DLC.</p>

<p>And now, we have a better idea of just what that previously teased "more" is, with the news that two new classes are coming to Elden Ring.</p>
<p>As shared by <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202505/41423">Famitsu</a>, these classes are Knight of Ides and Heavy Knight (via machine translation). At the present time, the developer hasn't said what kind of stats these two new classes will have, so something else to keep an eye out for. Heavy Knight suggests quite a burly class, though.</p>
<p>According to the publication, in addition to these new classes the Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition will also include three new looks for Torent, along with four new types of armour, weapons, and combat techniques.</p>
<p>As to when we will be able to get our hands on this edition of Elden Ring, we are still awaiting a release date. Later this month, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">co-op spin-off Elden Ring Nightreign will make its debut</a>.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a> will be released on 30th May across PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC. You can check out the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-the-pc-requirements-for-elden-ring-nightreign">PC requirements for Elden Ring Nightreign here</a>.</p>
<p>The studio also has a brand-new title known as The Duskbloods in the pipeline. Announced as part of Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct, The Duskbloods is a PvPvE title with online multiplayer, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-is-bloodborne-meets-sekiro-meets-dark-souls-with-jetpacks-and-dinos-thrown-in">our Matt noting it looked like "Bloodborne meets Sekiro meets Dark Souls, with jetpacks and dinos thrown in"</a>. </p>
<p>Last week, FromSoftware announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-sales-pass-30m">Elden Ring had shipped over 30m copies worldwide</a> since its release three years ago.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
