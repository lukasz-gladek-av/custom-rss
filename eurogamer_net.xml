            <p>
Switchmas Day is finally upon us, but some unlucky <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a> recipients have had a nasty surprise when unwrapping their presents from Miyamoto Claus. Reports have surfaced of retailers carelessly stapling receipts right through the console's packaging and into its screen.
</p>
<p>
Anyone that's already purchased a Switch 2 might have noticed just how neatly Nintendo's squeezed the thing into its relatively small box. In order to achieve that compact footprint, the company has settled on a packing configuration that places the slimline console right at the top pile, up against the cardboard surroundings with just a thin sleeve to protect it from scratches.
</p>
<p>
It most cases, it's a perfectly fine approach, but not when retailer carelessness - and improper use of a staple gun - is factored in. Numerous customers have taken to the internet following yesterday's midnight launch to report they'd excitedly unpacked their Switch 2s, only to discover that staples used to attach their receipts to the front of the box had gone straight through two layers of cardboard, through the console's protective sleeve, and become embedded right into Switch 2's prominent screen.
</p>
<p>
"GameStop stapled the receipt for me and my friends Switch 2s to the box," one disgruntled customer <a href="https://x.com/Oadhan/status/1930496875532018128">wrote on social media</a>, adding an entirely understandable, "FML." They also attached a sad image of their console's shiny new display, now sporting two very noticeable puncture holes. Similar stories have been posted to the GameStop subreddit, although some have now been removed after they highlighted a specific GameStop store.

<p>
"This happened to me and another buddy [at the same GameStop]!", one Redditor wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1l3rcuu/comment/mw370bi/">in response to a now-deleted post</a>. "Think the entire pre order batch is completely fucked." IGN, which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-screen-punctures-ruin-launch-day-for-fans-due-to-store-receipts-stapled-into-consoles-box">saw the posts prior their removal</a>, reports the issue primarily appears to have impacted Switch 2's purchased at one busy GameStop in New York, but it's unclear if the aggressive frontal use of a staple gun is company policy across all its stores.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer contacted GameStop for clarification on the extent of issue, to see what it's doing to prevent similar occurrences elsewhere across its stores, and how it will be ensuring impacted customers receive a new Switch 2 in a timely manner - hopefully one that doesn't whistle in the wind this time around. "We are currently investigating this matter," a company spokesperson responded. "We will make the customer whole if there was damage."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/out-of-nowhere-arcsystem-works-sends-the-fighting-game-genre-into-chaos-as-the-outlook-suddenly-changes-for-riots-2xko<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>During last night's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-everything-announced">PlayStation State of Play</a>, the show concluded with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-is-a-superhero-tag-team-fighter-launching-next-year">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a>. A superhero tag-team fighter from Arc System Works, the community of die-hard fighting game lovers celebrated the announcement, with some making comparisons to Riot Games' upcoming release: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/project-l">2XKO</a></p>
<p>2XKO, itself a tag fighter that has been in development <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/3/8/11181204/riot-games-acquires-radiant-entertainment">since Radiant Entertainment was acquired by Riot back in 2016</a> had largely had the tag-fighter space to itself for the foreseeable future, with the exception of the endearing but budget title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hunterxhunter-nenximpact">HunterxHunter NenxImpact</a>.</p>
<p>However, with this announcement, it looks like Riot Games has a real Marvel rival to contend with. Social media was abuzz with excitement for Marvel Tokon. Justin Wong, perhaps North America's most prominent Marvel vs Capcom player, <a href="https://x.com/JWonggg/status/1930380603524034820">wrote</a>: "Holy shit MARVEL FIGHTING GAME IS BACK?!".</p>

<p>Yipes, himself a beloved figure in the professional fighting game scene and a legendary Marvel vs Capcom 2 player, was lost for words. <a href="https://x.com/IFCYipeS/status/1930382431057784971">He posted</a>, "!??!?!?!??!?!?!", an apt measure of the overall feeling following the State of Play.</p>
<p>This reveal brought with it immediate comparisons to 2XKO, due to the unavoidable rivalry between the two games. <a href="https://x.com/Alioune85/status/1930405418137727416">Former pro player Alioune</a> summed it up with "If « fuck you 2xko » was a game", whereas <a href="https://x.com/Nushinator24/status/1930382031797792861">one fighting game fan</a> on Twitter reacted by stating: "Game already has a bigger roster than 2xko".</p>
<p>Indeed in the run up to 2XKO's release later this year the game has been seen through a more critical lens following recent announcements and play tests. Game director on 2XKO Shaun Rivera revealed in a Discord Q&amp;A earlier this year that <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2xko-will-have-a-smaller-number-than-you-would-expect-when-it-comes-to-champions-at-launch-but-theres-a-good-reason-why">2XKO will have 10 champions at launch</a>, a relatively small number for a tag fighter. That game currently has seven announced fighters, whereas Marvel Hokon blasted out the gate with eight on display.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Congrats to Marvel, ArcSys and Playstation on the Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls reveal. The game looks amazing and I can’t wait to play it.</p>— Shaun Rivera (@Unconkable) <a href="https://twitter.com/Unconkable/status/1930425812270100550?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>However rather gritting their teeth or keeping thoughts close to their chest, several members of the 2XKO development team praised the new game. Unsurprising, as the team is composed of several former professional fighting game players. Rivera<a href="https://x.com/Unconkable/status/1930425812270100550"> congratulated the Marvel Hokon team on the reveal</a>: "Congrats to Marvel, ArcSys and Playstation on the Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls reveal. The game looks amazing and I can't wait to play it."</p>
<p>Ben Forbes, 2XKO's editor-in-chief, <a href="https://x.com/draggles/status/1930380440315277393">shot out an initial</a> "oh fuck", before following up with: "sorry i was in meetings and had to pay attention MARVELLLLLLLLLLLLLL I'M THERE DAY ONE IRON MAN LOOKS SO SICK AAAAAAAAAA also star lord is dante???? LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOO".</p>
<p>All in all it appears to be a "two cakes" situation, with two somewhat similar games clashing in the future resulting in more options for those who love diving deep into 2D brawls. <a href="https://x.com/JWonggg/status/1930392702568317181">As Wong puts it</a>: "Too many fighting games what a time to be a fighting game fan".</p>
<p>If there are any companies catching strays right now, it's actually Capcom. The developer responsible for the Marvel vs Capcom series up until the poorly received <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-vs-capcom-infinite">Marvel vs Capcom: Infinite</a>. Folks reacted to Marvel taking the IP to another company with the sort of humour you'd imagine. Take Evo champion Sonicfox, who posted the following image:</p>

<p>Ultimately Marvel Hokon: Fighting Souls has made the next year or so dead interesting. Whether Riot Games can capture the hearts and minds with a live service approach, or Marvel Hokon: Fighting Souls can cut itself a slice of the pie with some of its own boundary-pushing twists on the genre, is something the two will have to fight over.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
