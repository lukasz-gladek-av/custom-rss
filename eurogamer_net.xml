            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> will include an optional combat radar, following intense pleas from the community.</p>
<p>In a lengthy social media thread by Randy Pitchford, the Gearbox CEO broke down the thought process behind the navigation and combat design in Borderlands 4, concluding the thread by revealing the team managed to add in a combat radar last week.</p>
<p>Pitchford wrote: "The feature will be *off* by default at launch. And, it didn't come on-line early enough to make it into our branch for the build we're bringing to the Borderlands Fan Fest this weekend. But it is now officially in the game!".</p>

<p>Pitchford elaborated: "This happened because of the best elements of our community. I'm talking about the real fans who sincerely want the best for the game and gave constructive notes and made reasonable arguments. You know who you are and you rock! You made this happen!".</p>
<p>The whole thread is worth reading for those interested in the game design process. It offers a lot of insight into the thought process behind the new movement and navigation mechanics, the costs of adding a combat radar to Borderlands 4, and how a recent press tour provided feedback that ultimately convinced the developers a combat radar would be a good idea.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 creative director Graeme Timmins added their own thoughts on the reveal, noting: "Props to Jason Brown, Justin Dooley, and Ray Pe√±a who went incredibly fast when I told them - 'If we're doing this, I want it for launch.' This is just how committed we are here guys; we're doing everything to make BL4 the definitive Borderlands."</p>
<p>A combat radar was an ever-present feature of previous installments in the Borderlands series, and offered quick and reliable information as to where immediate dangers were at any one time. This wouldn't be a huge deal at first, but as you proceeded to more challenging content it became vastly more important.</p>
<p>As such, its absence <em>was</em> noteworthy. In response to this news Borderlands fans celebrated on social media, with user furt1v3ly writing: "Oh heck yeah. I didn't need the mini-map but that radar beats the compass system hands-down. And being able to turn it off for screenshots or for extra frame rate should be a bigger win. This is the best choice."</p>
<p>It's a moment of good PR for Gearbox, at a time when it's sorely needed. Gearbox recently revealed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/randy-pitchford-stoked-about-borderlands-4s-70-price-point-confirms-tonne-of-dlc-on-the-way">$70 retail price of Borderlands 4, which Pitchford was publically "stoked" about</a>. This came after Pitchford stated on social media that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-randy-pitchford-seeks-to-justify-80-real-fans-comment">"real fans" would get a copy regardless of its price</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-changes-next-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> Reddit AMA has provided insight into when the next major update may be coming, as well as a firm stance on the design direction of the PvP endgame.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lehj35/official_dune_awakening_launch_ama_with_funcom/">AMA</a> was handled by Funcom developers including creative director Joel Bylos. It was Bylos who responded to questions regarding the endgame PvP, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-is-being-dominated-by-one-busted-technique-crushing-people-with-helicopters">which has proven controversial</a> among those torn on the orniphopter-laden meta that has formed in the game's opening weeks.</p>
<p>When asked whether the team was considering removing missile launchers for scout orniphopters - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-early-meta-helicopter-infested-nightmare">the source of much ire</a> - Bylos responded with considerations from the team.</p>

<p>"Equipping a Scout Ornithopter with rocket Pods [could] reduce overall maneuverability and max speed. This will help solidify this module selection as a desire to engage in combat and balance it versus other combat-focused vehicles," said Bylos. He also noted other ideas, like an increased impact on the scout orniphopters' heat when shooting missiles, as well as a baseline speed increase to orniphopters with boosters equipped to make escaping easier.</p>
<p>As for the overall endgame experience, Bylos expanded his thoughts as to explain more macro goals the team desire.</p>
<p>"We want players to make meaningful decisions about what they bring with them and how they outfit their vehicles," Bylos stated. "Once players have engaged in PvP, we want the experience to be reliable, responsive, and clearly understood. This determines how PvP as a whole feels and how players make their moment to moment decisions in a fight."</p>
<p>Bylos would conclude by addressing concerns regarding connection-related troubles: "To ensure a more reliable experience in ground combat, we are continuing to address issues with movement desyncs and rubber banding, as well as ability activation reliability."</p>
<p>When asked whether or not a Deep-Desert-style zone without vehicles was being considered, Bylos outright stated no, elaborating: "a lot of our adjustments and balancing are going to drive combat towards the core vision, which is people competing over points of interest in the Deep Desert". Bylos continued: "The current balance between vehicles and on-foot is not tuned to our liking and there are multiple changes in the pipeline to address this (above and beyond bugs we will fix)."</p>
<p>So it's certainly been made clear that quality of life changes are being worked on, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-patch-ends-the-reign-of-vehicular-terror-as-ramming-into-other-players-no-longer-deals-damage">like the removal of vehicle ramming damage in PvP</a>, the team stood firm for their ideas on how the Deep Desert works. Which is good, in my opinion. Filing down this "vision", as Bylos puts it, risks removing a substantial amount of character from the game.</p>
<p>The AMA wasn't just focused on PvP! Other interesting tidbits were revealed by the team, such as a quality-of-life update coming in July, the fact that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-new-maps-hagga-basin">major Dune: Awakening updates</a> are planned to release every three-four months with new PvE and story stuff to play through, as well as plans to add new contracts to the game.</p>
<p>In Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-review">Dune: Awakening review</a>, the endgame was described glowingly: "It feels less like structured group activities you'd see in a traditional MMORPG raid, and more like grouping up in Classic WoW for a world boss. Or joining a hunt train in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>. It's organic community play, something that forms bonds, strong friendships, and undoubtedly tense rivalries."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This is the second of the team's zombie games to get the remake treatment. However, reception to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/house-of-the-dead-remake-heading-to-playstation-5-this-week">first House of the Dead: Remake's reception was pretty mixed</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/house-of-the-dead-film-in-the-works-from-resident-evil-monster-hunter-director">The House of the Dead is also set for the big screen, with Paul WS Anderson</a> on board to write and direct. Anderson will also serve as a producer, alongside his partner Jeremy Bolt. The duo have also worked on adaptations for the likes of Mortal Kombat (1995) and Monster Hunter (2020), as well as multiple Resident Evil films.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Limited Run Games has requested Nintendo temporarily remove its Gex Trilogy from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> eShop.</p>
<p>The Gex Trilogy, which bundles together the cult-classic 90s platformer Gex and its two sequels, launched earlier this week across PC, PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and both Switch consoles.</p>

<p>But while things appear to have gone swimmingly across most platforms, the trilogy wasn't working as intended on Switch 2. A number of Limited Run Games titles which run on its Carbon Engine had compatibility issues with the new console, however a recent firmware update released by Nintendo last night resolved the majority of these. But, alas, the Gex Trilogy was not one of them.</p>
<p>Sharing an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/limitedrungames.com/post/3lrxtpy5kw627">update on social media</a>, Limited Run Games said: "Since we do not have clarity on when Gex Trilogy on Switch 2 will be fixed in firmware, we submitted our own patch last week to correct the issue."</p>
<p>However, due to the Juneteenth holiday across the pond, this patch is still awaiting approval. While Limited Run Games hopes to issue the patch early next week, it has requested Nintendo for the time being removes the game from the Switch 2 eShop.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your patience as we work with Nintendo to resolve these issues," Limited Run Games wrote, before sharing a list of its games that are now Switch 2 compatible following that aforementioned firmware update.</p>
<p>This list is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clock Tower: Rewind</li>
<li>Jurassic Park Classic Games Collection</li>
<li>Tomba! Special Edition</li>
<li>River City Girls Zero</li>
<li>A Boy and his Blob Collection</li>
<li>Rocket Knight Adventures</li>
<li>Shantae</li>
<li>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Retro Collection</li>
<li>Xtreme Sports</li>
<li>Trip World DX</li>
<li>Felix the Cat</li>
<li>Rendering Ranger R-2: Rewind</li>
</ul>

<p>The Gex Trilogy has otherwise been a successful launch for the team at Limited Run Games. Soon after its more modern debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gex-trilogy-celebrates-success-with-much-requested-feature-that-should-make-european-fans-happy">the publisher announced the PAL versions of Gex 2 and Gex 3</a> - which feature the vocal stylings of Leslie Philips and Danny John-Jules respectively - will be added in an update.</p>
<p>"We're excited for European Gex fans to relive these games the way they remember and for others to hear them for the first time," Limited Run Games said at the time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
