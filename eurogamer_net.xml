            <p>Sonic Rumble, Sega's forthcoming party game for mobile and PC, has been delayed into the spring.</p>
<p>The game is currently available in pre-launch in 44 countries, with a global launch (including UK and US) originally planned for winter.</p>
<p>Now, in a new update from developer Rovio (known for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/angry-birds">Angry Birds</a> games), the global launch has been pushed back to spring, with its 1.2.0 update.</p>

<p>Sonic Rumble will be a free-to-play battle royale game where 32 players collect rings in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a>-esque competitive rounds.</p>
<p>Rovio has revealed the 1.2.0 version will also include a ranked competitive mode, a "Crews" feature to allow players to join up together, and the inclusion of character-specific abilities.</p>
<p>Before that, a 1.1.2 update for those in pre-launch will add a Quick Rumble mode for players to enter a single round challenge.</p>

<p>"We would like to extend a huge thank you to our players and Sonic fans for their patience in waiting for the global launch of Sonic Rumble," wrote the developer <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/en/news/000111/">in an update</a>. "The team is committed to delivering a memorable experience for Sonic fans with even more new game mechanics, new features, and more exciting content to look forward to."</p>
<p>Known predominantly for its Angry Birds games, Sonic Rumble will be Rovio's first brand new game since the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-buys-angry-birds-maker-rovio-for-625m">studio was acquired by Sega in 2023</a> for £625m.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-rumble-wont-include-gacha-mechanics-as-sega-says-theyre-shunned-in-west">Sonic Rumble is also notable for its lack of gacha mechanic</a>, due to its lack of popularity in the west.</p>
<p>Said Sonic franchise lead Takashi Iizuka: "In the Japanese and Asian markets, it's common to have to spend tens of thousands of yen [in a game] until you draw a rare character and finally get to move on. But this is not the case in the global market, especially for an action game like Sonic Rumble, where players should be able to enjoy the game on an equal footing. The starting point of this project itself was to make it a mobile game that would sell globally. Therefore, the monetisation model was designed from the beginning based on global standards."</p>
<p>The game will feature a season pass instead.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken">Tekken</a> boss Katsuhiro Harada has responded to a fan on social media criticising the new design of Anna Williams, stating "there will always be people like you".</p>
<p>Yesterday Bandai Namco revealed Anna would be the next fighter to join <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a> as part of its ongoing DLC roadmap, complete with a redesign of her look - as with many returning characters.</p>
<p>However one fan shared their disappointment on social media requesting the old design return. "I don't like the new design," they wrote, "replacing Anna with this new character is the devs way at getting back at Anna fans for all these years of support makes me feel sad."</p>

<p>"While 98 percent of the fans are welcoming this, there will always be people like you," wrote Harada in response. "I understand and sympathise that it may not suit your personal taste, but if you prefer the old design, past works already exist. I am not taking those away from you.</p>
<p>"Also, you refer to yourself as 'Anna fans,' as if you represent all Anna fans, but you should express your opinion as an individual."</p>
<p>Harada then referred to the impossibility of pleasing players, writing: "You threaten to quit if she isn't brought back. You complain the moment she is brought back. You demand that she be reverted after she has been completely redesigned from scratch, including her model and framework. And if she actually were reverted, you'd just say, 'That's recycling!'"</p>
<p>"Either way," he concluded, "your method of expressing your opinion and the content of your argument are entirely unconstructive, utterly pointless, and, above all, disrespectful to the other Anna fans who are genuinely looking forward to her."</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1894542252967649717">Harada additionally responded to a more positive response</a> to Anna's design, and explained why he often responds to negative opinions.</p>
<p>"It's because these negative folks tend to have a narrow perspective," he said. "If I don't respond, they start spreading toxicity, saying things like, 'Why won't they engage with the community?!'"</p>
<p>He responded to other negative comments too, stating: "If you don't like something, you don't have to buy it, you don't have to comment, and you can simply leave."</p>
<p>Harada's comments exemplify the frustration of developers battling online toxicity. Take former PlatinumGames boss Hideki Kamiya, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-calls-out-shty-leakers-in-wake-of-switch-2-reveal">called out "shitty leakers" in the wake of Nintendo's Switch 2 reveal</a>, or Riot Games' head Anna Donlon who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valorant-studio-head-tells-toxic-players-to-play-something-else-we-wont-miss-you">discussed the "current state of player behaviour" in Valorant</a> and told toxic players to "play something else, we won't miss you".</p>
<p>Harada caused confusion last month when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-boss-says-he-just-wants-to-meet-more-people-as-fans-spot-linkedin-post-looking-for-work">set his LinkedIn profile to "open to work"</a>, causing fans to worry he would be leaving Bandai Namco. He responded saying he wanted to "broaden [his] horizons by connecting with more people".</p>
<p>Before Anna, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16s-clive-coming-to-tekken-8-as-first-seasons-final-dlc-character">Tekken 8 added Final Fantasy 16's Clive Rosfield</a> as a DLC character.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Last night, Warner Bros shocked the industry when it was announced the closure of three studios, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">including Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor's Monolith Productions</a>. Founded in the 1990s and part of Warner Bros since 2004, the studio was best known for Shadow of Mordor and its follow-up Shadow of War, which both used the studio's patented Nemesis system.
</p>
<p>The Nemesis system, for those unfamiliar, is a clever in-game mechanic which tracks a player's actions to create enemies that feel capable of remembering past encounters. In the studio's Middle-earth games, this allowed foes to rise through the ranks and enact revenge.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monolith-is-making-a-wonder-woman-game">Nemesis system was set to be utilised again in Monolith's Wonder Woman game</a>, though that project has now been cancelled alongside the studio's sudden closure - leaving the Nemesis system seemingly now lying unused, and protected by Warner Bros due to its successful patent application.</p>

</figure>
<p>The patent itself - <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160279522A1/en">which you can view here</a> - was originally filed back in 2016, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-is-trying-to-patent-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordors-nemesis-system">before it was granted in 2021</a>. It is dubbed "Nemesis characters, nemesis forts, social vendettas and followers in computer games". As it stands, the patent has an expiration date of 11th August, 2036.</p>
<p>So, even though Monolith is getting shut down, Warner Bros will be able to retain the patent for the Nemesis system for another 11 years, should it keep up the patent's associated fees.</p>
<p>Many are upset that this may well mean the death of the Nemesis system. "They really patented the Nemesis System only to do absolutely nothing with it," <a href="https://x.com/MarsSuccessor/status/1894469391846105516">wrote one social media user</a>. "RIP the Nemesis system, I guess," added <a href="https://x.com/Cade_Onder/status/1894486393952317771">video game journalist Cade Onder</a>. </p>
<p>"Monolith literally created a one-of-a-kind system that procedurally generated a complete hierarchy of unique enemies that interacted with the player and itself in the Nemesis System," <a href="https://x.com/counterscottGO/status/1894467261261389908">another wrote</a>. "WB took that from them, patented it, and then closed their studio. Fuck them."</p>

<p>Needless to say, the news of Monolith's closure last night, along with the closure of Player First Games and Warner Bros Games San Diego, has been met with sadness across the industry.</p>
<p>Comic book writer Gail Simone, who was serving as a consultant on Monolith's Wonder Woman title, said the game was both "gorgeous and expansive".</p>
<p>"It was beautiful to look at. I am not going to give details for a number of reasons, but every effort was made to make this not just a great game, but a great WONDER WOMAN game," Simone wrote on social media, calling the project a "showpiece epic". The consultant added the team wanted to "make the best game ever", however "sometimes, you give your all and it doesn’t work out".</p>

<p>The cancellation of Wonder Woman comes amid an extremely rocky period for Warner Bros' games division, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gotham-knights-latest-patch-adds-a-tough-new-15-floor-heroic-assault-raid">Warner Bros Montreal's Gotham Knights</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-final-chapter-brings-game-to-a-cheap-end">Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-director-in-deep-mourning-following-last-weeks-shutdown-news">IP-heavy party brawler MultiVersus</a>, and last year's Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions all failing to make an impact with consumers.</p>
<p>Last month, Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment president <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-departs-following-rocky-period-for-publisher">David Haddad announced he was stepping down after 12 years in the role</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/edge-of-eternity-studio-announces-jrpg-follow-up-with-xenoblade-and-chrono-trigger-talent<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
The French developer behind million-selling indie role-player Edge of Eternity has announced a fresh follow-up, Edge of Memories.
</p>
<p>
This new game - a blend of JRPG mechanics and French animation - is set in the same world, and will launch this autumn for PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
</p>
<p>
Once again, the Montpellier-based Studio Midgar has recruited JRPG veterans to join the game's development, with Edge of Eternity featuring an expanded roster. This includes Nier writer Sawako Natori and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-10">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a> character designer Raita Kazama.

</figure>
<p>
For the game's music, some of which you can hear in the game's reveal trailer above, Studio Midgar has called in Nier and Nier Automata singer Emi Evans, as well as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> and Xenogears composer Yasunori Mitsuda, plus <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-3">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a> composer Mariam Abounnasr.
</p>
<p>
Edge of Memories is being designed as an action RPG, with real-time combat focused on chaining combos across the game's plague-ridden new continent of Avaris. Today's teaser ends with the game's main character looking like she can draw power from the plague too - intriguing!
</p>
<p>The game's Kickstarter-funded predecessor Edge of Eternity launched on PC back in 2021 to a decent if not overly-enamoured response. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indie-jrpg-edge-of-eternity-headed-to-consoles-next-year">console version turned up in 2022</a>, including a cloud version for Switch. I wonder if we'll see <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> port announced down the line?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
