<p>Vessel of Hatred was released in October, adding the Spiritborn class and a new jungle region.</p>
<p>"A polished, bewitching upgrade that sinks its claws into you - featuring perhaps the best character class in Diablo's history," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred review</a>.</p> <div>

<p>However, Diablo now has strong competition from Path of Exile 2, another ARPG that released into early access this month.</p>
<p>Ahead of its launch it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-director-warns-of-queues-this-weekend-due-to-over-a-million-early-access-players">reached one million early access redemptions</a>, and on Steam it quickly reached a peak <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2694490/charts/">concurrent player count</a> of 578,569.</p>
<p>"Soulslike thrills combine with sky-high production values to make Path of Exile 2 a hugely impressive package, even in early access," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-early-access-review">Path of Exile 2 early access review</a>.</p>
<p>Still, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-not-rewarding-enough-its-developer-admits-amid-incoming-changes">developer admitted the game was "not rewarding enough"</a> as it addressed early feedback and laid out plans to alter its rewards.</p>
<p>Diablo 4 is also available on Xbox Game Pass.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
