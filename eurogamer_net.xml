EA has confirmed its next Battlefield game is still on track to launch before next April, with a full reveal due this "summer", following several months of invite-only playtests.
</p>
<p>
EA CEO Andrew Wilson shared the news of Battlefield's imminent reveal as part of the company's <a href="https://news.ea.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q4-and-FY25-Results/default.aspx">Q4 and financial year 2025 earnings report</a>. "As we look to the future, we're confident in our ability to execute across a deep pipeline," he wrote, "beginning this summer with the highly anticipated reveal of Battlefield, a pivotal step in delivering on our next generation of blockbuster entertainment."
</p>
<p>
The publisher also recommitted to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-expected-to-release-before-april-2026">previously announced FY26 release window </a>for Battlefield, meaning the game is still on track to launch before April next year. Back in February, Wilson suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be">EA might be willing to delay its next Battlefield</a> if "some things happening in the year" meant that "wasn't a great window for us" - seemingly an oblique reference to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">since been delayed into May next year</a>.

<p>
EA has previously shared some lofty goals for its next Battlefield, saying it wants it to be the "biggest [series  entry] we've ever made." To that end, it's been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">running invite-only playtests</a> since March as it seeks to "get the community back on [its] side" following the poorly received <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> - which quickly became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-is-now-one-of-steams-worst-reviewed-games-of-all-time">one of Steam's worst-reviewed games of all time</a> after its launch in 2021, and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-admits-battlefield-2042-flopped-but-would-have-been-less-than-10-percent-of-annual-revenue-anyway">later acknowledged to have flopped</a>.
</p>
<p>
While EA's recent Battlefield playtests have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reminds-battlefield-players-things-taking-place-in-labs-may-or-may-not-make-their-way-to-the-final-game">resulted in a flurry of leaked footage</a>, little has been officially revealed beyond the fact it's set in the modern day, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">bring back traditional classes and more focused maps</a> after the unpopular changes made in Battlefield 2042. There've also been suggestions, based on landmarks sighted in the single bit of concept art shared last year, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-sleuth-seemingly-identifies-location-teased-in-next-games-first-bit-of-concept-art">the series might be heading to Gibraltar</a>. But with a full reveal due this "summer" - perhaps at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-dates-confirmed">this year's Summer Game Fest</a> - there shouldn't be too long until we learn more.
</p>
<p>
Before then, however, EA <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1919754055284314568">has announced plans</a> to "continue scaling Battlefield Labs testing globally", saying it'll begin inviting more players across Europe, North America, and select areas of Asia throughout May. These playtest will include new content, as well as further testing of weapon balancing, damage values, plus "movement and combat pacing mechanics".
</p>
<p>
Away from Battlefield, EA has confirmed its free-to-play Skate reboot is similarly due to launch before April 2026. Previously, developer Full Circle said it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-wont-be-playable-offline-to-offer-a-massively-multiplayer-sandbox-thats-always-online-and-always-evolving">remains committed to its 2025 early access release window</a>, although a more specific date is yet to be shared.

            <p>
Starbreeze Studios has acquired the publishing rights to its beleaguered heist sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a>, insisting the move will enable it to "accelerate content development and pursue broader business opportunities" for the franchise "as a whole".
</p>
<p>
Payday 3 got off to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-developer-likens-launch-to-being-a-rock-band-when-the-whole-stage-collapses-and-everyone-leaves">disastrous start</a> when it launched in September 2023, struggling with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-players-endure-second-consecutive-day-of-server-issues-preventing-them-from-playing">serious matchmaking issues</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-requires-an-always-on-online-connection">unpopular online-only requirements</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3s-much-delayed-first-patch-is-finally-here">repeatedly delayed first major patch</a>. Its player count quickly plummeted and has been consistently dwarfed by its predecessor since then, with Starbreeze last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-developer-seeks-long-term-success-after-disappointing-launch">admitting</a> numbers were "at significantly lower levels than [it] would like". Just a month later, CEO Tobias Sj√∂gren was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starbreeze-ceo-tobias-sjogren-ousted-by-board-following-payday-3-flop">ousted by the board</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-gets-new-creative-leads-as-player-numbers-still-dwarfed-by-decade-old-predecessor">new Payday 3 creative leadership team was brought in last December</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's in that context Starbreeze has now "reached a mutual agreement" with former Payday 3 publisher Plaion that'll enable the studio to fully acquire the publishing rights to the game. To finance the transaction, Starbreeze has <a href="https://www.starbreeze.com/news/starbreeze-enters-into-agreement-regarding-the-publishing-rights-for-payday-3-and-carries-out-a-directed-share-issue-of-class-b-shares-amounting-to-sek-33-million/">announced it's issuing new shares worth SEK 33m</a>, with SEK 29m of the proceeds (approximately ¬£2.3m) going toward repaying Plaion under the previous Payday 3 agreement, and "settling certain outstanding claims".
</p>
<p>
In a statement accompanying the news, board member Thomas Lindgren said Starbreeze's Payday 3 acquisition would enable it to "significantly accelerate [its] content development roadmap, and pursue broader strategic opportunities for the Payday franchise as a whole."
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Starbreeze - which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-and-dragons-game-in-the-works-from-payday-developer-starbreeze">currently also working on a Dungeons &amp; Dragons game</a> - has suggested more Payday could be on the way, despite the latest instalment's struggles. "While this agreement marks the conclusion of the current publishing arrangement," the studio wrote in its announcement, "it also lays the groundwork for a long-term partnership between Starbreeze and Plaion on future Payday franchise projects."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer contributor Vikki Blake <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-review">awarded Payday 3 three out of five stars in 2023</a>, calling it a "shallow shooter that doesn't offer anywhere near enough bang for your ill-gotten buck."
