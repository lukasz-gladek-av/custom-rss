            <p>
GOG has announced a fresh wave of additions to its Preservation Program, including Capcom's classic RPG Breath of Fire 4, which returns to PC after an absence of over 20 years.
</p>
<p>
Breath of Fire 4, if you're currently drawing a blank, follows the adventures of a young man named Ryu (who usefully has the power to transform into dragons) as he attempts to stop an immortal emperor from destroying the world. The game is celebrating its quarter-century anniversary this year - having originally launched for PlayStation in Japan and the US back in 2000 - and GOG is marking the occasion by bringing it to PC for the first time since 2003.
</p>
<p>
GOG's Preservation Program is intended to provide "the best [versions of classic games] you can buy on any PC platform", and each features a range of enhancements intended to "guarantee convenience and compatibility with modern systems". In Breath of Fire 4's case, GOG is promising Windows 10 and 11 compatibility, "improved graphics powered by an upgraded DirectX renderer", as well as new display options including anti-aliasing, V-sync, windowed mode, and "refined" gamma correction.

<p>
Missing environmental sounds are also said to have been restored and new configuration options have been added as part of an audio engine upgrade, and players can choose between either English or Japanese localisations. And if that sounds like something you might be interested in, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/breath_of_fire_iv">Breath of Fire 4 is available to purchase on GOG right now</a> for Â£8.99.
</p>
<p>
And it doesn't stop there. GOG has released a further nine titles as part of its Preservation Program, including Gremlin Interactive's stupendously weird 1996 haunted house mystery adventure <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/realms_of_the_haunting">Realms of the Haunting</a> - a sort of first-person shooter/point-and-click/FMV adventure hybrid, which pretty much consumed me back in the day. It's now gained the likes of cloud support, custom key mapping, and the ability to play either the US or UK version.
</p>
<p>
Breath of Fire 4 and Realms of the Haunting arrive alongside upgrades for <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/ultima_underworld_1_2">Ultima Underworld 1+2</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/ultima_9_ascension">Ultima 9: Ascension</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/worlds_of_ultima_the_savage_empire">Worlds of Ultima : The Savage Empire</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/ultima_worlds_of_adventure_2_martian_dreams">Ultima Worlds of Adventure 2: Martian Dreams</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/worms_armageddon">Worms: Armageddon</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/robin_hood">Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stonekeep">Stonekeep</a>, and cult classic point-and-click FMV adventure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Tex%20Murphy:%20Under%20a%20Killing%20Moon">Tex Murphy: Under a Killing Moon</a>.
</p>
<p>
GOG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-announces-preservation-program-aims-to-maintain-game-compatibility-with-modern-and-future-systems">announced its Preservation Program last November</a>, when 100 games were part of the line-up. That list has continued to expand since then with a regular influx of new additions - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fear-platinum-joins-gog-preservation-program-to-properly-recognise-monoliths-contributions-to-gaming">Monolith Production's much-loved horror shooter FEAR</a>, which was added to "honour [the studio's] legacy" in February, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">Monolith's shock closure</a>.

            <p>
Facebook owner Meta has reportedly cut over 100 jobs at Reality Labs, the division responsible for its virtual reality and augmented reality software and hardware, including Quest.
</p>
<p>
The news was initially <a href="https://www.theverge.com/meta/655835/meta-layoffs-reality-labs-vr-supernatural">reported by The Verge</a>, whose sources said the cuts had impacted teams within Meta's Oculus Studios - which is focused on developing games for the company's Quest headsets - as well as "some" employees from Reality Labs' hardware arm. Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-24/meta-lays-off-more-than-100-staff-across-reality-labs-unit?embedded-checkout=true">later reported "more than 100" workers were impacted</a>.
</p>
<p>
In a statement provided to The Verge, Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton confirmed cuts had been made within Oculus Studios, saying "some" teams were "undergoing shifts in structure and roles that have impacted team size." Clayton added the changes were intended to "help Studios work more efficiently on future mixed reality experiences for our growing audience, while still delivering great content for people today." The Verge says Meta declined to comment on layoffs outside of Oculus Studios.
</p>
<p>
Impacted staff include the team behind Meta Quest fitness application Supernatural, which Meta acquired for $400m USD - alongside its developer Within - in 2023, following an anti-trust battle with the FTC. The Supernatural team <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/getsupernatural/permalink/9571469649572696/">confirmed it had been affected by Meta's latest layoffs</a> in a statement shared on Facebook, writing it was "deeply saddened" by the loss of "some of our incredibly talented team members".
</p>
<p>
Despite the layoffs, Meta says it remains "committed to investing in mixed reality experiences, including fitness and games, and our drive to deliver the best experiences possible for the Quest and Supernatural communities remains unchanged."
</p>
<p>
Meta has dramatically reduced staff numbers of the last few years, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/facebook-owner-meta-announces-further-10000-job-losses">cutting more than 20,000 jobs in 2022 and 2023</a>. Lone Echo developer Ready at Dawn - which Meta acquired in 2020 - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lone-echo-developer-ready-at-dawn-reportedly-heavily-impacted-by-latest-meta-layoffs">heavily impacted</a> by those cuts and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lone-echo-and-the-order-1886-developer-ready-at-dawn-reportedly-shut-down-by-meta">closed down at the end of last year</a>.
</p>
<p>
Today's Reality Labs layoffs follow Meta's admission last April that the AR/VR <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/facebook-owner-meta-loses-a-billion-per-month-on-its-arvr-division-but-believes-it-will-be-worth-it">division had lost over $1bn every month</a> for most of the last two years, with the company saying it expected losses to increase as it deepened its investment.
