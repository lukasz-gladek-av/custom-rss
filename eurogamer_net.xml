            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> might be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-finally-adds-the-series-iconic-burglar-and-it-only-took-11-years">tootling along merrily</a>, but it's now over ten years old and fans are getting increasingly impatient for clarity on what's next for the franchise - particularly given EA's somewhat confounding communications on the matter. Amid all this, extensive footage of EA's new The Sims "game concept" have now surfaced online, fuelling all sorts of disappointment as fans ponder a reality where the future of The Sims is, in fact, just a tacky looking mobile game.
</p>
<p>
To recap, EA first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-gives-super-early-look-at-next-generation-sims-game-project-rene">began discussing its "next generation" Sims game</a>, codenamed Project Rene, back in 2022. This, many assumed, would be <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-5">The Sims 5</a> - until, that is, EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-5-not-happening-as-ea-moves-beyond-linear-sequential-sims-releases">announced Project Rene wasn't The Sims 5</a>, that The Sims 5 wasn't happening, and that whatever Project Rene was would instead co-exist alongside The Sims 4. It also teased a bunch of "cosy games, social and collaborative based gameplay, [and] mobile narrative games" coming under The Sims banner, before revealing Project Rene (whatever it was) would begin playtesting soon.
</p>
<p>
In the six months since then, playtest footage has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1frtd5c/new_project_rene_formerly_the_sims_5_screenshots/">sporadiaclly leaked online</a>, leaving fans largely unimpressed. And it seems unlikely the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8IPPtMzVBE">sudden influx of new gameplay footage</a> (as flagged by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-sims/another-disappointing-looking-project-rene-leak-makes-me-wish-ea-would-finally-step-in-and-say-anything-at-all-to-sims-fans/">PC Gamer</a>) will change that, given the bland visuals, endless reward-incentivised to-do lists, and front-and-centre currency focus feels more like a free-to-play mobile wallet squeezer than a truly "next-generation" The Sims game.

<p>
EA describes the playtest - officially titled <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.gp.lifegame&amp;hl=en">City Life Game With Friends over on Google Play</a> - as "small parts of a larger game concept". And the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8IPPtMzVBE">newly</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXD7u0miBKA">shared</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pMyt1ioAs">footage</a> focuses on the same multiplayer-enabled plaza location we've <a href="https://streamable.com/guwvh2">seen in numerous leaks before</a>, only now festooned with even more garish free-to-play style window dressing as players stroll around, strike up conversations, and hand out a few muffins. It's not especially inspiring stuff - and given EA's refusal to clarify the nature of the project, it's unclear how horrified fans should actually be.
</p>
<p>
All this, of course, comes as developer Krafton's highly anticipated The Sims competitor <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">InZoi</a> launches into Steam early access. And while I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-25-years-of-the-sims-could-inzoi-be-about-to-steal-its-crown">wasn't particulary impressed with InZoi</a> during my time with it last month, it's unlikely anyone's going to be dazzled by anything resembling EA's City Life Game with Friends when Krafton's game is around.

            <p>
Members of the ZeniMax Workers United union - which is made up of more than 300 quality assurance workers across ZeniMax Studios - has "overwhelmingly" voted to authorise union leadership to call for a strike if no resolution is reached following two years of unsuccessful contract negotiations with Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
ZeniMax Workers United, which is part of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), became the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-recognises-300-person-zenimax-testers-union">first union ever to be voluntarily recognised by Microsoft in 2023</a>. At the time, members - who've worked on the likes of Fallout, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>, and Doom - said they'd push to end sudden periods of crunch, unfair pay, and a lack of growth opportunities within the company.
</p>
<p>
But two years on, ZeniMax Workers United says it's still to successfully negotiate a first contract. According to the union, its bargaining committee has so far failed to reach an agreement with Microsoft over "better wages, workplace improvements, and key concerns, including a lack of remote work options and the company's replacement of in-house quality assurance work with outsourced labour without notifying the union."
</p>
<p>
Last December <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hundreds-of-zenimax-workers-strike-over-microsoft-outsourcing-remote-work-policies">saw union members in Maryland and Texas stage a one-day walkout</a> amid concerns around Microsoft's outsourcing and its return-to-office policies, and the CWA additionally filed an unfair labour practice charge against Microsoft for unilaterally outsourcing work. However, that action could potentially escalate now more than 94 percent of ZeniMax Workers United members have voted to authorise union leadership to call for a strike if contract negotiations fail to reach a resolution.
</p>
<p>
"Paying your employees a liveable wage as a multi-trillion dollar company is the least they could be doing," union member and associate QA tester Aubrey Litchfield said in an <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-vote-authorize-strike-microsoft">statement companying today's news</a>. "However when addressed at the bargaining table, Microsoft acts as though we're asking for too much. Our in-house contractors have been working on minimal wages with no benefits, including no paid sick time. Workers are choosing not to start families because of the uncertainty of finances. We've released multiple titles while working fully remote. When will enough be enough?".
</p>
<p>
"Underpayment and costly [return-to-office] initiatives have caused many of us to put our lives on pause," union member and senior QA tester Zachary Armstrong added, "because our income does not match even the rising cost of living in the cities where ZeniMax insists we live and work to maintain employment... If Microsoft and ZeniMax continue to demonstrate at the bargaining table that they're unwilling to pay us fair wages for the value our labour provides to our games, we'll be showing them just how valuable our labour is."
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640423/zenimax-union-cwa-strike-authorization-vote">statement provided to The Verge</a> in response to today's union announcement, Microsoft spokesperson Delaney Simmons insisted the company was "deeply committed to reaching a fair and equitable resolution that acknowledges the teams' contributions." Simmons  also claimed "substantial progress" had been made over the course of the negotiations, and that "tentative agreements [had been reached] on a majority of the topics at the table".
</p>
<p>
"We have presented a package proposal that we believe is fair," Simmons continued. "If accepted it would result in immediate compensation increases, even more robust benefits and is in alignment to the company's hybrid model of three days in office. We look forward to continuing this progress during negotiations."
</p>
<p>
ZeniMax Workers United is just one of an increasing number of video game unions successfully established in the last few years, with workers at the likes of Activision, Blizzard, and Sega also now represented by unions. Additionally, last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/communications-workers-of-america-announces-industry-wide-united-videogame-workers-union">saw the CWA announce the industry-wide United Videogame Workers</a> - a direct-join union open to all freelance or full-time video game industry workers in the US or Canada.
