            <p>Did you know there's a 3v3 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> fighting game? Well there is! It's called Ultimate Sonic Smackdown, and you can play it right now.</p>
<p>Indie studio Arcforged has released the game to the public for free. In an announcement trailer released today, you can see a variety of Sonic characters duke it out in 2D. All you've got to do is join the game's official Discord server and get playing!</p>
<p>You may have guessed it from the title, but Ultimate Sonic Smackdown is actually a drastic overhaul of an older fan game: Sonic Smackdown. That game was a traditional 1v1 fighter, and has been playable online via <a href="http://itch.io/">Itch.io</a> or at US tournaments for a while now.</p>

<p>This iteration, four years in the making, is a wilder evolution of the game. A tagging system means more hectic fights, more options for offence, and the opportunity to team up your favourite Sonic characters in your chosen squad. It's the latest in a sparse scattering of Sonic the Hedgehog fighting games, first established by the official, Sega-developed Sonic the Fighters released in arcades in 1996. Its Sega Saturn port was cancelled.</p>
<p>As a tag fighter, Ultimate Sonic Smackdown joins a bizarrely packed collection of similar games coming out soon. You've got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hunterxhunter-nenximpact">HunterxHunter NenxImpact</a> coming in July, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/project-l">2XKO</a> which is bound to come out sooner or later, c'mon guys. Then you've got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/invincible-vs">Invincible Vs</a> coming next year, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a>! So suddenly, a style of fighting game that had basically no modern representation is stacked with incoming options.
</p>
<p>Sonic has a rich history of fan games. Famously, Sega hired Christian Whitehead to be lead developer on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-mania">Sonic Mania</a>, following his work on unofficial ports of older Sonic games. There's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-unleashed-available-for-pc-at-last-thanks-to-fan-made-port-with-uncapped-framerate">also a fan-made PC port of Sonic Unleashed</a> which is rad, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-triple-trouble-gets-fan-made-16-bit-makeover">a 16-bit makeover of Sonic Triple Trouble</a> from a few years back.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-fantastic-fan-made-sonic-fighting-game-in-the-wild-and-you-can-play-it-right-now]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sony has announced four new games on the way to its PSVR2 headset, three of which are coming this year.</p>
<p>One of those is Dreams of Another, the next game from Q-Games - the studio behind the PixelJunk games. Dreams of Another is from multimedia artist Baiyon, the director of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pixeljunk-eden">PixelJunk Eden</a>.</p>
<p>The game sees players control "The Man in Pajamas", but has the philosophy of "No Creation Without Destruction". As such, shooting in this game creates the world around you from circular particles.</p>

<p>I was able to play the game (though not in VR) at the Game Developer Conference earlier this year, and found its use of "point cloud rendering" to be particularly mesmerising. I can only imagine how it'll look in VR, in both third and first person. Dreams of Another is due for release later this year.</p>
<p>Before that, though, there's Grit and Valor - 1949. A tactics rogue-lite, players take the role of a commander in an alternate timeline World War 2 to win battles by moving pieces chess-style on a tactical grid. It's due out on 21st August.</p>

<p>Also coming later this year is Hotel Infinity, a follow-up to Manifold Garden from Studio Chyr. This surreal puzzle game has players exploring an abstract hotel to solve riddles. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/manifold-garden-review-rewiring-strange-architecture-in-the-void">Manifold Garden received a rare Essential from Eurogamer</a>, so expect good things from this one.</p>

<p>Last up is <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/24/introducing-meteora-a-cosmic-survival-racer-for-ps-vr2/">Meteora</a>, a "cosmic survival racer" coming to PSVR2 next year. Players will navigate "explosive asteroid belts, electrically charged debris, and icy barriers" as a meteor racing across space. Energy Crystal can increase your mass and Stardust boosts your velocity, but should you focus on survivability or speed?</p>
<p>You can read more about all four games on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/24/reveals-and-updates-on-upcoming-ps-vr2-titles/">PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>
<p>Sony has been criticised for not supporting its PSVR2 headset. In its latest State of Play showcase, only one VR game was included - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-more-than-a-decade-classic-stealth-series-thief-is-being-revived-for-psvr2">Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow</a> - though this will also be released on other VR platforms.</p>
<p>The Meta-owned Beat Games also recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/support-for-beat-saber-on-ps4-and-ps4-ends-shining-a-light-on-psvr2s-lack-of-success">ended support for Beat Saber on PS4 and PS5</a>, what many consider to be VR's killer app.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Microsoft announced it has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-dips-its-toes-into-vr-with-limited-edition-xbox-themed-meta-quest-headset">collaborated with Meta on a limited edition Xbox-themed Quest 3S headset</a>, as the company dips its toes into the world of VR.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-remembers-psvr2-exists-announces-four-new-games-coming-soon]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Futuristic racer Fast Fusion will receive an update later this week, adding new tracks and a new rendering mode without upscaling.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-fast-fusion-most-technically-impressive-switch-2-launch-title">Digital Foundry reported</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> launch game actually renders at a low image resolution but uses the console's DLSS equivalent to upscale the image. Put simply, the game has been criticised for poor image quality, despite being such a fast game.</p>
<p>Now, developer Shin'en Games is introducing a new render mode called "Pure" that removes upscaling and instead renders at a native 1440p when docked (and 1080p in handheld).</p>

<p>What's more, a new Carbium Cup will be added, including three new tracks: Alpine Trust, Sunahara Plains, Zenshoh Habitat.</p>
<p>Players of previous game Fast RMX may recognise these tracks, though they have all-new graphics and changed layouts to make use of Fast Fusion's Hyperjump feature.</p>
<p>Further additions include: a new particle effect for snow, two new jukebox entries, a lower price to unlock the third cup for easier progression, fixed an issue where the game shut down when changing render mode, while stability and performance improvements have been implemented.</p>
<p>The update will arrive on 26th June.</p>

<p>Fast Fusion is one of the few brand-new launch games for Nintendo's new console. It's the follow up to Switch game Fast RMX, itself an improved version of Fast Racing Neo on Wii U.</p>
<p>Anyone who's a fan of the F-Zero or WipEout series will find much to enjoy here, with the game's high speed thrills, rollercoaster tracks, and techno soundtrack. Indeed, it's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/f-zero-gx-on-switch-2-is-virtually-unplayable-without-remapping-the-controls">modern day rival to F-Zero GX</a> - one of three GameCube games available on Switch 2 through Nintendo Switch Online.</p>
