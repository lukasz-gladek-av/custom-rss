It's a kung fu kind of week on the Epic Games Store, thanks its latest headline freebie: developer Sloclap's acclaimed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, which arrives alongside several other free titles for mobile and PC.
</p>
<p>
In total, Epic is giving away three free games across PC, Android, and iOS this week, and they'll be sticking around for the next seven days. The full list looks like this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Sifu (PC)</li>
<li>Deliver At All Costs (PC)</li>
<li>Gigapocalypse (PC/mobile)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Sifu's the biggie, of course, even if it's not the first time it's been <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/sifu">free on the Epic Games Store</a>. For those unfamiliar, it takes players on a cinematic rampage of revenge through the streets of China. It's a game of pulverising, cathartic martial arts action, with the twist being its protagonist gets steadily older each time they're resurrected by their magical pendant upon death, despite the world around them staying the same.
</p>
<p>
"An elegant martial arts meditation on temporality and self-possession", is what Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirwell <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-review">said in his Sifu review back in 2022</a>, and given all the improvements it's seen since then, it's well worth the (free) entry fee.
</p>
<p>
Epic's other two PC freebies this week come in the form of the newly released <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/deliver-at-all-costs-a30c8d">Deliver At All Costs</a> - a game of bizarre delivery challenges across highly destructible environments, set somewhere in the 1950s - and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/gigapocalypse-fdc53b">Gigapocalypse</a>. This latter title sees players customising their own giant monsters, KaijÅ« style, and then setting out on a mission of mass destruction developer Goody Gaweworks describes as "loud, punk, metal, anarchy and a lovely homage to the game and movie classics."
</p>
<p>
Gigapocalypse is also currently free for iOS and Android via Epic's mobile store, but you'll need to be in the EU to access it on Apple devices.
</p>
<p>
All the above are available to download and keep via the Epic Games Store right now and will remain so until next Thursday, 29th May. After that, a fresh batch of (still mysterious) freebies will take their place.

It's been a busy day in the grimdark world of Warhammer 40K, thanks to its latest video game focused <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4A1s4DH78w">Warhammer Skulls showcase</a>. Not only have we learned a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-and-space-marine-1-spruce-ups-are-coming-this-year">couple of classics getting a spruce-up</a>, there's brand-new stuff coming too, including a Boltgun sequel, new tactical RPG Dark Heresy, plus a smattering of fresh DLC.
</p>
<p>
Warhammer 40K: Boltgun 2, which seems as good a place as any to start, is exactly what it sounds like - a follow-up to developer Auroch Digital's acclaimed 2023 retro shooter Boltgun. Details are relatively limited at present, but it'll pick up immediately after the events of the first game, and offer another helping of old-school-inspired FPS action over the course of its branching single-player campaign. There's talk of new locations - "from the colossal heights of a hive city to the impenetrable mangrove swamps of a jungle" - plus new weapons and never-before-seen foes, including the ferocious Bloodletters and their daemonic Juggernauts.

<p>
All that's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3115160/Warhammer_40000_Boltgun_2/">PC</a> sometime in 2026. However! There's an extra - and more immediate - treat for Boltgun fans in the form of Boltgun: Words of Vengeance. This "first person typer" twist on the retro shooter - in which players must deploy their QWERTY skills for maximum carnage - is entirely free and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3533730/Warhammer_40000_Boltgun__Words_of_Vengeance/">available to download on Steam</a> today.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in the gloomy world of Warhammer 40K, developer Owlcat has announced Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy, a "narrative-driven tactical RPG" set against the backdrop of the Noctis Aeterna and the mystery of the Tyrant Star. "Players will lead a warband of diverse companions in a desperate battle against heresy and corruption," the studio explains, "from loyal Imperial subjects, such as a veteran Guardsman from the death world of Catachan, to nefarious xenos, including a bird-like Kroot mercenary."

There's talk of full voice acting, "intricate investigations", turn-based combat, and "choices that carry grave consequences", all said to build on the ideas introduced in Owlcat's Rogue Trader. And if that sounds intriguing, Dark Heresy is coming to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710600/Warhammer_40000_Dark_Heresy/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warhammer_40000_dark_heresy">GOG</a>, and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/warhammer-40k-dark-heresy-4cf5b0">Epic</a>) at some currently undisclosed future point.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of Rogue Trader, Owlcat has <em>also</em> announced a 24th June release date for the game's second expansion, Lex Imperialis. This introduces a faction of "incorruptible enforcers" known as the Adeptus Arbites, plus a new companion - Solomorne Anthar - across its 15-hour storyline. Additionally, the studio has revealed it's working on a Season Pass 2 for Rogue Trader, bundling together an appearance customisation pack and two more 15-hour expansions - each featuring new quests and a new companion. The first of these expansions takes players to a Necron vault curated by Trazyn the Infinite, where they'll encounter ancient guardians and uncover relics relating to the Von Valancius legacy. The second new expansion promises a "descent into madness and mystery" as they explore a "surreal" voidship graveyard.

<p>
And while we're on the subject of DLC, there's one last bit of business to discuss in the form of Space Marine 2's new Siege mode. This "endless" PvE mode for the acclaimed shooter unfolds on Kadaku, where three players must survive against ever-more-deadly waves of Tyranid and Chaos as they attempt to defend an Imperial fortress. It'll be playable on Steam via developer Saber Interactive's Public Test Server starting 4th June, and it gets its full release across all platforms as part of a free update on 26th June.

<p>
All of which pretty much covers the big Warhammer 40K news, but it's probably also worth mentioning there are currently significant discounts across a huge number of Warhammer games on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC as part of today's Warhammer Day celebrations.
