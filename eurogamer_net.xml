            <p>
Valve appears to have quietly updated its Steam Early Access policy to no longer accept games with mature themes.
</p>
<p>
The decision comes in the wake of pressure from payment processors against adult content on digital storefronts like Steam and itch.io.
</p>
<p>
Dammitbird, developer of the adult game Heavy Hearts, applied for Steam Early Access but failed review "because we're unable to support the Early Access model of development for a game with mature themes", according to a notice from Valve they <a href="https://x.com/GalewindG/status/1961949585254826238">shared on social media</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Due to current events, I panicked and contacted my publisher to help me get on Steam Early Access," Dammitbird told <a href="https://www.gamesmarket.global/business/pressure-continues-steam-denies-early-access-release-for-adult-games-ed57cc6bd4b4e60ee9663c5f90a1b797">GamesMarkt</a>. "The general rule is that your game should be about 65 percent done before doing EA. Well, we are about 70 percent done so the time was right anyway. But now, all of a sudden and without a policy announcement, the rules have changed and now I can't join Steam EA"."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-introduces-vague-new-rules-banning-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-to-appease-credit-card-companies">Valve updated its vague guidelines back in July</a> around what sort of content was allowed on Steam. 
</p>
<p>
"We were recently notified that certain games on Steam may violate the rules and standards set forth by our payment processors and their related card networks and banks," a Valve spokesperson told Eurogamer. "As a result, we are retiring those games from being sold on the Steam Store, because loss of payment methods would prevent customers from being able to purchase other titles and game content on Steam."
</p>
<p>
Now, it seems, this has been extended to include Early Access games. However, it remains unclear exactly what constitutes adult content. 
</p>
<p>
Heavy Hearts, for instance, includes pornographic content, so it's assumed this isn't accepted in Steam Early Access.

<p>
But where does Valve draw the line? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, for instance, includes sexual content and is listed on Steam as a mature game that's age restricted. Would Larian's game - celebrated for its gradual development through Steam Early Access - be allowed under these new rules?
</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Valve for clarification on what games are eligible for Steam Early Access.</p>
<p>
Pressure from payment processors isn't just impacting pornogrpahic content on steam and itch. Eurogamer recently spoke to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/queer-developers-speak-out-as-adult-games-remain-in-limbo-following-payment-processor-showdown-at-steam-and-itchio">queer developers who've been caught up in the recent rule changes after itch.io's blanket de-indexing of adult content</a>.

            <p>
Japanese publishers are "more understanding toward creators," said Hideki Kamiya, which partly explains why there have been fewer layoffs in the Japanese games industry.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/clovers-interview-kamiya-and-koyama-talk-okami-2-industry-layoffs-and-a-potential-future-with-capcom/">VGC</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> and Devil May Cry creator discussed the current state of the industry and the difference between eastern and western studios.
</p>
<p>
"What it feels like when working with Japanese publishers is that the development culture feels closer to mind, and they tend to be more understanding toward creators," said Kamiya, who's worked with multiple publishers on both sides of the globe.

<p>
"I think of game development as a kind of invention," he continued, using the likes of Bayonetta's Witch Time and Okami's Celestial Brush as examples. "My goal is always to build in a unique mechanic that only that game can have. On the Japanese side, my impression is that they see you're trying to make a new invention. They understand the struggle of trying to give birth to something new, and they watch over the process with patience."
</p>
<p>
By comparison, western publishers prefer the "sense of safety following an established format".
</p>
<p>
"That's where I see there's a difference with publishers," said Kamiya. "For foreign companies, if you're trying to invent something new, because the shape of it isn't clear yet, there tends to be pressure, like 'show us something that's taken shape more'. And if you look at the games themselves, like how first-person shooters were the popular thing for a while, I get the impression that they feel a sense of safety following an established format."
</p><p>
Kamiya used <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/scalebound">Scalebound</a> as an example - the Xbox One exclusive was a joint project between PlatinumGames and Microsoft but was ultimately cancelled. Here, the team was building a system to control both a human protagonist and a dragon simultaneously. "But there was no clear reference or format for us to follow for a game like that," said Kamiya. "And I think that's why it was easy for some to have doubts."
</p>
<p>
And while Kamiya doesn't believe Scalebound would've been published had it had a Japanese publisher, he did admit "it would've been different."
</p>
<p>
"Japanese companies tend to be more open to new challenges, and I think the conversations would have been more positive, like, 'Okay, so how should we approach this together?'," said Kamiya. "For me personally, overseas publishers seem to have a much stronger desire to see a finished product as quickly as possible. If it had been a Japanese publisher, I feel they might have given us more leeway."
</p>
<p>Speaking on his desire to protect his new studio from layoffs, Kamiya said: "We really have a deep commitment to keep the company going for [our staff], who we're grateful to. Of course, I understand there are circumstances that force large companies to make layoffs, but for us, that's a route that we don't want to go down. We want to take care of our staff."</p>
<p>
Kamiya has recently founded a new studio, Clovers, which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-announcement-had-hideki-kamiya-crying-with-the-fans">developing a sequel to Okami with Capcom</a>. Back in March he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-still-wants-to-resurrect-the-cancelled-scalebound">joked about resurrecting Scalebound</a>.
