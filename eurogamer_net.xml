            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> developer Bungie has acknowledged it is "investigating a potential issue within [its] code for how RNG perks are generated" despite previously assuring players there was "no perk weighting active for any legendary weapon perks in Destiny 2".</p>
<p>For the last week or so, Destiny 2 fans have been debating if the "god roll" for its latest grenade launcher, VS Chill Inhibitor - "Envious Arsenal" and "Bait and Switch" - was being throttled. Despite both perks falling on other weapons with relative frequency, the chance of getting VS Chill Inhibitor with both perks was vanishingly slim, making some think Bungie was intentionally tipping the RNG scale to ensure this roll dropped very, <em>very</em> infrequently.</p>
<p>Cue "Weightgate".</p>

<p>At first, Bungie was clear: "Hey all, we had a conversation with our Sandbox folks this morning about this. There is no perk weighting active for any legendary weapon perks in Destiny 2," the Destiny support team <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1848473860905308232">insisted</a> on X/Twitter.</p>
<p>"We have added perk attunement for Exotic Class Items in a recent update, but that's a different system."</p>
<p>The issue, however, becomes impossible to ignore when you look at the stats on sites like <a href="https://www.light.gg/db/items/1762785662/vs-chill-inhibitor/?p=,,,,,0,0">light.gg</a>, a database that scrapes weapon perks from player inventories (cheers, <a href="http://v/">PC Gamer</a>).</p> <div>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, a few days later Bungie posted to X/Twitter "regarding further reports of perk weighting", saying that whilst it has "confirmed that there is no intentional perk weighting on weapons within our content setup", it acknowledged that something was up, and was "now investigating a potential issue within our code for how RNG perks are generated".</p>
<p>"Many thanks to all players who have been contributing to data collection across the community. This data has been monumentally helpful with our investigation, and we are currently working on internal simulations to confirm your findings," the team said.</p> <div>

<p>At the time of writing, Bungie is still investigating, but says it will provide more information "as soon as it is available".</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Bungie unveiled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-and-neteast-unveil-free-to-play-mobile-shooter-destiny-rising-with-closed-alpha-coming-soon">Destiny: Rising, a free-to-play mobile version of its sci-fi shooter series</a> developed in collaboration with Chinese publisher NetEase, that's set to receive a "limited access closed alpha test" on iOS and Android this November.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dayz">DayZ</a> may have just turned a decade old, but it's seemingly more popular than ever, setting a new highest daily active user count of over 500,000 players.</p>
<p>DayZ's second expansion, Frostline, has tempted - and tempted back - hundreds of thousands of players, with 501,222 logging on on 20th October: 235,618 on Steam, 113,897 on PlayStation, and 152,037 on Xbox.</p>

<p>That's not all, either; the second expansion has also set a new concurrent record on Steam, clocking up a new record of 78,937 simultaneous players. At the same time, 33,000 users were on PlayStation, and 36,000 on Xbox.</p>
<p>DayZ Frostline sees you "brave the elements and embrace the chilling new challenges", bringing a new "depth of survival gameplay as the bitter cold sweeps across the land". Either alone or with a team, you can expect "countless opportunities for thrilling encounters and unexpected alliances".</p>
