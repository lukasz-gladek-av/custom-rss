            <p>Roblox shares have dropped by 20 percent after the platform's reported daily active users fell short of analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>For the fourth quarter (ending 31st December), the number of daily active users fell by four percent to 85.3 million compared to the previous quarter, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-06/roblox-shares-plummet-after-miss-on-daily-active-users-bookings?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> has reported. Wall Street analysts had forecasted 88.4 million. Overall player engagement also declined by 9.7 percent in the same period to 18.7bn hours.</p>
<p>Bookings, the company's measure of sales, totalled $1.36bn (£1.09bn), also falling shy of its forecast of $1.37bn(£1.1bn).</p>

<p>In an earnings call, Roblox CFO Mike Guthrie noted growth in Eastern Europe was "quite a bit slower" than anticipated, owing to a ban of the platform in Türkiye over child safety concerns.</p>
<p>That ban took place in August last year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-responds-to-platform-ban-in-turkiye">Roblox responding at the time</a>: "We respect the laws and regulations in countries where we operate and share local lawmakers' commitment to children. We look forward to working together to ensure Roblox is back online in Türkiye as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Now, Guthrie has stated this last quarter was "the first full quarter where Türkiye has been off".</p>
<p>On a more positive note, in this quarter Roblox shared a record $281m with its game developers. CEO David Baszucki said in the earnings call this reflected the company's commitment to paying creators.</p>
<p>Back in 2021, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-exploiting-young-game-developers-new-investigation-reports">report by People Make Games</a> accused Roblox of exploiting children as young developers. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-studio-boss-children-making-money-on-the-platform-isnt-exploitation-its-a-gift">Roblox Studio head Stefano Corazza further discussed this with Eurogamer</a> last year, with the company later clarifying it does not hire minors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> will get an official prequel story, fittingly told by a tie-in manga series. 
</p>
<p>
But rather than simply adapting the story of Ubisoft's upcoming feudal Japan stabathon, the series will instead be set some time prior.
</p>
<p>
The manga's first slice will be available in Japan alongside Shadows itself, when it arrives on 20th March. Elsewhere in the world, however, we'll have to wait a little longer.
</p>
<p>
"Follow the story of a young Assassin apprentice, as she fights against the growing presence of the Templars order in Japan," reads Ubisoft's description of the manga series. "Available in Japan at the launch of the game and later elsewhere."
</p>
<p>
Cover art for the first issue shows a young female Assassin wielding a sword as well as the iconic Hidden Blade. Is this Naoe, the shinobi co-protagonist of Shadows itself? I'm not sure. 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AssassinsCreedShadows?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AssassinsCreedShadows</a> will get its own manga!</p><p>Discover the official prequel of the game.

</p></div>
<p>
For starters, the moment that Naoe obtains the Hidden Blade for the first time is actually shown early on in Assassin's Creed Shadows itself - meaning she likely isn't the menacing looking Assassin shown here. Beyond that,  its opening sequences - which Eurogamer has now played - seem to indicate Naoe isn't yet versed in who either of the Assassins or the Templars are.
</p>
<p>
So, this looks to be an entirely different protagonist entirely - unless Ubisoft has some other kind of time-wimey shenanigans going on.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-spoilers-splurged-on-adult-cartoon-website">spoilers for the upcoming Assassin's Creed Shadows popped up online</a> after the game's unreleased artbook was leaked via an adult cartoon website.
</p>
<p>
"Shadows looks to be very much on track to become that feudal Japanese fantasy we've long been hankering for," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">Eurogamer's Assassin's Creed Shadows hands-on preview</a>. "If Ubisoft can stick the landing on this one, it will be worth the extended wait."

            <p>
Excellent indie adventure Dungeons of Hinterberg will belatedly launch on PlayStation next month.
</p>
<p>
A PS5 version will become available on 13th March, after previously arriving for PC and Xbox Series X/S last summer.
</p>
<p>
This new version will also include a "new, secret bonus episode", publisher Curve Games said today - though details of what exactly this will be remain under-wraps. Presumably, the PC and Xbox versions will get this addition via a free update too.

<p>
If you're yet to try Dungeons of Hinterberg, it's an enjoyable Zelda-inspired adventure that splits its time between exploration and combat in various Alpine biomes, breezy dungeons filled with monsters and puzzle-solving, and then a social side set within a nearby town full of residents to befriend and side-quests to take on.
</p>
<p>
"Combat and RPG progression get an ingenious social twist in this disarming slice of fantasy," our Chris Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-of-hinterberg-review">Eurogamer's Dungeons of Hinterberg review</a>, reserving particular praise for the game's overall narrative.
</p>
<p>
"The protagonist's story hinges on burnout, but also the question of how one should spend their time and what they should value," Donlan wrote. "The story that unravels in the village, meanwhile, slowly starts to blur the distinctions the game has been careful to build up, touching on everything from the cost of tourism to the question of authenticity. It's gripping stuff."
</p>
<p>
"If you play games for escapism, there are few this year that did it better," Chris Tapsell added, recommending Dungeons of Hinterberg in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-50-best-games-of-2024-ranked">Eurogamer's best games of 2024</a>. "It's a dreamy, warm-hearted, timely and deeply welcome retreat."
