            <p>
It's been a long time coming - seven years, in fact - but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s animated adaption of Devil Cry is almost upon us. The streaming service has announced the series premieres on 3rd April, and there's a trailer of sorts to accompany the news.
</p>
<p>
We first heard a Devil May Cry animated adaptation was in the works back in 2018, with Adi Shankar - executive producer on Netflix's acclaimed Castlevania adaptation and 2023's Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix - tasked with teasing it into existence.
</p>
<p>
For a while it seemed like the project might have been quietly shelved, but 2023 proved otherwise, bringing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-first-look-at-netflixs-long-in-the-works-devil-may-cry-animated-series">first look at the show</a>, alongside confirmation its animation was being handled by Studio Mir - the team behind The Legend of Korra.

<p>
A year later, Netflix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-anime-launches-2025-and-everything-else-from-netflix-geek-week">released its first proper trailer</a> for the series, providing a glimpse of a Dante displaying little enthusiasm for buttoning up his shirts. That reveal also pointed to an April 2025 release, which has now been narrowed right down to April 3rd.
</p><p>
Netflix's release date news is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4V6H0LFEGs">accompanied by a trailer</a> showcasing the Devil May Cry series' intro sequence, complete with strikingly stylised violence and a Limp Bizkit soundtrack. It's a lot different to the actual show, of course, which adopts a more traditional anime-style aesthetic.
</p>
<p>

We still don't have any story details for this animated version of Devil May Cry yet - beyond 'white-haired young man in red jacket loves to show off his abs - but presumably Netflix'll have more to say about the series ahead of its arrival.

            <p>
Capcom's clearly in a sharing mood. It's announced it's airing not one but two showcases next week - one being <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> themed and the other focusing on a number of other upcoming games, including Onimusha Way of the Sword.
</p>
<p>
And if that sounds like your kind of night, things get underway at 10pm GMT/2pm PT next Tuesday, 4th February. First up is Capcom's Spotlight showcase. This lasts around 20 minutes and covers three titles on the publisher's slate: Onimusha Way of the Sword, Capcom Fighting Collection 2, and Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection Arcade Classics.
</p>
<p>
Onimusha Way of the Sword was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-onimusha-game-in-development-from-capcom">announced in December</a> and isn't expect to arrive until next year (some 20 years after the series' previous entry, Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams, released), so it's perhaps a little surprising it has more to say so soon. As for Capcom Fighting Collection 2, it hasn't yet been given a release date beyond 2025, so we can probably expect one - and we'll likely also get a release date for Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics on Xbox, after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-now-coming-to-xbox-following-technical-discussions-with-microsoft">bit of a faff around</a> last year.

<p>
And once Capcom's Spotlight is done, it'll immediately be time for a 20-minute update on Monster Hunter Wilds, which'll be just weeks away from its 28th February launch by then. We can probably expect a couple of monster reveals, a new biome, and me squealing giddily if they announce they're bringing back sea-squirting Cthulhu cuttlefish elder dragon Namielle.
</p><p>
So that's that; next Tuesday, 4th February at 10pm GMT/2pm PT for all your latest Capcom news. The publisher hasn't actually said <em>where</em> you'll be able to watch its showcase yet, but YouTube seems like a fair bet. And we'll have all the news from the event right here too, if you'd rather catch up at a less indecent time over a nice cup of beans.
