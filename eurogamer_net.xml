            <p>A fan-made <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> anime has been delayed into next year, but a new teaser trailer shows how production is developing.</p>
<p>The anime adaptation was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fan-made-elden-ring-anime-adaptation-receives-teaser-trailer">revealed in July this year</a>, with the full five-minute short film aiming for an autumn release.</p>
<p>That's now been pushed back to summer 2025, to give creator Steins Alter more time to polish the animation.</p>

<p>The new teaser trailer, above, reveals both the new Japanese, French, and Brazilian dubs, and some work-in-progress comparison shots.</p>
<p>Steins Alter stated in the video the release delay was "sort of a hard decision for me to stomach".</p>
<p>"However, us animators are all very busy, and rushing on isn't within any of my interests," the creator continued. "I want to spend all these extra months polishing the animations and style, getting the most out of the animations by these talented animators."</p>
<p>It's certainly looking impressive and I look forward to seeing more of Malenia next year.</p>
<p>Despite the anime arriving three years after Elden Ring's release, it's still somewhat timely. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, the game's DLC expansion, was released earlier this year and has received a nomination for Best Game at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-lead-this-years-the-game-award-nominations">this year's The Game Awards</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Reuters reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware">Sony is in talks to buy FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa</a>, meaning it would own the rights to Elden Ring and Dark Souls alongside Bloodborne and Demon's Souls.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Remedy's upcoming Control sequel - aptly titled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/control-2">Control 2</a> - will be an action-RPG.</p>
<p>The developer first announced a sequel to its surreal action-adventure back in 2022, simply stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedy-officially-announces-sequel-to-control">Control 2 would be an "unexpected journey"</a>. In the time since, the developer has kept most details close to its chest, although in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/max-payne-1-2-remake-enters-full-production-control-2-features-in-playable-form">August of this year it stated "important" Control 2 features are now in "playable form"</a>.</p>

<p>We now have another small morsel of information on the sequel, however, thanks to confirmation from Remedy that the upcoming release will be an action-RPG. The developer shared this little nugget of information during its <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/">Capital Markets day presentation</a>, before following it up with a rather casual bullet point tucked within a social media post.</p>
<p>This same post also said Control Ultimate Edition will release on Mac on 12th February, and Control will receive a free update early next year, which will unlock "some previously released content".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> has now sold over 1.8m units. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-has-now-recouped-most-of-the-money-it-cost-to-make">Earlier this month</a>, Remedy said the sequel was close to recouping the money the studio had spent on developing and marketing the game, 12 months after its initial release.</p>

<p>As for Control 2, while we still admittedly do not know much about the sequel, fans do believe <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-2-tease-lies-in-alan-wake-2s-lake-house-dlc-fans-say">Remedy has hidden a little teaser for the forthcoming game in its Alan Wake 2 DLC</a>, The Lake House.</p>
<p>But, while we wait a little longer to see where this tease ultimately leads, Remedy also has its Control spin-off - FBC: Firebreak - in the pipeline. The three-player co-op multiplayer will launch for PC and consoles in 2025, and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-control-developer-remedy-reveals-first-ever-multiplayer-game">coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one</a>. You can check out a trailer for FBC: Firebreak in the video above. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
