            <p>
It's been six years since developer Ghost Town Games gave the world a sequel to its smash-hit culinary caper <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overcooked">Overcooked</a>, so you might very well be wondering what it's been up in the time since. Well, all is now revealed, with Ghost Town having unveiled its brand-new co-op adventure Stage Fright - which is being published by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> studio Hello Games.
</p>
<p>
Hello Games' announcement describes Stage Fright as a mix of "Overcooked style chaotic moments [and] escape room style cooperation" that's designed for two players. It's playable either as a classic couch co-op adventure or by teaming up online.
</p>
<p>
There's not much to share in the way of specific gameplay details, but we do known Stage Fright takes place in a "magical and spooky" setting - "think <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/luigis-mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> meets Overcooked" - and that it promises a "really charming story" that's "touching, with a real heart".

<p>
"The codename of Stage Fright was Project Attic," Hello Games continues, "because [Ghost Town members] Phil, Oli, and Gemma have been in the attic at the top of their house working on this new game for the last five years, joined by a small team of talented contributors... They have so many stories of the joy Overcooked has brought to families and partners and friends (as well as near divorces). They really want to create more of those moments."
</p><p>
Hello Games says it'll be lending Ghost Town its behind the scenes experience and support as development continues. "But if we're honest," it adds, "it really appeals to us to have fun working with a bunch of creative people we just love spending time with."

            <p>
Capcom has revealed a new Onimusha game is in development.
</p>
<p>
Shown at tonight's The Game Awards, Onimusha: Way of the Sword is set to launch in 2026 - so there's quite a wait.
</p>
<p>
A short clip of gameplay was shown, which appears to eschew the Resident Evil-esque fixed perspectives of the first game for full 3D combat.

<p>
As for the story, it's unclear who the protagonist will be, though he does bear a resemblance to the first game's Samanosuke.
</p>
<p>
Still, there's a good glimpse at some bloody slicing and dicing, as he battles samurai zombies and collects those precious golden orbs. I just hope it can stand apart from the likes of Sekiro, Phantom Blade Zero, and the Nioh games.
</p>
<p>
The first Onimusha game was released on the PS2 in 2001, which was remastered in 2018 for Switch, PS4, and Xbox One (with a PC release a year later). 
</p>
<p>
That was the last release in the series, while the last new console game was Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams in 2006. It's been a long wait for fans, then.
</p>
<p>
Still, will Capcom appease fans with a return to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dino-crisis">Dino Crisis</a> next?
