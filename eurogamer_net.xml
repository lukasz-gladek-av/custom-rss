            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>' hugely anticipated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is still on track to launch this "fall" publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> has reiterated, despite persistent rumblings of a delay.
</p>
<p>
Take-Two recommitted to its release window as part of its <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/4d81f3f6-cf24-44fa-892b-8ace44767349">Q3 FY 2025 earnings report</a>, writing, "This calendar year is shaping up to be one of the strongest ever for [the company], as we plan to launch <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> 7 on 11th February 11, Mafia: The Old Country in the Summer, Grand Theft Auto VI in the Fall, and Borderlands 4."
</p>
<p>
Take-Two <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">announced an autumn 2025 release target</a> for GTA 6 last May, narrowing down what had previously only been a 2025 window at the time of the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-first-trailer-released-early">first trailer reveal</a>. However, rumours of a possible delay have continued to dog the game since then.

<p>
A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-release-may-slip-to-2026-as-development-has-reportedly-fallen-behind">report last March</a> suggested Rockstar had originally been targeting a "spring" 2025 release but that development had "fallen behind". An autumn launch was said to be more likely - just as 2K later announced - but it was claimed a 2026 release could happen as "fallback plan".
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-recommits-to-autumn-2025-launch-following-delay-rumour">later called the rumours unfounded</a>, and Take-Two has continued to stand by its autumn launch window, even if it still hasn't quite got as far as revealing the release date the entire games industry is waiting for.</p>
<p>
Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has acknowledged the mounting anticipation around GTA6 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">in an interview with IGN</a>. "I think the game is eagerly anticipated both internally and externally," he said. "We know that Rockstar seeks perfection. I never claim success before it occurs. I'm fond of saying arrogance is the enemy of continued success, so we're all running scared and looking over our shoulders and we know that the competition is not asleep. Our whole organisation is super excited."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
With February upon us, it's time to vigorously rub hands together as subscription services up and down the land lob a fresh batch of titles at their members, expanding those already bulging backlogs to increasingly calamtous extremes. And now it's Amazon's turn, with the company having announced 20 more titles it's bringing to Prime Gaming before February is through.
</p>
<p>
This month's offerings - as is customary for Prime Gaming - arrive over the course of several scheduled content drops. And following the inclusion of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-2">BioShock 2</a> Remastered in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reveals-16-titles-heading-to-prime-gaming-in-january">last month's Prime Gaming bucket</a>, February's line-up continues the theme with the inclusion of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a>. That's available right now, alongside the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-talos-principle">The Talos Principle</a>: Gold Edition, which bundles together Croteam's excellent philosophically minded puzzler and all its DLC.
</p>
<p>
Then, as we get further into February, Prime Gaming subscribers can look forward to a whole bunch more title,s including sci-fi salvage sim Hardspace: Shipbreaker, RPG deckbuilder Dark Sky, isometric stealth adventure El Hijo – A Wild West Tale, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex-human-revolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a>. Additionally, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wolfenstein-youngblood">Wolfenstein: Youngblood</a> pops up before the end of the most, which is mostly notable for the fact its Microsoft Store code means it's playable on both Xbox and PC. The full list of incoming titles (plus the stores they can be grabbed from) are below.
