            <p>Quantic Dream, the studio behind narrative games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/heavy-rain">Heavy Rain</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a>, has revealed its first-ever multiplayer game.</p>
<p>Earlier today, studio founder David Cage shared a blog post on forthcoming projects, mentioning it was working on a new multiplayer game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-eclipse-is-still-in-development-quantic-dreams-assures-alongside-new-competitive-multiplayer-game">alongside continued development of Star Wars: Eclipse</a>.</p>
<p>Now the studio has revealed Spellcasters Chronicles, a free-to-play team-based multiplayer game of 3v3 third-person arena battles. Check out gameplay in the teaser trailer below.</p>

<p>Players will take on the role of the titular Spellcasters, mages of distinct archetypes split between support, tank, or damage dealer. Further, a strategic deck-build system will allow players to select from over 50 spells and summons, plus there are summonable Titans too.</p><p>"We are honoured and excited to introduce Spellcasters Chronicles to players today, developed in our Paris and Montreal studios," said Cage. "Stepping into a new genre with a fresh artistic approach has been both a challenge and a source of growth, allowing us to evolve as a team. We now look forward to shaping the game further with players' feedback and to perfecting this journey together."</p>
<p>"Spellcasters Chronicles began as a creative experiment, an opportunity to channel our passion for storytelling into a shared, living world," explained game director Gregorie Diaconu. "While very different from our previous titles, it builds on what has always driven us: giving players the power to shape stories - this time in a collective manner."</p>
<p>A closed beta for the game will take place on PC (Steam) by the end of 2025, with <a href="https://www.spellcasterschronicles.com/en-US/beta">sign-ups now open</a>.</p>
<p>Before then, the game will be shown at TwitchCon this weekend, which will also be streamed on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lan">Twitch LAN channel</a>.</p>
<p>Spellcasters Chronicles will be the first game from Quantic Dream since Detroit: Become Human in 2018. The studio is  also working on the long-in-development Star Wars: Eclipse, though Quantic Dream CEO Guillaume de Fondaumière <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-eclipse-developer-quantic-dream-gives-update-amidst-netease-cuts-and-closures">confirmed earlier this year it wasn't impacted by cuts at NetEase</a>.</p>

            <p>
Nintendo has addressed recent server breach claims made by hacking group Crimson Collective, insisting no "development or business information" has been leaked from its servers, and that it's so far found no evidence any personal information has been compromised.
</p>
<p>
Crimson Collective <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hackers-claim-to-have-breached-internal-nintendo-data">claimed to have "breached" Nintendo's servers and stolen internal data</a> in a message widely shared on social media earlier this month. The claim was accompanied by an image purportedly showing a digital depository of Nintendo manuals, admin and development assets, and more.
</p>
<p>
Now, in a statement provided to <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20251015-6H66THKNKJKJLCI2BKXWZYB72Y/">Japanese publication The Sankei Shimbun</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-responds-to-reports-its-servers-were-breached-while-keeping-silent-on-pokmon-teraleak">IGN</a>), Nintendo has downplayed the incident. "We have not confirmed any leak of personal information, and there has been no leak of development or business information," the company said.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo did not, however, address <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-devastating-pokemon-leak-reveals-plans-for-future-games-but-its-the-reported-development-budgets-that-have-left-players-stunned">this week's major leak of new Game Freak data</a>, including artwork and other details related to the studio's future Pokémon games. This latest leak stems from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-developer-game-freak-reels-from-unprecedented-gigaleak-of-significant-internal-data">last year's "teraleak" hack</a>, which was confirmed to include personal details of Game Freak employees.
</p>
<p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-lawyers-want-to-force-discord-to-reveal-pokemon-teraleak-source">filed a request to subpoena Discord</a> for the hacker's identity in April, but it's unclear if its investigation has progressed any further since then.

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-sure-seems-to-confirm-one-key-legends-arceus-character-is-indeed-immortal</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-sure-seems-to-confirm-one-key-legends-arceus-character-is-indeed-immortal.1326703/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Right, before we get started here, I am making a big point to announce this article is going to be incredibly spoiler-heavy for both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-walkthrough-tips-tricks">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. We've got late-game spoilers for Arceus, and I'll be chatting about something you discover in one of the (sadly quite limited) locations in ZA's Lumiose city. You've been warned.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Pokémon Legends Arcues and Pokémon Legends: Z-A spoilers follow.</h2>
<p>Right, some context. Back in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-x-and-y">Pokémon X and Y</a>, when you finally got to Lumiose City, you could explore various sectors of the large settlement. Over on the North Boulevard, one key tourist trap was the Lumiose Museum which was home to a nice little collection of objects that seemed to point cheekily to  other regions of the Pokémon world - whether that was Sinnoh’s Battle Frontier or Unova’s Castelia City, this little Parisian-esque cultural collection was a nice, knowing nod to wider Pokémon lore.</p>
<p>But, in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, it seems the museum has expanded a bit, and now explores not just the horizontality of the Pokémon world, but the verticality of it, as well, as there are new collections in the museum's halls that explore the world's peculiar timeline. As you gain access to this museum, one of the collections stands out: it's a little exhibition of 'formal attire', that Arceus players will recognise as Volo's outfit from the previous game in the spin-off series.</p>
<p>Volo, who bore a striking resemblance to Cynthia and even used many Pokémon she'd later use in her team, was a key figure in the last game. The loner cropped up quite a lot, always seeming to be one step ahead of you in your journey, and was fixated on the rich mythology of the Hisui region (with a particular interest in the Plates held by the special and Legendary Pokémon around the region).</p><p>As it turns out, though, Volo was never really there to help out. He was actually pretty vexed at you, and the schism in space-time that teleported you to the region in the first place. Why? Because, well, he wanted to create the universe anew, shaped with his own ideals and values. A bit heavy for a kid's game, if you ask me.</p>
<p>Volo was a peculiar character: he had a relationship with Cogita, a member of the 'ancient Sinnoh people', and claimed to be one himself. But, in-game, this was never really verified. He'd say things like he was willing to even take centuries to locate and conquer Arceus, but you'd be forgiven for chalking that up to dramatic villain talk. Turns out, he genuinely could.</p>
<p>In Legends: Z-A, interacting with Volo's outfit proffers the following text:</p>
<blockquote><p>Formal Attire. This outfit is said to have been worn by the ancient Sinnoh people during their rituals. This group worshipped the Pokémon Arceus as an almighty deity. It is thought that they showed their respect by mimicking Arceus' appearance - even reflected in the way that they styled their hair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not much on its own, sure. But then the curator adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was told that the person who wore this outfit donated it to the collection personally. Apparently, he gazed a while at those sketches by Professor Laventon with this nostalgic air, too…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What can we infer from this? Well, the collection is new - added between X and Y and Legends: Z-A, which occurs later in the timeline (Lumiose City is redeveloped compared to its first appearance). That means Volo has, in the interceding years, appeared in the city - alive and well - and donated his old ritual clothing. What's more, he doesn't appear to have dethroned God just yet. Maybe the actions of our heroes in Hisui/Sinnoh knocked that wind out of him for good. Or maybe not…</p><p>It's a small little nod that wraps up one dangling thread from the last Legends game, and I'm actually quite pleased to see it manifest in-game. There's not a lot of exploration and depth to the city in Legends: Z-A, so at least Game Freak has added some little nuggets for the lore-heads, if nothing else.</p>
<p>Volo and Cogita aren't the only immortals in the game; X and Y - and, hence, Z-A - also have the enigmatic AZ, the former king of the Kalos region, the creator of the ultimate weapon, and the current owner of Hotel Z. Quite the CV, eh? He's also got a portrait in the museum. Whether his longevity is linked to that of Volo/Cogita remains to be seen, and I wonder if it's something Game Freak is set to explore in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc">the upcoming Pokemon Legends Z-A Mega Dimension DLC</a>...</p>
