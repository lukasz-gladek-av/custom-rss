            <p>
In anticipation of Doom: The Dark Ages imminent arrival, Microsoft has unveiled a selection of limited edition Xbox accessories, including a wireless controller sporting the sleek, blood-spattered hues of the Doom Slayer.
</p>
<p>
Starting with the controller, its body, buttons, and directional pad are all chest plate green, while its right thumbstick has been coloured red to match the Doom Slayer's augmented nipple - or "chest port" as Microsoft insists on calling it. That's alongside "silver-plated sheathing" for the grippy bits, and "3D silver helmet spikes" surrounding the Xbox guide button.
</p>
<p>
It's a pretty nifty looking thing, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/d/xbox-wireless-controller-doom-the-dark-ages-limited-edition/8mzbmmcjzqc0#footnotes-uidfbe7">costs £74.99/$79.99 USD</a> - which includes the Doom Slayer Executioner Skin DLC for Doom: The Dark Ages. It's available to purchase exclusively from the Microsoft Store until 18th April, after which it'll be making its way to other retailers.

<p>
Fans of the Xbox Elite Series 2 have their own option, with Microsoft also announcing a Doom: The Dark Ages variant of its premium controller. This one's a little more subdued, featuring a black body, maroon buttons and sticks, plus a final nosebleed flourish. Sure the giant red Mark of the Slayer in the middle looks a bit naff, but you can't have everything. This one <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/d/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-doom-the-dark-ages-limited-edition/8mzbmmcjzqkt">costs £179.99/$199.99</a> and is available from 25th April - although you can pre-order it now.
</p>
<p>
And finally, the Mark of the Slayer returns for a limited edition Xbox Series X wrap designed to resemble a sort of crumbling, blood-spattered stone obelisk. It also includes some eye-catching innards, scrawled with "unspeakable inscriptions and symbols from the deepest levels of Hell". It's compatibile with disc and all-digital Series X consoles and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/d/xbox-series-x-wrap-doom-the-dark-ages/8mzbmmcjzqbx">costs £49.99/54.99 USD</a>. Both the Doom: The Dark Ages wrap and Elite Series 2 controller are exclusive to the Microsoft Store. And if any of these takes your fancy, you'll <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/04/16/doom-the-dark-ages-accessories-controller-console-wrap/">find more details here</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for Doom: The Dark Ages itself, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-gets-release-date-confirmed-will-make-you-feel-like-an-iron-tank-rather-than-the-fighter-jet-acrobatics-of-doom-eternal">launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 15th May</a>. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hands-on-with-doom-the-dark-ages-reveals-another-reinvention-but-one-that-feels-less-cleanly-defined">looking promising too</a>, with Eurogamer's Robert Purchase calling it a "bold reimagining [and] a brave departure" earlier this year.
