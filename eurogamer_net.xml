            <p>
Stop Destroying Videogames - the European campaign inspired by the Stop Killing Games movement - has shared a progress update as EU countries continue verifying petition signatures, saying it's preparing for the next stage, which will include "countering misinformation and industry lobbying".
</p>
<p>
Stop Destroying Videogames is looking to convince the EU to pass regulations preventing "the remote disabling of video games by the publishers, before providing reasonable means to continue functioning of said video games without the involvement from the side of the publisher." To that end, it turned to the European Citizens' Initiative - an official EU mechanism designed to provide a way for citizens to propose a legal act to the European Commission - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">successfully surpassed 1.4m signatures</a> before the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/eci">petition</a> closed in July.
</p>
<p>
With several months having passed since then, Stop Destroying Videogames organisers have now <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/comments/1nfvxk1/campaign_update/">shared a progress update on the Stop Killing Games subreddit</a>. At present, the post explained, all signatures are being checked by national authorities. As previously noted, if 1m signatures are successfully verified (the post adds "early reports from several countries show around 97 percent of signatures being valid"), the petition can then be presented to the EU for either a public hearing or full debate session at the European Parliament. "That moment will mark the start of the legislative phase," the post continues, "where the Commission and Parliament must decide how to respond."

<p>
While verification continues - a process that should take around three months - Stop Destroy Videogames is preparing for the next stage of its campaign. The goal, organisers explain, is to ensure "our initiative cannot be ignored", and so it's working toward, "Legislative outreach to Members of Parliament and the Commission; countering misinformation and industry lobbying; strengthening our community structures to support this next stage." Some work will, by necessity, remain behind the scenes. "Past attempts to undermine the initiative," organisers write, "have shown us the risks of being too open."
</p><p>
Stop Destroying Videogames also noted some "long-time contributors" - including Ross Scott, the figurehead of the main Stop Killing Games initiative - have "stepped back" after years of effort. In a follow-up comment, Ross clarified, "It's more like I'm 'on call' for anything where me being involved would help a lot. Most of what's happening now is best left to people familiar with EU political processes like Mortiz [Katzner], so I'm leaving most things to people who know what they're doing better than I do to maximise our odds."
</p>
<p>
"This campaign exists only because of you," the post concludes, "and with your continued support we can make sure our voices are heard in Brussels."

            <p>
The physical release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> will be on a game key card and will take up around a third of the console's storage capacity.
</p>
<p>
Some Switch 2 physical games are sold as game key cards, which use the card solely as a key to download the full game. Many third-party publishers are opting for this method of release on Nintendo's new console.
</p>
<p>
Images of the game box on <a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade---switch-2">Square Enix's store</a> prove Final Fantasy 7 Remake will be another game key card release, while its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/limited-early-purchase-editionfinal-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-switch-2/?srsltid=AfmBOooMV8kwa75CskPgxZMlJ4rAwW63sBdWbil-myyKr466ROJJPwwY">eShop listing</a> states it requires a download of up to 90GB. As the Switch 2's storage capacity is 256GB, that means the game will take up approximately 34 percent (though of course you'll need to account for console system files).

<p>
The reported maximum size for a proper game card is 64GB, which is the card size CD Projekt Red opted for with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> release on Switch 2. But at 90GB, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s game wouldn't fit.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, the huge size of games is exactly the reason Nintendo offers game key cards as an option, but this has been heavily criticised by game preservationists. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-dont-like-nintendos-controversial-game-key-cards-you-can-now-let-the-company-know-directly">Nintendo even released a survey</a> to gather reactions.
</p>
<p>
So what's the alternative solution here? Should Square Enix be to blame for its decision and/or inability to reduce the game size? Or is Nintendo to blame for not offering larger game cards?
</p>
<p>
Larger game cards would be more expensive for publishers, while a higher console capacity would be more expensive for Nintendo who seems more than happy to let consumers choose to expand storage space through expensive MicroSD Express cards - this now looking pretty essential if you plan on playing triple-A third-party games on the Switch 2.
</p><p>
One developer at Ubisoft did explain why it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-dev-comes-out-with-first-actually-good-reason-for-using-switch-2s-controversial-game-key-cards">opted for a game key card with Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2</a>, stating traditional cards "simply didn't give the performance we needed at the quality target we were going for". The game was built around the SSDs of release platforms and as such it "relies heavily on disk streaming for its open world environments".
</p>
<p>Perhaps Square Enix has a similar reason.</p>
<p>
Still, Square Enix has confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-gets-switch-2-release-date">entire Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy is headed to Switch 2</a>. And considering second game Rebirth is 145GB on PS5, there's no way you'll be able to play all three games on your Switch 2 in future without opting to expand the memory.

            <p>
Balatro was set to receive a 1.1 update this year, but its solo developer LocalThunk has pushed it back in order to preserve his "hobbyist" approach to game development.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://localthunk.com/blog/im-slow">statement titled "I'm slow"</a>, the developer apologised for the delay, adding he "probably shouldn't have announced any date". "I feel bad for not keeping that promise, and I am sorry," he said.
</p>
<p>
Since release, LocalThunk has been crunching alone on a balance patch and a mobile port, before taking some time out and then beginning 1.1 work slowly this year. "However, I chose to only work on the game like I did when the project began, as a hobbyist," he said, "and it turns out that it's a lot slower than working in crunch mode 12 hours per day like I was around launch."

<p>
LocalThunk said the prospect of rushing the work "felt terrible". "I am working slowly, but I like it that way," he said.
</p>
<p>
"I have never, before Balatro, set a deadline for any of my creative projects and I now realise how important that is for my process," he continued. "I am in a very lucky position in that I can choose to work this job however I wish, and I think the best version of 'work' for me is the version that makes me want to come back to my keyboard every day, healthy, and hopefully just as excited about game development 5 years from now as I am today. I don't want 1.1 to be the last update this game gets."
</p>
<p>
As such, the 1.1 update will be "done when it's done", and will be available for free across all platforms. It just won't be this year.
</p>
<p>
He concluded: "The Balatro player in me will absolutely not allow me walk away from developing this game...Rest assured, it will happen."
</p>
<p>
After a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-wins-formal-appeal-to-reclassify-poker-game-as-pegi-12">shaky start with ratings boards</a>, Balatro has gone on to find phenomenal success. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/100-completing-balatro-has-developer-better-equipped-to-design-the-next-big-update">LocalThunk has 100 percent completed his own game</a>, which has "equipped" him to better design the next update.
