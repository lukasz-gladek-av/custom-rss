Well, here's a surprise. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> will be part of Sony's PlayStation Plus Essential Games for March.
</p>
<p>
BioWare's big role-playing game only launched four months ago, so it's a surprise to see it included within the subscription service so soon.
</p>
<p>
Reception to the game has been mixed, with a solid launch last October and a decent critical response not translating into sales. Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-ea-sports-fc-25-and-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-as-it-lowers-financial-forecast">publisher EA said the EA Sports FC 25 and Dragon Age: The Veilguard had "underperformed"</a>. This month, its boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-suggests-dragon-age-the-veilguard-might-have-sold-better-if-it-was-live-service-so-what-does-this-mean-for-mass-effect-5">Andrew Wilson suggested the game might have performed better if it was live-service</a>.
</p>
<p>
PlayStation Plus Essential games for March 2025 include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Dragon Age: The Veilguard (PS5)</li>
<li>Sonic Colors: Ultimate (PS4)</li>
<li>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection (PS4/PS5)</li>
</ul>

<p>All the above join the PlayStation Plus game catalogue next Tuesday, 4th March, and you'll find more details on what else is on offer in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">full PlayStation Plus guide</a>.</p>

Dragon Age: The Veilguard is the fourth major entry in its long-running fantasy series, and its first in a decade. It picks up storylines from across the franchise so far and ties many of them up - but it's also a good point for new players to drop in. "A fantasy role-playing game of astonishing spectacle," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>. 
</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-colours-ultimate">Sonic Colors: Ultimate</a> is the 2001 remaster of Sega's Wii platformer that, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-sonic-colours-ultimate-tech-review">according to Digital Foundry</a>, "is still a lot of fun and it plays even better now".</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</a>, launched in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection-sees-return-of-13-retro-classics">features 13 classic Turtles games from the series' Konami era</a>, released between 1989 and 1994.</p>
<p>So, anything take your fancy?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> players are reporting that some in-game children now have pregnant bellies, following the game's latest patch.
</p>
<p>
Several <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/1iyd8rp/umm_guys_my_kid_is_pregnant/">posts on The Sims' reddit</a> from over the past 24 hours report the issue and provide visual evidence, showing young Sims strutting about with a baby on board.
</p>
<p>
"Umm guys..." one player wrote. "My kid is pregnant..." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/1iy87lc/since_todays_patch_all_the_male_children_in_my/">Wrote another</a>: "Since today's patch all the male children in my game have pregnant bellies." 
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="740"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/1iyd8rp/umm_guys_my_kid_is_pregnant/">Umm guys… My kid is pregnant…</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FutureApricot8074/">u/FutureApricot8074</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/">thesims</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

It's unclear what new bug has caused the issue, or how widespread the appearance of pregnancy has spread.
</p>
<p>
The bright side here is that these young Sims are only appearing pregnant, rather than actually having their in-game status set to give birth. As far as players can work out, the issue is simply a visual one - though still, bizarre.
</p>
<p>
"I think the overall bug is that they're mixing up adult and child body presets somehow," one player suggested. "One in my save is very muscular suddenly and I saw another one with the classic beer belly and narrow shoulder combo. Really hope they fix it soon."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted The Sims publisher EA for more detail on what's gone wrong.
</p>
<p>This week's patch for The Sims 4 - the one that seems to have caused this issue - was meant to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-finally-adds-the-series-iconic-burglar-and-it-only-took-11-years">finally add the series' iconic burglar, after 11 years</a>. </p>
<p>Amidst some uncertainty surrounding The Sims' future, the franchise is currently celebrating its 25th anniversary with a range of events, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-1-and-2-patch-fixes-numerous-issues-following-farcical-re-release">somewhat wobbly remasters of The Sims and The Sims 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
