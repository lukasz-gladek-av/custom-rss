            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is launching a new Daft Punk Experience, but is adamant the robot rock duo aren't getting back together.</p>
<p>Unlike previous Fortnite concerts - from the likes of Marshmello, Travis Scott, and Ariana Grande - The Daft Punk Experience is instead a "fully interactive playground" in the Discover(y) mode, with multiple rooms in which to enjoy the music and lose yourself to dance.</p>
<p>That includes blasting robots with a soundwave laser in the Robot Rock Arena, remixing songs at Dream Chamber Studios, or making a Lego music video at Around the World. Some form of "afterparty" is also being teased, whatever da funk that might be.</p>
<p>"The band may be no longer, but their music lives on in Fortnite," reads a new blog post on the experience.</p>
<p>And to really hammer it home, the FAQ directly states: "The band is not getting back together". So no, you don't feel it coming - it's the end of the line.</p>
<p>It also states the experience won't feature any new music, as all songs have been previously released. Players will be able to make their own mashups though, but good luck making them harder, better, faster, or stronger.</p>
<p>The experience launches on 27th September at 2pm ET (that's 7pm UK time), but players are advised to join early. It will then be available "for a while" in Discover.</p>
<p>Of course, a Fortnite collaboration wouldn't be complete without a load of stuff to buy, either individually or as part of the Dark Punk Bundle. It includes song emotes, glittery outfits, and some adorable Lego characters so you too can be a Starboy, as well as other Jam Tracks including the duo's collaborations with The Weeknd.</p>

<p>Speaking of Lego, the first ever music-reactive build will be added to Fortnite - it's a lego pyramid that lights up when music is played.</p>
<p>Full details can be found on the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/party-harder-better-faster-stronger-in-fortnite-with-the-daft-punk-experience">Fortnite blog</a>, so you can read up on the experience one more time.</p>
<p>Last week, Epic announced it would be giving Fortnite creators some more digital love by allowing them to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-creators-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items-to-make-more-money-but-are-creative-mode-offerings-like-steal-a-brainrot-what-players-want">sell in-game items on their created islands</a>.</p>
