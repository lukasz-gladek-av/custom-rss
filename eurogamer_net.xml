            <p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has discussed the growing importance of the PC market, though stopped short of outright confirming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> will be heading to PC.</p>
<p>GTA 6 is currently slated for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, but there's been no mention of a PC release so far. That's surprising in 2025, when big releases are often released simultaneously across all three platforms, or at least follow up soon with PC.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025?utm_source=threads,twitter">IGN</a>, Zelnick teased a PC release of GTA 6 will be on the way, but the company tends not to "go across all platforms simultaneously".</p>

<p>"So with Civ 7 it's available on console and PC and Switch right away," Zelnick said, making comparison with Firaxis' recently launched Civilization 7. "With regard to others in our lineup, we don't always go across all platforms simultaneously. Historically, Rockstar has started with some platforms and then historically moved to other platforms."</p>
<p>Interestingly, Zelnick admitted that the PC version of a multiplatform game can generate 40 percent of overall sales. As a result, the PC platform is growing in importance.</p>
<p>"We have seen PC become a much more important part of what used to be a console business, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that trend continue," he said.</p>
<p>Still, the focus for GTA 6 for now are the console releases, which Zelnick expects to boost console sales in response.</p>
<p>"When you have a big title in the market and we have many of them coming, historically that has sold consoles," Zelnick said.</p>
<p>"And I think that will happen this year. I don't think tariffs are going to be our friend, but I think there will be a meaningful uptick in console sales in calendar '25 because of the release schedule, not just coming from us, but coming from others. So I'm not concerned about that [console sales falling]. I think the trend that you'd want to focus on is this increasing share of the market that is reflected in PC."</p>
<p>So why no PC release for GTA 6 at present? As Zelnick noted, Rockstar has traditionally started with console releases in the past: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>, for instance, released in September 2013 while the PC version (initially aiming for simultaneous release) was delayed until April 2015.</p>
<p>Rockstar also has a torrid history with modders, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/who-spilled-hot-coffee">infamous Hot Coffee mod</a>.</p>
<p>Just last month, the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-shuts-down-ambitious-mod-that-put-gta-4s-liberty-city-in-grand-theft-auto-5">shut down an ambitious mod that put a playable version of GTA 4's Liberty City inside GTA 5</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has launched an investigation into Roblox.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/sec-confirms-game-service-roblox-part-of-active-investigation">Bloomberg</a>, while the investigation is ongoing, the exact focus of the SEC's probing remains unclear. The commission did however acknowledge the investigation was active, and said it could not currently share full details to ensure there was "no harm to the ongoing enforcement proceeding".</p>
<p>The SEC was established after the 1929 Wall Street crash in a bid to protect American citizens from market manipulation. It requires public companies to submit quarterly and annual reports, as well as investigate possible violations of the securities laws.</p>

<p>"We have confirmed with Division of Enforcement staff that there are responsive emails between Enforcement staff referencing Roblox and that these emails are a part of an active and ongoing investigation," an SEC spokesperson told Bloomberg, via a Freedom of Information request: </p>
<p>Bloomberg suggests - though it is not confirmed - that the investigation may pertain to November's report that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/damning-roblox-report-claims-company-inflates-player-numbers-to-investors-by-as-much-as-42">Roblox misled investors by falsely reporting player numbers, and has highlighted yet more examples of inappropriate - and allegedly, illegal - content being shared via the platform</a>.</p>
<p>In response to November's report, Roblox said at the time that it "rejects" its findings and pointed to previously-released details of its efforts to try and combat inappropriate content. It also stressed that it had previously acknowledged that "fraud and unauthorised access to [its] platform may contribute, from time to time, to an overstatement of DAUs".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-shares-drop-by-20-as-platform-misses-target-active-users">Roblox shares dropped by 20 percent last week</a> after the platform's reported daily active users fell short of analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>For the fourth quarter (ending 31st December), the number of daily active users fell by four percent to 85.3 million compared to the previous quarter. Wall Street analysts had forecasted 88.4 million. Overall player engagement also declined by 9.7 percent in the same period to 18.7bn hours.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Roblox for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
