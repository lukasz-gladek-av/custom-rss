            <p>Cast your minds back to a few months ago, and you might recall the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">Minecraft memes of Chicken Jokey and Lava Chicken</a>. Yes, we were all a-flutter for the cuboid world's poultry thanks to the release of A Minecraft Movie.</p>
<p>The Jack Black and Jason Momoa-fronted film became a resounding success on its debut in April, generating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">$301m USD worldwide on its first weekend</a>.</p>
<p>And, as he did with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jack-blacks-super-mario-bros-movie-song-rising-up-us-charts">Peaches for The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a> last year, Black once again lent his vocal stylings for a catchy ditty in A Minecraft Movie known as Lava Chicken. It's a song about what happens when you add lava to a chicken in Minecraft (it cooks). Soon after the film's release, Lava Chicken entered the UK's official music chart, becoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-now-shows-warning-following-disruptive-chicken-jockey-trend">the shortest ever entry in the official UK Top 40</a>.</p>

<p>But, what has all this got to do with Minecraft now, Victoria? Well, basically, there 's no escape, and developer Mojang recently announced an update for Minecraft (the game), which adds Lava Chicken as a music disc. As spotted by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/minecraft/minecraft-1-21-94-update-finally-adds-lava-chicken-song-3226469/">Dexerto</a>, thanks to Minecraft's <a href="https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/37810171798029-Minecraft-1-21-93-94-Bedrock">1.21.94 update</a>, players can get access to a remixed version of the song Black sings in the film. This version is by Hyper Potions. And, how do you get it? Of course by defeating a baby zombie riding a chicken... Yes, that's a ruddy chicken jockey.</p>
<p>A Minecraft Movie's Chicken Jockey trend (which saw some viewers of A Minecraft Movie going feral and launching their popcorn into the air during a scene where Black's character Steve shouts "chicken jockey" as Jason Momoa confronts a baby zombie riding a chicken) was disruptive to say the least.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-now-shows-warning-following-disruptive-chicken-jockey-trend">Cinemas and Black himself asked viewers to refrain from such behaviour</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-is-leaning-into-the-memes-with-sing-along-screenings">introducing sing-along 'Block Party Edition' screenings in a bid to calm things down a notch</a>. Not that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-director-defends-popcorn-throwing-chicken-jockey-chaos-says-viewers-just-having-a-true-party">A Minecraft Movie director Jared Hess was too fussed</a> by the chaos caused. In fact, the filmmaker said he found the chaotic scenes "way too funny" and had been "laughing [his] brains out" with each new video sent his way.</p>

<p>"Just the fact that people are making memories at the movies - that's what it's all about," Hess continued. "That's why we do it. I never could have anticipated this level of passion and fun and craziness that's happening."</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">sequel to A Minecraft Movie is already in discussion</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/good-news-minecraft-is-getting-the-lava-chicken-song-bad-news-minecraft-is-getting-the-lava-chicken-song]]></content:encoded>
