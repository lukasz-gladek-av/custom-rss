Devil May Cry director Hideki Kamiya has revealed he'd "love" to remake the first game in Capcom's classic hack-and-slash series, acknowledging the aging original "really does feel like a 24-year-old game design" after all this time.
</p>
<p>
Back in December, Kamiya confirmed he'd entered into a new partnership with Capcom - the publisher he left in 2006 after helming such classics as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a>, Okami, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/viewtiful-joe">Viewtiful Joe</a> - and was responding to a fan question inspired by the news during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOBoqQCcRTQ">latest episode of his YouTube show</a> (as translated by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideki-kamiya-says-hed-love-to-remake-devil-may-cry-now-hes-working-with-capcom-again/">VGC)</a>. When asked how he might approach a remake of the first Devil May Cry, he replied, "I'd love to do that."
</p>
<p>"I usually don't replay my own games after release," he continued, "and Devil May Cry is no exception. But once in a while, I catch gameplay clips and think, 'Yeah, this really does feel like a 24-year-old game design.'" As to how he might tackle a remake, Kamiya said, "With today's technology and game design approach... I'd want to remake it from the ground up. If that ever happens... well, I don't think seriously unless it's really happening, so right now, I don't have anything in mind. But if the time comes, I'll come up with something. That's what I do! So Capcom, leave it to me! Also, let me handle Viewtiful Joe too!"

Since its debut outing in 2001, Devil May Cry - which follows the demon-hunting adventures of white-haired protagonist Dante - has seen five major instalments (plus the polarising <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dmc-devil-may-cry-review">2013 reboot DmC: Devil May Cry</a>), but Kamiya only directed the first. After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-on-leaving-platinumgames-i-couldnt-allow-myself-to-kill-my-soul">departing PlatinumGames in 2023</a>, he formed new studio Clovers, which is currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-in-the-works-with-capcom-and-hideki-kamiyas-new-studio-clovers">working with Capcom to create a sequel to his beloved action-adventure Okami</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for Devil May Cry, the series has remained dormant since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-5-review-an-unashamedly-old-school-retooling-of-an-action-classic">2019's well-received fifth instalment</a>, but it recently returned to the spotlight thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-season-1-review">Netflix's anime adaptation</a>, which Eurogamer contributor Graeme Virtue called a "spirited take on the mythos" last month.
