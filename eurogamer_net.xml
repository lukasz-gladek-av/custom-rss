            <p>In a new interview, Gears of War E-Day creative director Matt Searcy has peeled back the curtain a little on the upcoming prequel to everyone's favourite gory third-person shooter. Namely, that by returning to Emergence Day the original series' vibes will return.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/gears-of-war/with-gears-of-war-e-day-recapturing-the-tone-and-vibes-of-the-original-games-the-coalition-believes-its-upcoming-prequel-has-the-potential-to-be-one-of-the-best-stories-in-the-gears-franchise/">Speaking to GamesRadar +</a>, Searcy spoke at length about what returning to a core moment in Gears history allowed the team to explore: ""This is the story we were excited to tell and so the process has been super energizing. There are touchpoints in the lore for us to build from, but enough room that we get to bring new elements and ideas in.</p>
<p>Searcy elaborates: "Getting to go back to the tone and vibes of the original games, exploring the details of Emergence, and imagining what would happen to a city (and the soldiers protecting it) as monsters poured out from the ground was a great starting point to reintroduce the Locust and these characters"</p>

<p>The game, which will be set in the city of Kalona over the course of a few consecutive days, will focus heavily on the shock of Locust forces popping up and causing havoc for the first time. According to Searcy, it'll be quite an emotionally charged experience as well as an action-packed one.</p>
<p>"Our story is set over consecutive days so that players can become intimate with the city," Searcy states.  "We want them to feel the loss of what was here: the history, the people, and the lives they were living.</p>
<p>"We think it has the potential to be one of the best stories in the Gears franchise, and certainly the most heart and emotion when you're looking at Marcus, Dom, and the origin of the brotherhood that they forge in this game."</p>

            <p>Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</a> studio has shared a statement following its game's shock cancellation.</p>
<p>Last night, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">Ubisoft announced a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset"</a>, which saw the company delay seven unspecified projects, close two studios and cancel multiple games. One such game was its Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-details-whats-new-in-its-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">unveiled in 2020</a>, and had suffered numerous delays and setbacks since. Then, this week, came the final nail in the coffin.</p>

<p>The team behind Prince of Persia's embattled remake has now shared a few words of its own. Here, the studio acknowledged the cancellation was "deeply disappointing" for fans as well as the development team, however this "does not mean [its] stepping away from the franchise" for good.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/2014018590396105121/photo/1">social media post</a>, Ubisoft's Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake studio wrote: "The game holds enormous meaning for fans and for the teams who worked on it.</p>
<p>"While the project had real potential, we weren't able to reach the level of quality you deserve, and continuing would have required more time and investment than we could reasonably commit. And, we didn't want to release something that fell short of what The Sands of Time represents."</p><p>It stated Prince of Persia "as a universe and a legacy" is still important to the studio, and Sands of Time's cancellation does not mean this is the end for the franchise as a whole. Closing, Ubisoft's studio thanked the community for its "passion, patience and love for Prince of Persia".</p>

<p>Many were surprised to learn Ubisoft was pulling the plug on its Sands of Time remake. Recent reports from the company had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">the game slated for release during"Q4" of its current financial year</a>, which comes to an end on 31st March. So, in just a couple of months.</p>
<p>In June of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-five-tumultuous-years-ubisoft-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-now-deep-in-development">the Sands of Time remake was said to be "deep in development"</a>, after the project moved from its original developers Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai to Ubisoft Montreal, where it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-years-on-ubisofts-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-still-in-the-conception-phase">seemingly rebooted from scratch</a>.</p>
