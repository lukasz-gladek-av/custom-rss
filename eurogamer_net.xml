            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> co-founder Andrew Gavin has opened up about why the studio was acquired by Sony back in 2001.</p>
<p>In a lengthy post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrew-gavin-441765_why-did-we-sell-naughty-dog-its-a-question-activity-7277011334121058305-JZKz/">LinkedIn</a>, Gavin cited the spiralling costs of game development as one of the reasons the studio was sold, saying "a systemic issue in the AAA space" wherein developers "almost never have the resources to fund their own games [...] gives publishers enormous leverage".</p>

<p>"Why did we sell Naughty Dog? It's a question I've been asked countless times. The answer is simple: budgets were skyrocketing," Gavin - who worked at Naughty Dog for almost 20 years before leaving in 2004 - said (via <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/522635/article/naughty-dog-co-founder-reveals-why-they-were-acquired-by-sony/">Gameranx</a>).</p><p>"When we started Naughty Dog in the 1980s, game development expenses were manageable. We bootstrapped everything, pouring profits from one game into the next. Our early 80s games cost less than $50,000 each to make. Rings of Power ('88-91), saw budgets rise to about $100,000, but yielded slightly more than that in after tax profits in 1992.</p>
<p>"In 1993, we rolled that $100k from Rings into a self-funded Way of the Warrior. But Crash Bandicoot ('94-96) cost $1.6 million to make. By the time we got to Jak and Daxter ('99-01), the budget busted the $15 million mark.</p>
<p>"By 2004, the cost of AAA games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jak-3">Jak 3</a> had soared to $45-50 million - and they have been rising ever since," Gavin added. "But back in 2000, we were still self-funding every project, and the stress of financing these ballooning budgets independently was enormous.</p>
<p>"It wasn't just us. This was (and still is) a systemic issue in the AAA space. Developers almost never have the resources to fund their own games, which gives publishers enormous leverage. Selling to Sony wasn't just about securing a financial future for Naughty Dog. It was about giving the studio the resources to keep making the best games possible, without being crushed by the weight of skyrocketing costs and the paralysing fear that one slip would ruin it all.</p>
<p>"Looking back, it was the right call."</p>
<p>Gavin ended by admitting that "AAA games have only gotten more expensive since then", citing costs for today's big-budget games "easily" top "$300, $400, or even $500 million".</p>
<p>"Would we have been able to keep up? Maybe. But selling - to the right party - gave Naughty Dog the stability it needed to thrive and to continue making the kinds of games we'd always dreamed of!"</p>
<p>Several months after studio lead Neil Druckmann confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-neil-druckmann-says">Naughty Dog had a number of games in the works</a>, the team has lifted the lid on its next, all-new title: Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet for PS5.</p>
<p>"Set thousands of years in the future, Intergalactic puts players into the role of Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria – a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago," teases the blurb.</p>
<p>"Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit," reads the game's official blurb."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> Nightreign will not include the game's signature in-game messaging system because there will be "no time" to read or write messages.</p>
<p>Whilst Nightreign's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-is-making-more-elden-ring-after-all-with-the-co-op-elden-ring-night-reign">announcement trailer</a> featured plenty of familiar elements like sites of grace and Evergaols - as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-will-feature-enemies-from-dark-souls-director-confirms">enemies from Dark Souls</a> like The Nameless King from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a> - Elden Ring Nightreign director Junya Ishizaki has confirmed the studio is pulling its in-game communication because with sessions around 40-minutes long, there simply isn't any time to waste.</p>

<p>"You can still see the ghosts of other players, but the ability to leave messages has been removed," Ishizaki told <a href="https://jp.ign.com/elden-ring-nightreign/77870/interview/elden-ring-nightreign-403rpg">IGN Japan</a> via machine translation.</p>
<p>"The reason we removed the message feature is that in this game, where each session is about 40 minutes long, there is no time to write your own message, and no time to read messages written by others."</p>
<p>"The concept was to make a 'condensed RPG'. RPGs have their ups and downs, and players sometimes gain and sometimes lose," Ishizaki added. "I think the best part of RPGs is that all of these experiences ultimately come to fruition. In order to create a harmonious experience that allows players to experience the true essence of RPGs, each game took place over three days."</p><p>Interestingly, this means defeated foes will not revive during the match - not even when you rest at a site of grace - and although ashes will make an appearance in Nightreign, how they're "handled" will differ from the original Elden Ring game.</p>
<p>The interview also revealed that Miyazaki was involved "up until the creation of the initial concept" for Nightreign, but he has since stepped aside for the new director, who has been at FromSoft since 2011.</p>
<p>"Elden Ring spin-off Nightreign is a very exciting game that will excite players," Ishizaki concluded. "It will provide a sense of accomplishment and joy that is different from previous titles, so please look forward to it."</p>
<p>ICYMI, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-co-op-spin-off-nightreign-network-test-announced-and-you-can-register-for-it-soon">network test for Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> will take place in February, with registration beginning on 10th January.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
