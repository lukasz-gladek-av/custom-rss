            <p>According to Sony's outgoing SVP of Global Partner Development and Relations, PlayStation is like a well choreographed dance.</p>
<p>The company's Phil Rosenberg will be heading off to pastures new at the end of this year. But, while he may be leaving, he has plenty of optimism for PlayStation's future.</p>
<p>"I think we have the smartest, brightest and most passionate people in the world working at [Sony Interactive Entertainment]. They are specialists in areas that need specific expertise. I think that as technology continues to evolve, it becomes more stable, will run faster and that gaming will be an even bigger part of our entertainment world," he said in <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/leadership-spotlight-a-conversation-with-phil-rosenberg/">a recent interview</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>The exec went on to describe the company's workings being "like a ballet", saying while it may all appear "like it's kind of effortless", in reality there is "a lot of work" and "heavy lifting" behind the scenes.</p>
<p>"And we're really good at it,"  Rosenberg said.</p>
<p>The exec stated he was "very hopeful and very encouraged by the wind we have in our sails right now", adding he believes the company will "end this year on a great note". Meanwhile, while he didn't go into any great detail, he said all signs point to Sony having "another fabulous year" in 2026.</p>
<p>Based on nothing other than my own extrapolations, this comment made me think of Insomniac's Wolverine, which still doesn't have a release date yet. I am still hopeful for a release this year, although it was recently said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-release-window-narrowed-down-by-black-panther-himself">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra was aiming for a Christmas launch window</a> - would Sony want to release a first party Marvel game around the same time? I am not sure.</p>
<p>But, back to the matter in hand! Continuing his train of thought, Rosenberg said he is sure Sony has a "bright, bright future" in store. "This is not a '30 years and out' story," Rosenberg closed. "This is a '60 years and who the heck knows from there' story."</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Sony news, earlier this month a leak revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-is-experimenting-with-ai-powered-playstation-characters-ironically-chooses-horizons-aloy-to-demonstrate">the company was working on AI-driven characters</a>, including Aloy from the Horizon series.</p>
<p>This prompted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-forbidden-west-actress-ashly-burch-responds-to-sonys-controversial-ai-aloy">Aloy's Ashly Burch to respond to the leaked footage</a>, with the actress stating she doesn't feel worried that the technology exists, or even because game companies want to use it, but it does still scare her.</p>
<p>"I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone's performance attached to it. That does have someone's voice, or face, or movement. And the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse," Burch said. "They wouldn't have any protections. Any way to fight back.</p>
<p>"And that possibility... It makes me so sad. It hurts my heart. It scares me."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Over the weekend, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> team announced the second wave of music set for the upcoming remakes, but some noticed a few omissions from the original games. However, there is a good reason for this, with none other than Tony Hawk himself taking responsibility.</p>
<p>"It was my choice to pick some different songs by the same artists featured in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">THPS3</a>+4 OST," <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHtXr4Xppt8/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">Hawk wrote on Instagram</a>. "I’m hoping that discovery is half the fun, and a big reason that these soundtracks resonated in the first place. So listen and enjoy the ride."</p>

<p>Hawk closed by assuring fans there is "more to come… both old and new", so keep your eyes and ears out for those.</p>
<p>As for that second wave of music, it includes tracks such as Hollywood Baby by 100 gecs and 2 Minutes to Midnight by Iron Maiden.</p>

            <p>In its first month of release, Capcom's latest Monster Hunter game has passed an impressive milestone.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250331.html">shared by the company</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has surpassed 10m units since its release on 28th February, 2025.</p>

<p>Celebrating this success, Capcom said Monster Hunter Wilds "provides an environment where a wider range of players can enjoy the game together with the introduction of crossplay, a first for the series, and a simultaneous release on Playstation 5 system, Xbox Series X/S, and PC".</p>
<p>It added the "introduction of the new Focus Mode mechanic and the implementation of seamless movement between settlements and ecosystems" allowed players to experience a more "immersive gaming experience".</p>
<p>Capcom also credited "the fusion of numerous new elements with Monster Hunter’s appeal" for generating plenty of fan excitement, "all of which led to the company first-month sales record of over 10m units sold".</p>
<p>Looking to the future, the company highlighted Monster Hunter Wilds' first free content update, which is set to release later this week, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-first-major-content-update-detailed-ahead-of-next-weeks-release">bring leviathan Mizutsune and more to the fray</a>.</p>
<p>A second title update will then be released later this summer, Capcom said, adding it plans to continue to release updates that "delight" its players.</p>

<p>On its release in February, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">Monster Hunter Wilds quickly surpassed Monster Hunter World's all-time player peak on Steam</a>, before breaking through the one million concurrent players milestone on Valve's platform.

<p>Our Matt awarded the game four out of five stars on its release, calling Wilds the "most exhilarating and refined Monster Hunter" to date.</p>
<p>"Wilds remains an exhilarating piece of work - so refined, so alive, so giddily, chaotically joyful when it all comes together that it feels like the ultimate culmination of everything the series has been working toward over the last two decades," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Eurogamer's Monster Hunter Wilds review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss Strauss Zelnick has revealed why the publisher is keeping Rockstar's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>'s release date such a closely guarded secret.</p>

<p>"The anticipation for that title may be the greatest anticipation I've ever seen for an entertainment property, and I've been around the block a few times," Zelnick explained right at the end of the interview.</p>
<p>"I've been in every entertainment business there is, and we want to maintain the anticipation and the excitement.</p>
<p>"We do have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance, and we found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials <em>relatively</em> close to the release window in order to create that excitement on the one hand, and balance the excitement with unmet anticipation," he added.</p>
<p>"I don't always get it exactly right, but that's what we're trying to do."</p>
<p>As Matt recently summarised for us, Take-Two has been doggedly sticking to the same non-specific <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">"fall" launch window for Grand Theft Auto 6</a> since announcing it last May - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">despite persistent reports of a potential delay</a>. But there seems to be one relatively safe spot on the 2025 calendar right now: it's unlikely GTA 6 will release on or during the weeks surrounding 23rd September, given that's the launch date <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-gets-new-trailer-and-a-release-date">Take-Two reserved for Borderlands 4</a> earlier this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Riven developer Cyan Worlds has cut its staff count by half.</p>
<p>In a statement posted to social media, the Washington studio - perhaps best known for the Myst series - said "despite its best efforts", "industry conditions" had forced it into a "tricky spot [where] the month-to-month realities of game development in 2025" left it with no choice but to lay off half its team.</p>

<p>"Today we would like to share with you some very unfortunate news," the statement began. "Despite our best efforts to avoid it, Cyan has made the difficult decision to reduce our overall staff size - resulting in the layoff of 12 talented staff members, roughly half the team - effective at the end of March.</p> <div>

<p>"Industry conditions have forced us into a tricky spot where we are having to weigh the future health of our studio against the month-to-month realities of game development in 2025. Throughout the past year, we have been ultra-transparent with the entire Cyan team about the choppy waters we find ourselves in, as well as the dangers ahead. While the news of a layoff was not a surprise to the team, it was (and is) still deeply saddening for all of us."</p>
<p>The studio said it has "done [its] best to pad the landing for those affected" with severance packages and is now committed to securing funding for its next project to "restabilise" the studio.</p>
<p>"We've been around for a very long time, and have been through tough times before," the statement concluded. "Our sincere hope is to continue to be around, and to provide the types of experiences that only Cyan can deliver."</p>
<p>At the end of last week, Tomb Raider developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-announces-layoffs">Crystal Dynamics similarly made the "difficult decision" to layoff 17 "talented" staff</a>. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/">1200 game developers have lost their jobs</a>, on top of around 14,600 in 2024, and 10,500 in 2023.</p></div>
