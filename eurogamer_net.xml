            <p>
Sega's legendary <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter">Virtua Fighter</a> is set to make a return, the publisher has confirmed, some 18 years after the launch of its most recent numbered instalment, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-5">Virtua Fighter 5</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since then, there've been numerous updated releases of Virtua Fighter 5 (culminating with 2021's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown">Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown</a>, itself a remaster of the earlier Final Showdow), alongside mobile instalments, and even a arcade update for Virtual Fighter 3. What series fans haven't had, though, is a brand-new game.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, Sega's new global head of transmedia, Justin Scarpone, has offered some hope in an <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/why-sega-is-reviving-classics-like-shinobi-and-jet-set-radio-across-games-film-and-tv/">interview with VGC</a>. "So we have a suite of titles in development right now that fall into that legacy bucket," Scarpone explained, "which we announced last year at The Game Awards; <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jet-set-radio">Jet Set Radio</a>, Streets of Rage, Shinobi."

<p>
Then came the bombshell. "And we have another Virtua Fighter being developed," Scrapone added, before glossing over the revelation completely, continuing, "And then in certain instances, we're also doing animation series, or live-action films to augment that and be part of those roadmaps." It's not, then, confirmation that a new mainline Virtua Fighter instalment is on the way, exactly, but it's something at least.
</p><p>
Despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-announces-flurry-of-projects-including-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi">announcing a flurry of legacy game remakes</a> last year - including Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio, Streets of Rage, Shinobi, Golden Axe, "and more" - details remain limited. Sega has shared a little about its Crazy Taxi revival - calling it an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-new-crazy-taxi-game-will-be-open-world-and-massively-multiplayer">open-world, massively-multiplayer game</a> that's "AAA" in scope - but is yet to talk launch windows, other than saying it'll "release these projects in the coming years."

            <p>
Well, here's another mystery to cross off the 'unresolved' list; 20 years after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a>'s release, Konami has finally confirmed fan suspicions that Russian spy Eva was voiced by the same actor who player Ariel in Disney's The Little Mermaid.
</p>
<p>
The identity of Eva's voice performer has long puzzled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> 3 fans, given the person listed in the game's credit - one Suzetta Mi単et - didn't appear to be a real person at all. And while vocal similarities had led some community members to believe <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/5ee3b2/jodi_benson_voice_of_ariel_from_disneys_the/">Mi単et was actually a pseudonym for Ariel voice actor Jodi Benson</a> (although she was far from the only suspect), it's never been officially confirmed... until now.
</p>
<p>
In the newly released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDIWFh7nYa4">third instalment of Konami's Metal Gear Solid Legacy Series documentary</a>, charting the history of the franchise, Benson finally confirmed her Snake Eater involvement and shared a little more about how Suzetta Mi単et came to be. "When we recorded... in 2003," she explained, "just the various projects that I am affiliated with in my career are sort of family based, children-based, things like that. So it was actually [our director] Kris Zimmerman Salter; she kind of sat down with me and she's like, maybe we need to change your name."

<p>
"So she asked me, 'What was your dog's name growing up?'," Benson continued, "and I said, 'Suzette Monet'. So she's like, 'You know what, let's build on that. How about Suzetta? How about instead of Monet, the artist, we'll do Mi単et?', and I was like, 'Sounds like a deal!"
</p><p>
However, Benson - whose other roles include Barbie in the Toy Story series and Thumbelina - admits some fans still managed to suss her out, even with the pseudonym. "Seven years ago, at various conventions when we meet and greet with wonderful fans," she went on, "somebody slipped one of these wonderful games to my table, and I said, 'Why are you bringing that?', and he said, 'Because you're in it.' And I said, 'Do you <em>know</em>? Do you know my deep dark secret?'. And he said, 'Yes! I do know', and I said, 'Shh, keep it quiet!'"
</p>
<p>
Confirmation of Benson's role in Snake Eater comes as Konami continues its efforts to revitalise the Metal Gear Solid series following creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-left-konami-earlier-this-month-report">acrimonious departure</a> from the publisher back in 2015. Last year saw the launch of Konami's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-the-mgs-master-collection-is-anything-but-masterful">less-then-stellar Metal Gear Solid Master Collection: Volume 1</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-looks-like-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-will-include-mgs4">Volume 2 still to come</a>. First, however, it'll be releasing  its Metal Gear Solid 3 remake, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-still-doesnt-have-a-release-date-despite-its-2024-window">still doesn't have a release date</a> despite its 2024 launch window.
