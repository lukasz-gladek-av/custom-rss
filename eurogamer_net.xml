            <p>Phasmophobia developer Kinetic Games has shared its 2026 roadmap, complete with hints of four seasonal events, two reworked maps, one completely new location, and a load of "major updates", including the player character overhaul, a Unity 6 update, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> release, and, of course, that highly-anticipated 1.0 release.</p>
<p>And it all starts pretty soon, too. That player character overhaul - which some had hoped would release last year - should be out by March, complete with free cosmetics, new character models, and "fine-tuned animations".</p>

<p>"Brave ghost hunters will need to gear up for a host of new spooks and scares, with the pivotal 1.0 launch set to release across all platforms simultaneously this year," Kinetic teased. "Set to be one of the biggest moments since the game's launch, players can expect lots of surprises, as this will also include what was previously known as Horror 2.0."</p><p>Following on from the reworked farmhouse maps, Willow Street and Tanglewood are the next residential maps to get the decorators in. While Tanglewood's layout will remain "similar" (interestingly, the same is not said of Willow Street, which is my personal favourite), players can expect "a range of new interactions, a few small layout changes, and more."</p>

<p>"For those with a keen eye, there's also a mystery lurking in the shadows of 6 Tanglewood Drive waiting to be uncovered," the team added.</p>
<p>As for the new map? Kinetic is playing its cards very close to its chest on that one, but it did tease that along with the return of the usual seasonal events, a mysterious one-time event is also planned for later this year, too.</p><p>"This year is set to be a big one for Phasmophobia, and we are so excited for our 1.0 launch, which will be one of the biggest moments since we released the game," said Daniel Knight , Kinetic CEO and game director of Phasmophobia.</p>
<p>"We are constantly working on creating a truly immersive experience for ghost hunters, and have been developing the game with this in mind. Previous updates including Chronicle and our upcoming Player Character update have all been steps in fulfilling our vision, and we hope the 1.0 launch will feel as fresh and exciting as when the game first launched back in 2020."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> developer Kinetic Games reckons 2026 will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2026-will-be-one-of-the-biggest-years-in-the-history-of-co-op-ghosthunting-game-phasmophobia">"one of the biggest [years] in the game's history" as it moves towards the full release of the game</a>. In an update shared at the beginning of the year, the team says we can expect to see "more immersive animations" added to the early access ghosthunting game, such as physically seeing your character model turn on your EMF Reader, opening and closing doors, and picking up or dropping equipment.</p>
