            <p>Nier: Automata producer Yosuke Saito and director <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/yoko-taro">Yoko Taro</a> have denied that any of their character designs were restricted for Western audiences.</p>

<p>In the interview above (skip to 28:12 for the segment concerned), Sony executive Yoshida Shuhei asked the developers about their design process.</p>
<p>"Our concept is always to do something that's 'not like anything else'. What I mean is, if Nier: Replicant had a boy as the main character, Nier: Automata would have a girl protagonist. If Western sci-fi is filled with Marine-like soldiers, we might go in the opposite direction and use Gothic Lolita outfits, for example," Taro said. "We tend to take the contrarian route."</p>
<p>"There are, of course, certain things that are ethically or morally inappropriate – even if they're just aspects of a character," Saito added, according to the subtitles. "We try to draw a line by establishing rules about what’s acceptable and what’s not.</p>
<p>"While certain things might be acceptable in Japan, they could become problematic in certain overseas regions, and even characters could become problematic as well. These are the kind of situation[s] we usually try to avoid creating. As a result, there are actually countries where we couldn't officially release Nier: Automata."</p>
<p>This immediately caused consternation with fans but as Automaton points out, this "could be a little tricky to translate, even for an advanced Japanese speaker".</p>
<p>When asked directly about the claim, Taro denied it, <a href="https://x.com/yokotaro/status/1933044002095575201">saying on X/Twitter:</a> "I've never heard of such a thing happening". Saito simply said he thought the things he'd mentioned had been mistranslated, and would clarify this in a future livestream.</p>
<p>In the same interview, former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nier-automata-revived-the-japanese-games-industry-says-former-sony-exec-shuhei-yoshida">Nier: Automata the "game that changed everything", as it was responsible for reviving the Japanese games industry</a> on its release. In a recent interview, Yoshida discussed how during the PS3 era, sales of Japanese games had declined, and increasingly studios there were chasing "overseas tastes".</p>
<p>That changed with NieR: Automata in 2017, released for the PS4. "I think Yoko Taro created it without paying any mind at all to making it sell overseas, but it was a tremendous success," Yoshida said.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>On the tenth anniversary of the release of free-to-play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-shelter">Fallout Shelter</a>, Bethesda has revealed the management sim game has been downloaded 230 million times across all platforms.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Bethesda reckons it's time to "celebrate a decade of adventure, excitement, and Vault-building fun with Fallout Shelter" by launching a new in-game event that offers "party favours" for everyone who logs in from 16th–21st June, including bonus lunchboxes, Nuka, and more.</p>
<p>"Tons of content has been added to the game since 2015. You've built Vaults, made lives (or chaos) for your dwellers, and embarked on thrilling quests, all while keeping the spirit of the wasteland alive and well," the developer <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/6zT9anWe9yLVqi1F6gGPms/fallout-shelter-10th-anniversary">said</a>.</p>

<p>"Whether you've been with us all along or you're new to the party, now is a great time to head into the wasteland and start building. To celebrate this huge milestone, we’re offering up to 70 percent off lunchboxes in the in-game store from now through 17th June.</p>
<p>"So, dust off your Pip-Boy, tune in to the celebration, and keep those Vaults thriving. Here's to another 10 years of Fallout Shelter!"</p>
<p>As for those aforementioned party favours?</p>
<ul>
<li>16-17th June: Lunchbox x2, Pet Carrier x1, Nuka x10</li>
<li>18-19th June: Lunchbox x3, Mr. Handy x1, Nuka x15</li>
<li>20-21st June: Lunchbox x5, Pet Carrier x1, Nuka x20</li>
</ul>
<p>ICYMI, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-renews-fallout-for-third-season-six-months-before-second-arrives">Fallout TV series has already been renewed for a third season on Amazon Prime</a>. That's despite the show's second season still being months away, debuting in December 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Although Sony made no public comment concerning the furore about sales restrictions invoked in countries where PSN isn't available or shared any plans to address it, check SteamDB and you'll see that the games <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/833972/history/?changeid=29554938">have indeed trimmed down the number of countries where they're unavailable</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/sony-removes-regional-restrictions-on-four-of-its-biggest-games-on-steam/">PC Gamer</a>). Just one region was added to the restricted sale list: Russian Federation.</p>

</span></p><p>This all started, of course, when Helldivers 2 was review-bombed last year following a PSN requirement which led to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">game being pulled from sale in 177 countries</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">company quickly u-turned its decision</a> following the backlash but not before several Sony-published games were caught up in the controversy. Most recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-pc-release-blocked-on-steam-in-over-120-countries-surprising-even-its-developer">Stellar Blade found itself at the centre of the backlash</a> even though developer Shift Up had stated a PSN account was only optional and not a formal requirement.</p>
<p>On the subject of Sony, president Hideaki Nishino recently stated the company is open to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-will-continue-to-add-more-value-to-ps-plus-says-company-president-but-it-may-come-with-price-changes-too">adjusting the price of PlayStation Plus in the future, as the company aims to "maximise profitability</a>".</p>
<p>The comments came as part of a discussion between Sony CEO Hermen Hulst and president Hideaki Nishino on PS Plus and the company's future. Discussing Sony's subscription service, Nishino stated: "We will continue to add more value and adjust our pricing strategy in a dynamic way to maximise profitability."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Per <a href="https://streamscharts.com/news/summer-game-fest-2025">StreamCharts</a> (via <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-viewership-record-50-million-livestreams-1236431017/">Variety</a>), YouTube saw the most views on The Game Awards' YouTube channel (which is, of course, Keighley's other seasonal show), with views up 43 percent compared to 2025. According to StreamCharts' analysis, the average audience also increased by 30 percent, while peak viewership for SGF on Twitch was also up by 38 percent.</p>
<p>More than 1300 community co-streamers, "ranging from variety broadcasters to Japanese VTubers", shared the feed live.</p>
<p>"In total, the peak concurrent audience for SGF reached more than 3 million live simultaneous viewers across Twitch and YouTube, with significant year-over-year growth on both platforms in terms of average viewership, watch time, and co-streams," a press release stated.</p>
<p>It's now the second-biggest gaming/tech show of 2025, second only to Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> showcase. March's Nintendo Direct is third, while Xbox Games Showcase and June's State of Play come in fourth and fifth place, respectively.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this month's PlayStation State of Play is similarly breaking records for Sony, as its <a href="https://streamscharts.com/news/sony-playstations-state-play-record">June showcase smashed prior peak concurrent viewership records</a>, making it the most popular State of Play hosted to date.</p>
