            <p>Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has reacted to online negativity regarding the upcoming Borderlands 4, stating "if you take developer's passion for granted, we'll all pay the price".</p>
<p>Pitchford's words come as part of an exchange on social media with influencer Gothalion, who also serves as audience director for publisher Midwest Games, and kicked off after Gothalion claimed Pitchford had muted a fan for raising some "very valid concerns (mild takes really)" about the next entry in the Borderlands series.</p>
<p>"His critique came from a place of love," <a href="https://x.com/Gothalion/status/1896361473586384983">Gothalion wrote</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/dont-gaslight-me-borderlands-4-ceo-randy-pitchford-begs-fans-to-be-optimistic-about-the-upcoming-fps-otherwise-well-all-pay-the-price/">GamesRadar</a>). "As will mine. Please reconsider. Do better. Make a great Borderlands, and when your longest lasting biggest supporters give feedback and worries, especially respectfully, digest it gracefully."</p>

</figure>
<p>Pitchford, however, did not take warmly to Gothalion's comments, and said the aforementioned mild takes were not a critique, but "shitty negativity that was demotivating" for the Borderlands 4 team.</p>
<p>"Want the best Borderlands? Root for us and cheer us on. If you take developer's passion for granted, we'll all pay the price," <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1896371927259980287">Pitchford replied</a>, adding he appreciates criticism and has "never been in short supply" of it.</p>
<p>"Don't gaslight me on his post," the Gearbox exec closed. "It wasn't criticism. It was pessimism. It's toxic for people killing themselves for your entertainment, so fuck that noise."</p>
<p>This is, of course, not the first time Pitchford has been vocal in defence of his studio and media online. Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-randy-pitchford-defends-recent-flops-by-comparing-gearbox-to-the-beatles">the CEO compared his company to the Beatles</a>. "I wish everything [we do] could be a hit," he said, "but that is not how it works... The greatest musical act of all time, The Beatles, had a 25 percent hit rate."</p>

            <p>Sony has just released a new update for its PS3 console, which turns 19 this year.</p>
<p>The system software update 4.92 improves system performance, according to the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/">patch notes</a>, and also renews the Blu-ray player encryption key to allow for disc playback.</p>
<p>Updates of this sort are an annual occurrence, as the Advanced Access Content System (AACS) <a href="https://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/video/aacs.html#:~:text=AACS%20(Advanced%20Access%20Content%20System,months%20and%20must%20be%20renewed.">encryption key regularly expires</a> - it's a copyright-protection technology that requires a key to be set on both the disc and the console in order to play new films.</p>

<p>The key also exists on PS4 and PS5, but according to the console manuals, the encryption key is automatically renewed, but on PS3 it must be done in a system update.</p>
<p>Presumably Sony will continue to release such updates on PS3 until it stops supporting the console.</p>

            <p>
Capcom has unveiled a bustling in-game event schedule for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, with the first oppurtunity to gain new gear available now.
</p>
<p>
Six events will go live over the next three weeks, each lasting for a week or two, with rewards ranging from new headgear to... more cheese? I guess <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-delectable-cuisine-causes-cheese-naan-sales-to-surge">Monster Hunter Wilds is really leaning into its cheese naan meme</a>.
</p>
<p>
The schedule begins now with Ku-Ku Gone Cuckoo, an event based in the Scarlet Forest which requires you gather special materials to obtain the Mimiphyta α headgear. This runs until 18th March.

<p>
The Stalking Supper event is also now active, which rewards you for gathering more Kunafa Cheese in Windward Plains to be used on your barbecue grill. This runs until 11th March.
</p>
<p>
Upcoming quests include Tongue-Tied, running from 11th-18th March, which involves gathering Armor Spheres, and then a trio of new events beginning on 18th March.
</p>
<p>
These include Ballet in the Rain, which involves gathering Glowing Orb - Swords, Sand-Scarred Soul, for gathering Glowing Orb - Armors, and Like A Fire Hidden By Sand, where Capcom says you can obtain "the Expedition Headgear α, a piece of equipment based on the emblem of the expedition!"
</p>
<p>
Capcom has a <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/event-quest/en-us/schedule?utc=0">full event schedule on the Monster Hunter Wilds website</a>.

Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">Capcom announced that Monster Hunter Wilds was its fastest-selling game ever</a>, with 8m copies shipped so far.

            <p>PlayStation has been hit with more layoffs from its Visual Arts studio, following the recent cancellations of multiple live-service games.</p>
<p>The layoffs come amid a restructuring of Sony's US studios, as an unknown number of staff from the San Diego-based Visual Arts studio will be let go this week.</p>
<p>Visual Arts supported first-party development (including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s The Last of Us remasters), and while these new cuts include staff who contributed to the recently cancelled live-service game from Bend Studio among others, <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-studios-visual-arts-layoffs-cuts-last-us-1851767734">Kotaku</a> has reported the layoffs are more widespread.</p>

<p>Eurogamer has contacted Sony for further details on these layoffs.</p>
<p>The news follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">several cancelled projects from Sony</a>, including a live-service game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> developer Bend and another from Bluepoint reportedly based within the God of War series.</p>
<p>Moreover, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">Sony cancelled live-service shooter Concord</a> back in September, admitting "our initial launch didn't land".

<p>On the flipside, Sony still has its Horizon live-service game in development, which has now added former Bungie senior design lead <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisjamesproctor/">Chris Proctor</a> to its team as a design director.

            <p>
Dotemu and Guard Crush Games, the studios behind 2020's widely acclaimed beat 'em up sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/streets-of-rage-4">Streets of Rage 4</a>, are teaming up again for something a little bit different: Absolum, a fantasy themed side-scrolling brawler with rogue-like elements that's launching this year.
</p>
<p>
Absolum aims to combine "thrilling arcade beat 'em up action" with "intricate, refined combat" to create what Dotemu is describing as a "rogue 'em up". There's talk of quests, branching pathways, NPCs, unlockable items, permanent warrior upgrades, and combinable character skills - all in a fantasy adventure channeling the spirit of classic brawlers including Golden Axe.
</p>
<p>
Absolum's action plays out across Talamh, a world of wonder and cosmic horrors gripped by warfare following a cataclysmic magical event. That's where the game's four-strong band of rebels comes in, all setting out on an epic quest to oppose the Sun King Azra and liberate Talamh after they're imbued with powerful magic.

<p>
All four rebels are playable (either solo or co-operatively) and feature their own unique skill set and personality, with two having been revealed so far. There's Galandra, for instance - an agile, sword-clad fighter designed to excel in close-quarters combat - while Karl is a tanklike dwarf armed with devastating punches and a rifle that can bring down opponents from afar.
</p>
<p>
"Absolum blends arcade-like melee combat with spells, counters, upgradable abilities and uniquely powerful playable fighters," explains Dotemu, "hosting a grand, high-stakes quest across an array of hand-crafted stages." Those stages - and Absolum's striking visual style - have been brought to life by the artists and animators at animation studio Supamonks.
</p>
<p>
Absolum doesn't have a release date yet, but it's coming to PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1904480/Absolum/">via Steam</a>) sometime later this year.
