            <p>
Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> is suing PlayerAuctions - an online marketplace already targeted in a complaint by Roblox - accusing it of selling "heavily modified" player accounts, items, and virtual currency obtained through hacks and cheats.
</p>
<p>
Take-Two's lawsuit - filed in the US Central District Court of California last week and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/536315/take-two-gta-5-online-black-market-lawsuit">spotted by Polygon</a> - targets PlayerAuctions' Chinese owner Paiao Network Technology. It accuses the company of running a "lawless enterprise", claiming it has "full knowledge" of the alleged "rampant infringement and other unauthorised conduct" happening on its site.
</p>
<p>
"[This] is not a regular online marketplace," reads the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/836607989/Take-Two-PlayerAuctions-lawsuit-via-Polygon">filing</a>. "Instead, [it] runs a sophisticated sales platform and actively recruits 'sellers' skilled at using hacking software and other exploits to create infringing digital goods and to provide illegal 'services' to players of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>." More specifically, Take-Two claims PlayerAuctions contains "thousands of listings for unauthorised, infringing GTA 5 content – including heavily modified player accounts, in-game assets, and virtual currency – all gained by using hacking software, cheats, and technical exploits."
</p>
<p>
Take-Two claims PlayerAuctions sells accounts manipulated through hacking to provide "exorbitantly high game level ranking and in-game currency amounts", as well as content ordinarily only accessible through gameplay or purchases. "At the scale of its website," continues the lawsuit, "PlayerAuctions risks upending the GTA 5 player experience and interferes with the balance and fairness of the game."
</p>
<p>
Take-Two claims it has "repeatedly confronted PlayerAuctions with evidence of infringement and other tortious conduct", but says its cease and desist orders have so far been ignored - all while Paiao Network Technology allegedly continues to reap "millions in revenue" from infringement. Take-Two says it's bringing its complaint to the court in order to "shut down PlayerAuctions' rampant infringing online marketplace, end its corrupt business model, and protect the integrity of GTA 5 for its players."
</p>
<p>
Take-Two is claiming relief for copyright and trademark infringement, and is requesting the court "preliminarily and permanently" prohibits PlayerAuctions from selling accounts, virtual goods, and virtual currency in GTA 5 or any of its other games. Additionally, Take-Two wants PlayerAuctions to be prohibited from "aiding, abetting, contributing to, or otherwise assisting, benefiting or inducing" hacking of its software or infringing its GTA trademarks.
</p>
<p>
Take-Two's lawsuit follows a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/824845348/Roblox-vs-PlayerAuctions-via-Polygon">similar filing against PlayerAuctions by Roblox Corporation last month</a>. The company is also seeking monetary damages, as well as requesting the court prevents PlayerAuctions from buying, selling, and trading Roblox-related products.

            <p>
It's been a bit of a busy day in the world of virtual reality, thanks to a flurry of PSVR 2 and PCVR announcements <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wN0B5utUu4">courtesy of the aptly named VR Games Showcase</a>. And if you've been itching for an excuse to don goggles again, there's fresh gameplay of Hitman: World of Assassination, a new look at Fireproof Games' intriguing Ghost Town, and more.
</p>
<h3>Hitman: World of Assassination PSVR 2 gameplay</h3>
<p>
Starting with Hitman: World of Assassination, it sees players slipping into the immaculately pressed suit (and other more situationally appropriate attire) of Agent 47, and he stealths his way through the likes of Mumbai, Paris, and the Columbian jungle. Its PSVR 2-enabled sniping, gadgetting, and dual-wielding arrives on 27th March, and here's what it looks like:

<h3>The Room studio's Ghost Town gets new gameplay trailer</h3>
<p>
Next up is a fresh look at Ghost Town from Fireproof Games, which previously developed the wonderfully sinister The Room series. This one casts players as witch-turned ghost-hunter Edith Penrose, as she tracks and exorcises spirits across 1980s London. It's a game of "unearthly puzzles" requiring "wits, mystical knowledge, and ancient magic" that's coming to Meta Quest, PSVR 2, and PCVR "early" this summer - and new gameplay is below.

<h3>Surviving Mars: Pioneer revealed</h3>
<p>
Strategy fans are also getting a bit of VR loving in the form of Surviving Mars: Pioneer, an adaptation of Paradox Interactive's terraforming colony management game from 2018. This one's set to release on Meta Quest and PCVR later this year, initially in early access.

<h3>Shadowgate VR coming to PSVR 2</h3>
<p>
Readers of a certain age might remember classic dungeon crawling series Shadowgate, which is celebrating its 35th anniversary this year. And to mark the occassion, its previously released virtual reality adaptation, Shadowgate VR: The Mines of Mythrok, is coming to PSVR 2. There's no word of a release date yet, but players can expect multiple difficulties, a crow guide called Odin, and other stuff as they explore Kal Torlin when it eventually shows up.

<h3>Slender Man slinking onto VR</h3>
<p>
And that's not the only blast from the past coming to VR; one-time horror phenomenon Slender Man is also being revived for virtual reality goggles in the form of Slender: The Arrival VR. It's a port of 2013's Slender: The Arrival - itself a "reimagining and expansion" of 2012 horror game Slender: The Eight Pages - and it's arriving on Meta Quest, PSVR 2, and PCVR this "spring".

<h3>More gameplay from Gorn 2</h3>
<p>
From a night in the woods to a spike in the butt, we're onto Gorn 2 - a "bigger, wilder, and stronger" sequel to 2019's comedic gladiator sim. There's talk of new weapons, new traps, and new supernatural power-ups as players challenge the five sons of the God of the Afterlife across the heavenly realms - which they'll be able to do when Gorn 2 comes to Meta Quest, PSVR 2, and PCVR later this year. And here's that new gameplay:
