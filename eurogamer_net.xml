            <p>Nintendo will reportedly launch its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> games in three phases.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-plans/">Insider Gaming</a>, the first phase will see <em>primarily </em>first party games released on the console's launch, which is believed to be June. This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-analysts-predict-400-price-and-biggest-console-launch-ever-in-june">console launch date ties in with what both analysts</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-coming-in-june-at-400-former-nintendo-employee-predicts">former Nintendo employee have predicted will be the case</a>.</p>

<p>The second phase of Nintendo's game launch plan is then reportedly set for around October-November, and will have a greater focus on third-party studios. Sources said these studios are expecting to get their hands on a Switch 2 dev kit in June.</p>
<p>The third and final phase will tie in with the holiday period, Insider Gaming reports. So, to me that's the end of November and then December. 
</p>
<p>Thankfully, there isn't too much longer to go until we hear something more concrete on Nintendo's Switch successor. A dedicated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">Nintendo Direct focused on the Switch 2 will take place on 2nd April</a>, where we'll presumably hear about the release date and price. And, just maybe, we will hear about more games coming to the console, so don't get your hopes up, but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>? Ooh, what about Silksong?! We surely must be getting an update on that soonâ€¦</p>
<p>Anyway, in the meantime while we wait for more, here's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">everything we know about Switch 2</a> so far.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
With <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> nudging toward its one-month anniversary, Capcom has whipped out another showcase, this one detailing the game's first free content update. And while we already had a pretty good idea what to expect thanks to earlier teases and reveals, we've now had the full run-down - including a confirmed 3rd April release on all platforms.
</p>
<p>
Starting with the monsters, Monster Hunter Wilds' Title Update 1 adds Mizutsune, first seen in 2015's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-generations">Monster Hunter Generations</a> and now back to rain bubbly mayhem on unsuspecting players. He'll be available at Hunter Rank 21 and above, and is unlocked by talking to Kanya in the forest. Mizutsune can be farmed to make new Hunter and Palico gear.
</p>
<p>
Players looking for a more significant challenge can also take on Monster Hunter Wilds' first arch-tempered beast - a variant of Rey Dau, who'll be available as part of a limited-time Event Quest running from 30th April to 21st May BST. Players will need to have reached Hunter Rank 50 or above to accept the quest, and can forge the Rey Day (gamma) and Felyne Rey Dau (gamma) armour by gathering sufficient materials.

<p>
Additionally, Title Update 1 introduces big boss Zoh Shia as a farmable monster with its own Hunter and Palico equipment to forge. In order to fight it again after completing story mode, players will need to accept a special quest available at Hunter Rank 50 and above - after which Zoh Shia can be accessed through the Environment Overview screen and during the Wyvern's Wakening in the Ruins of Wyveria.
</p>
<p>
And if you're looking for somewhere to relax inbetween all that hunting, there's some good news: Title Update 1 also brings a new social area known as The Grand Hub. This can be unlocked by talking to Tetsuzan in Suja, the Peaks of Accord Hunter, at Rank 16 and above, and provides players will a range of new activities to undertake in their downtime.
</p>
<p>
Alongside a variety of convenient local amenities, it features what appears to be a proper canteen for pre-hunt meals, alongside tables for arm wrestling and a new Barrel Bomb bowling mini-game. Players can unlock useful items and pendants by honing their bowling skills, although it does require Barrel Bowling Vouchers. These can be earned in various ways, Capcom notes, including through login bonuses. And as an added treat, players will occasionally find the so-called Diva offering her song of worship when they visit the hub at night, so they can settle back and enjoy the show.

<p>
Once players have unlocked The Grand Hub, the Squad Information Counter will relocate here from the Windward Plains, and it's also the place to find the Arena Counter for Monster Hunter Wilds' new Arena Quests. These see teams of no more than two players competing for the fastest times as they take on monsters using predetermined equipment. Title Update 1 also adds Challenge Quests and Free Challenge Quests - both available as limited-time Event Quests - that up to four players can tackle using any equipment in order to earn pendants and other rewards.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, The Grand Hub will serve as the focus for Monster Hunter Wilds' new seasonal events, starting with the Festival of Accord: Blossomdance on 23rd April. This celebration of spring sees The Grand Hub getting a bit of a makeover, alongside festival-specific meals, and various opportunities to obtain new equipment, pop-up camp decorations, gestures, and more.
</p>
<p>
That's it for the big Title Update 1 features, but Capcom still had a little more to share. Once the update arrives, it'll also be possible to change Alma's outfit (and, later, glasses) from the Appearance menu at camp. There'll be a free outfit included, and presuably more to purchase using real money from the Monster Hunter Wilds store. Speaking of which, players can grab a selection of free classic gestures in the store when Title Update 1 arrives, and the previously announced Cosmetic DLC Pack 1 will also be available to download by Premium Deluxe owners and Cosmetic DLC Pass holders. And still in the realm of paid cosmetics, there'll be new pendants to attach to your weapons, and new camp gear options to purchase - including a big old barbecue and giant stuffed bears to lounge around on.
</p>
<p>
To recap, Monster Hunter Wilds' Title Update 1 arrives next Friday, 3rd April. And looking further into the future, more Event Quests are promised - with rewards including a lovely flowing scarf - and a smaller update releases at the end of May. This'll introduce an unspecified collaboration with another Capcom game and "other additional features", including a list showing the endemic life you've captured. As for Title Update 2, that's coming this "summer" and, judging by Capcom's teaser trailer, will see the return of water leviathan Lagiacrus.
