            <p>The director of the upcoming Resident Evil film has assured fans of the series this adaptation will "rip", and admits to not actually seeing any of the previous movie attempts as "the games are [his] thing".</p>
<p>Zach Cregger - whose previous work includes 2022's Barbarian, which our Matt describes as "wonderfully unpredictable" - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-movie-reboot-snapped-up-by-sony-and-it-already-has-a-release-date">was first announced to be helming the next Resident Evil movie in March of this year</a>. Since then, the director has assured fans that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-resident-evil-film-will-be-unlike-any-of-the-previous-adaptations-says-director-as-euphoria-actor-eyed-for-starring-role">his adaptation will be "unlike any of the previous films" in the franchise</a>, which may not exactly be a bad thing.</p>

<p>Now, Cregger has shared a little bit more about what moviegoers can expect on the film's release, and it sounds like the director will be working with a deep knowledge of the source material.  "I love the games," Cregger told <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/resident-evil-reboot-movie-zach-cregger-tease-games/">Comic Book</a>. "I played all of the games. I played <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a> a hundred times through. I'm obsessed with it. And so, I just want to tell a story that feels like it's honouring the experience you get when you play the games."</p>
<p>Cregger added he hasn't "seen the movies", because "that's just not my thing". The game series, though, well "that's just a playground I just love," the director said. "I think the movie is going to rip. I think it's going to rip".</p>
<p>Cregger's latest comments on the Resident Evil film, which is set to star Euphoria actor Austin Abrams (pictured below), come as some plot points have leaked. <strong>This is your cue to head elsewhere if you want to keep your next Resident Evil cinema trip as spoiler-free as possible</strong>.</p>

</figure>
<p>According to internet tipster <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/residnet-evil-134395521">Daniel RPK</a>, Cregger is working from the following synopsis: "Bryan, a laid-back organ courier, is sent on a late-night delivery to Raccoon City General Hospital. En route through a snowy mountain road, he accidentally hits a strange woman with his car</p>
<p>"She survives - but something is very wrong. As he tries to help, Bryan stumbles into a full-blown outbreak involving horrifying tentacle-based mutations and bio-engineered monstrosities" (thanks, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/resident-evil-movie-plot-leak-zach-cregger-3229632/">Dexerto</a>).</p>
<p>Bryan is reportedly the character Abrams will play. In terms of the game series, the only Brian that comes to mind is corrupt RPD Chief Brian Irons (pictured below), who is an antagonist in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a>, but it doesn't sound like this is the same character. Unless this film will serve as some kind of prequel, backstory type set up for future adaptations, and change the spelling of Bryan's name.</p>
<p>Cregger's Resident Evil film is expected to be released on 18th September, 2026.</p>

<p>As for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>, we recently got news of the next mainline installment, known as Requiem. Anticipation for this release is already pretty high, as in June Capcom announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-already-looks-set-for-massive-success-as-it-hits-significant-wishlist-milestone">over a million of us had already added Resident Evil Requiem to our wishlists</a>.</p>
<p>We got our first look at Resident Evil Requiem last month, when Capcom <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-officially-unveiled-coming-february">introduced us all to Grace Ashcroft and a destroyed Raccoon City</a>. The developer once considered having Leon Kennedy take on the protagonist role for Requiem, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leon-kennedy-actually-quite-a-bad-match-for-horror-says-resident-evil-9s-director">in the end decided he was "actually quite a bad match for horror"</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/new-resident-evil-film-will-rip-director-says-as-plot-spoilers-leak]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, from Chinese developer Leenzee, has got off to a great start on Steam, following in the footsteps of the extraordinarily popular <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>.</p>
<p>The soulslike game has been out for a day, but has already racked up a peak concurrent player count of 114,132 (thanks <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2277560/charts/">SteamDB</a>). That's vastly more than the majority of the genre on Steam, including FromSoftware's own Dark Souls and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-ii">Dark Souls 2</a>.</p>
<p>The top soulslikes remain FromSoftware's work, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> peaking at 953k, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a> peaking at almost 130k, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sekiro-tips-and-tricks-6009">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a> peaking at 125k. Elden Ring multiplayer spin-off Nightreign released in May and has peaked at almost 314k.</p>

<p>Wuchang remains far behind Black Myth: Wukong, which has a huge peak concurrent player count of 2.4m as the second most played game ever on the platform.</p>
<p>Still, Wuchang is off to a great start as another successful action-RPG from a Chinese developer, though unlike Wukong it's firmly in soulslike territory.</p>
<p>However, despite the concurrent player count, Wuchang currently has a Mostly Negative rating, with players criticising its poor performance. Its use of Unreal Engine 5 is considered the cause of this.</p>
<p>"Another unstable UE5 title," reads one review, while others call the performance "abysmal" and "god-awful". I've been playing on PS5 and performance isn't optimal on that console either.</p>
<p>So far, the developer has yet to acknowledge any performance issues, or issue a patch.</p>
<p>From this launch, though, Wuchang is yet another Chinese-made action game to find success on Steam. Indeed, Valve released its Steam Hardware and Software Survey back in March which revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/50-of-all-steam-users-in-february-were-chinese-speaking">Chinese-speaking users accounted for 50 percent of Steam's playerbase</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-black-myth-wukong-has-changed-the-game-for-chinese-developers">Black Myth: Wukong has certainly proven big success is possible for Chinese developers</a>, and Wuchang is just one of many action-RPGs following in its wake.</p>
<p>"Familiarity stalks you at every turn in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, a competent, cool and pretty soulslike with a nice twist on death but few true surprises," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review">Wuchang review</a>.</p>

            <p>Nintendo is getting us all reminiscing about a time when mixtapes were the best way to share music, fluorescent pinks and greens were standard fashion choices, ET had a breakfast cereal and leotards were the ultimate workout attire. Yes, Nintendo has taken us back to the 80s this morning, with a trailer for its upcoming Lego Game Boy that recreates its famous 'Robot' commercial of 1989.</p>
<p>36 years ago, Nintendo released a trailer for its handheld gaming device, the Game Boy, which came complete with a sci-fi robot alien type chap and a denim clad youngster playing their consoles together on a dusty planet who knows where. It all came packaged with a wonderfully dramatic voiceover proclaiming we could now enjoy "all the power and excitement of Nintendo" in the palm of our hands. You can check it out below.</p>

<p>Anyway, fast forward to today, and we once again have a robot and young chap starring trailer complete with dramatic voice over and far off dusty planet, but this time for Nintendo's upcoming Lego Game Boy collaboration.</p>
<p>"They said, it wasn't possible," the trailer's voiceover begins, "but now, you can have all the power of the brick in your hand." Ah, it is glorious, as you can see for youself below. </p>

<p>As for the Lego model itself, it's a near 1:1 scale replica of the original Game Boy, with a D-pad, as well as A, B, Start, and Select buttons. The set also includes buildable Game Boy cartridges for two classic games - Super Mario Land and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/zelda-links-awakening">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</a> (they missed a trick not having Tetris, but hey ho).</p>
<p>Builders then have three options for what they choose to display on the Game Boy's screen. They can plump for either a Nintendo start screen, or gameplay images from the two included games.</p>
<p>The set comes with a total of 421 pieces. "Relive the thrill you felt when you first played on the Game Boy," Nintendo and Lego proclaim.</p>
<p>If you are interested in getting your hands on the Lego Game Boy, you can pre-order now. The <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/game-boy-72046">model costs £54.99 for those of us in the UK</a>, and will start shipping on 1st October.</p>
