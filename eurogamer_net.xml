            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> team has shared a new piece of artwork for the mobile game's 9th anniversary, hinting that a few familiar faces may be joining very soon.</p>
<p>This artwork reveals Paradox Pokémon - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-scarlet-violet-paradox-iron-valiant-roaring-moon-locations-9015">first appeared in  Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> - could well be heading to Pokémon Go. Paradox Pokémon are a special collection of Pokémon, and are either a futuristic or prehistoric version of a present day Pokémon. In the new artwork, we can see both Great Tusk (an Ancient Pokémon) and Iron Treads (a Future Pokémon).</p>

<p>In addition to these two, we can see a Mega Butterfree, another yet-to-be-released Pokémon for PoGo. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-gen-6-list-x-y-kalos-region-7002">steel/ghost type Pokémon Aegislash is also in the artwork</a>, and will be arriving with the Steel and Scales event this month.</p>
<p>In addition to potential and confirmed upcoming Pokémon, it also looks like a new feature will be coming to PoGo. This is based on the character towards the left-hand side of the anniversary artwork, who is getting a thumbs up from a wrist communicator. <a href="https://x.com/ThatMonadoBoy/status/1941996071514763526">Some have suggested remote trading</a>, but it remains to be seen for now. Any thoughts?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the inclusion of Zygarde 50 percent Forme may well be hinting at a future Route / Zygarde event. Hopefully the Pokémon Go team will reveal all soon, stay tuned!</p>

            <p>
Last week, Stop Killing Games - the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">consumer-driven initiative</a> demanding games publishers leave their titles in a playable state once support is terminated - surpassed 1m signatures. But now, EU industry body Video Games Europe - which represents the likes of Ubisoft, Take-Two, Warner Bros., Riot Games, Activision Blizzard, Microsoft, and Nintendo - has weighed in, insisting the initiative's proposals would make games "prohibitively expensive to create".
</p>
<p>
Stop Killing Games was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-aims-to-mount-political-and-legal-challenges-to-games-going-offline">launched last April by Accursed Farms YouTuber Ross Scott</a>, calling upon video game fans around the world to petition their local governments regarding the increasingly common occurrence of purchased games becoming unplayable due to publisher actions. The games preservation movement was prompted by Ubisoft's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">shut down open-world racer The Crew's servers last March</a>, preventing access to both its multiplayer and single-player content due to its always-online nature. More controversy followed shortly after, when the publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown">began revoking customers' licenses to the game,</a> permanently removing it from their libraries and preventing hopes of resurrecting it through private servers.
</p>
<p>
After a year of campaigning and with an official deadline looming, last week finally saw Stop Killing Games' European petition surpass the 1m signatures needed for it to be submitted to the EU for verification and then, potentially, either progress to a public hearing or full debate session at the European Parliament. However, as that milestone was reached, organiser Scott <a href="https://x.com/accursedfarms/status/1940798871678210158">warned many of those signatures could be invalid</a> due to mistakes or deliberate spoofing (a practice he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmkCQJrc9n4">later noted</a> was illegal on official government petitions such as this), suggesting the real tally was likely around 600–700k genuine signatures. As such, he encouraged EU citizens to continue signing it legitimately before the deadline to ensure it passes the approval process.
</p>
<p>
Yet while the exact number of legitimate petition signatures remains unclear at present, it seems the threat of its success - and a potential parliamentary hearing - has spooked video games publishers enough to spur them into action. A statement from industry body and lobbying group Video Games Europe, which represents over 30 major publishers and national trade associations around Europe, has now been <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/news/statement-on-stop-killing-games/">shared on its website</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We appreciate the passion of our community," it reads. "However, the decision to discontinue online services is multi-faceted, never taken lightly and must be an option for companies when an online experience is no longer commercially viable. We understand that it can be disappointing for players but, when it does happen, the industry ensures that players are given fair notice of the prospective changes in compliance with local consumer protection laws."
</p>
<p>
"Private servers are not always a viable alternative option for players," it continues, "as the protections we put in place to secure players' data, remove illegal content, and combat unsafe community content would not exist and would leave rights holders liable. In addition, many titles are designed from the ground-up to be online-only; in effect, these proposals would curtail developer choice by making these video games prohibitively expensive to create.
</p>
<p>
"We welcome the opportunity to discuss our position with policy makers and those who have led the European Citizens Initiative in the coming months."
</p>
<p>
Stop Killing Games organiser Scott <a href="https://x.com/accursedfarms/status/1941562023973883972">shared a brief response to Video Games Europe's statement on social media</a>, calling its arguments against allowing customers to keep their purchases "flimsy". Scott added he'd provide a more lengthy video response soon.
</p>
<p>
Away from Stop Killing Games' EU activities, the initiative's <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074">official UK petition</a> has now surpassed over 150K signatures. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/favourite-game-no-longer-playable-uk-government-says-it-wont-tighten-rules-to-punish-publishers-who-switch-off-servers">previous government response</a>, mandatory for any parliamentary petition that surpasses 10K signatures, said: "There are no plans to amend UK consumer law on disabling video games". However, having now passed the 100K signatures threshold, the petition must now be considered for a debate in parliament.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The writer and producer of sci-fi anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners said he doesn't want to write a jolly story for the series, because "when people are sad", it makes him "a bit happy".</p>
<p>Edgerunners is an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-edgerunners-shows-cd-projekts-cyberpunk-is-still-worth-fighting-for">animated spin-off of CD Projekt Red's Cyberpunk 2077</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-cyberpunk-2077-anime-edgerunners-arrives-13th-september">first debuted in 2022</a>. Following acclaim, a second season is now in production for Netflix. </p><p>

News of this next season arrived during Anime Expo, along with a new trailer. "Night City lives on," reads the official blurb. You can check out the trailer below.

<p>At the same event, a Cyberpunk: Edgerunners panel was held, where writer Bartosz Sztybor was asked about the human stories told within Edgerunners' dystopian world. Here, the show's writer replied that this type of narrative is incredibly important for CDPR, and the team always wants to "write stories that are character driven".</p>
<p>Sztybor then elaborated on this point further stating: "But the other thing is that we are a company from Poland. I'm from Poland and people in Poland are sad. They are born sad, they die sad, so I just wanted to make the whole world sad." This was met with plenty of laughter from his audience.</p>
<p>When asked if he had ever considered changing things up a bit, and perhaps offering up some joyful story lines, Sztybor replied, "no", with the panel's host joking the writer liked to feast on others' misery.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for the second season of Edgerunners yet, with the team merely saying it will arrive on Netflix when it is ready. We do know, though, that it will comprise 10 episodes, and feature a standalone story within the world of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>The Edgerunners team promise "a raw chronicle of redemption and revenge" on the second season's debut. "In a city that thrives in the spotlight of violence, one question remains: when the world is blinded by spectacle, what extremes do you have to go to make your story matter," the blurb teases.</p>
<p>As for Cyberpunk 2077 itself, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">it is now available on Switch 2</a>. Our pals at Digital Foundry have taken the game out for a spin on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> already, asking the question: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-can-the-new-nintendo-console-handle-it">Can the new Nintendo console handle it?</a></p>
<p>In addition, the team at CDPR are currently cooking up another update for Cyberpunk 2077, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-new-update-will-have-scope-similar-to-22-as-cd-projekt-announces-delay">which will have "scope similar" to 2.2</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/when-people-are-sad-im-a-bit-happy-cyberpunk-edgerunners-season-two-is-going-to-be-sadder-bloodier-and-darker]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has released a special movie to celebrate the 25th anniversary of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a>, but fans are still left wondering what's going on with the rumoured remake.</p>
<p>The movie is just a minute long, and is essentially a highlights reel from the game's FMV sequences, edited over a new recording of the game's iconic theme song Melodies of Life.</p>
<p>The video follows a number of other small releases in the run up to the anniversary. Back in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/official-final-fantasy-9-25th-anniversary-website-ignites-remake-hopes-once-again">Square Enix launched a 25th anniversary website</a> for the game that's slowly been updated with new artwork in celebration of the game's Japanese release on 7th July 2000 (it was released in the UK a year later in 2001).</p>

<p>New merchandise has also been released, and - perhaps most interestingly - a <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th_news/5605">new prequel picture book has been released</a> from the game's event designer Kazuhiko Aoki and character designer Toshiyuki Itahana. It details how adorable black mage Vivi got his name - I won't spoil anything here.</p>
<p>So where, then, is the rumoured remake?</p>
<p>The rumour began back in 2021, as part of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nvidia-acknowledges-leaked-pc-game-list-including-god-of-war-and-final-fantasy-7-remake">infamous Nvidia leak</a> which included a number of unreleased and unannounced Square Enix games. The leak has proven to be accurate so far, following the likes of the Chrono Cross remaster, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-is-real">recently revealed Final Fantasy Tactics remaster</a>. The Final Fantasy 9 remake is now the only remaining officially unannounced Final Fantasy game from the leak.</p>
<p>As on the anniversary website, a <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th_news/5481">new vinyl subtitled Timeless Tales</a> is due for release later this week on 9th July - some fans believe this may be the name of the remake itself too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>'s latest expansion, Dawntrail, also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-patch-72-due-end-of-march-with-even-more-final-fantasy-9-references">heavily references Final Fantasy 9</a>. This could be coincidence considering the MMORPG regularly references past games, but its director and producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> has denied remaking Final Fantasy 9.</p>
<p>With this 25th anniversary, Square Enix seems to be really pushing Final Fantasy 9. The company announced earlier this year the game had sold 8.9m units worldwide, but this is less than many others in the series, not only including renowned favourite Final Fantasy 7 and the widely released Final Fantasy 15, but also Final Fantasy 8 and 10 - the two games either side of FF9. Where was Final Fantasy 8's big 25th anniversary?</p>
<p>Released late in the PS1's lifecycle, Final Fantasy 9 launched a year after Final Fantasy 8, which proved popular for its realistic graphical style, and a year before Final Fantasy 10 on the more powerful PS2. Though critically well-received, Final Fantasy 9 hasn't always been the most popular of the series.</p>
<p>Still, a remake of the game would be great timing for Square Enix. The game's original PS1 release was seen as a callback to the origins of the series, with its more medieval setting and cartoonish art style. A remake release now - if it stayed true to the original - would parallel this callback at a time Square Enix needs it most.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">Final Fantasy 7 Remake series</a> has proven divisive in its approach to a remake, despite some welcome modernisation, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-has-me-questioning-the-essence-of-the-series">Final Fantasy 16</a> was exemplary for some fans of Square Enix's decision to move further into action game territory.</p>
<p>A remake of Final Fantasy 9 would return the company to its turn-based roots and bring newer fans into the series with a classic remake. But at this point, Square Enix is just leaving us waiting.</p>
<p>If you're yet to play Final Fantasy 9, a remaster is already available across PC, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and mobile.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-celebrates-final-fantasy-9s-25th-anniversary-so-wheres-the-rumoured-remake]]></content:encoded>

<p>"I think Game Pass is an unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade, subsidised by [Microsoft's] 'infinite money', but at some point reality has to hit," Colantonio, whose works include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> and Prey, wrote on social media.</p>
<p>"I don't think [Game Pass] can co-exist with other models, they'll either kill everyone else, or give up."</p>
<p>Colantonio's observations were spotted by Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who said the "most vocal concern" from within his own network was: "What happens when all that money runs out?"</p>
<p>Douse said this was "one of the main economic reasons people I know haven't shifted to its business model", stating "the infinite money thing never made any sense". In response, Colantonio said he agreed with Douse, adding: "I'm fed up with all the bs they fed us at first like 'don't worry, it doesn't impact the sales', only to admit years later that it totally does."</p>
<p>The duo spoke about the "cannibalisation" of sales, with Douse stating that he recognised that for "smaller teams with new or riskier" titles, getting their game onto Game Pass does help minimise a certain level of risk. However, he personally favours "Sony's 'lifecycle management'" way of doing things.</p>
<p>"Yeah, the only way [Game Pass] can co-exist without hurting everyone is for the back catalogue," <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1941517481463701744">Colantonio replied</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1942054157566795931">separate exchange</a> following his initial post, Colantonio said he could appreciate why gamers like Microsoft's subscription model, calling it a "great deal" for consumers. However, "the maths don't work for [Game Pass], it only works because [Microsoft] injects billions into it to make it a good deal for the players... for now".</p>
<p>The Arkane Studios founder closed: "That's only my opinion, I'm respectful, be respectful."</p>
