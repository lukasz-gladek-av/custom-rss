<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> is almost upon us (and in some territories, <em>actually</em> upon us), and with its arrival comes Nintendo's much-touted day one update. We already knew it was an important one, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-reportedly-already-out-in-the-wild-but-needs-a-day-one-update-to-function">unlocking a significant amount of the console's basic functionality</a>, but Nintendo's patch notes make it clear you won't be doing much of anything right out of the box on launch day without it.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/au/support/articles/system-update-information-for-nintendo-switch-2/">20.1.1 patch</a> is available to download now (not especially useful in the UK at the moment, of course), and opens up a whole raft of fairly fundamental features you otherwise won't have access to, including the ability to play a substantial number of games.
</p>
<p>
Once installed, your inert electronic Nintendo lump will be positively transformed, now capable of running Switch software, accessing Switch Online features including Game Chat, opening Nintendo's eShop, and more. Notably, the update is also required to use MicroSD Express cards and to run <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-physical-releases-will-just-have-a-download-key-on-the-card">Switch 2 software shipped on game-key cards</a> - which seems to be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-most-switch-2-third-party-physical-releases-dont-have-the-game-on-the-card">vast majority of third-party physical releases</a> right now.
</p>
<p>
You'll be prompted to install the update as part of Switch 2's set-up process, otherwise you'll later see the prompt when trying to access any of the features it's used for. Nintendo hasn't explicitly revealed its download size, but early word suggests it's pretty svelt - you might just be able to fit in a cuppa while you wait, though, if you turn the kettle on quick. Patch notes!
</p>
<p><em><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 Version 20.1.1</h3>
<p>The following features have been added:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of compatible Nintendo Switch software</li>

<li>Nintendo Switch App on a smart device is needed to view and download screenshots and videos uploaded to the server</li>
<li>Linking to a Nintendo Account is required for network features, with some exceptions.</li>
<li>Updating to version 20.1.1 is required to use Nintendo Switch 2 game-key cards.</li>
<li>Updating to version 20.1.1 is required to use a microSD Express card.</li>
</ul></em></p><p>

Will Switch 2's 20.1.1 update turn Nintendo's latest console into a must-have machine? It'll be a little while before Eurogamer's ready to share our final verdict, but you can at least read our review of Nintendo's <em>other</em> controversial, expensive handheld until then. As for the machine's launch day games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-a-couple-of-hours-mario-kart-worlds-open-world-left-me-slightly-underwhelmed-but-is-there-more-to-it">Mario Kart World left Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell wondering if there might be more to see</a> after some underwhelming first impressions, while Welcome Tour, conversely, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/welcome-tour-is-the-switch-2s-welcome-surprise-and-might-even-be-worth-your-8-quid">proven to be an unexpectedly welcome surprise</a>. Even if it does cost Â£8.
