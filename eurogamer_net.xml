Sony has announced it's very nearly time to bid a fond farewell to those PS5 themes it released in celebration of PlayStation's 30th anniversary last year. But the good news is it has plans to bring them back following a "fantastic response" from players.
</p>
<p>
Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-playstation-30th-anniversary-ps5-update-turns-your-console-retro-for-a-limited-time">released a number nostalgia-laden PS5 themes</a> last December, featuring visuals and sounds intended to evoke memories of different console eras. There was one for PlayStation 1, PS2, PS3, and PS4, plus a theme more broadly celebrating the PlayStation brand's big three-oh.
</p>
<p>
The party, however, is almost over, with Sony having now confirmed all its limited-time anniversary themes will cease to be available from Friday, 31st January. Announcing the news on social media, it thanked fans for the "fantastic response" to the themes.

<p>
In fact, the response appears to have been good enough that Sony's had a bit of change of heart regarding the classic console themes' temporary nature. It also revealed it'll be making the designs available again "in the months ahead", just as soon as it's finished "doing some work behind the scenes" to bring them back.
</p><p>
Alongside those retro themes, PlayStation's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-30th-anniversary-celebrations-include-digital-soundtracks-and-a-board-game">30th anniversary celebrations</a> also saw the release of some strikingly designed, PS1-inspired <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-and-digital-edition-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-consoles-announced">limited edition PS5s</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-to-release-free-to-play-my-first-gran-turismo-to-celebrate-playstations-30th-anniversary?view=comments">free-to-play version of Grand Turismo</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-death-stranding-and-the-last-of-us-star-in-playstations-nostalgia-fuelled-30th-anniversary-thank-you-video">nostalgia-heavy thank-you video</a>. Eurogamer also got in the celebratory mood with our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-30th-anniversary">PlayStation 30th anniversary theme week</a>, which is well worth a browse.

Amibitious romance sim Date Everything! will no longer launch on the romantic release date of 14th February, its developer has announced.
</p>
<p>
Instead, the indie couple-up sandbox is now set to arrive four months later - sometime in June.
</p>
<p>
"I was too confident that we could properly test all the wild amounto of content and pathing that exists in this massive game," lead designer Ray Chase said in a statement today, "and unfortunately we ran out of time on our current (and yet so appropriate) release date.

<p>
"Our bug list is finally starting to dwindle down as QA gets through the labyrinthine story pathing, but to submit our game in this state with so many outstanding glitches would be doing you a disservice."
</p>
<p>
In keeping with the game's claim to let you date everything, Chase mentioned that "you actually can date the glitches" - though exactly how this will work remains to be seen.
</p>
<p>
This is not the first delay for Date Everything!, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-in-todays-nintendo-direct-and-indie-world-showcases">once set to arrive back in October 2024</a>.
</p>
<p>
When it's finally here, you'll be able to meet and romantically greet around 100 characters, including anthropomophic versions of furniture such as bookcases and lamps, voiced by a cascade of familiar actors including Roger Craig Smith, Ashley Johnson and Neil Newbon. And yes, Henry the Hoover is also included.
</p>
<p>
Date Everything! is published by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/team17-parent-company-announces-name-change-but-the-worms-developers-brand-will-still-live-on">Team17, which last week announced a name change</a> - even though the veteran brand will still live on.
