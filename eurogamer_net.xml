<p>Nioh 3 has proved popular since its debut. On its first weekend in the wild, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-3-reaches-almost-90000-concurrent-players-on-pc-after-launch-over-doubling-series-record">game welcomed just shy of 90,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>. As our Connor reported at the time, this was <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1325200/charts/">over double what Nioh 2 achieved on the same platform</a>, and <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/485510/charts/">eight times what the original Nioh managed</a>.</p><p>"It feels as though the series, after three iterations, has finally refined its formula to the point of excellence: like the shogun it so reveres, it has taken the roots of what has come before, paid homage to its legacy, and deigned to build something even more powerful - something even more enduring - on those foundations," our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-3-review">Dom wrote in Eurogamer's Nioh 3 review</a>.</p>
<p>"Enjoy the brutality, revel in the power fantasy, and let yourself be hammered into the ground by the blunt-force trauma of a world dedicated to seeing everything in terms of absolutes."</p>
