            <p>Controversial and violent shooter Ready or Not has now sold over 13m copies across platforms.</p>
<p>In a press release, developer Void Interactive added that its game - which was released on both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in July of this year, following a spell of PC exclusivity - has sold over 3m copies on consoles. That means <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ready-or-not-hits-1m-console-sales-in-4-days-despite-censorship-claims-from-its-pc-players">Ready or Not has sold over 2m copies on consoles in under two months</a>.</p>

<p>Ready or Not initially released in early access back in 2021, and soon after this Void Interactive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/swat-game-loses-publisher-following-school-shooting-comments">said it had parted ways with publisher Team17</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Void Interactive said that Ready or Not's console port needed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ready-or-not-adjusts-in-game-violence-and-nudity-on-pc-to-secure-ps5-and-xbox-release">changes "as absolutely required by our first party partners"</a> before it could be released on Xbox and PlayStation. This included tweaks to dismemberment and gore, nudity, mistreatment of children, and "explicit representations of violence". This move ignited a certain amount of backlash from the game's community, with some leaving negative Steam reviews citing "content censorship".</p>
<p>Void Interactive sought to quell these concerns soon after, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ready-or-not-developer-seeks-to-alleviate-censorship-concerns-following-community-outcry">stating it had seen "misconceptions and misinformation circulating around the scope of these changes"</a>.</p>
