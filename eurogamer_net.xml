            <p>Valve has confirmed all the Steam sale and Fest dates for 2025.</p>
<p>In a new blog post, Valve detailed the events it's expecting to run over the course of this year, helping both players and developers "plan their overall participation for the year".</p>

<p>"Each year, we plan out a bunch of themed sale events (Fests) that center around a rotating category of games, and we know that announcing those dates ahead of time is helpful to developers planning their overall participation for the year," Valve explained.</p>
<p>"This is especially true given that we sprinkle them throughout a year already marked with each of our four seasonal sales and three Next Fests!</p>
<p>"We announced the schedule for the first half of 2025 last summer, and are now sharing the themed Fests and their dates planned for the second half."</p>
<p>Here's the full list:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Developers are invited to register their games for the events, as well as the digital store's legendary seasonable sales, which take place four times a year.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-bans-all-steam-games-that-force-players-to-watch-advertisements">Valve re-emphasised its rules around advertising, explicitly prohibiting games that force players to watch in-game ads</a>.</p>
<p>The rules confirmed that whilst cross-promotion and product placement are permitted, games that force players to watch or engage with advertising in order to play are not. Nor should developers use advertising as a "way to provide value to players, such as giving players a reward for watching or engaging with advertising in their game".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We first got word of Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time during a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-1">Nintendo Direct in February 2023</a>. At the time of its announcement, the game was set to release in 2023, but it later saw its launch nudged back.</p>
<p>We got a subsequent look at Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time in February last year, along with a peek <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">at the various jobs players</a> will be able to undertake in this time travelling adventure.</p>
<p>Away from Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/professor-laytons-new-adventure-turns-him-into-lukes-protege">Level-5 also has a new Professor Layton game in the pipeline</a>. It's known as New World of Steam and will place the Professor as something of a newcomer himself, in a story which moves the series' action to America.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
