            <p>Popular life sim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">InZoi</a>, already released on PC, has been confirmed for release on PlayStation 5 during the first half of 2026. While PS5 players keen for more life sim options are in luck, Xbox owners need to wait to see if the game will arrive on their consoles. Publisher Krafton has stated that an Xbox release of InZoi is "under consideration."</p>
<p>For console players worried about how InZoi will work outside of the PC space, Krafton has stated that the console version will be full-featured and be optimised for consoles. Given the game is some way from release we'll need to be patient to see if these claims are backed up.</p>
<p>InZoi raced to 1 million players on PC within one week of the game's release on Steam in March.</p>
<p>Aside from announcing plans to consider the game for Xbox, InZoi is also releasing on Mac on 20th August. On Mac players will need Apple silicon Macs with an M2 chip or newer and 16GB or more of unified memory.</p>
<p>We felt <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-25-years-of-the-sims-could-inzoi-be-about-to-steal-its-crown">InZoi had potential</a> to be a big player in the life sim market when we played the game back at release, although it was far from the complete package.</p>
