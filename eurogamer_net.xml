            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>'s next patch, 7.2, will be called Seekers of Eternity and will be released at the end of March.</p>
<p>The news was shared as part of the latest Letter from the Producer livestream, along with artwork for the patch.</p>
<p>It will feature a new character, though her identity has been left a mystery for now beyond featuring in the new artwork.</p>

<p>As with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-patch-71-crossroads-is-coming-in-november">previous patch 7.1</a> released in November (Crossroads), Seekers of Eternity will continue the main story after the events of Dawntrail. Eventually these will lead to the presumed next expansion.</p>

</figure>
<p>As part of that story continuation, a new dungeon will be included in this patch called The Underkeep, which - like the story of Dawntrail - appears to take clear inspiration from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a>'s Alexandria. A new Trial called Recollection against a Beatrix-esque cyborg will also be added.</p>

<figcaption>Is that a robot Beatrix?! | <span>Image credit: <cite>Square Enix</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Other additions in this patch include more Hildibrand Adventures, new Cornservant side quests, new Allied Society quests with the Mamool Ja, and a return of the PvP mode Frontline (Secure). The Arcadion will also continue with the Cruiserweight tier, while the Duty Support system will be extended to The Sunken Temple of Qarn.</p>
<p>Further, we've finally received further details on the forthcoming Cosmic Exploration mode.</p>
<p>This new activity is designed for crafters and gatherers as players explore stars, with new stars added in each major patch of the 7.x series. Players will "nurture the development of planets by completing missions and events as a community", including building a base of operations.</p>
<p>Not much more is known yet, though more details will follow in the next livestream. It's clearly meant as a mirror to the Island Sanctuary farming mode from the previous expansion, with a bucolic setting swapped for a sci-fi aesthetic and a new experience aimed more at communal play than solo play.</p>

<figcaption>Your base of operations in Cosmic Exploration | <span>Image credit: <cite>Square Enix</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another addition will be the Occult Crescent field operation, an island shrouded in mystery where players can explore its unmapped terrain and battle against its inhabitants. Players will join forces in small skirmishes against monsters, as well as larger boss battles, with this area also providing a new method of weapon enhancement.</p>
<p>To enter the Occult Crescent players must be level 100, but interestingly it's introducing Phantom Jobs: essentially a secondary Job with additional support actions and traits. These Phantom Jobs include Monk, Bard, Geomancer, Ranger, Berserker, Time Mage, Chemist, and Cannoneer. These will be familiar to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-v">Final Fantasy 5</a> players and its Job system, and while the team wants to implement new Jobs in the next expansion, these Phantom Jobs allowed them to introduce Jobs that may not fit with the game otherwise.</p>

            <p>Blizzard has shared a first look at the housing system it's adding to MMORPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>, but not without a dig at its main rival <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>.</p>
<p>Though it's still without a release date, the system has been five years in the making and was first revealed at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-in-the-making-world-of-warcrafts-player-housing-the-most-ambitious-expansion-feature-ever-says-blizzard">last year's Warcraft 30th anniversary celebration in November</a>.</p>
<p>Blizzard's main aims for housing are to offer "boundless self-expression", for the system to be "deeply social", and to have a "long-last journey". As such, the toolset will be easy to use, can be experienced solo but is more fun with other players, and will be an evergreen addition to the game with its own roadmap of patches and expansions.</p>

<figcaption>Housing Teaser | World of Warcraft<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXHFrLX6A4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The developer also wants housing to be widely adopted by players. "Most players should want a house in Azeroth, and if a player wants a house in Azeroth, they can have a house in Azeroth," reads this <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24176592">new post on the system</a>.</p>
<p>And that's the first of multiple not-so-subtle digs at Final Fantasy 14. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s MMORPG has had an equivalent housing system for some time, but it's been a notorious point of frustration for players.</p>
<p>Despite changes, players must enter a lottery to purchase one of the popular plots. And even on owned plots, players must enter their house at least once every 45 days to maintain it or it's lost. That means continuing to pay the game's subscription.</p>
<p>"If you want a house, you can have a house," reads the blog post. "No exorbitant requirements or high purchase costs, no lotteries, and no onerous upkeep (and if your subscription lapses, don't worry, your house doesn't get repossessed!)."</p>
<p>It's a cheeky note, but it's also great to see Blizzard learning from its key rival, as both games have long been in competition for players. While World of Warcraft has been praised for its intuitive menus and ease of use, Final Fantasy 14 excels for its story and friendly community.</p>
<p>Executive producer and vice president for World of Warcraft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-says-its-time-to-make-a-bold-statement-with-world-of-warcraft">Holly Longdale spoke to Eurogamer last year</a>, stating it's "time to make a bold statement, it's time to set ourselves up for the next twenty-plus [years]."</p>
<p>Housing is part of that process. The new post details two housing zones, one for Alliance and one for Horde, to promote interaction between players and ensure the zones work as intended. The system is also intended to be "player-first and not revenue-first", though a small number of items will be available in the cash shop (comparable to transmogs and pets).</p>
<p>Houses will also be organised into around 50 plot Neighbourhoods, which will be either public or private, in which players can share rewards.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcraft-getting-customisable-cars-player-housing-and-classic-classics-launching-soon">World of Warcraft's next expansion will be Midnight</a>, which will continue the Worldsoul Saga later this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Civilization 7 players say they can hear coughing and grunting while browsing the game's Age Transition screen - and now publisher 2K has acknowledged the issue. 
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1ij1clt/you_can_hear_a_person_coughing_and_typing_on_a/">lengthy reddit thread discussing the problem</a> includes examples of strange audio clips that players have recorded - and yes, you can clearly hear something going on in the background, behind the Age Transition menu's soaring orchestral music. 
</p>
<p>
"I thought maybe I'd left a stream on or was somehow in a Discord call," one player reported, "but I double-checked and no. You can really hear a person clearing their throat and coughing throughout the music. I'm not sure how this is even possible but it's kind of hilarious if you ask me."
</p>
<p>
Other examples uploaded to YouTube include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/clip/Ugkxa4lknNnwAGn-x5jMADoovq8ix8SxiSbn">snippets of characters grunting</a>, or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeYvr1q4Ev8&amp;ab_channel=HansAnonymous">sounds of swordfighting</a>.

<p>But rather than the game's actual music track being taped over by someone with a sore throat, 2K has said a more benign reason is likely to blame.</p>
<p>
"During an Age Transition, players might hear strange noises," a 2K spokesperson confirmed, in a <a href="https://support.civilization.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/38315115956371-Audio-from-the-Main-Menu-plays-during-Age-Transition">post on the official Civilization support site</a>. "This is likely due to the audio from the Main Menu being played over Age Transition screens.
</p>
<p>
"This means you may hear short voice lines, shuffling around, and general idle noises while on the Age Transition menu."
</p>
<p>
Other players report hearing audio from the leader they're playing as looping in the background, including mumbling and clothes rustling.
</p>
<p>
Earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firaxis-acknowledges-civilization-7-issues-fixes-incoming">Firaxis issued a blog post acknowledging Civilization 7's mixed response from players so far</a>, and pledging a raft of updates designed to address key community-requested changes and features. 
</p>
<p>
These will include improvements to UI interactions and map readability, as well as adding Teams to multiplayer games and adding in hotseat multiplayer.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review">Eurogamer's Civilization 7 review</a> described it as "a competent entry with some poorly executed ideas and a striking lack of personality".

<p>It seems few areas of the company are unscathed, with job losses reported across esports, community, design, QA, marketing, and UI/UX.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately the UI/UX team was impacted by the Hi-Rez layoffs today - myself included," said UI/UX designer, Amanda.</p>
<p>"It has been an amazing journey to go from fan of a game to creating content for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/smite">Smite</a> and Paladins. I have had the honour of working with some immensely talented humans!"</p>
<p>These cuts come on top of a similar round of cuts back in October, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/smite-2-studio-hi-rez-lays-off-undisclosed-number-of-employees">Hi-Rez announced it was laying off an undisclosed number of employees</a> in order to "ensure [the company's] long-term success".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
