Larian has bid a final farewell to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, its beloved breakout hit that won a legion of fans and propelled the studio to a new level of stardom.
</p>
<p>
Today, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-last-ever-major-update-gets-a-long-awaited-release-date">previously announced, marks the release of Patch 8</a> - the game's final content update. This adds PC, Mac, PlayStation and Xbox crossplay, a photo mode, a dozen more subclasses, plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-patch-8-adds-long-awaited-split-screen-co-op-for-xbox-series-s">the long-awaited arrival of Xbox Series S split-screen multiplayer</a>.
</p>
<p>
Larian has marked the patch's launch today in a fresh <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/the-final-patch-new-subclasses-photo-mode-and-cross-play_138">blog post</a>, which also includes a final animated short featuring the Baldur's Gate 3 cast going on one last adventure. There's even a special fourth wall-breaking cameo from Larian's own head honcho Swen Vincke, dressed in his suit of armour.

"You've helped us make BG3 a bigger success than any of us could've ever hoped for," Larian's blog post reads, "and that passion could keep us tweaking things and making changes until the end of time. But then we'd never be able to create something new. 
</p>
<p>
"As Swen said during the Baldur's Gate 3 retrospective panel at PAX West in August of last year, it's time for the team to go back to our cave and hang the armour on the wall while we focus on bringing you our next project."
</p>
<p>
What is Larian's next project? All we know officially is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">the game will be unrelated to Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>, something "big and ambitious" and "new in the sense that it is different from the things we've done before".
</p>
<p>
What about a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> 4, then? Well, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wizards-of-the-coast-now-talking-to-lots-of-partners-about-next-baldurs-gate">D&amp;D owner Wizards of the Coast has said we may still get one of those too from another developer</a>, though it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-wants-baldurs-gate-4-but-isnt-in-a-hurry">wasn't "in a hurry" to rush it out</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> has been delayed slightly to implement last minute changes from beta testers.</p>
<p>Back in February, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-gets-steam-release-date-plus-character-creator-and-benchmark-tool-in-advance">Funcom announced a release date of 20th May on Steam</a>. That's now been pushed back to 10th June (with earlier access for pre-orders on 5th June).</p>
<p>In a statement on social media, Funcom explained a major preview beta has been initiated in addition to the game's ongoing Persistent Closed Beta that's provided "invaluable" feedback to ensure the studio can "launch a quality game".</p>

<p>"Thanks to this process, we've concluded that with a bit more time to cook, we can act on a lot more of the feedback we know is important to our beta testers," the statement reads.</p>
<p>"This is not a decision we take lightly, we know everyone is very excited to get playing, but these three extra weeks will give us the time needed to make improvements that will lead to a better gameplay experience from day one."</p>
<p>As a result of the delay, Funcom will launch a large-scale beta weekend next month, with more information expected soon.</p>
<p>"Dune: Awakening is a <em>beast </em>of a game," the studio said. "This is multiplayer survival on a massive scale, and we're making gameplay and technical strides not seen in the genre before. We want to make sure we stick the landing."</p>

</span></p><p>There's no mention in the statement of the game's console release on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, which is expected to follow PC.</p>
<p>Before May was originally confirmed, the game had an "early 2025" release date. The game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakenings-early-2025-release-date-is-looser-than-you-might-think">executive producer Scott Junior told Eurogamer</a>: "I guess it depends how you define early. It could be the first half of '25 - that could be 'early'. So I'll leave it there. It could be the first half of 2025."</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Bertie Purchese came away impressed after going <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-proves-mmos-can-still-be-interesting-and-try-new-things">hands-on with Dune: Awakening</a> at the start of the year, writing: "You can live out your Dune fantasy in the most faithful recreation of Arrakis we've yet seen in a game, pausing as the ground shudders from a nearby sandworm, ducking for cover as a sandstorm blows in, and searching crevices for the secrets of the world hidden within. Dune: Awakening has promise - keep an eye on this one."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
