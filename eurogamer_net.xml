            <p>Capcom has revealed new in-game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> loading screen art for Kimberly which will be given to all players as part of a recent community art contest.</p>
<p>This piece comes as a replacement for a former entry, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-6-art-contest-rocked-by-ai-controversy-disqualification-issued">which was disqualified following allegations of AI use</a>. According to the terms and conditions of the art contest, all work submitted must be entirely original, and as such the suspected AI use broke the rules.</p>
<p>Alongside the new art reveal comes the following statement from Capcom: "The Street Fighter 6 development team has completed the previously announced replacement for Kimberly's new challenger screen. The illustration is based on her swimsuit Outfit 4, which has been earning rave reviews from the community."</p>

It's not just the Kimberly piece players will be able to use. <a href="https://www.streetfighter.com/6/contents/2ndanniv_contest/en-us/">Taking a look at the art contest website</a>, a selection of winning entries are displayed alongside the artist who created them. All of these - representing a wide spread of playable characters - will soon be popping up in your online matches.

</p><p>These art pieces will all be free, and delivered to all Street Fighter 6 players in short order. It's a nice end to a bit of controversy, with the contest remaining a celebration of the creative talents of Street Fighter players. You love to see it.</p>

            <p>
A new major update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> has been unveiled, which will finally take the battle to the home of Super Earth's enemies.
</p>
<p>
Into the Unjust will see players explore the Hive Worlds behind the Gloom, to the home of the insect-like Terminids. That means battling through an underground labyrinth of cave tunnels without Super Destroyer support from the skies.
</p>
<p>
News of the update arrives on the same day Helldivers 2 releases on Xbox Series X/S. Into the Unjust will arrive on 2nd September.

<p>
The update will bring a whole bunch of new enemy types, as well as new mission types. Players will need to locate and destroy the Hive Lung in the tunnels to stem the spread of the Gloom, as well as escorting a mobile oil rig across treacherous terrain.
</p>
<p>
The update will also arrive with a new Dust Devils premium Warbond. This will include a primary weapon, a new throwable, and three unique strategems, in addition to new armours, capes, and more - details in the image below.

            <p>Sony has pushed an update live to the PlayStation store that makes refunds considerably easier.</p>
<p>The new process, which can only be done on the PlayStation website or app, goes as follows: navigate to the PlayStation store and select the three dots in the top right corner to access your transaction history. From there, you should be able to select your past purchases and request refunds.</p>
<p>Previously, PlayStation users would have to use an online assistant, basically a chat bot, to negotiate a refund. The requirements for a refund remain the same: only a product bought within the last 14 days is valid, and you can't have begun the process of downloading or playing it. That is, unless what you bought is faulty, in which case these requirements may be circumvented.</p>

<p>It's a nice little update that should make those 2am reflex purchases of Detroit Become Human feel a little less rancid the next day. Also, anything that takes away those pesky chat bot supports is a good update in my book. This comes alongside a selection of other improvements made to the PS Plus store as of late, including additional accessibility options and Apple Pay support.</p>
