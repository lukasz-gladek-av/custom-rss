            <p>
Civilization 7 didn't get off to a great start when it launched earlier this year, quickly becoming mired in complaints around its controversial gameplay choices, lack of features, and clumsy UI. But while developer Firaxis is still struggling to win over series fans - particularly on Steam, where its user reviews remain "mixed" - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss Strauss Zelnick believes Civilization 7 is still on track to hit its lifetime "value" projections.
</p>
<p>
Civilization 7 released back in February - Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review">called it</a> a "competent [series] entry with some poorly executed ideas and a striking lack of personality" at the time - and criticism from customers soon followed. Complaints were loud enough, particularly among the series' more visible base of PC players (Civilization 7 also launched on consoles), that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firaxis-acknowledges-civilization-7-issues-fixes-incoming">Firaxis quickly moved to address fans</a>, promising a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-will-improve-its-much-criticised-ui-across-multiple-future-updates">roadmap of fixes</a> that's still ongoing.
</p>
<p>
And it appears these early troubles have contributed to what Zelnick has now acknowledged to be a "slow start" for the 4X strategy series' latest entry - but he remains optimistic about its future. "I think the key thing is that Civ has always been a slow burn," he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-insists-projections-for-the-lifetime-value-of-civilization-7-are-very-consistent-with-our-initial-expectations-for-the-title-despite-slow-start">told IGN</a> in a recent interview. "It's always been a title that had - I'm not really a big believer in the long tail theory of the entertainment business - but Civ is an example of that theory. And right now our projections for the lifetime value of the title are very consistent with our initial expectations."

<p>
"So while we were off to a slow start," he continued, "and while we have had to make changes - and there are more changes coming - I feel like consumer uptake is better and better and we feel really good about the title. I think over time it's going to take its place in its Civilization pantheon in a very successful, credible way."
</p>
<p>
Civilization 7's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1295660/view/498327545507219278?l=english">most recent update</a>, officially referred to as version 1.2.3, brought UI and quality-of-life adjustments, alongside a first round of changes aimed at improving the game's controversial Age Transitions - changes intended to introduce a greater sense of continuity and connection as Ages shift. It sounds like Firaxis' most meaningful revisions are still to come however, with the studio confirming it's currently "in the middle of some deeper work on systems like Ages, replayability, and how players connect with their civ across history". However, these, it admitted, are "going to take time".

            <p>A collaboration between The Pokémon Company and McDonald's has ended early due to scalping and food waste.</p>
<p>An exclusive Pikachu trading card was available as part of a Happy Meal promotion, from 9th August until 11th August. However, this ended after less than a day of availability "due to sales exceeding expectations", according to a <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.jp/company/info/2025/0809b/">statement from McDonald's</a>. "We sincerely apologise for not being able to meet the expectations of our customers who have been looking forward to it due to the early end of distribution."</p>
<p>However, as reported by <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/08/amid-chaos-mcdonalds-japan-sells-out-of-pokemon-tcg-promo-cards-in-less-than-a-day">Poké Beach</a>, the promotion resulted in chaos - long queues, card scalping, and food waste. Images show uneaten food left on the streets to rot as customers seek only the special card.</p>

<p>Meanwhile on eBay, the Pikachu promo card is being sold for around £25 each, while the full set of six cards is double that. There are also reports of McDonald's employees illegally selling boxes of the cards.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Former Activision Blizzard president Mike Ybarra <a href="https://x.com/Qwik">posted on X</a> (formerly Twitter) that he thinks <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> will "boot stomp" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">Call of Duty</a> this year, and that this will push the CoD series to stop being "lazy".</p>
<p>The full post reads: "Battlefield will boot stomp CoD this year. But the real win here is CoD won't be lazy anymore, and we'll all get better FPS games for it." He elaborated on his thoughts in a response to another X user, writing:</p>
<p>"CoD has gone downhill for years since then. It's a mess. Cheating, heavy UI/install, rainbow colors. People are sick of it. Luckily BF will force them to change it."</p>

<p>Ybarra even touched on the recent spree of layoffs at Microsoft, the company that owns Activision Blizzard and as such the developers behind the Call of Duty series. Ybarra stated: "CoD will get better because BF will be great. You're blind if you don't see that. Bitter? No, glad I'm not part of the end of Xbox. Upset they can't lead teams to make good games? Yes. Because they layoff all those people for leaderships mishaps."</p>
<p>Since his departure from Activision Blizzard ahead of the Microsoft acquisition, Ybarra has since become CEO of Prizepicks. This sports betting company is notable through a gaming lens as an early adopter of esports betting, which it started embracing back in 2019.</p>
<p>It certainly seems like Ybarra's chips are on Battlefield this year. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-the-top-selling-game-on-xbox-and-playstation-last-quarter">Call of Duty is still no slouch in terms of sales</a>, though positive sentiment has certainly taken a dip in recent years with complaints piling up (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield">such as a distaste for certain cosmetics</a>).</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/former-blizzard-president-predicts-battlefield-6-will-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-this-year]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sony has been steadily boosting its anime business and it's now been likened to the PlayStation's PS1 era.</p>
<p>Speaking to Japanese outlet <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/3609be19cc49117b054e2818fd30808944dcc10e?page=1">Toyo Keizai</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/sonys-anime-business-is-in-its-early-playstation-stage-executive-says/">Automaton</a>), Sony CSO Toshimoto Mitomo (in charge of global IP development) said the company's anime business is "in a phase roughly equivalent to the period between the launch of the PS1 and PS2".</p>
<p>Back in August 2021, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-completes-usd1bn-crunchyroll-buyout">Sony completed a $1.175bn acquisition of anime-streaming service Crunchyroll</a>. Then at the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-is-now-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawas-largest-shareholder">Sony increased its shares in FromSoftware owner Kadokawa</a>, with the intention to co-produce anime works, expand global distribution of Kadokawa's anime, and adapt franchises into live-action film and TV dramas. As such, anime was core to the business decision - not, as fans may have hoped, to secure Bloodborne 2.</p>

<p>Even more recently, last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-increasing-shares-in-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-sony-now-owns-25-of-elden-ring-publisher-bandai-namco">Sony acquired 2.5 percent of publisher Bandai Namco</a>, once again in a bid to boost its anime business. "Through this business alliance and Sony's investment in Bandai Namco... [we] will focus on expanding the fan community for IP such as anime and manga around the world and strengthening engagement, particularly in the anime field where rapid market growth is anticipated," the companies wrote in a joint statement.</p>
<p>While the PS1 was Sony's first home console, it proved immensely successful. With over 102m units sold, it's the sixth best-selling games console of all time. It was followed by the PS2, which saw Sony dominate the games industry with the best-selling console of all time.</p>
<p>Mitomo's comments seem to suggest that Sony's anime business is poised for similarly explosive growth, following its recent acquisitions.</p>
<p>Indeed, as just one example, Sony is breaking records in Japan with its release of Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle, which had the <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/anime-movies/after-the-best-opening-weekend-ever-in-japan-demon-slayer-infinity-castle-might-break-mugen-trains-usd500-million-box-office-anime-record/">biggest opening weekend ever in Japan</a>.</p>
<p>It certainly contrasts to the company's live-service strategy, which has seen a string of flops and cancellations. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-concord-and-a-string-of-delays-and-cancellations-sony-admits-playstations-live-service-strategy-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly">Sony's chief financial officer Lin Tao recently admitted</a> the strategy is "not entirely going smoothly".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-anime-business-in-early-playstation-stage-says-company-executive]]></content:encoded>
