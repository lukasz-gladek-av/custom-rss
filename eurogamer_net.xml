            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> for PlayStation 5 edges closer and closer to its October release date, but if you are finding the wait hard to take then this short but sweet gameplay trailer might ease your suffering.</p>
<p>While this gameplay snippet is only a mere glimpse at just 30 seconds, it does show off the combat you'll be treated to in the full game. As the lead character Atsu dispatches foes on a bridge, you'll see how she can utilise sand to startle and disable foes, and also send enemies to their deaths by pushing them off the edge of high platforms.</p>

<p>Key to this gameplay clip is the Yari spear, one of the many weapons you'll be able to use in the game. As well as being lethal in its own right, the Yari spear can also be used as a way for Atsu to propel herself forwards into enemies.</p>
<p>Ghost of Yōtei from Sucker Punch is set to release exclusively on PlayStation 5 on October 2. The game follows the 2020 PS4 game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, which went on to release on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>
