            <p>Activision has confirmed that players who own <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> get a 30 percent XP boost in Warzone.</p>
<p>This little nugget of XP insight comes from a new Black Ops 6 and Warzone trailer, which was released yesterday. "Get Black Ops 6 and receive a XP boost in Warzone," the description reads, while the footage itself adds: "Level up faster in Warzone."</p>
<p>The After Action Report screen in Warzone has also been known to advertise a "premium XP boost" for players who purchase Black Ops 6, as noted by Charlie Intel on X.</p>

<p>In addition, Activision has released a fresh set of patch notes for <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-01-patch-notes">Call of Duty: Warzone Season 01</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes">Black Ops 6 Season 01</a>.</p>
<p>Here, it confirmed the Black Ops 6 team has addressed those indefinitely spawning zombies on the Terminus map. It has also issued a number of stability fixes.</p>
<p>In Warzone, meanwhile, the team has sorted an issue that allowed players to redeploy with the Specialist Perk Pack still active, among other tweaks.</p>

<p>"Right now, the world is crying out for a big shooter to come along with some new ideas, to grab the genre and the medium by the collar and give it a good shake, perhaps conjuring up a bit of renewed energy in the process. Its arrival on Game Pass for the first time, effectively buying it an instantly expanded player base, ought to give Call of Duty room to take some creative risks," our Chris wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">Eurogamer's Black Ops 6 multiplayer review</a>.</p>
<p>"But after such a promising campaign, Black Ops 6's multiplayer offering ultimately did the opposite for me, retreating to the safest of spaces in offering tightly confined, purely twitch-based shooting and little else."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-developer-cast-farscape-star-as-morrigan-after-hearing-her-beat-poet-rendition-of-noughties-rap-banger<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Dragon Age fan favourite character Morrigan found her voice after Farscape and Stargate SG-1 actress Claudia Black sent in a demo tape containing a surprising recording. 
</p>
<p>
Medieval poetry? Fantasy literature? No, it was Black giving a beat poet rendition of Smack That by Akon (feat. Eminem).
</p>
<p>
Writing on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lbdpsilhg22c">Bluesky</a>, Dragon Age creator David Gaider today revealed that BioWare had previously wanted Morrigan to be a teenager. There were also plans for the character to be Middle Eastern, though this fell through when legendary actress Shoreh Aghdashloo was no longer available to voice Morrigan's mum Flemeth.

<p>
As plans changed around him, Gaider recalls being given Black's recording and instantly becoming a fan. The rest is history. 
</p>
<p>
As a reminder, here are (some of) the lyrics to Smack That by Akon (feat. Eminem).
</p>
<p>
<em>I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow / Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo? / Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo? / And possibly bend you over? / Look back and watch me</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Smack that, all on the floor / Smack that, give me some more / 
Smack that, 'til you get sore / Smack that, oh</em>
</p>
<p>
"I lost my goddamn mind," Gaider wrote. "Yes, I still have the recording. No, you cannot have it.
</p>
<p>
"Naturally, we jumped on that immediately. As I recall, this was met with resistance from higher up - they had this image of Morrigan as young, like 18 years old (no idea where this came from) and complained that Claudia sounded 'too old'.
</p><p>
"The first two sessions we asked her to pitch her voice up and it was AWFUL. So Caroline [Livingstone, BioWare's veteran VO Director] and I did the sneaky thing, and on the third session we asked her to just... act. Use her natural voice. We loved her performance so much we had the feeling that the team would love it too and forget their nonsense. They did."
</p>
<p>
BioWare recently said that a Dragon Age trilogy remaster "wouldn't be easy", because hardly anyone at the studio still knows how its old engine works. This differs from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, which was made in the still-friendly Unreal Engine.
</p>
<p>
For now, then, there's the excellent Dragon Age Veilguard - in which Morrigan, of course, once again appears. "A fantasy role-playing game of astonishing spectacle," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-rolling-out-cross-save-support-from-today-as-ps5-pro-enhancements-arrive">joined the likes of No Man's Sky</a>, with confirmation it is now playable in 8K resolution on Sony's recently-released <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> console.</p>
<p>If PS5 Pro owners want to see the Dead Space spiritual successor running in 8K (and have the other kit required, such as a suitable TV), they will need to settle for 30fps. If higher framerates are more your thing, however, there is also the option to run the game at 60fps, but in 4K. Whichever you decide, though, developer Striking Distance Studios promises full ray tracing for both.</p>
<p>"Experience The Callisto Protocol like never before with the power of PlayStation 5 Pro," reads the game's latest, PS5 Pro flavoured trailer, announcing the update. You can check it out for yourself below.</p>

<p>Striking Distance Studios was set up by Dead Space alum Glen Schofield. In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-review-a-dead-space-alike-built-on-simpler-pleasures">Eurogamer's Callisto Protocol review</a>, our Vikki acknowledged that while "Dead Space comparisons are impossible to avoid", she felt it made up for some of the missing tension "with production value and bloody-minded fun".</p><p>Despite this, however, The Callisto Protocol reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kraftons-share-price-falls-as-the-callistol-protocol-fails-to-hit-its-sales-target">failed to hit sales targets</a>, which caused publisher Krafton's share prices to fall. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-developer-striking-distance-studios-lays-off-32-employees">Striking Distance subsequently laid off 32 employees</a> in August last year - a month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-departs-callisto-protocol-studio-after-flop">Schofield left the studio</a> "to pursue new opportunities". More recently, Schofield said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-publisher-krafton-insisted-on-releasing-it-too-soon-says-director-glen-schofield">Krafton forced Striking Distance to release the game early</a>.</p>

<p>The statement follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware">yesterday's report Sony is looking to acquire Kadokawa</a>, which would include Dark Souls and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> studio FromSoftware.</p>
<p>Sony already owns the rights to Bloodborne and Demon's Souls, both of which were PlayStation exclusives.</p>
<p>The news has certainly interested Bloodborne fans hoping for some form of re-release, should Sony be in complete control.</p>
<p>It's not just Souls games, though. Kadokawa also owns <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> developer Acquire, Pokémon Mystery Dungeon and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</a> developer Spike Chunsoft, and RPG Maker developer Gotcha Gotcha Games.</p>
<p>Further, Kadokawa is a big name in anime, which would support Sony's growth in the area after acquiring Crunchyroll.</p>
<p>Earlier this year FromSoftware boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-discusses-bloodborne-remake-benefits-of-waiting-for-new-hardware">Hidetaka Miyazaki discussed the interest in a Bloodborne remake</a> with Eurogamer.</p>
<p>"Put simply, it makes me very happy to see it's a title with a lot of specific memories, both for me and the staff who worked on it," he said. "And when we see those passionate voices in the community, of course it makes us feel thrilled, it makes us feel very fortunate to have that and to have those memories."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Impressive indie puzzler <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes">Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</a> will arrive for PlayStation 4 and PS5 next month, on 3rd December.
</p>
<p>
Developed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sayonara-wild-hearts">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a> and Year Walk studio Simogo, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes was greeted by positive reviews when it first arrived PC and Nintendo Switch back in May.
</p>
<p>
A non-linear and mostly monochrome puzzle game, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes is set in a world of fragmented memories designed to make players question their surroundings. Solving puzzles, of which there are more than 150, gradually offers a greater understanding of what's going on.

<p>
The game looks stunning - which fits its wider philosophical themes that consider the nature of art - though how much you will understand even after completing the game is a matter of debate.
</p>
<p>
"You'll never have it all figured out, and Lorelei's story stays impenetrable even after it's completed," Ashley Bardhan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review">Eurogamer's Lorelei and the Laser Eyes review</a>, nevertheless praising it for "some of the most visually and technologically stunning scenes I've ever witnessed" in a game. 
</p>
<p>
"Simogo weaves together interlocking puzzles, infinite timelines, and supernatural mischief with only minimal clumsiness," she wrote, awarding Lorelei and the Laser Eyes four out of five stars.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/f1-manager-25-reportedly-cancelled-by-planet-coaster-studio<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-coaster">Planet Coaster</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elite-dangerous">Elite Dangerous</a> developer Frontier looks to have canned its upcoming F1 Manager 25, following poor sales of the franchise.
</p>
<p>
In September, Frontier said in a <a href="https://frontier-drupal.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/production/frontier-corp/s3fs-public/press-releases/financial/Frontier-FY24-Financial-Results.pdf">financial statement</a> it had held "commercial discussions with an IP partner" that had "resulted in the voluntary termination of a contract for a future game before full development started". 
</p>
<p>
The identity of that game had previously been kept out of the public eye. Now, however, private analysis from investment research firm Zeus Capital has been shared online, identifying the game in question as F1 Manager 2025.
</p>
<p>
As first reported by <a href="https://traxion.gg/f1-manager-2025-cancelled-as-sales-below-expectations/">Traxion</a>, this analysis claims the F1 Manager series is yet to turn a profit, compared to Frontier's other profitable franchises Elite Dangerous, Planet Coaster, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-zoo">Planet Zoo</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jurassic-world-evolution">Jurassic World Evolution</a>.
</p>
<p>
Zeus Capital's analysis is not intended for public dissemination. However, Eurogamer can verify the information is as reported. We've contacted Frontier for comment.
</p>
<p>The cancellation of F1 Manager 2025 does not come as a huge surprise following the poor performance of the series to date. The studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frontier-share-price-plummets-following-f1-manager-2022-flop">share price tumbled after the release of F1 Manager 2022</a>, and the company was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frontier-latest-studio-hit-with-layoffs-following-f1-manager-disappointment">hit by a wave of layoffs in October 2023</a> following the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f1-manager-2023">F1 Manager 2023</a>. This year's F1 Manager 2024 also seems to have not made much of an impression.</p>
<p>A report published in April <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/f1-manager-developer-frontier-accused-of-mismanagement-in-wake-of-layoffs">accused Frontier of mismanagement in the wake of the layoffs</a>, and said the company had struggled to handle its expensive, multi-year deal with the F1 brand.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frontier-making-third-jurassic-world-game-with-two-additional-management-sims-due-over-next-three-years">Frontier's future hopes are pinned on a return to its more traditional management sims</a>, such as the just-released Planet Coaster 2 and the upcoming Jurassic World Evolution 3, which is due next year.  A third unannounced management sim is also in production, due to release during its financial year 2027.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Following the debut and eventual discontinuation of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-controller-revealed">original Steam controller</a>, Valve is now said to be working on another iteration, under the codename Ibex.</p>
<p>That's according to knowledgeable Valve source Brad Lynch (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/11/19/24300757/valve-steam-controller-2-roy-deckard-leak">The Verge</a>). Lynch states the Steam Controller 2, as Valve has reportedly called it, is set for "a mass production goal in their factories" at this very moment in time.</p>
<p>"That's why I know they're in later stages of productisation," Lynch wrote in a post on social media platform X.</p>

<p>Lynch did not go into much further detail, but did reply to another user to say the "biggest change will be the shape/size of the trackpads", which will essentially get the controller "into that gamepad-y form".</p>
<p>In addition, the company is also said to be working on a set of wand controllers (codenamed Roy). Again, these wands are said to be aimed at mass production.</p>

<p>Reportedly, these wand type controllers would be for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOEgUmkhzOU">Valve's rumoured "Deckard" VR headset</a>, which will allegedly function as a standalone hybrid VR headset. The company previously debuted its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valves-vr-headset-is-real-heres-our-first-look-at-valve-index">'Index' VR headset back in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>As for the original Steam controller, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-calls-time-on-its-divisive-steam-controller">this chap was discontinued, also in 2019</a>. Eurogamer alums Johnny Chiodini and Chris Bratt went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-hands-on-with-the-steam-controller">hands on with the controller on its release</a>, and you can check out their impressions thanks to a little bit of vintage EG video goodness above.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 1pm UK: </strong> <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> Mobile will be free-to-play and won't include gacha mechanics.</p>
<p>This news was confirmed by Japanese publication <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202411/23633">Famitsu</a> in an extensive article. How exactly the game will be monetised remains unclear, though presumably it will be through costumes and mounts in the game's online store.</p>
<p>This differs from other <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> mobile games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-7-ever-crisis">Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-final-fantasy-mobile-game-ends-global-service-this-time-the-one-with-ariana-grande">recently ended Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius</a> that heavily include gacha mechanics.</p>
<p>Further, the game will have controls optimised for mobile devices, likely including a virtual joystick.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL 8am UK:</strong> A mobile version of Final Fantasy 14 has officially been revealed.</p>
<p>The in-development game was announced by Final Fantasy 14 director and producer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a>, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>-owned Lightspeed Studio behind development. The studio previously developed PUBG Mobile.</p>
<p>"This is our latest MMORPG title specifically tailored for the mobile platform," said Yoshida in a video announcing the project. "Despite these adjustments Lightspeed Studios is working with tremendous enthusiasm and dedication to faithfully recreate the story, duties, battle content and other aspects of the original game."</p>

<p>He continued: "I hope both current FF14 players and those who are interested in exploring its story will look forward to what's coming next."</p>
<p>The video provides a first look at gameplay, which shows a fully-realised version of Eorzea from the cities of Ul'dah and Limsa Lominsa, to the Gold Saucer and even a battle against the Primal Titan.</p>

<p>As noted on the <a href="https://ffxivmobile.com/web202409/index.html#/">game's website</a>, nine jobs will be available at launch out of the full game's 22 battle jobs. While these aren't listed, imagery suggests the likes of Black Mage, Warrior, Dragoon, Bard, and White Mage will all be playable.</p>
<p>What's more, all 11 crafting and gathering jobs will be included, as well as side activities like Triple Triad, chocobo racing, and home customisation.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 14 has already received over 30 million registered players and has proven a huge success for Square Enix. It's no wonder a mobile version is in development to boost that further.</p>
<p>This mobile version, along with the Tencent collaboration, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-is-reportedly-coming-to-mobile">rumoured back in July this year</a>. A month later, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-mobile-game-is-approved-in-china">approved in China</a>.</p>
<p>While a release date is unknown, a demo through multiple play tests will soon be available in China, with a global launch planned afterwards. Fans can pre-register now.</p>
<p>The expansion to mobile is part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Square Enix's "aggressive" push to multiplatform releases</a> to "diversify earnings opportunities".</p>
<p>For current players of Final Fantasy 14, the <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/9b42b2425f3a680caea3281ccd65c99677cb00e2/">latest Patch 7.1</a> was released earlier this month, bringing the Final Fantasy 11 themed raid series as well as new story content.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
