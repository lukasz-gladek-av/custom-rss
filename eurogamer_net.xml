            <p>Embracer's new CEO Phil Rogers has discussed the company's use of AI in its latest Annual General Meeting, praising the technology but insisting "human authorship is final".</p>
<p>Previous CEO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-overseeing-thousands-of-layoffs-and-numerous-studio-closures-embracer-ceo-lars-wingefors-is-stepping-down">Lars Wingefors left Embracer earlier this summer</a>, with Rogers taking over in August. AI tools can be a "power multiplier" he said, though insisted this isn't "corporate speak" but "words we're hearing from studio heads and heads of production".</p>
<p>"In an industry defined by escalating development costs and limitless player expectations, the question is no longer if a company will adopt a technology like AI, but how it leads with it? How we take Embracer forward across Fellowship? Our answer is a smart implementation of generative AI in ethical and sustainable ways," he said.</p>
<p>"We really do view AI as a strategic catalyst," he continued. "It's the most powerful technology or tool of our generation for driving efficiency, amplifying creativity, and ultimately delivering the high-quality, memorable games that players demand more effectively, more predictably, and more profitably than before."</p>
<p>AI tools are being used across multiple departments by animators, designers, engineers and more, though Rogers emphasised the need for "tuning by human hand" so developers can "add their unique authorship".</p>
<p>For instance, Rogers claimed AI advancements allow for in-game animations that are "indistinguishable" from motion capture, which can see "a seven day mocap shoot cut in half".</p>
<p>"This isn't a theoretical future," said Rogers. "It's happening now and the results are quite compelling. Many of our studios have been experimenting with AI in the past couple of years and are now starting to really leverage it to eliminate bottlenecks and empower our development teams. We're beginning to see measurable increases in productivity."</p>
<p>His view is that AI can reduce busywork and repetitive tasks, though he acknowledged criticism of AI tools within the industry and the need to protect workers. As such, the company's core principle is "empower, never replace".</p>
<p>"We see the headlines and we hear the concern from players and developers alike, but we believe the greatest risk is not in using AI, but in using it without a strong ethical framework," said Rogers. "Players aren't longing for generic, soulless side quests or synthetic AI voices. Developers want creative freedom to innovate and experiment and reduce iteration time so they can make more content. Artists, actors, writers need protection from plagiarism. Intellectual properties need to be nurtured and respected."</p><p>He continued: "For us, ethics and good business are one and the same. They really do go hand in hand. Our position is clear: human authorship is final. Our developers will always have the final creative control and authorship. After all, AI is a co-pilot. It is not the pilot."</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/embracer-ceo-acknowledges-ai-concerns-but-says-the-tech-can-become-a-creative-catalyst-?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Game Developer</a> pointed out, Rogers' comments ironically come days after Embracer subsidiary Aspyr <a href="https://support.aspyr.com/hc/en-us/articles/39710879443853-Tomb-Raider-IV-VI-Remastered-Hotfix-for-Patch-2">issued a hotfix</a> for its latest Tomb Raider Remastered collection to remove "unauthorised AI generated content" following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-lara-croft-taking-legal-action-against-aspyr-for-ai-generated-voice-use-in-tomb-raider-remasters">criticism from French Lara Croft actress Fran√ßoise Cadol</a>, who claimed her performance had been replicated without consent.</p>
<p>Further, Rogers' comments mirror those of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-about-incredibly-talented-people-not-doing-incredibly-boring-stuff-blizzard-devs-say-its-possible-to-use-ai-tools-while-still-feeling-handcrafted">Blizzard developers interviewed by Eurogamer</a>, who claimed AI can be used for "menial" areas but they always retain a "handcrafted" feel.</p>
<p>Indeed, AI was a common theme at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-was-everywhere-at-gamescom-2025">as Eurogamer reported</a>, with some indie teams claiming AI tools are invaluable.</p>
<p>AI tools are also being used for remasters and remakes, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gaming-ai-remasters-can-they-be-any-good">Keywords in particular experimenting with AI at every stage</a> - but can they ever be good?</p>

            <p>Nintendo has released a new update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> launch game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, which now makes it easier to locate collectibles you've found in its open world.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Free Roam map now displays the locations of P Switches you've run over, as well as Peach Medallions obtained. You can also now fast travel to P Switches.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Free Roam, it's now easier to encounter UFOs and the "conditions for the appearance of some Peach Medallions" have been adjusted.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-0-review">Yakuza 0</a> Director's Cut is heading to current gen platforms in December, but existing owners won't get a free upgrade.</p>
<p>This Director's Cut was first released on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> in June as a launch game, but RGG Studio has announced it will now be heading to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam on 8th December.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> will be coming to Switch 2 on 13th November, and then on 8th December will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam alongside Yakuza 0 Director's Cut.</p>

<p>Essentially, by the end of this year all three games will be available across all current gen consoles. Then, next year, Yakuza Kiwami 3 and its Dark Ties spin-off will be released, meaning the first four games in the series will be available.</p><p>However, there's a catch. Across the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10015829">PlayStation Store</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/yakuza-0-directors-cut/9nrkltwn2zq7">Xbox Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2988580/Yakuza_0_Directors_Cut/">Steam</a>, there will be no free upgrade path from the original Yakuza 0 release to the Director's Cut. In addition, save data cannot be carried over to the new version.</p>
<p>Further, on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, the Director's Cut version's Red Light Raid online multiplayer will be added in a post-launch update (the Steam version presumably will have it at launch). There's no release date yet for this update.</p>
<p>This multiplayer mode is a key addition for the Director's Cut, which sees players teaming up with friends to take down hordes of enemies. It's disappointing it won't be included at launch, plus <a href="https://www.sega.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Sega has confirmed</a> cross-play will not be supported, so you'll need to play with friends on the same platform.</p>
<p>The reveal followed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-kiwami-3-is-real-and-coming-early-2026-alongside-brand-new-prequel-spin-off-launching-on-the-same-day">official unveiling of Yakuza Kiwami 3</a> earlier in the RGG Direct, which will come with a new prequel spin-off called Dark Ties. RGG also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-studios-next-game-stranger-than-heaven-still-a-long-way-off-as-teased-in-jazzy-behind-the-scenes-video">teased its next project, Stranger Than Heaven</a>.</p>
