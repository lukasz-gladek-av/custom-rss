            <p>The<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/movies/street-fighter"> Street Fighter movie</a> may have found its Chun-Li, who will reportedly be a "lead female role" in the 2026 adaptation.</p>
<p>Callina Liang, known for her roles in recent thriller Presence and high school drama Bad Genius, has been picked for the role of one of gaming's biggest female fighters <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/street-fighter-movie-casts-callina-liang-chun-li-1236439931/">according to Deadline</a>.</p>
<p>The Street Fighter movie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/live-action-street-fighter-movie-gets-2026-release-date#:~:text=Live%2Daction%20Street%20Fighter%20movie,2026%20release%20date%20%7C%20Eurogamer.net">is scheduled for release on 20th March 2026</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-film-gets-new-director-still-set-for-2026">will be directed by Kitao Sakurai</a>. Sakurai was previously responsible for directing Netflix's Bad Trip, as well as the Eric Andr√© Show.</p>

<p>Additional details on the Street Fighter movie are scarce. We know Capcom is "deeply involved" with the adaptation thanks to a report by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-finds-its-director-1236140934/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, but the premise or other featured characters remains a mystery.</p>
<p>What we do know is Chun-Li has found herself in a second surge of popularity - not thanks to the excellent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>, but due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> where a crossover skin introduced her to a new generation of fans. This skin has also recently made a return to the battle royale, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1lj01px/chunli_is_1st_best_seller_for_3_days_straight_so/">quickly becoming the top selling cosmetic in-game</a>.</p>
<p>It's also clear we're in the midst of a golden era for video game adaptations. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/movies/minecraft">The Minecraft movie</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-jockeys-past-550m-at-the-box-office">broke records around the world</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">has a sequel on the way</a>. Meanwhile the Sonic film franchise spun past $1bn in global box office sales this January.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-movie-chun-li-actor]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A man has been arrested after being accused of stealing "approximately $10,000 worth" of Nintendo Switch video games from US libraries.</p>
<p>The man in question is Jamal Reed-Obafumi, who is said to have targeted multiple public libraries in Northern California. As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/man-accused-of-stealing-10000-worth-of-switch-games-from-libraries/1100-6532651/">GameSpot</a>, the Marin County Sheriff's Office said on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MarinCountySheriff/posts/pfbid0ooLynurh5d2koiZcGqVUTRTvGhHYRgsDuQXGaLaHtHihBZ4Y9kiY5BhEyxoUGdDpl">Facebook</a> it had arrested 45-year-old Reed-Obafumi earlier this month, on 17th June.</p>

<p>The Office alleged Reed-Obafumi was "connected to a string of at least seven different burglaries of Marin County Libraries". These incidents took place between April and June of this year, although specific libraries were not mentioned.</p>
<p>According to the Facebook post, Reed-Obafumi now faces 12 felony charges. These include multiple "counts of burglary", in addition to "committing a felony while out on bail", the Marin County Sheriff's Office said, before closing:</p>
<p>"Our libraries are pillars of the community and must be safeguarded for everyone to enjoy!"</p>
<p>It is currently unclear if any of the stolen Switch games have been recovered. Eurogamer has contacted the Marin County Sheriff's Office for comment.</p>

            <p>Anticipation for the next mainline entry in the Resident Evil series is evidently high.</p>
<p>Capcom has today announced that Resident Evil Requiem has already had "over" one million of us add the upcoming game to our wishlists.</p>
<p>"Thank you," <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/1937289617008427060">Capcom wrote on social media</a>, with a little infographic showing the figure alongside Grace Ashcroft.</p>

<p>While this does not equate to actual games sales, we are all clearly very keen for the next Resident Evil release. And, it seems rightly so. Our Alex has been hands-on with Resident Evil Requiem already, admitting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-played-resident-evil-9-and-they-heard-me-scream-in-the-booth-next-door">even the relatively small chunk he played made him scream so loudly that those in the booth next door heard him</a>, which bodes well!</p>
<p>Back in April, it was revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-4-remake-becomes-fastest-game-in-the-series-to-sell-10m">the Resident Evil 4 Remake has now sold more than 10m copies</a>. It managed to hit that milestone faster than any other game in the Resi series to date. Could today's wishlisted figure for Resident Evil Requiem mean that Resi 9 will potentially take that milestone crown on its release next year? Time will tell.</p>
<p>We got our first look at Resident Evil Requiem earlier this month, when the developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-officially-unveiled-coming-february">introduced us all to Grace Ashcroft and a destroyed Raccoon City</a>. We can expect yet another look in just a couple of days' time, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-spotlight-announced-for-next-week-with-resident-evil-requiem-pragmata-and-more-to-feature">Capcom hosts its Spotlight showcase on 26th June</a>.</p>

<p>Along with Resident Evil Requiem, the developer will also give us another look at its astronaut and small girl-starring game Pragmata, as well as existing titles <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p>
<p>During this stream, the developer will delve further into the newest update for Monster Hunter Wilds. As our Dom wrote yesterday, after a strong start for Wilds the game has suffered an influx of overwhelmingly negative Steam reviews. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">Can Capcom turn things around with Monster Hunter Wilds' upcoming Title Update 2</a>?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-already-looks-set-for-massive-success-as-it-hits-significant-wishlist-milestone]]></content:encoded>
