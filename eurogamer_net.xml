            <p>
Following last year's slam-dunk <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake, the beloved survival horror sequel is being reinterpreted yet again, this time in the form of new movie adaptation Return to Silent Hill. And now, three years after its announcement, it's been given a release date of 23rd June 2026.
</p>
<p>
Return to Silent Hill was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-konamis-silent-hill-october-2022-showcase">originally unveiled in 2022</a>, alongside a variety of gaming projects including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-ascension-fails-to-impress-with-greedy-monetisation-and-cluttered-ui">unloved Silent Hill: Ascension</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">masterful Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, the upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, and No Code's still-mysterious Silent Hill Townfall.
</p>
<p>
Amid that flurry of gaming news, Return to Silent Hill was perhaps a little lost in the throng, but the key bit of information was that it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-film-detailed">see Christophe Gans take on directing duties once more</a>. Gans, of course, previously helmed 2006's Sean-Bean-starring original Silent Hill movie, which certainly captured the game series' atmosphere - even if it did all start to fall apart in the last stretch, when it suddenly decided it needed to explain itself in a ham-fisted exposition dump that even some high-velocity barbed wire couldn't save.

<p>
Since Return to Silent Hill's initial unveiling, it's been confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-casts-war-horses-jeremy-irvine-as-james">War Horse's Jeremy Irvine will star as Silent Hill 2 protagonist James</a>, with Hannah Emily Anderson in the role of his "one true love" Mary (an early leak suggested the two won't be married in this version). More recently, Gans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-film-will-be-faithful-adaptation-of-silent-hill-2-distributor-promises">insisted his adaptation would be a "faithful" one</a>, although a careful reading of the movie's synopsis does imply some potentially notable changes:
</p>
<p>
"James, a man broken after his relationship with the love of his life, Mary, ends," reads the official synopsis. "When a mysterious letter from her calls him back to Silent Hill, he finds a once-recognisable town transformed by an unknown evil. While James desperately searches for Mary he encounters terrifying creatures and begins to unravel the mystery of what happened to the town. But as he descends deeper into the darkness the secrets he uncovers lead to a horrifying truth, and James finds himself struggling to hold on long enough to save his one true love."
</p>
<p>
We'll know if Return to Silent Hill does its source material justice when it <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/silent-night-deadly-night-return-silent-hill-release-dates-1236436030/">hits the big screen</a> on 23rd June next year. However it ends up, Bloober's remake - which has now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-passes-another-sales-milestone">sold over 2m copies</a> - is a fine way to experience a bonafide gaming classic. And the studio is about to do it all over again, as it embarks on its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-silent-hill-remake-has-been-revealed-during-konami-press-start-showcase">recently announced remake of Silent Hill 1</a>.
