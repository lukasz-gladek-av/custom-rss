            <p>
Mike Pondsmith, the creator of the Cyberpunk tabletop RPG that formed the basis of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, has been discussing CD Projekt's in-development sequel, saying it'll feature second city that feels like "Chicago gone wrong".
</p>
<p>
CD Projekt <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-red-announces-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-future-witcher-projects-outlined">confirmed a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel was in the works</a> back in 2022, and only a scant few details have been shared since then. We know it's currently being referred to by the codename Project Orion, for instance, that it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-team-relocating-to-boston-for-sequel">being developed by CD Projekt's Boston and Vancouver studios</a>, and... well, that's about it.
</p>
<p>
Pondsmith, though, has now provided what might just be the first tangible details of CD Projekt's Cyberpunk 2077 sequel. Speaking to TVGRY during this year's Digital Dragons Conference in Krakow, he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cthec500Ofo">explained</a> that while he's "not as involved directly" with Project Orion as he was its predecessor, he still sees the scripts and has been visiting its development studio.

<p>
"Last week," he revealed, "I was wandering around talking to different departments and seeing what they had... I spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place in Orion... because there's another city we visit, and I'm not telling you anymore than that."
</p>
<p>
Luckily for everyone (except, perhaps, CD Projekt, which seems unlikely to have sanctioned any of these reveals), Pondsmith <em>did</em> share a little more. First, he confirmed "Night City is still there" alongside this second location, before teasing how Project Orion's two cities will differentiate themselves. "I remember looking at [the new location] and going, 'Yeah, I understand the feel that you're going for, and this really does work. It doesn't feel like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a>, it feels more like Chicago gone wrong'. And I said, 'Yeah, I can see this working.'"
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, while Pondsmith only suggested Project Orion's second location was <em>like</em> Chicago, fans have long speculated the actual city of Chicago will play a key role in CD Projekt's sequel. As explained in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/17jz77f/chicago_might_be_one_of_the_new_locations_in_the/">fairly comprehensive post on the Cyberpunk subreddit</a>, the in-universe version of Chicago has struggled through both an economic collapse, a corporate war, and a bio-plague - so "gone wrong" would very much apply here. Additionally, Cyberpunk 2077's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> expansion features a possible ending that can nudge players several years forward in the timeline, after which the Transcontinental Maglev Network project referenced in the base game - one linking Night City with Chicago - is revealed to be complete.
</p>
<p>
It's certainly a compelling theory, especially given Pondsmith's latest chatter, but there's obviously no guarantee any of this will make it through the years of development required to turn Project Orion - which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-shares-witcher-and-cyberpunk-project-updates-announces-partnership-with-mobile-developer-scopely">currently in the pre-production phase</a> - into a complete and released game. That won't happen until sometime after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>'s still-nebulous launch window - but at least that leaves plenty of time to wrap up the original Cyberpunk 2077, which will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-is-a-switch-2-launch-title">soon be making its Nintendo debut on Switch 2</a>.

            <p>
Carrie Patel, who served as game director on this year's acclaimed fantasy action-RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a>, has confirmed her departure from Obsidian Entertainment after nearly 12 years with the studio and announced a new role at Netflix.
</p>
<p>
Patel, who was very much the face of Avowed throughout its development, shared the news in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carrie-patel-80003aa/">brief update on LinkedIn</a>, revealing she's now working within Netflix's gaming division, having joined Oxenfree developer Night School Studio as a game director.
</p>
<p>
She offered no further clue as to what she'll be working on at Night School in her update, but the Oxenfree and Afterparty studio has an impressive track record, despite its limited output since being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-acquires-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">acquired by Netflix in 2021</a>. It released Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals in 2023 but nothing else until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-new-netflix-black-mirror-series-has-another-bandersnatch-like-gaming-crossover-moment-but-you-might-not-even-notice-it">Black Mirror tie-in Thronglets</a> arrived earlier this year - a release that followed an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-culls-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">unspecified number of layoffs at Night School</a> in March.

<p>
Netflix's gaming strategy has taken some dramatic shifts in direction since the streaming service's first tentative steps back in 2021. After an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-halo-infinite-creative-head-joseph-staten-joins-netflix-games">initial focus on mobile titles</a>, it seemed ready to stride into the world of AAA console gaming in 2023, even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-acquires-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">hitting up longtime Halo creative lead Joseph Staten</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> executive producer Chacko Sonny, and God of War art director Rafael Grassetti to found a new development team.
</p>
<p>
However, Netflix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-closes-aaa-internal-studio-led-by-halo-creative-head-joseph-staten">quietly closed the studio late last year</a>, and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-games-boss-says-consoles-not-the-future-as-streamer-looks-to-phone-controlled-party-games">reportedly now focusing on</a> narrative and transmedia projects, on big mainstream IP, on being a destination for families, and on party games played on TVs using mobile phones as a controller. That does, of course, still leave room for Night Studio - and Patel - to continue making the kind of games it does best.
</p>
<p>
As for Avowed, prior to Patel's departure from Obsidian, she suggested it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-director-hints-at-a-future-for-the-franchise">wasn't a one-and-done effort</a>. "Now that we've built this wonderful world, and also built this team strength and muscle memory around the content and gameplay in this world," she explained, "I'd love to see us do more with it." Next up for Obsidian, though, is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2. It's due later this year, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-announces-june-showcase-event-reveals-game-getting-this-years-big-spotlight">special developer deep dive set to air on 8th June</a> following the Xbox Games Showcase.
