            <p>NetEase's PvPvE sandbox action horror, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/feedback-on-once-humans-season-2-has-been-quite-demoralising">Once Human, started testing its mobile port back in September</a>, and now we <em>finally</em> have a mobile release window: April 2025.</p>
<p>In an end-of-year <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc00VaAEgfM">livestream</a>, NetEase also revealed what new features Meta-Humans can expect when the mobile version drops, including three new scenarios: Code: Purification, Code: Deviation, and Code: Broken. The latter is a 10-day PvP scenario, whilst the first two are PvE.</p>

<p>We'll also get to experience the all-new Visional Wheel from 16th January, which introduces new wrinkles to gameplay courtesy of new weapons, powers, and rules, as well as making enemies stronger and adversely impacting player sanity. Oh, and there'll be a holiday event running across Christmas and the new year, too.</p>
<p>Once Human is also expected to come to console - complete with cross-platform support - as well. There's still no date on that, though. Sorry.</p>
<p>Interested? Head on over to the <a href="https://www.oncehuman.game/">official website</a> to pre-register your interest now. Right now, over 26 million Meta-Humans have signed up, unlocking a slew of free gifts including cosmetics, skins, decorative items, and crafting resources.</p>
<p>I gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/once-human-review">Once Human a modest three out of five stars when I reviewed it for Eurogamer</a>, saying it offers a deeply moreish open world scavenge-em-up, but weak action and generic clutter hold it back. Since launch, however, NetEase has ramped up its premium in-game offerings, including cosmetic loot crates.</p><p>"Not for one moment did I expect a F2P live service offering to be anything other than an unmitigated slog stuffed with the pitfalls and unforced errors of every other game I started and stopped playing, so wildly over-saturated is this genre. But here I am, late at night again, fashioning myself a Slippery When Wet sign to put beside my water tank."</p>
<p>The developer behind NetEase's survival free-to-play horror, Once Human, recently said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/feedback-on-once-humans-season-2-has-been-quite-demoralising">feedback it's received about the game's second season has been "quite demoralising"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A video game charting the true story of the Nakba, the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian Arabs in 1948, has secured three-quarters of its <a href="https://www.launchgood.com/v4/campaign/dreams_on_a_pillow">crowdfunding goal</a> with over three weeks still to go.</p>
<p>Dreams on a Pillow - a "pseudo-3D stealth adventure game about a land full of people being made into a people without land" - tracks Omm, a young mother from an olive farmers' family in al-Tantura. With Omm, you'll traverse historical events and stories of the Nakba as she attempts an escape towards Lebanon in the North.</p>

<p>The crowdfunding page explains that Palestinian game developer Rasheed Abueideh is "asking for your support and blessing as he sets out on his largest game project so far, which has been a dream of his for almost a decade". To date, it has realised £104.5K of the £155,823 Abueideh seeks to raise and is set to close on 13th January.</p>
<p>"Almost exactly a decade ago, as an Israeli invasion tore through Gaza, Rasheed Abueideh recognised the power of games: they let players step into someone else’s reality," the description explains.</p>
<p>"Not long after Rasheed began development of Liyla &amp; The Shadows of War, a game that brought to life the harsh realities of living under invasion, apartheid, &amp; occupation. The development was fraught with obstacles and rejections: Apple declared the game 'too political', and temporarily banned the game - and while publishing funding in the games industry were aggressively funding games, a Palestinian game was deemed 'too controversial'. Rasheed persevered, and Liyla became a global phenomenon."</p>
<p>Abueideh said Dreams on a Pillow is "proof that games can tell the stories of anyone, anywhere". For more, <a href="https://www.launchgood.com/v4/campaign/dreams_on_a_pillow">head on over to the crowdfunding page</a>, where pledges range from £24 to £8000.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Executive producer Mark Rubin said the update marked a "bittersweet moment", but he was proud of the team "that did everything they could to make this game and all of its amazing content".</p>
<p>"Ubisoft has not only allowed a small team to stay on and continue working to get our Season 3 content out the door, but we've also been able to add some extra content to this release from future seasons," Rubin explained. "So, we have our Season 3 content plus some of the content from Season 4, 5, 6, 7 and even Season 8."</p>

<p>The content itself includes three new factions, including the Assassin Creed's crossover promised a little while back. The Wolves and Omega Force factions are also available, even though they were supposed to release in seasons four and five, respectively.</p>
<p>"We are also adding six new Arena Maps and three new Linear Maps from future seasons. So along with the four new maps from Season three that’s a total of 13 new maps," Rubin added. "And I have to say the team really went all out on these amazing new maps. If you do anything at all, you need to check out the new Rayman map that was going to be part of an epic event takeover in Season 4. It even has it’s own mode with Lum Hunt."</p> <div>

<p>Players can also expect a brand-new experience called Tactical that uses corridor-style maps with new mode Defuse, a "1-life classic bomb mode", plus a slew of weapons and cosmetics that were supposed to come in future seasons, too.</p>
<p>"All of this and more are our last tribute to all of the hard-working people that made this game and to all of the fans who have been with us through this journey," Rubin added. "Not all journeys end well but we can all be proud of what we accomplished.</p><p>"I wish everyone who worked on this game directly or indirectly the best for their future endeavors.

<p>A month and a half after denying reports it was poised to pull the plug on its free-to-play live-service shooter XDefiant which launched back in May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-shutting-studios-laying-off-277-employees-as-it-pulls-plug-on-live-service-shooter-xdefiant">Ubisoft confirmed earlier this month that it's doing just that</a>, resulting in the closure of three production studios and 277 employees losing their jobs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
