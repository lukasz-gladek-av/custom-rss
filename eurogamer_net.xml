            <p>
Keanu Reeves has made no secret of wanting to return to the world of Cyberpunk following his role as Johnny Silverhand in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> - even though that could be a little tricky given <em>events</em>. However, series creator Mike Pondsmith is on the case, saying he's figured out "ways" to make it happen.
</p>
<p>
Back in September, when asked if he'd be interested in returning for developer CD Projekt's upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, Reeves <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/breathtaking-keanu-reeves-would-love-to-be-johnny-silverhand-in-cyberpunk-2">revealed he'd "love" to play Johnny Silverhand again</a>. That's great news for Reeves/Silverhand fans, of course, but easier said that done given the character's narrative trajectory left him, well, otherwise engaged by the time the credits rolled.
</p>
<p>
But it seems Cyberpunk series creator Mike Pondsmith has risen to the challenge, paving a way for a potential return. "Not that long ago," he revealed in Cyberpunk 2077's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1_HsIlaqMkc?si=Ta51TFmBnop3th3L">recent anniversary livestream</a>, "I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again."
</p>
<p>
"I have ways to do that, Keanu," he continued enigmatically. "Contact me." Of course, given Pondsmith's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-feature-second-city-thats-like-chicago-gone-wrong-says-series-creator">admission</a> he's "not as involved directly" with Cyberpunk 2 compared to 1, CD Projekt might already have different ideas.
</p>
<p>
To date, little has officially been revealed about the sequel, beyond the fact <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-gets-a-new-name-as-pre-production-phase-now-officially-underway">pre-production is underway</a>. In May, CD Projekt confirmed around 100 developers were working on the project, with the bulk of the studio focused on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. That doesn't mean it remains a complete mytery, however.
</p><p>
Earlier this year, Pondsmith <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-feature-second-city-thats-like-chicago-gone-wrong-says-series-creator">claimed Cyberpunk 2 will feature a second city</a> - in addition to Night City - that's like "Chicago gone wrong". That's perhaps not a big surprise, though; Cyberpunk 2077's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> expansion features a possible ending set several years later, after the Transcontinental Maglev Network project referenced in the base game - one linking Night City with Chicago - is revealed to be complete.

            <p>The UK's House of Commons has debated the need for improved video game consumer protections as well as video game preservation. In this debate, Concord's sudden shutdown was used as an example of a game shut down suddenly, and the requirement for strong consumer protections in such a case.</p>
<p>One MP stated in their statement: "A recent example is Concord, a game released for PlayStation 5 and Windows in August 2024. Following a disappointing launch, Sony Interactive Entertainment made a commercial decision to shut it down. To their credit, they did refund all purchases, but this isn't always the case.</p>
<p>"I know the honourable members will agree that where publishers fail to make the life span of a game clear at the point of sale, they must be held accountable. That's why I welcome the strengthened consumer protections, including the digital markets, competition and consumers act 2024, which came into force earlier this year. This legislation rightly requires traders to provide clear, timely, and accurate information to consumers, including the longevity and functionality of digital products."</p>

<p>Other games of note mentioned as examples of games made unplayable, including The Crew as well as Anthem, the latter's servers will be shut down later this year.</p>
<p>The debate was had today in the UK House of Commons, in which MPs discussed the issues raised by the Stop Killing Games consumer movement. MP Ben Goldsborough led the debate, making the argument for further consumer rights in regard to live service video games.</p><p>Goldsborough noted that the video game industry provided both £7.6bn and 75,000 jobs to the UK. He noted in his opening statement: "Gamers still feel the deep sense of personal possession, because they invest more than money. They invest time, effort, imagination, and friendship. When a game shuts down without notice, that investment is lost."</p>
<p>He also urged funding partnerships, and sector support to make sure we maintain a library full of significant games. Goldsborough said:  "This is about fairness, responsibility, creativity, and protecting a cultural legacy [...] of which the United Kingdom should be proud."</p>
<p>There were issues raised with the suggestion, with one MP noting that when games are acquired or shut down altogether the responsibility to provide such support for preservation efforts or online support. This was countered by the claim that there's a need for "natural justice", that if someone has paid for a product they should be able to use it for as long as they like.</p>
<p><a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2025-0195/">The UK government has stated it has no intention of changing consumer laws</a>, in spite of the overwhelming amount of pro-consumer and pro-preservation sentiment from the MPs present in today's governmental debate.</p>

            <p>All of the notable Grand Theft Auto games have been set in fictional versions of American cities, but there was once an expansion pack that showed us a glimpse of somewhere else. Somewhere, if you're me, very close to home: London.</p>
<p>In 1997, an expansion pack was released for the original Grand Theft Auto game that remade its world to look like London in the Swinging Sixties - specifically, in 1969. Cue lots of colourful Minis and mini-skirts and mods and bob haircuts and garish pastel colours. It was fun, and it was enough of a glimpse to keep the question of whether Rockstar might ever return to London, for a full-fat GTA instalment, alive for many years after.</p>
<p>But that dream-balloon has popped now, with <a href="https://youtu.be/o3gbXDjNWyI?si=tLh2Pqo2iIIJZ4as">Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser telling Lex Fridman</a> that the Grand Theft Auto series has become too characterised by Americana to be set anywhere else.</p>
<p>"There's a reason why GTA kept coming back to Miami, New York, Los Angeles," Houser said. "They're all very good for what you laid out..." Houser was referring to Fridman's description of Miami being a place where huge wealth exists next to extreme poverty, of it being a place of everything: glitz, glamour, immigration, drugs and organised crime - the whole lot. A melting pot.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZHrrLPk2S4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>London arguably has that but it doesn't have other important ingredients. One of those ingredients Houser described as larger-than-life characters, because GTA games, he said, are exaggerated slices of life. A GTA experience would be like "a psychotic version of a Dickens book", he said, smiling. But a bigger problem is a lack of available guns here - a weapon Grand Theft Auto games depend upon.</p><p>"For a full GTA game: we always decided there was so much Americana inherent in the IP it would be really hard to make it work in London or anywhere else," Houser said. "You needed guns, you needed these larger-than-life characters. It just felt like the game was so much about America, possibly from an outsider's perspective, but that was so much about what the thing was that it wouldn't have really worked in the same way elsewhere."</p>
<p>Dan Houser left Rockstar in 2020 to create a new studio called Absurd Ventures, which is making a couple of open-world video games - one set in a science-fiction world called A Better Paradise, and the other within a comedy satire setting. A Better Paradise book has been released but other than that, we don't know anything about these games.</p>
<p>Given how long ago Houser left, he has had nothing to do with the making of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, which will be a notable change for the GTA series. Houser was usually the person who'd come up with the story the games would be based on, then hold the team to that creative vision as the game went forward.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I find it fascinating to hear Houser reflect on past GTA projects, particularly on the pressure the studio felt making them, because Rockstar often projects an aura of invincibility at the time.</p>
<p>"GTA 4 was very pressured because there had been all this pressure on the company - the company nearly imploded several times due to Hot Coffee," Houser said, referring to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/who-spilled-hot-coffee">the infamous reinstated-by-modders sex mini-game that people found in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a>. "It was extremely tough. So I think that felt very stressful. GTA 3, the company was basically broke, but I was young and I didn't really care. I wasn't living in the grown-up world yet. All of them had their own pressure."</p><p>But even years later in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, the company's most recent major work, there was enormous pressure on Houser and the studio. "With Red Dead 2, we were behind schedule, we were over budget so much I didn't want to think about it, and you're making a game about a cowboy dying of TB, and the game's not coming together," he said. "Turns out a lot of people doubt you at that moment; it's not a lot of fun. That was a lot of pressure."</p>
<p>I suspect that therein lies <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-is-leaving-the-company-in-march">the reason he ultimately left Rockstar</a>, after taking an extended break following completion of the Red Dead Redemption 2 project. His brother Sam Houser, however, remains there, as president of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>.</p>

            <p>
Original Saints Row design director Chris Stockman has revealed he wants to revive the open-world crime series following the poorly recieved 2022 reboot, and claims publisher Embracer Group has reached out to hear more.
</p>
<p>
Stockman departed developer Volition (which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-studio-volition-has-been-closed-down-effective-immediately">closed in 2023</a> as part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-has-reduced-its-workforce-by-over-1800-people-in-the-past-year">devastating layoffs across Embracer</a>) in 2007, shortly after Saints Row 1's release. Following stints at Human Head Studios and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/zynga">Zynga</a>, he founded VR-focused studio Bit Planet Games, known for the likes of Ultrawings and The Battle of Sol. But nearly 20 years after Saints Row 1's release, Stockman reckons he still knows what makes the series work - and it wasn't in the recent reboot.
</p>
<p>
"There's a level of expectations for a Saints Row game, and [developer Volition's reboot] missed the mark on all of them", Stockman <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2025/10/saints-row-creator-interview-gta-vi">recently told Esports Insider</a>. "When I found out that they were rebooting Saints Row, I spoke to an old friend of mine who was my old boss for Saints Row 1. He was the producer, and I was learning about what they were doing, and I thought, 'Man, this is a terrible idea.' What is it trying to be? You're rebooting it, but why are you rebooting it? There's a lot of characters in the series that people love. It wasn't Saints Row at all. Just call it something else at that point."
</p>
<p>
In the same interview, Stockman encouraged Saints Row owner Embracer to reach out, saying, "If you're listening to this, contact me. Let's go. I can bring much of the old band back together who worked on Saints Row 1. I could turn that IP around with a decent budget. They don't even have to fund it. I could get other outside people to fund it. I could turn the franchise around. I know I could." And it seems Embracer is curious to learn more.
</p><p>
"Guys and Gals, I have hopeful news!," Stockman <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintsRow/comments/1ok2dh3/ive_been_asked_to_a_create_a_pitch_for_a_saints/">wrote on the Saints Row subreddit</a>. "I've been asked to create a pitch for a Saints Row reboot! I can't say anything more than that but my dreams for this game just became a little more than just dreams!" Stockman <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/saints-row/prequel-pitch-original-director">later told PCGamesN</a>, he'd contacted Embracer himself after the original interview "created a bit of a fervour", and discovered "there is interest" within the company. "A pitch has been requested."
</p>
<p>
As for what Stockman has in mind for a potential revival, he "won't say much" at this point as he want to "keep my cards close to my chest, for now." However, he's keen to "bring the Saints Row franchise back to its roots", believing it has "strayed way too far away from that." He's also confirmed he's not envisaging it as a VR game and that he won't be bringing back the series' (at this point pretty iconic) giant dildos if Embracer bites. "I would've never put that abomination of a weapon in", he added on Reddit.
</p>
<p>
And despite Stockman's current caginess, his earlier Esports Insider interview might reveal a little of what he's got in mind. "What I would have done [for the reboot] was to take the franchise back to the 70s and do a period piece," he explained, "a prequel of how the gangs from the first one started. You're running around with a crew of teens that ended up as the main characters for the first game. You could really go all in on the 70s theme with big Afros, bell-bottoms, and the music of that whole period. I'd have taken it into a different direction so you’re not competing with the modern-day GTA games."
