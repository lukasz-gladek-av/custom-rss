<p>In a statement, FuturLab CEO Kirsty Rigden said that whilst the team "absolutely love and believe in VR", it wasn't "able to continue with support right now".</p>

<p>"We have been faced with a crossroads: we have a truly excellent and kind VR team who were working on a platform which costs us more than it makes, while also having a list of job openings that were looking to be filled on other projects," Rigden said in a statement posted to social media.</p>
<p>The VR team has now been redeployed to "other projects/roles".</p> <div>

<p>"Whilst I would love to live in a world where we could support PowerWash Simulator on every platform going, I will always choose job security for my team. Every time," Rigden concluded.</p>
<p>"While I know that you must be so disappointed, I also know that if you were in my position, you would have made the same decision."</p>
<p>Following a festive bout of generosity with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-sim-wants-to-put-you-in-the-festive-mood-with-this-free-christmas-update">December's free PowerWash Simulator update</a>, FuturLab recently announced the squirt 'em up's next blast of paid DLC, this time themed around Lancashire's premier Wensleydale gobblers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-simulator-aims-nozzle-at-wallace-and-gromit-for-next-paid-dlc">Wallace &amp; Gromit</a>. It doesn't have a release date yet, but FuturLab says it's out this year and "coming soon".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo is expected to finally unveil <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> in just a matter of days. 
</p>
<p>
Industry whispers Eurogamer has heard over the past week have coalesced around a reveal this Thursday, 16th January, with a focus on the much-leaked console itself, rather than a deep dive into its software line-up.
</p>
<p>
Today, these whispers were first mentioned publicly by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWifbMkXe_4&amp;ab_channel=NatetheHate">Nate the Hate</a> podcast, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-release-acclaimed-first-party-game-on-another-platform-report-suggests">previously leaked Microsoft's multiplatform publishing plans</a>. Writing on social media, The Verge's <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1878827836741673217">Tom Warren</a> confirmed he also understood Nintendo planned to reveal Switch 2 this week.

</div><figcaption>Everything we learned this week about Switch 2<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1BtAZoo1S0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
While Nintendo is yet to announce anything, and announcement plans are always subject to change, the growing sense that this week is - finally - the week we officially see Switch 2 for the first time fits with what Eurogamer has previously heard of Nintendo's announcement timing. 
</p><p>
Eurogamer has tracked Switch 2's road to release over the past few years and exclusively reported that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-demoed-switch-2-to-developers-at-gamescom">system's capabilities had been demoed to developers around Gamescom</a> in the summer of 2023. We believed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-switch-2-design-leaks-nintendo-keen-to-announce-console-as-soon-as-possible-analyst">an early 2025 reveal was imminent</a>, as Nintendo sought to wring one last Christmas from Switch 1 but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-now-very-unlikely-before-2025-analyst-says">faced a ticking clock for when it would then reveal the console's successor</a> before its own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">self-imposed 31st March deadline</a> - and amidst a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-lawyers-visited-genki-to-discuss-those-switch-2-leaks-reporter-claims">growing ocean of leaks</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's reveal of the Switch 2 hardware, when it comes, will finally put paid to speculation around the console's form factor, before an expected full reveal of the its launch line-up at a later date, it's believed. 
</p>
<p>As for the console's actual launch, Eurogamer previously reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hopes-fade-for-switch-2-launch-in-early-2025">Switch 2 will not arrive before April</a>, following earlier plans that saw its arrival <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-now-q1-2025-report">pushed to 2025 to ensure it arrived with the strongest launch line-up possible</a>.
</p>
<p>
An announcement this week also fits neatly after last week's industry focus on the CES trade show, and a week clear of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-announces-xbox-developer-direct">Microsoft's own Xbox Developer Direct</a>, on Thursday 23rd January.
