            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2: Edge of Fate</a> launches later today, but thanks to the opportunity to pre-load the expansion ahead of time, players have been able to hop into the title screen. It's there that longtime Destiny fans were welcomed with a blast from the past.</p>
<p>This nostalgia bomb comes courtesy of a music track that plays while on this title screen. The track is the main menu theme from the original Destiny! Originally composed by Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori, it's been long absent from the series for years until now.</p>
<p>Destiny 2: Edge of Fate is the first in the game's Fate Saga, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2s-getting-two-paid-expansions-this-year-and-one-of-them-is-star-wars-themed">and the first in its new approach to major game expansions</a>. Rather than the massive updates that came with The Witch Queen or Beyond Light, now medium-sized updates will be coming twice a year.</p>

<p>It's also been stated by developers at Bungie that a major goal is to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-can-it-ever-win-lapsed-players-back">create a "more curated experience" for new players</a>. This has proven a major thorn in the side of Destiny 2 for some time, as older versions of the game have been vaulted forever alongside all the accompanying content. For example, new players can't experience the story of the base game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2s-unpopular-removal-of-older-game-content-now-hampering-bungies-ability-to-defend-plagiarism-lawsuit">something which has proved vexing for Bungie in recent legal battles</a>.</p>
<p>It's a good start for the Destiny 2 team, who are fighting to win back some positive sentiment for the game after a lengthy string of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inexcusable-current-and-former-bungie-employees-react-to-sweeping-layoffs">layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-targeted-in-lawsuit-from-writer-who-says-bungie-copied-his-work">legal trouble</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-now-investigating-an-issue-with-rng-weapon-perks-days-after-telling-players-there-was-no-issue-at-all">embarrassing moments</a>. With Edge of Fate, the team has another chance to tempt people back. Whether it can remains to be seen.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-edge-of-fate-title-screen-blasts-fans-with-nostalgia-with-a-single-track]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>EA and DICE have been going about building anticipating for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">the next Battlefield</a> in some fairly unusual ways. The game's title has yet to be officially announced, and no reveal - of any kind - has taken place, yet.</p>
<p>The people making the highly-anticipated shooter instead decided to run an invite-only testing environment - dubbed <a href="https://www.vg247.com/topics/battlefield-labs">Battlefield Labs</a> - and have that, well, do the talking. It's clear DICE and co wanted to get the people who care most about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/battlefield">Battlefield</a> involved as early as possible, because it's them who'd be more than happy to generate that word of mouth organically.</p>
<p>Of course, you have to keep in mind that those same people are more than happy to tell you when there's something they don't like, too - and that's a problem when what that is seems integral to the vision of the game.</p>

<p>If you've not been paying attention to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-most-important-leaks-battlefield-6">any of the recent (and many) Battlefield 6 leaks</a>, the short version is that the game looks good! The art style is grounded, depicting gritty combat in environments where you expect it to take place. There's a big emphasis on destruction, combined arms gameplay, and a focus on bringing back <a href="https://www.vg247.com/battlefield-2042-128-players-massive-maps-reveal">the type of squad combat Battlefield 2042 abandoned in its attempt at Apex Legend-ifying the series</a>.</p>
<p>Crucial to the way a Battlefield game works is class co-dependency. In other words, each class is meant to perform a certain role, and it's only allowed to use certain weapons. It would be even better if each also had a distinct look and an easy-to-spot silhouette. Those inherent limitations give Battlefield's multiplayer its character, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> is chipping away at - at least - some of that.</p>
<p>DICE first revealed its intentions to alter the way classes work in the next game nearly two months ago, when it first allowed Battlefield Labs participants to test out a version of the game where any player could use any weapon, regardless of their class.</p>
<p>DICE's language at the time was a little soft; seemingly <a href="https://www.vg247.com/battlefield-labs-weapon-class-restrictions-community-reaction">intended to massage what the developer knew would be an incredibly controversial change</a>. The studio's argument was that it's building in-game systems to incentivise players to stick to their chosen class' recommended weapon type - so called Signature Weapon - and that players would need to play with those systems implemented first before they pass judgement on the direction things are going.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Will EA improve on the reputation of the series post-2042? | <span>Image credit: <cite>EA</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As it happens, that conversation started with a blog post that had a telling "part one" at the end of its title, which signaled that things <em>could</em> change. The <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/news/battlefield-labs-the-class-system-part-two">second part of that blog post</a> has since gone up, confirming that DICE is sticking to its guns on this one.</p>
<p>The biggest reveal in the post is that each class in Battlefield 6 will have two Training Paths, effectively branching roles with passives that enhance your character. Each path is structured into three levels that you progress through in the match itself, similar to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-4">Battlefield 4</a>'s Field Upgrades.</p>
<p>You get to immediately take advantage of level 0 of either track after you spawn, and you can expect a basic stat boost there. Levels 1 and 2 offer advantages specific to your class, and DICE says earning them can only be done through "teamplay progression and score XP." The third and final level is a single-use ability.</p>
<p>The progress rate and power of each node (and for each class) is what DICE is currently testing in Battlefield Labs. What's not changing, however, is that all weapons will be available for all classes. If you like the passives that come from using your chosen class' Signature Weapon, all the better - but the crux of this entire dilemma is that you can simply choose not to care.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>It's spent a while in the Labs, but we'll see it soon. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The arguments against this lack of weapon limitation are plentiful, and many of them are simply re-heated from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> pre-launch months. Players tend to land on one side over the other here, because of how fundamental class co-dependency - and the limitations therein -  are to what makes Battlefield, well, <em>Battlefield</em>.</p>
<p>More than what the change could do to Battlefield 6's gameplay, the general sense is that DICE developers are being "forced" into doing this by EA's upper management because it is seen as an instance of friction the game could do without.</p>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/behind-the-next-battlefield-game-culture-clash-crunch-and-colossal-stakes/">wide-ranging Ars Technica report</a>, EA is betting the farm on the next Battlefield. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reportedly-expects-battlefield-6-to-have-100-million-players-three-times-more-than-the-series-best-seller">It wants to bring in 100 million players</a>, and it's going to offer multiple ways of accessing the game to entice the largest possible number of them.</p>
<p>It's impossible to divorce that design decision from the report. Class co-dependency, weapon and gadget limitations are often cited among the reasons why many players could never stick with the series; they're as integral to Battlefield as Killstreaks are to Call of Duty. <a href="https://www.vg247.com/ea-call-of-duty-salt-mines-with-battlefield-it-doesnt-make-sense">EA doesn't want anything less than its own Call of Duty factory</a>, and the publisher even <a href="https://www.vg247.com/battlefield-call-of-duty-general-manager-ea">went as far as hiring some of the higher ups who created that model</a> with Activision's shooter series.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Can a refresh of old modes make a big impact? | <span>Image credit: <cite>EA</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The irony, of course, is that most players who tend to favour <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> have no problems listing all the many things that prevent them from having the same kind of fun in Battlefield, which means any one of the series' defining aspects may as well be significantly altered - or done away with entirely - in pursuit of taking away some friction.</p>
<p>There really is no way to tell how much that change will mess with the game's character, or whether or not it's even going to matter four, six or 12 months on from launch. For all we know, the game's rumoured battle royale mode may well be the mode that takes off and dethrones <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Warzone</a> as the go-to for casual players, leaving the core experience just to the Battlefield fans. Maybe then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-overhauls-specialists-with-new-class-like-system">DICE will have more reason to revamp that whole system</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/if-youre-worried-about-one-of-battlefield-6s-most-controversial-design-changes-dice-just-confirmed-your-fears]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> - the Schrödinger's cat of video games in as much as its development appears to be simultaneously alive and dead - is set to reveal its delayed 2.3 update tomorrow, 16th July, with CD Projekt seemingly hinting at a vehicular focus.
</p>
<p>
Cyberpunk 2077's 2.3 update was originally announced in June, despite development on the game having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-development-has-finally-wound-down-after-three-and-a-half-years">technically wrapped up last year</a>, with a planned release toward the end of the month. However, its launch was ultimately pushed back to an undisclosed later point after CD Projekt decided it needed "more time".
</p>
<p>
As for what 2.3 will include, all the studio would say previously is that it was "aiming for a scope similar to" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-22-adds-new-secrets-expanded-customisation-options-and-more">last year's 2.2 release</a>. That, by way of comparison, introduced a variety of fixes and quality of life improvements, alongside an improved photo mode, new car and player customisations, plus a new selection of "most requested" vehicles for purchase via Autofixer. Oh, and there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-night-city-infiltrated-by-balatros-giggling-joker-in-22-update-secret">that Balatro collaboration</a> too.
</p>
<p>
All of which brings us to tomorrow's <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1945136315705467297">newly announced livestream</a>. It's airing at 5pm, 16th July, on <a href="https://t.co/crpXzrC6VR">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://t.co/6RhhKsU0xa">YouTube</a>, with appearances from Cyberpunk 2 associate game director Paweł Sasko and Adrien Jouannet, lead Designer at Virtuos. Rumours <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-cdpr-isnt-actually-finished-with-cyberpunk-2077-announces-another-update">Virtuous had been drafted in to work on some sort of Cyberpunk 2077 DLC</a> first surfaced back in June.
</p>
<p>
CD Projekt's livestream announcement also features some very particular phrasing, strongly hinting this latest release will likely focus on vehicles. "We're driving into Patch 2.3 of Cyberpunk 2077 to check what's under the hood of the newest update," the studio wrote, before referring to the shows guests as "passengers" then wrapping up with a wheel emoji.
</p>
<p>
Cyberpunk 2077 has, of course, recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-a-cutting-edge-game-translates-well-to-nintendos-console-hybrid">made an impressive debut on Switch 2</a>, and a sadder, bloodier, and darker <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/when-people-are-sad-im-a-bit-happy-cyberpunk-edgerunners-season-two-is-going-to-be-sadder-bloodier-and-darker">second season of Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</a> is also on the way. That's alongside Cyberpunk 2077's eagerly anticipated - albeit distant - sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-feature-second-city-thats-like-chicago-gone-wrong-says-series-creator">Cyberpunk 2</a>.

            <p>The Pokémon Company has announced that <a href="https://x.com/pokemon_cojp/status/1945045929620349069?s=46">a Pokémon Presents livestream</a> will take place on 22nd July. This comes alongside a tease of Pikachu standing in front of what appears to be a DJ deck.</p>
<p>The stream will take place at 9pm JST, which is 5am PDT / 8am EDT / 1pm GMT / 2pm CEST. There's no word on what exactly will be shown, but given the teaser image one can assume it'll be some form of music-related game or service.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, Pikachu has tried his hand at DJing in the past. He and Gengar have donned DJ attire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/m8X3DBT_pio">at Universal Studios Japan as part of the Pokémon Halloween event</a>. Aside from that, there have been no music-focused Pokémon games, and neither Pikachu nor Gengar have shown up as DJs in card form.</p>

<p>So what's the deal here? Well, this is speculation, but one of two reveals seems likely. The longshot is a new music-focused Pokémon game that'll get revealed during the Pokémon Presents livestream. The other, a Pokémon music service. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-music-app-sees-mario-maker-take-on-spotify-and-youtube-playlists">Nintendo launched its own music app in October 2024</a>, and Pokémon is no stranger to banger tracks and catchy tunes.</p>
<p>That or it could be something totally different, and this teaser image has nothing to do with music whatsoever. With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> the next big release in the series, one wouldn't be surprised to see an update for that game featured as part of this livestreamed event. Either way, we'll have to check it out live to know for sure!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-presents-livestream-date-reveal-points-to-something-musical-rather-than-simply-an-update-on-pokemon-legends-z-a]]></content:encoded>
