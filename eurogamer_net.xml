            <p>It doesn't sound like Bob Odenkirk wants to play nicely with Nintendo's moustachioed Jack of all trades Mario.</p>
<p>Speaking with Eurogamer's sister site IGN at San Diego Comic-Con, Odenkirk said that he would, err, "kill" Mario, which sounds quite extreme.</p>

<p>For background on how we got to this unexpected and rather dramatic comment from the actor, Odenkirk had been chatting about his upcoming action thriller Nobody 2, where he plays assassin Hutch Mansell. The conversation turned to how Hutch would end the days of characters who had also gone on holidays during their own sequels, as this is the <em>very loose </em>premise of Nobody 2.</p>
<p>Anyway, after chatting about popping off the likes of Bernie Lomax from Weekend at Bernie's 2 by decapitation and finishing off the Brady Bunch by chucking them down the stairs, Nintendo's mascot came into focus thanks to his escapades in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>.</p>
<p>"I'll kill 'im," Odenkirk said looking at some images of Mario enjoying life on the beach. "I'll tear that moustache off his face, jam it down his throat, take those goggles, rip them to pieces, and stab him with those.</p>
<p>"It's gonna be bloody. Bloody!"</p>
<p>This thirst for Mario's blood comes "because of the smile," Odenkirk claimed. "I don't like that smile, it's too innocent." You can check out IGN's full conversation with Odenkirk below.</p>
