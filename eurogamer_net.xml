            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s second wave of physical Lego sets will include codes for in-game character skins.
</p>
<p>
The next batch of four Lego sets will drop in from the Battle Bus on 1st June - and there's a range of options to choose from.
</p>
<p>
Each contains exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a> minifigures, as well codes to unlock at least one in-game skin per set - something the Lego Fortnite range did not include with its first four sets released last year.
</p>
<p>
Joining the range is <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/peely-sparkplug-s-camp-77075">Peely &amp; Sparkplug's Camp, the cheapest option at £18</a> for a 250-piece set. This looks to be based on the Lego Fortnite Odyssey game mode, as it features replicas of its workbench item and wolf enemy. Minifigures included are, unsurprisingly, Peely and Sparkplug. You'll also get a code for the Sparkplug in-game skin.
</p>
<p>
Next up in size is the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/durrr-burger-restaurant-77076">Durrr Burger Restaurant, priced at £54.99</a> for a 546-piece set. This includes a corner of the burger restaurant seen on various older Fortnite maps, plus minifigures for Beach Bomber, Beef Boss and Grimey. You'll also get a code for the Beef Boss in-game skin.

<p>
Splash out a little more and you can buy the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/klombo-77077">Klombo set, priced £89.99</a>, which features Fortnite's lovable purple dinosaur as he appears in Lego Fortnite, plus minifigures for Oro and Adventure Peely. The in-game skin here is for Adventure Peely, which Lego Fortnite fans may have already from an earlier Lego Pass.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, this wave's centrepiece set is the enormous <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/mecha-team-leader-77078">£209.99 Mecha Team Leader model</a>. This is one of those big Lego sets designed to sit on a shelf and look impressive, rather than actually be played with - though at 45cm tall and weighing in at 2503 pieces, you're going to need a big shelf. 
</p>
<p>
Mecha Team Leader has been the star of a few Fortnite live events, most notably <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-fortnites-mecha-vs-monster-battle-played-out">the game's monster vs mech battle</a> that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-remix-finale-event-smashes-14m-all-time-player-record">remixed last year in a fight sequence featuring Eminem</a> (standard Fortnite). Included in the box are two codes each for both the Mecha Team Leader and Mecha Team Shadow skins. But is it worth £210? Hmm. You do get a Mecha Team Leader minifigure too...
</p>
<p>
Lego and Fortnite's collaboration began several years ago, with the launch of its in-game Lego Fortnite mode that has since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-fortnite-brick-life-is-a-major-new-social-game-mode-that-sounds-a-bit-like-the-sims">grown into several modes</a> and a platform for hundreds of smaller community-made minigames. Nearly all Fortnite skins now also have a digital equivalent (though not Eminem, in this case).
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-lego-sets-leak-including-99-battle-bus">Lego Fortnite's first four Lego sets</a> include a giant Supply Llama, a Durrr Burger, a large model of Peely Bone, and a recreation of the Battle Bus with around a dozen minifigures - that one really is very nice.

            <p>
Evercade seller Funstock has become the first notable hardware retailer to freeze orders for US customers due to the country's ongoing trade war with China.
</p>
<p>
At the start of April, sweeping international tariffs enacted by US president Trump have caused stock markets to falter and left companies struggling to react as the situation fluctuates daily.
</p>
<p>
Now, retro console and handheld seller Funstock, which handles sales of the Evercade in the UK and internationally, has said it will be taking "a cautious approach to the situation" by "temporarily stopping any new orders and pre-orders for US customers".
</p>
<p>
"Until we know more, we do not want to put our customers at risk of unexpected charges," Funstock said in a statement emailed to existing customers this afternoon, as seen by Eurogamer. 
</p>
<p>
"As soon as the situation is clearer, we'll release a statement on our shipping policies going forward. This pause in service will be effective from Monday, 28th April and means that customers in the US will not be able to make new orders on our website."
</p>
<p>
Existing US customers still awaiting pre-orders will need to sit tight for now, Funstock continued. 
</p>
<p>
"We are exploring all available options to ascertain what our customers can expect with their pre-orders and will update you on any changes by 17th June," the company concluded. "We will advise all customers with existing pre-orders what to expect by that date."
</p>
<p>
Orders to customers in Canada are unaffected, Funstock noted.
</p>
<p>
Funstock is far from the only video games company which has reacted to the US tariffs. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">Nintendo delayed US Switch 2 pre-orders until today</a> while it reassessed the situation and ultimately <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-raising-cost-of-switch-2-accessories-in-us-due-to-tariffs-but-console-price-to-remain-same-1">raised the prices of Switch 2 accessories in response</a>. PlayStation, meanwhile, recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">raised the price of PS5 in various countries, including the UK</a>, citing "the backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates".
