            <p>Don McGowan is an attorney who knows what he's talking about when it comes to understanding what Microsoft might do following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-microsoft-be-able-to-stop-the-white-house-using-ai-generated-halo-imagery-to-depict-trump-as-master-chief-and-to-promote-and-recruit-for-ice-depressingly-i-doubt-it">the Trump administration's provocative use of the Halo IP</a> on social media this week. He was a senior attorney at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> for three years. He was also chief legal officer at The Pokémon Company for a decade - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-pokemon-company-confirms-that-no-its-imagery-was-not-granted-for-use-in-disturbing-us-department-of-homeland-security-video">another brand recently abused by the Trump administration</a>. McGowan, currently a partner at KUSK Law and principal at Extreme Grownup Services, has given me an insight into what Microsoft's current thinking might be.</p>
<p>Quickly if you don't know: we're talking about The White House tweeting an AI-generated an image of Trump as Halo protagonist Master Chief, and the Department of Homeland Security tweeting an AI-generated Halo image promoting ICE, which showed Halo spartan soldiers on a Warthog jeep on a Halo ring world alongside a call to destroy the Flood - a thinly veiled and deplorable reference to illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Understandably, such use of the Halo IP has caused fierce backlash, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-administrations-use-of-halo-ought-to-offend-every-halo-fan-regardless-of-political-orientation-says-key-series-designer">including strongly worded reprimands from the original creators of the Halo series and games</a>.</p>
<p>But the question has remained, all through this week, what Microsoft intends to do about it, because it hasn't said or done anything noticeable yet. "If I were Microsoft looking at this situation I would game-out the benefits and drawbacks of making this an issue," McGowan told me.</p><p>"One of Microsoft's biggest customers is the US government. Think of how many Windows licenses, Azure instances, Office 365 licenses, etc. the government has. Why would Microsoft take a step that puts those at risk? Microsoft has a dedicated federal government sales team, which means if that customer goes away, so might those jobs.</p>
<p>"It's always worth remembering how companies see themselves to understand what they're trying to do," he explained. "Microsoft is a business software company (Nintendo is a consumer electronics company and Sony is a bank). As in: The list of brands Microsoft wants most to protect probably doesn't have Halo on it, and the customers with whom it wants to protect its reputation are institutional customers. The tail doesn't wag the dog. This might lead to a reduced customer base for Xbox but that's less of an existential problem than fighting with a government."</p>
<p>Were this situation left to McGowan to deal with - and bear in mind it's been 17 years since he worked at Microsoft - he told me the first thing he'd do is have someone make a call to the government and have a friendly word.</p>
<p>"I would have Fred Humphries, the head of [Government Affairs at Microsoft], make a call to someone friendly in the Administration and say hey, could you do us a solid and use someone else's IP for a while? That might be challenging because the obvious substitute IP is Call of Duty and that's theirs also, but still."</p>
<p>There are already clues this might have happened in <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1983604918239031569">the Department of Homeland Security's pivot to  using imagery from The Lord of the Rings films</a> instead of Halo.</p>
<p>"What I wouldn't do is anything public," McGowan added. "I might let <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> say something like 'we wish they wouldn't have done that' in an unrelated interview. But that's as far as I'd go."</p>

<p>There's also a related question of precedent here. We saw a few months ago the usually litigation-quick Pokémon Company seemingly do nothing about the egregious use of Pokémon in an ICE promotional video. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-flood-are-evil-space-zombie-parasites-and-are-not-an-allegory-to-any-group-of-people-original-halo-devs-hit-out-at-homeland-security-ice-recruitment-ad">McGowan told IGN</a> recently he wouldn't have touched this either, were he still working there, "and I'm the most trigger-happy CLO [Chief Legal Officer] I've ever met", he said.</p><p>Does Microsoft's apparent inaction here, in addition to The Pokémon Company's apparent inaction, open the door for other parties to use these IPs as they see fit, too? Does it create an argument of some legal weight whereby someone can argue 'hey they did it worse'?</p>
<p>"I'm a big believer that people and companies have the right to be capricious," McGowan told me. "Letting someone do a thing doesn't obligate you to let everyone do that thing, and so if you see a thing you don't have to stop it.</p>
<p>"Copyright isn't trademark where there's a legal obligation to stop people from infringing," he explained. "You can let someone infringe your copyrights without issue, except that a future judge might not give huge damages for future infringement on account of judges are people. But letting [Customs and Border Patrol, which is part of the Department for Homeland Security] do this has no legal impact in the future."</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> community is on the hunt for Easter eggs, with one persistent player managing to clip inside a hidden room attached to the in-game shooting range.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ok2yig/hidden_room_in_the_shooting_range/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Posted on the Battlefield reddit</a>, user Mobile_Cyberdemon_as showed off the process required to get past the door marked 'keep door closed'. Facing the door, look to the left and you'll see a small rubbish bin on the floor. By going prone on top of this bin at just the right angle, you can clip through the wall and access the hidden room.</p>
<p>What's inside the room isn't particularly exciting, with only some furniture and a helmet or two littered around, but nonetheless it raises the question of why it's there in the first place? It could just be a layover from a previous design of the shooting range, certainly. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ok2yig/comment/nm7oq32/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Though some players believe it could indicate a future expansion to the shooting range</a>, perhaps for vehicles.</p>

<p>Others have pointed out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ok2yig/comment/nm7ri9z/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">that the stripy background you can see on the walls of this hidden room looks the same as the background when you customise a weapon</a>, meaning <em>this</em> could be where the customisation actually takes place in-game. It's entirely possible, it's common for separate screens like weapon customisation to take place in the environment out of sight via usual means as to avoid lengthy loading screens.</p><p>This marks the first big discovery in Battlefield 6's inevitable hunt for Easter eggs, a practice that has flourished for years given every game in the series' hidden treasures sprinkled throughout the games. For example, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-mirrors-edge-easter-egg-in-battlefield-2042s-new-map">in Battlefield 2042 there was a Mirror's Edge Easter egg</a> tucked away on the map Flashpoint. Players were able to find a pair of red running shoes by a crane, a clear nod to a gaming classic.</p>
<p>So while this hidden shooting range room isn't the treasure trove players were hoping for, it is regardless a step in the right direction. Who knows, maybe with some more snooping, this room could reveal additional secrets… Or maybe it's a cool red herring. Only time will tell!</p>

            <p>Epic Games has announced that Sidekicks are coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, little pets that you can bring with you into the battle royale as well as other in-game experiences within the Fortnite platform.</p>
<p>These sidekicks are essentially another form of cosmetic that players can earn and, of course, buy. They are customisable, and can even be given cute little accessories. The first sidekick to come to the game is Peels, a small yellow banana dog who'll be present in the next battle pass starting the 1st November.</p>
<p>If you're not feeling Peels, there's another bunch coming in November as part of the in-game shop. This includes Bonesy, Spike, and Lil-Raptor. Epic Games has also teased that some type of cat sidekick is set to come to Fortnite in the near future too, so there should be plenty of options. And that’s before we get to the inevitable IP tie-in stuff that’ll be sure to rear its head in the future.</p>

<p>Sidekicks do not provide any in-game advantage, though they can be interacted with thanks to new sidekick emotes coming to Fornite. They also can "react to the world around you", though how exactly that works remains a mystery as of writing.</p><p>One quirk of the sidekick features is that a sidekick can only be customised one time after they're acquired, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/fortnite-battle-royale-c-202300000001636/gameplay-c-202300000001721/how-do-i-customize-the-appearance-of-my-sidekick-a202300000021343">as declared on the Epic Games help website</a>. You can, however, buy the same sidekick multiple times, and can own several copies of the same sidekick as long as their customisation options are different. So, for example, you can own one red Lil Raptor, and one green Lil Raptor. You cannot own two green Lil Raptors.</p>
<p>Who doesn't love pets in video games? Even if they are just cosmetics when you really think about it, a little fella running alongside you, doing tricks or dancing on command? It's a surefire way to please people, and on Epic's part, a nice way of tempting folks to spend a little extra this month on Fortnite.</p>

            <p>Amid Nintendo's ongoing patent infringement lawsuit against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a>, the company's initial efforts to patent a variety of Pokémon-style monster capture and throwing mechanics in Japan have been rejected.</p>
<p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">launched its controversial lawsuit against Palworld maker Pocketpair</a> last year following the game's<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-reaches-25m-players-in-first-month"> wildly successful launch</a>, accusing the studio of infringing  "multiple" patents. At the time, it said it was seeking an injunction and compensation for damages. In response, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-vows-to-fight-nintendo-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-fans-and-indie-developers">vowed to fight the legal action</a>, saying it wanted to ensure small studios could not be "hindered or discouraged from pursuing creative ideas".</p>
<p>Throughout all this, it remained unclear exactly what patents Nintendo was accusing Palworld of infringing, although evidence unearthed by legal observers suggested the lawsuit primarily<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-looks-to-hinge-on-pokeball-patent"> hinged on Pokémon's ball-throwing and creature catching mechanics</a>. Notably, one of the patents Nintendo appeared to be pinning its legal hopes on wasn't filed until <em>after</em> PalWorld's release - albeit appended to a pre-existing "parent" patent filed in December 2021. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/exceedingly-plausible-nintendo-crafted-patent-claims-to-specifically-target-palworld-says-ip-expert">one IP expert observed</a> at the time, it was "exceedingly plausible" Nintendo had crafted the patent application to specifically target Palworld.</p>
<p>Speculation Pokémon's Pokéball mechanics lay at the heart of Nintendo's lawsuit <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">appeared to be confirmed last December</a> when Pocketpair released an update to remove Palworld's Pokéball-style summoning mechanic. It later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-says-pokemon-lawsuit-will-prompt-more-disappointing-changes-as-it-continues-to-dispute-claims">removed a gliding mechanic</a>, saying it had to make "yet another compromise" due to the lawsuit. Since then, Palworld lawyers have argued, among other things, that the continued existence of games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a> - which all feature similar mechanics to those Nintendo wishes to patent - invalidates the company's efforts, and Pocketpair has continued to assert the "invalidity of the patents in question". And it now appears Japan's patent office agrees - in part and for now at least - with that stance.</p><p>As <a href="https://gamesfray.com/japan-patent-office-rejects-nintendo-application-relevant-to-palworld-dispute-cites-games-like-ark-as-prior-art-after-third-party-submission/">reported by GamesFray</a>, the Japan Patent Office has now rejected an application (specifically application no. 2024-031879) filed by Nintendo in March last year which attempts to patent certain capture and item-throwing mechanics. According to the machine translated rejection notice, the patent will not be granted in its current form as the "claimed invention(s) could have easily been made by persons who have common knowledge in the technical field to which the claimed invention(s) pertains", given evidence the "invention(s)" already existed "in Japan or other foreign countries prior to the filing of the patent application".</p>
<p>The rejection notice then highlights documentation provided by an unnamed third-party pointing to instances of similar mechanics existing prior to the filing in games such as Monster Hunter 4, Ark: Survival Evolved, Pocketpair's own Craftopia, and even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>. However, as GamesFray notes, the rejection isn't final, and Nintendo may still choose to amend its application in order to sway the patent examiner. It also stresses a final rejection of the application would have no "direct impact" on the Palworld lawsuit given patent office decisions are non-binding. That doesn't necessarily leave Nintendo in the clear, however; GamesFray says Japanese judges "tend to have respect for the determinations made by patent examiners".</p>
<p>Of course, Nintendo finds itself in an entirely different position in the US, where it was recently granted a patent covering gameplay mechanics relating to the summoning of a sub-character to let it fight another. Eurogamer spoke to legal experts at the time to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-nintendos-potentially-industry-changing-new-monster-battling-patent-enforceable-we-asked-some-lawyers">find out how enforceable that patent actually is</a>.</p>
