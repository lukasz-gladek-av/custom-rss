            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> director Guillaume Broche has said a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> version of the game "could be interesting", though it seems there are no firm plans as of yet.</p>
<p>The game released last month across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, but with Nintendo's next console arriving next month, speculation has arisen as to whether a port could be possible.</p>
<p>Speaking to French YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M14dRaYeAHM">mistermv</a>, Broche discussed how the success of the game "changes everything" and the studio is considering its next steps.</p>

<p>"Well, at this point, considering the success of the game, it kind of changes everything," said Broche (machine translation, via <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-switch-2-version-could-be-interesting-says-sandfall">MP1st</a>). "So clearly, it's too early to say, but we're kind of in a situation where... let's say there are a lot of opportunities showing up - way too many at once - and we're figuring out what we'll go for and what we won't. But yeah, it's definitely something that could be interesting."</p>
<p>By popular demand, the team is also looking into <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/expedition33.bsky.social/post/3lp4swutbys2p">plushies of the game's cuddly character Esquie</a>.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur was created by a core team of around 30 people (with extra outsourced support) and it seems its sudden success has been overwhelming. It sold<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-500k-sales-in-one-day"> a million copies in three days</a> and, despite releasing the same week as Bethesda's Elder Scrolls: Oblivion remake, the game's publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-oblivion-surprise-release-didnt-seem-to-harm-clair-obscur-expedition-33-success-publisher-says">Kepler said this didn't seem to harm sales</a>.</p>
<p>Still, its high-end graphics make great use of Unreal Engine 5. "Overall, I think Expedition 33 is a very good-looking Unreal Engine 5 title, and it's one of the most graphically pleasing current-gen RPGs," wrote Digital Foundry in its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-clair-obscur-expedition-33-tech-review-ps5-pro-series-x-s">Clair Obscur tech review</a>. "Despite a few minor quibbles, it's delivering a top-notch aesthetic experience that looks consistently high quality when exploring or engaging in fights."</p>
<p>But would the game even be technically possible on Switch 2? Digital Foundry's Rich Leadbetter told me a port would be compromised, "but it is too early to say how compromised as we've seen so little of UE5 on Switch 2".</p>
<p>Earlier this week, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-french-inspired-setting-was-originally-steampunk-london">in-development trailer for the game was unearthed on reddit</a>. It was originally called We Lost and featured a steampunk town and sci-fi elements.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> is continuing with its multiplatform strategy, despite a drop in sales of its games.</p>
<p>Its latest financial report shows a year-on-year drop in sales of its single player games, although profit was up due to the sales of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake which were "stronger... than initially assumed".</p>
<p>The likes of Visions of Mana, Fantasian Neo Dimension, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, among others, could not compete with previous releases <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>, or the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters.</p>

<p>Predictably, sales and profits of the company's MMOs have increased, notably due to the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> expansion Dawntrail last summer. Further, sales and profits of mobile games have dropped "sharply" as the company has closed many of its games.</p>
<p>Indeed, it announced today the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-cancelled-but-kingdom-hearts-4-still-on-the-way">cancellation of mobile game Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, then, the digital entertainment sector has seen an 18 percent drop in sales, but 28 percent increase in operating income.</p>
<p>However, Square Enix is in the midst of a "three-year reboot for long-term growth", which began last year when CEO Takashi Kiryu announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">company was "aggressively pursuing" a multiplatform strategy</a>, including "Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs".</p>
<p>So far, year-on-year sales of PC games have doubled - in the past year, previously console exclusives like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-final-fantasy-7-rebirths-pc-port-has-promise-but-too-many-problems">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-final-fantasy-16-is-highly-demanding-on-pc-and-these-are-the-best-settings">Final Fantasy 16</a> have been released on PC.</p>
<p>It seems Switch 2 will also be important for the company. Final Fantasy 7 Remake will be out this year (and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/full-final-fantasy-7-remake-series-heading-to-switch-2-director-suggests">seemingly the full remake series</a>), while Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster will be out at launch. Could other games be ported over too?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-gets-first-look-at-gameplay">Dragon Quest 1+2 HD Remake</a> will be the biggest new release of the year, set for release across Switch, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Windows, Steam). This will be followed in the next couple of years with "plans to release major titles" and "plans to release multiple titles on multiple platforms". By the third quarter of 2028, the company plans to "release major titles on a consistent basis".</p>
<p>The company also plans to release a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-mobile-officially-revealed">mobile version of Final Fantasy 14</a>, though curiously it's listed as "for China" in this report.</p>
<p>What other "major titles" are in the pipeline? There's the expected third part of the Final Fantasy 7 remake series, but outside of that could the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/official-final-fantasy-9-25th-anniversary-website-ignites-remake-hopes-once-again">rumoured Final Fantasy 9 remake</a> be a reality? A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-celebrating-chrono-trigger-anniversary-with-new-projects-sparking-re-release-hopes">remake of Chrono Trigger</a>? And when will whatever Final Fantasy 17 turns out to be see the light of day?</p>
<p>Square Enix's diversifying strategy extends outside of games too. There's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-and-magic-the-gathering-crossovers-sephiroth-design-hints-at-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-three">soon-to-be-released Magic: the Gathering card collection</a>, alongside various pop-up stores, concert events, and anime shows like NieR: Automata.</p>
<p>The company is also collaborating with Japanese TV network TBS on a "new IP based on transmedia expansion" - no further details have been provided.</p>
<p>As a result of all this, Square Enix is forecasting a further drop in sales for the next fiscal year, but an increase in profits. Without a major Final Fantasy release or Final Fantasy 14 expansion, it's certainly looking like a quieter year for the company.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Final Fantasy series producer Yoshinori Kitase confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-story-completed-producer-very-satisfied-as-development-continues-without-delay">story for the third part of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy is complete</a>. It remains without a release window.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has cancelled development of mobile game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> Missing-Link.</p>
<p>In a statement on social media, the company stated it would be "difficult for us to offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time". However, it confirmed that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-hearts-4">Kingdom Hearts 4</a> - the long-awaited next mainline entry in the series - is still in development.</p>
<p>Missing-Link would have been a GPS-based action-RPG similar to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> but with Disney characters and combat against Heartless similar to the mainline console games. Gameplay was shown at the series' 20th anniversary celebration.</p>

<p>"We wish to convey our heartfelt apologies to everyone who has been looking forward to the start of service," the statement reads.</p>
<p>"Although we worked hard on developing and adjusting the game in the hope that it would be enjoyed by lots of players, we determined that it would be difficult for us to offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time, leading us to the decision to cancel development."</p>
<p>The company thanked those who took part in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-kingdom-hearts-game-begins-closed-betas-next-month">multiple closed beta tests</a>, before concluding: "The Kingdom Hearts series will continue. We are hard at work on Kingdom Hearts 4, and hope you'll continue to support the series as you keep an eye out for further updates."</p> <div>

<p>The series has received multiple spin-offs outside of its three main entries across mobile and handheld consoles, with each extending the overarching plot a little further.</p>
<p>However, it's been six years since the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-hearts-iii">Kingdom Hearts 3</a> on PS4 and Xbox One, the most recent series entry.</p>
<p>Square Enix officially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-4-is-officially-on-the-way">announced Kingdom Hearts 4 back in 2022</a> for the series' 20th anniversary celebration, but little has been heard about it since.</p>
<p>Last year, series director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-4-will-lead-towards-a-series-conclusion-so-nomura-can-retire">Tetsuya Nomura stated the fourth game will be a reset of the story</a> but will lead towards a series conclusion as he looks to retire.</p>
<p>Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link is the latest mobile game to be cancelled by Square Enix.</p>
<p>Back in February this year, the iOS version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-shuts-down-another-final-fantasy-mobile-game">Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles was shut down</a> due to an ongoing bug. This followed the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-final-fantasy-mobile-game-ends-global-service-this-time-the-one-with-ariana-grande">Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dissidia-final-fantasy-opera-omnia-will-shut-next-year">Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia</a>, and Final Fantasy 7 battle royale <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-mobile-battle-royale-the-first-soldier-shuts-down-next-year">The First Soldier</a>, which were all shut down due to declining player numbers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
