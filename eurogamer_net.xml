            <p>As fans come to terms with the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> delay - from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1kd7oq8/i_built_a_gta_6_countdown_website_because_therapy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">creating countdowns "that are cheaper than therapy"</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1kdp5pp/i_think_we_need_to_calm_ourselves_about_the_delay/">pleas to "calm ourselves"</a> - at least one person is delighted by the news: Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 actor, Luke Dale.</p>
<p>Dale, who portrayed Hans Capon in the game, took a glass-half view on the delay, writing on X/Twitter: "WE'RE IN WITH A SHOT! GOTY!", appending the hashtag #KCD2.</p>

<figcaption>Here's Eurogamer's Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAljLcUMomM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>You see, while players have been salivating for the next instalment of the universally-acclaimed series - so much so that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss Strauss Zelnick acknowledged the fervor for GTA 6 is "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-release-date-is-still-secret-because-take-two-boss-wants-to-maintain-the-anticipation-and-excitement">the greatest anticipation [he's] ever seen for an entertainment property</a>" - developers and publishers of other games targeting a similar release window were understandably worried about accidentally butting up against GTA 6's launch. Even Gearbox's Randy Pitchford was forced to strenuously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-not-the-reason-for-borderlands-4-release-date-change-randy-pitchford-insists">deny that bringing Borderlands 4's release date forward</a> had anything to do with GTA 6 (which turned out to be true).</p>
<p>And of course, Luke Dale is <em>not</em> the only person in the games industry to have puffed out a sigh of relief yesterday - he just chose to do so publicly. The silver lining now is that games that have already released in 2025 - and those that had been holding back on solidifying release dates until  GTA 6'a launch was confirmed - can feel more confident about securing an accolade or two in award ceremonies or best games of 2025 lists (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/with-gta-6-delayed-to-2026-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-star-celebrates-were-in-with-a-shot-to-win-game-of-the-year-2025/">GamesRadar+</a>).</p> <div>

<p>We gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 three out of five stars</a>, writing: "This gorgeous medieval RPG continues to be just as divisive, prickly and abrasive as its predecessor."</p>
<p>Following a hugely successful launch that saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hits-1m-sales-in-just-one-day">over 1m people snapping up Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 in just 24 hours</a>, developer Warhorse Studios continues to plug away at its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-post-launch-roadmap-bringing-barbers-horse-riding-and-more">post-release roadmap</a>, mostly recently adding <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-gets-mod-support-a-barber-shop-and-over-a-thousand-fixes-and-improvements">mod support, a barber shop, and "over a thousand" fixes and improvements</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">Rockstar announced it was delaying the launch of GTA 6 to 2026</a>. The highly-anticipated sequel will now arrive for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th May 2026. Rockstar's confirmation of a delay follows months of speculation over whether the game would still make its 2025 launch window, despite assurances from Take-Two that the game was still on track.</p>
<p>No other information was announced by Rockstar at the time. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-first-trailer-released-early">Rockstar released GTA 6's first - and so far only - look at the game back in December 2023</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>MiHoYo has just dropped a new teaser giving us our first peek at the "brand new" Honkai game on the way.</p>
<p>Developer MiHoYo announced the news in a livestream, and while it didn't get very much away at all - not even a name at this point - the developer urged players to "stay tuned" in a 20-second teaser showing the familiar faces of Kiana, Blade, and what looks like, but is not confirmed to be, Pokémon-esque or monster collecting gameplay.</p>

"I think it’s called Honkai: Nexus Anima. In an investor briefing, they recently showed that GGZ, HI3, HSR are all under the Honkai IP, separate from Genshin/ZZZ/ToT which are their own IPs.

<p>EA announced the end of its partnership with the World Rally Championship earlier this week. At the time, it was not clear if - or how many - members of the Codemasters team had been impacted.</p>

<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/codemasters-confirms-layoffs-as-ea-owned-studio-shifts-focus-away-from-beloved-rally-games/">VGC</a>, EA again did not confirm the number of its colleagues affected, but did acknowledge: “As a business, we are constantly evolving to meet the growing needs of our players and driving greater focus across our portfolio.</p>
<p>"This has led us to look at reducing some roles, while we redeploy as many as possible against our strategic priorities," the statement concluded.</p>
<p>EA's decision to end its WRC partnership follows its announcement last year - made as it laid off 670 employees - that it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-further-lay-offs-this-time-likely-to-affect-around-670-employees">moving away from "future licensed IP"</a> toward its "owned IP, sports, and massive online communities".</p>
<p>The WRC news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reportedly-lays-off-over-300-employees-cancels-new-titanfall-game">followed yet more layoffs at EA</a>, reportedly affecting "between 300 and 400" employees who also lost their jobs earlier this week. That means around <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">2200 developers</a> have lost their jobs in the first four months of 2025 alone.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Epic Games has "exciting updates" for game makers, confirming the storefront will no longer take a share of revenue up to the first $1,000,000 profit a game makes.</p>
<p>Starting in June 2025, Epic confirmed developers will pay zero percent "revenue share on their first $1,000,000 in revenue per app per year", followed by its usual 88/12 percent revenue cut - with Epic taking the latter - on revenue earned beyond that.</p>
<p>This means games that don't meet the million dollar threshold will never have to share its profits with Epic Games.</p>

<p>In comparison, competitor Steam - much like other digital stores like the Nintendo eShop - takes around 30 percent, although Valve's store revised its Steam Distribution Agreement and revenue share tiers back in 2018 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-revises-revenue-share-policy-to-let-big-game-developers-keep-more-of-their-profits">so developers can keep more of the profits of their most successful games</a>, taking 30 percent on the first $10 million of revenues earned, 25 percent from $10 million onwards, and 20 percent on any revenue over $50 million.</p>
<p>But that's not the only seismic change, either.</p>
<p>"We’re making some exciting updates to the Epic Games Store to provide an even better deal for developers, starting in June," Epic announced in a <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/new-epic-games-store-webshops-and-revenue-share-update">brief statement</a>.</p>
<p>"In June 2025, we are releasing a new feature enabling developers to launch their own webshops hosted by the Epic Games Store. These webshops can offer players out-of-app purchases, as a more cost-effective alternative to in-app purchases, where Apple, Google, and others charge exorbitant fees.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Epic Games Store will take 0% on the first $1,000,000 of payments we process per game per year (vs 15% for Apple), and 12% after that (vs 30% for Apple).</p><p>Next month, we launch EGS Webshops for out-of-app purchases, as an alternative to in-app purchases.<a href="https://t.co/yTufyZbiqR">https://t.co/yTufyZbiqR</a></p></div>— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1917973199309987970?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>"With new legal rulings in place, developers will be able to send players from games to make digital purchases from webshops on any platform that allows it, including iOS in the European Union and United States."</p>
<p>To sweeten the deal, player spend accrued in Epic "Webshops" will also receive five percent Epic Rewards on their purchases.</p>
<p>The changes come after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-updates-app-store-guidelines-in-wake-of-seismic-judgement-paving-way-for-fortnites-return">Apple formally updated its App Store guidelines to reflect the dramatic decision</a> laid down by a US judge around alternative app store payments. In a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">fiery injunction passed this week</a>, Apple was told it could no longer dissuade app makers from offering other payment methods by applying a 27 percent commission on their proceeds. The move allows apps and games to offer direct - and potentially cheaper - options for in-app purchases, at least in the US.</p>
<p>In February, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-store-has-more-pc-players-than-ever-295-million-in-fact">Epic revealed 295 million PC players had used Epic Games Store in the last year,</a> up 25 million from 2023, and 898 million are using Epic cross-platform accounts - that's up 94m. Together, we've run up 7.72bn hours of playtime.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
