            <p>People are getting ready for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> in the very best way possible – by replaying the original, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>, in record numbers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date">Ever since Silksong's 4th September release date was confirmed at Gamescom last week</a>, more and more people have been heading back into Dirtmouth, so much so that Team Cherry's critically-acclaimed game has repeatedly broken its own concurrent peak player count on Steam over the weekend.</p>

<p>Right now (and "right now" is subject to change with alarming speed), Hollow Knight's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/#max">all-time concurrent peak of 39,356 players</a> was set less than an hour ago. And while there are plenty of games that have eclipsed that over the last few weeks, don't forget that Hollow Knight is an indie single-player game that's eight years old now.</p><p>Of course, concurrent Steam peaks are precisely that – an indication of popularity on Steam – but it's usually indicative of player counts on other platforms, too. But before the Silksong announcement, Hollow Knight's concurrent Steam peak, set back in 2022, stood at a much more modest 20K.</p>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong will release on Thursday, 4th September 2025 for PC, Switch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. Yet contrary to what you may believe, Silksong hasn't been in development hell for that time, however – in fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-silksong-hasnt-been-in-development-hell-hype-skyrocketed-sales-of-the-original-game-to-give-team-cherry-financial-freedom">Team Cherry's developers say they were just having too much fun making it</a>.</p>

            <p>Silent Hill series producer Motoi Okamoto has called comparisons of the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> to soulslike games "disingenuous", insisting "a lot of these things we actually pulled from classic Silent Hill titles".</p>
<p>The comment comes as more and more footage emerges in the run-up to 25th September's launch day. And while we already <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/silent-hill-f-launches-september-25-ps5-gameplay-revealed/">knew</a> the combat would have a "heavier focus on melee and be more action-oriented compared to last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>: Remake", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fandom-split-on-silent-hill-fs-soulslike-combat">fans have expressed concern about how enemies react, degradable weapons, and "soulslike" boss encounters</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/these-things-arent-new-and-exclusive-to-soulslike-games-silent-hill-f-producer-wants-to-set-the-record-straight-on-combat">IGN</a>, Okamoto – who has become a familiar face having worked on all of the games since the series was resurrected in 2022, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-the-short-message">Silent Hill: The Short Message</a> and Silent Hill 2: Remake – insists some of the things fans have seen in the videos "aren't new and exclusive to soulslike games".</p>

<p>"This is one of the things that we see – the term soulslike – being thrown around on the internet quite a bit," Okamoto said. "And I think it's a label that's a little bit disingenuous. Modern players will see like, oh there's a stamina meter, there's a dodge, and they're like, 'Okay, it's a soulslike'.</p><p>"But to be very honest, a lot of these things we actually pulled from classic Silent Hill titles. Look at Silent Hill 4 – there’s a charge meter for your attacks, kind of like our Focus meter. And even for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-3">Silent Hill 3</a> there's a stamina meter. You see it later on."</p>
<p>According to IGN's interview, Okamoto "expressed a degree of frustration with the online dialogue surrounding the game".</p>
<p>"These things aren't new and exclusive to soulslike games," he added. "They've been a part of action horror games for a very, very long time. If you have these things you're labelled a soulslike. And we'd like to reiterate we are an action horror game, but we are not a soulslike."</p>
<p>Silent Hill f was unveiled as part of Konami's four-game series revival back in 2022, but it took until the middle of March 2025 to get an update. Now that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Bloober Team's superb Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> is behind us, the publisher is turning its attention to this follow-up, a new mainline instalment set in 1960s Japan.</p><p>It's being developed by Neobards Entertainment (which has previously served as a support studio for Capcom's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>), with creature and character design by Kera, a script by When They Cry writer Ryukishi07, and music from the series' usual composer, Akira Yamaoka. It's set to release on 25th September.</p>

            <p>Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford admits he's a "little nervous" about Borderlands 4's "more challenging" difficulty.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-pitchford-nervous-challenge-borderlands-4/">Insider Gaming</a>, Pitchford acknowledged that "a lot" of Borderland players "aren't interested in deep, hard challenges", adding "we definitely have pushed the challenges quite a lot, especially with bosses and boss fight mechanics".</p>

<p>"We have lots of players that actually aren't interested in deep, hard challenges; lots of people that love just exploring the Borderlands or spending time with the characters," Pitchford said.</p>
<p>"I'm a little nervous because there are points of Borderlands 4 that are more challenging, but one of the coolest things about Borderlands 4, because of the nature of the RPG, is if anything is a little challenging for you, you can just grind somewhere and level up and become more powerful.</p>
<p>"You will find that things that were hard when you were a little chump will become trivial when you become a badass. But we definitely have pushed the challenges quite a lot, especially with bosses and boss fight mechanics."</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 was announced last August, and we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-borderlands-4-featuring-a-brand-new-planet-and-four-new-vault-hunters">finally got a first look at the looter-shooter sequel</a> when The Game Awards rolled around in December. Since then, we've had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-film-director-blames-flop-on-zoom-and-covid">thoughts on that Borderlands film flop</a>, a promise to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-will-dial-down-the-toilet-humour-says-narrative-director">cut back on the toilet humour</a> for the series' fourth instalment, and, as Matt described it, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/80-for-borderlands-4-too-costly-randy-pitchford-says-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen">putting his foot in it</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-slam-gearbox-ceo-randy-pitchfords-message-to-cost-sensitive-fans">so many times</a> on social media, it's a miracle publisher Take-Two didn't hide his phone. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-for-switch-2-wont-release-alongside-other-platforms-gearbox-confirms-but-theres-just-a-few-weeks-wait">Borderlands 4's elusive Switch 2 release date was recently revealed</a>: 3rd October.</p>
