            <p>Frontier has detailed its update roadmap for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-coaster-2">Planet Coaster 2</a>, with new features on the way from February until May.</p>
<p>The theme park sim sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2s-first-paid-dlc-releases-today-alongside-major-update">received its first major free update back in December</a>, alongside its first paid DLC.</p>
<p>The next update will arrive in February, bringing new features like custom video billboards, custom speakers, synchronised coasters, and interchangeable coaster cars.</p>

<p>As for new rides, there will be new stock coasters as well as the return of flat ride Pathos III. Other adjustments will include enhanced guest navigation; ongoing guest, economy and management enhancements; and ongoing stability and performance enhancements.</p>
<p>The third update will arrive a month later, which will allow guests to jettison off flumes (ouch) and add round-bottomed flumes and inflatable deformation. Water rides are a major part of the sequel, which Frontier is continuing to tweak post-release.</p>
<p>Other additions include making career maps available in sandbox mode as starting layouts, more stock coasters, and another returning ride.</p> <div>

<p>Two more updates will then take place in April and May, although these remain under construction.</p>
<p>While an image of the roadmap has been shared, Frontier noted it is non-exhaustive and the developer is continuing to investigate crash and bug reports. Each update will bring a full list of changes.</p>
<p>Lastly, the developer is also looking to bring back some of the themes from the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-coaster">Planet Coaster</a> game, with more to share in future.</p>
<p>"Planet Coaster 2's flexible creation tools are as compulsive as ever, but the fun butts up against an exhausting UI, uninspired management gameplay, and conspicuous content gaps that feel like cynical spaces for DLC," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2-review">Eurogamer Planet Coaster 2 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sony has released a video for its upcoming Until Dawn film, giving us our first tease at what horrors await those unsuspecting teens.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting snippets to come from the trailer is how the film team is going to adapt the game's branching narrative. As those who have played Until Dawn will know, characters can die or survive depending on the different decisions made by the player. There will be a variation on this mechanic in the film.</p>

<p>"One of the creative things the game did is that people make different choices and die in different ways," explained Until Dawn's film director David F. Sandberg, adding: "The movie has this mechanic where things start over and they get to try again" (cue plenty of intense breathing).</p>
<p>So, what does this actually mean for the film's characters? "Every time they come back to life, it's like they are in a new horror genre," said Sandberg. "To survive, they have to make it until dawn."</p>
<p>Along with this news, the trailer features actor Peter Stromare, who is credited simply as Hill. "I'm very proud to be part of this evolution onto the screen," he says, before the video jumps to posters of missing teens, as an ominous ticking noise plays.</p>
