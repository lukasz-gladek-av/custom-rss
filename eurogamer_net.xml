            <p>A little game by the name of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> just released, and it has thrown platforms into chaos.</p>
<p>As you can see from images captured by the Eurogamer team, the likes of Steam was brought to a grinding halt as many flocked to get their hands on the highly-anticipated sequel.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, several of us have been unable to add the game to our carts across Xbox, PlayStation and Switch. The PS store, for example, is stuck on Wishlisted at the time of writing.</p>
<p>
In the words of our Connor: "Steam it looks like every step has issues, trying to pay with Paypal is leading to error messages."</p>
<p>Are you having more luck than us?</p>

            <p>Daily <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> News, a YouTube channel and Discord server that has been posting constant updates on Team Cherry's action adventure game Hollow Knight: Silksong, has said farewell after 1694 days of uploads.</p>
<p>The final video, which premiered as Hollow Knight: Silksong became available for sale and titled The End, the video featured a stop-motion skit sending the channel off with a face reveal of the host Araraura. It's peak early internet energy.</p>
<p>Over almost 1700 days, Daily Silksong news accrued 234,000 YouTube subscribers and a Discord community of thousands of dedicated fans, lurkers, and posters. The live premiere of the final Silksong news video had over 15,000 live viewers, with longtime watchers saying their farewells at the cusp of the game's release.</p>

<p>Daily Silksong News was a running gag that transformed into something larger than its original intent. The vast majority of the channel's uploads are brief, with host Araraura announcing there was no news. However, on the occasion when there was news, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkjebOOXbX4&amp;ab_channel=DailySilksongNews">both Araraura and the channel's community would erupt with energy</a>.</p><p>Speaking to Eurogamer, Araraura expanded on his feelings now that the journey was over: "It feels unreal in a way, I got so used to Silksong just being 'a game that's not out' now that it's about to be it almost feels like I'm about to experience something that was out of my reach for so long".</p>
<p>As for how he'll be celebrating the release of Silksong, Daily Silksong News host Araraua will hang around with his friends and community members until the game goes live: "[I'm] probably gonna watch the DSN finale with my friends and stay on VC until the very last minute before it comes out after that I'm gonna go full blackout mode and enjoy Silksong on my own. No commentary or streaming, just at my own pace".</p>
