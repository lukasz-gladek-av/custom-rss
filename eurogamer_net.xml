            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>'s full original soundtrack is now available to stream.</p>
<p>Featuring original works by Swedish musicians Gustaf Grefberg and Jonatan Järpehag, the soundtrack - which Grefberg called "as fun as it gets" - is available on all the usual platforms, including Spotify, YouTube, Apple, and Amazon.</p>

<p>The playlist features 45 tracks, the synth score "providing the perfect backdrop to Mio and Zoe’s sci-fi and fantasy adventures with unique tracks ranging from atmospheric to high tension".</p>
<p>"Since every chapter in Split Fiction is so different, we wanted to do things similarly to the visuals and the gameplay and throw the player into a new world of music," Grefberg explained in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/news/spilt-fiction-official-soundtrack-out-now">Q&amp;A</a> about the game's music.</p>
<p>"Sometimes the inspiration comes from common genres like trance or drum and bass or cinematic new age music. Other times the inspiration originated from a single instrument. For example, the traversal music throughout most of Summit is based on our own live recordings of hangdrums. There are a few subtle references in there, but most inspiration is based on the foundations of genres or instruments taken in our own unique direction."</p>
<p>Grefberg explained that to create the dynamic score that jumps between different genres, the composers "sat down and played through with what we had, which often meant something very much work-in-progress".</p>
<p>"We discussed the overall feeling before we spent some time (usually one to two weeks, depending on available time) to just try out ideas and moods. We then sat down with Josef and listened together and came to a final direction. Sometimes we got them down right away, other times we went through a few iterations to get the feeling and mood that we all aligned with and Josef enjoyed."</p>
<p>Split Fiction shifted 1m units in 48 hours, and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">another million copies in its first week</a> - and now it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-has-broken-not-one-not-two-but-three-world-records">officially record-breaking, too</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, Guinness World Records revealed Hazelight's part-fantasy, part-sci-fi adventure "broke an impressive three world records within days of its release", becoming the most played local co-op video game on Steam, the most sold local co-op video game within 48 hours of release, and most sold local co-op video game within one week of release.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> developer Kinetic Games has outlined what's coming up in the first event of 2025, Cursed Hollow, when it launches on 17th April.</p>
<p>Fans can expect "new bone-chilling challenges and secrets to uncover", as well as a number of "exciting changes from previous events" including new reward categories, daily map rotation - nine of which have been seasonally decorated - and gameplay modifiers as you unearth mysterious Jackalope totems.</p>

<p>Players can also expect "additional reworks" recommended by the Phasmo community itself, including two different types of rewards: Community and Personal. Completing the former will grant points that go towards the wider community pool, whilst personal rewards are precisely that. However, to unlock personal objectives, players have to work together to reach the Community goal first.</p>
<p>"During Cursed Hollow, Ghost Hunters will need to work together to identify ghosts, complete objectives, and search for Jackalope totems hidden across the game’s maps," the developer teased. "But beware: interacting with the totems will have eerie effects, some helpful, and some that may hinder even the most experienced of teams."</p>
<p>"We're really excited for Cursed Hollow to launch next week, and once again have our players join together to tackle this season's Community goals," said lead developer and director of Kinetic Games, Daniel "Dknighter" Knight.</p>
<p>"We've made some changes this year following direct feedback from our previous events; from the new reward split, to some interesting new gameplay modifiers. Our community is everything, and we're always looking for ways to improve - we hope everyone enjoys what 'Cursed Hollow' has in store for them this Easter, and keeps the feedback coming on what they want to see in the future."</p>
<p>Cursed Hollow will kick off on 17th April and run for three weeks. Phasmophobia is available on PC via Steam, PS5, PS VR2, and Xbox Series X/S</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-marks-22m-total-sales-with-its-2025-roadmap-and-changes-to-maps-kit-and-our-humble-journal">The ghost-hunting sim has sold two million copies on console</a> since it came out of early access last October, bringing the total sales across all platforms to 22 million.
