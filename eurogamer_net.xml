            <p>
Nintendo has lowered its sales projections for Switch hardware and software, as the company faces one final Christmas focused on its current, aging platform.
</p>
<p>
Switch hardware sales were down 31 percent year-on-year for the three months ending 30th September. The company has now cut its total Switch sales forecast for the financial year to 12.5m, down from the 13.5m it expected previously.
</p>
<p>
After more than seven years on sale, the Switch stands at 146.04m units sold, just 8m shy of the Nintendo DS, the company's best-selling gaming device.

<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, released just before the end of September, shifted 2.58m copies before the end of that month. 
</p>
<p>
Other recent releases to sell over a million copies include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/paper-mario-2-thousand-year-door">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> (1.94m) and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/luigis-mansion-2-hd">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a> (1.57m).
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, the Switch's evergreen bestseller, sold another 1.37m copies, and remains by some margin the console's best-selling game. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's final sales update of 2024 paints a picture of a company on the cusp of announcing much-needed new hardware - though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-year-fiscal-year">provided no new word on when that announcement might arrive</a>. 
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>, or whatever Nintendo eventually ends up calling it, is expected to finally launch in 2025 and will be announced before the end of March.

            <p>If you were expecting to hear more about Nintendo's next console, which has been dubbed '<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>', during today's latest financial report from the company, I am sorry I am going to have to disappoint you. The company has made no new announcements regarding its Switch successor.</p>
<p>It does still plan to share more on its next console before the end of this fiscal year, however. That all remains the same.</p>
<p>Following the release of the company's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241105_5e.pdf">latest earnings report</a>, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa affirmed the next console will be announced by the end of March, 2025.</p>

<p>It seems unlikely that this announcement will happen before the end of the calendar year, however. According to Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda, making a new console announcement before January "has gotten quite difficult" for Nintendo, he told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nintendo-cuts-annual-operating-profit-forecast-switch-sales-slow-2024-11-05/">Reuters</a>. "You would not want to divert attention to an upcoming console in the middle of the critical year-end shopping season," Yasuda reasoned.</p><p>We got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">official confirmation of Switch 2's existence back in May</a>, when Furukawa first said the company planned on sharing more on the upcoming console "this fiscal year". At this time, Furukawa tempered expectations, adding we would not be hearing any more about the Switch successor during its then scheduled summer Nintendo Direct.</p>
<p>But, while we don't have an official look at the console, we know developers are now openly working on games for it. Meanwhile, several announcements recently have suggested games are coming to Nintendo's future hardware, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yooka-laylee-remaster-headed-to-ps5-xbox-and-nintendo-platforms-so-switch-2">Yooka-Replaylee</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-gets-first-confirmed-release-in-my-time-at-portia-sequel">My Time At Evershine</a>.</p>
<p>It was once said Nintendo wanted to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-successor-reportedly-due-late-2024">launch Switch 2 in late 2024</a>. Plans have, evidently, now shifted, and a report in August suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hopes-fade-for-switch-2-launch-in-early-2025">Nintendo's next console won't launch before April 2025</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere during last night's financial report, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-cuts-switch-sales-forecast-as-the-wait-for-new-hardware-continues">Nintendo revised down its expectations for total Switch console and game sales</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
New York Times tech staff have begun strike action in protest of alleged unfair labour practices, and are asking people not to play the Times' games - which include the likes of Wordle and Connections - in order to "honour the digital picket line".
</p>
<p>
The strike, which started today after "multiple rounds of intense bargaining" with management failed to reach an agreement, has been organised by The Times Tech Guild, a union covering 600 workers responsible for the creation and maintainance of the technology powering the New York Times' website and games.
</p>
<p>
According to a <a href="https://x.com/nyguild/status/1853418971585729013">statement</a> shared by the NewsGuild of New York - the labour union representing over 6,000 workers at news organisation in the area - the Times Tech Guild had raised a number of key concerns with management prior to today's strike. These include remote/hybrid work protections, "just cause" job protections (which the Times' newsroom is said to have had for "decades"), subcontracting limits, and pay equity/fair pay.

<p>
Times management are accused of engaging in "numerous labour law violations" during the bargaining process, including the implementation of a return-to-office mandate without bargaining, and the intimidation of staff through "interrogations about their strike intentions".
</p>
<p>
As a result, the NewsGuild of New York has filed unfair labour practice charges against the Times covering "numerous" violations of labour law, and work stoppage began at 12.01am ET on Monday with Tech Guild members picketing outside its Eighth Avenue entrance. Additionally, its newsroom union has pledged not to do struck work, as per their contract.
</p><p>
The Times Tech Guild's strike action is set to continue daily from 9am to 6pm if no progress is made during negotiations - threatening to impact the Times' US election coverage this week - and the union is asking readers to "honour the digital picket line and not play popular NYT Games such as Wordle and Connections as well as not use the NYT Cooking app."
</p>
<p>
"Our union members and bargaining committee have done everything to avoid this ULP strike," Tech Guild unit chair Kathy Zhang said in the statement. "But management is more willing to risk our election coverage than they are to agree to a fair deal with its workers. They have left us no choice but to demonstrate the power of our labour on the picket line. Nevertheless, we stand ready to bargain and get this contract across the line."
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/474209/new-york-times-strike-wordle-connections">response provided to Polygon</a>, New York Times spokesperson Danielle Rhoades Ha said, "We look forward to continuing to work with the Tech Guild to reach a fair contract that takes into account that they are already among the highest paid individual contributors in the Company and journalism is our top priority.
</p>
<p>
"We're in one of the most consequential periods of coverage for our readers and have robust plans in place to ensure that we are able to fulfil our mission and serve our readers. While we respect the union's right to engage in protected actions, we're disappointed that colleagues would strike at this time, which is both unnecessary and at odds with our mission."
