            <p>
Today is clearly the day Atari and Namco have sealed their reunion with pursed lips and probing tongues. Following the announcement of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pac-man-dig-dug-and-other-retro-favourites-get-the-interactive-museum-treatment-in-atari-50s-new-namco-dlc">new Namco-themed expansion for the excellent Atari 50 interactive museum thing</a>, the pair (along with third wheel Plaion) have cuddled up to unveil an <em>extremely</em> yellow Pac-Man edition of the Atari 2600+.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ataris-bringing-its-classic-2600-console-back-as-a-100-modern-day-faithful-recreation">original Atari 2600+ launched in 2023</a>, when it was described as a "modern day faithful recreation" of Atari's classic 70s/80s console. As for the new 2600+ Pac-Man Edition - released to celebrate the character's 45th birthday - it's pretty much the same thing, featuring mod cons like HDMI output, USB power, and multiple screen resolutions. However, the Atari 2600's timeless, woody hued design has been abandoned in favour of "signature pac-Man yellow".
</p>
<p>
And you know what? It's pretty tasteful in its own garish way. While the body of the machine is about as (Pac-Man) yellow as yellow can be, the spherical chomper and his old ghost pals make an apparently illuminated appearance on the front panel, while the black of the upper panel is broken up with a matching yellow cartridge slot and knobs.

"The Atari 2600+ Pac-Man Edition is more than just a console," manufacturer Plaion writes in the machine's announcement, "it's a tribute to the moment home gaming truly began. By reimagining the iconic hardware in Pac-Man's unmistakable style, we're celebrating the legacy of two cultural giants who helped define a generation of play."
</p>
<p>
If that burst of enthusiasm has you sold, you can pre-order the Atari 2600+ Pac-Man Edition starting 23rd July, and it'll cost you £129.99. For that, you get the machine itself, one CX-40 wireless joystick (also yellow), and a Pac-Man Double Feature cartridge, which includes Pac-Man's home console debut - Pac-man 2600, which released in 1982 - and Pac-Man 7800, a "brand new, arcade-style version of the classic".
</p>
<p>
And if you're after more than one Pac-Man CX40+ wireless joystick, you're in luck; they're also being sold separately for £29.99 each. But don't think you're limited to yellow. Plaion is also releasing Blue (Inky ghost), Red (Blinky ghost), Pink (Pinky ghost) and Orange (Clyde variants), and you can pre-order those from 23rd July too.
