As part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-007-first-lights-september-playstation-state-of-play-livestream-with-us-here">Sony's big Bond-themed PlayStation State of Play</a>, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has revealed 007: First Light will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, and PC on 27th March next year. Additionally, the studio has unveiled a collector's edition with a price tag likely to leave you at least slightly shaken if not completely stirred.
</p>
<p>
007: First Light was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-io-reveals-fresh-project">announced all the way back in 2021</a>, under the name Project 007, but it wasn't until earlier this year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-a-fresh-faced-whipper-snapper-of-a-james-bond-in-007-first-light">IO began discussing the game in earnest</a>. The gist is that First Light serves as an origin story for IO's Bond - part of what's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy">hoped to be a trilogy</a> - charting the iconic spy's early days as a "young, resourceful, and sometimes reckless new recruit". It's promising stealthy espionage, daredevil action set-pieces, cool spy gadgets, and seemingly everything else you might expect from a Bond game.
</p>
<p>
IO showed off some of that in more detail during Sony's latest PlayStation State of Play showcase, and you can <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-james-bond-preview-hitman-uncharted-comparisons">read more about 007: First Light's gameplay fundamentals</a> elsewhere on Eurogamer. But perhaps the biggest news of the evening was a confirmed release date. We already knew it was coming next year, but IO has now firmed that up into a 27th March launch. Additionally, it's also <a href="https://ioi.dk/007firstlightgame">announced a bunch of different editions</a> as pre-orders get underway.

<p>
Anyone that pre-orders 007: First Light's £59.99/€69.99/$69.99 USD Standard digital edition - which can be purchased for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) - will be upgraded to the Deluxe Edition at no extra cost. This gets you the game itself, 24 hours of early access, and a Deluxe Upgrade cosmetics bundle featuring four exclusive outfit skins, one new weapon skin, and the Gleaming pack. After launch, the Deluxe Edition will cost £69.99/€79.99/$79.99 USD.
</p><p>
There's also a physical release - known as the Specialist edition - featuring all the above plus the Classic Tuxedo Skin, for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC. And for the big spenders out there, IO is releasing a limited edition Legacy variant. This physical-only release for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC costs a not-insignificant £259.99/€299.99/$299.99 USD and includes everything featured in other editions, plus a couple of exclusive weapon and outfit skins, a Golden Gun figurine with a stand and secret compartment, a certificate of authenticity, and a magnetic steel case. Oh, and a great big box.

Whether IO Interactive can pull off its ambitious Bond origin story remains to be seen, but Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-one-trailer-io-interactive-has-totally-proven-it-gets-bond-and-its-all-about-the-salivating-consumerism">previously opined that signs are good</a>. "In one trailer, [the Hitman studio] has totally proven it 'gets' Bond," he wrote, "and it's all about the salivating consumerism."
