            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/reanimals">Reanimal</a> might be flying under many radars, but it's one of the most promising horror games set to be released in 2026. Ahead of its February launch, Tarsier Studios wants to make sure we know what's coming next month and beyond.</p>
<p>On 20th January, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2129530/view/217994805837303288">the dev team took to Steam</a> to explain what's going on with the game's post-launch plans and the (already available) demo. A full FAQ is set to arrive "within two weeks before launch," but Tarsier has now confirmed three DLC packs (included in its more expensive Deluxe Edition) are locked, with more information on them coming soon. As for a separate original soundtrack release, it's unlikely it'll be available at launch, but there's some interest in making it available at a later date.</p>
<p>We've also received immediate announcements pertaining to the aforementioned demo and the game on PC. The former, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-nightmares-studios-new-horror-reanimal-gets-console-demo-and-february-release-date">available on consoles</a> as well, will be updated soon in order to "reflect the up-to-date, more polished state" of Reanimal as it nears completion. PC gamers can also look now at provisional system requirements which "are not likely to change":</p>
<p><strong>Minimum:</strong></p>
<p>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</p>
<p>OS: Windows 10/11</p>
<p>Processor: Ryzen 5 2400G / Core i5-9400F</p>
<p>Memory: 8 GB RAM</p>
<p>Graphics: GeForce GTX 1060 / Radeon RX 480</p>
<p>DirectX: Version 12</p>
<p>Network: Broadband Internet connection</p>
<p>Storage: 18 GB available space</p>
<p><strong>Recommended:</strong></p>
<p>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</p>
<p>OS: Windows 10/11</p>
<p>Processor: Ryzen 5 3600X / Core i7-7700KTBD</p>
<p>Memory: 16 GB RAM</p>
<p>Graphics: GeForce RTX 2060 / Radeon RX 6600XTTBD</p>
<p>DirectX: Version 12</p>
<p>Network: Broadband Internet connection</p>
<p>Storage: 18 GB available space</p>

<p>Last but not least, on 15th January, Tarsier also confirmed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2129530/view/217994805837300749">Reanimal is getting the friend's pass treatment</a> like recent co-op hits such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">Split Fiction</a>. This means you'll be able to invite pals to play the game with you even if they don't own it (and as long as they aren't scaredy-cats). Local co-op and single-player modes are available too.</p>
<p>Reanimal is confirmed to release on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on 13th February, making it the perfect Valentine's date night pick for horror aficionados.</p>

            <p>The creator of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s R.E.A.L VR mod, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-removed-by-cd-projekt-after-its-creator-wouldnt-release-it-for-free">which was taken down earlier this week following a DMCA strike by CD Projekt Red</a>, has stated that he's being punished by pirates sharing his mods online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/creator-of-dmcad-cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-says-people-are-now-pirating-it-to-punish-him-for-breaking-cd-projekts-terms-of-service">In a statement to IGN</a>, who reached out to creator Luke Ross asking he would consider making the Cyberpunk 2077 mod free, he responded by saying that it would take a considerable amount of work, and that he believed there was little point in doing so thanks to rampant piracy.</p>
<p>"I do not rule out releasing the mod free for everyone [...] but it would take time, because my software supports 40+ games and various completely different engines, which makes creating a version that specifically supports only Cyberpunk 2077 a non-trivial task. Also, the people who have voluntarily given their money to me in order to support my development efforts for the framework might not be happy about seeing the mod being given away all of a sudden to everyone just because I've been bullied into it."</p>

<p>Ross continued, stating: "Anyway, it's kind of become a moot point, because following to the unexpected DMCA strike, after the mod was forcibly removed from my Patreon, people afraid of losing VR support for their favorite games have started pirating and illegally exchanging the mod all over the Internet, brazenly saying that since I was not complying with CDPR's ToS, my work is now fair game and I should be punished by having it stolen. So in a sense CDPR already got what they wanted."</p><p>The mod itself wasn't the reason why Ross received an NDA, rather its availability behind a Patreon paywall behind several other R.E.A.L VR mods Ross has created over the years. This, according to CD Projekt Red, broke its 'fan guidelines' document, which prevents selling content derived from CD Projekt's works for money.</p>
<p>The company also stated, in a document shared by Ross, the following: "We're happy for you to accept reasonable donations in connection with your fan content, but you're not allowed to make people pay for it or have it behind any sort of paywall (e.g. don't make content only available to paid subscribers)"</p>
<p>Ross publicly pushed back against this, writing on his Patreon page: "In the end it amounted to the same iron-clad corpo logic: every little action that a company takes is in the name of money, but everything that modders do must be absolutely for free</p>
<p>"As usual they stretch the concept of 'derivative work' until it's paper-thin, as though a system that allows visualising 40+ games in fully immersive 3D VR was somehow built making use of their intellectual property".</p>
