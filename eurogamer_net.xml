            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wyrdsong">Wyrdsong</a>, the next game from a team of former Bethesda and Obsidian RPG veterans, is struggling on with a "skeleton crew" after further departures from its team and a rescoping of the game. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/talking-to-the-former-fallout-76-lead-about-their-new-studio-and-occult-rpg-wyrdsong">Wyrdsong was announced back in 2022 as the first project from Something Wicked Games</a>, a new studio helmed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> lead Jeff Gardiner and Obsidian veteran Charles Staples. However, progress on Wyrdsong has been hampered by the team struggling to find further financial backing. 
</p>
<p>
After an initial investment from NetEase, funding ran dry 12 months ago <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wyrdsong-developer-something-wicked-reportedly-impacted-by-layoffs">leading to the departure of "most of" the game's team</a>. Now, speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/wyrdsong-the-rpg-from-ex-bethesda-talent-isnt-dead-but-its-no-longer-an-open-world-were-down-to-a-skeleton-crew/">PC Gamer</a>, Gardiner has revealed further departures - including that of his co-founder Staples and of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-lead-quest-designer-joins-other-ex-bethesda-developers-at-wyrdsong-studio">former Starfield lead quest designer Will Shen</a>, who quit Bethesda to join the project.
</p>
<p>Wyrdsong has been reshaped as a consequence of these departures, to try and make the game more managable to fund and be finished.</p>
<p>
"We were making a big open-world RPG," Gardiner said. "The way I have learned to do them requires a lot of people to do that, which means a lot of money that was not forthcoming in the industry."
</p>
<p>
Wyrdsong was announced as a historical fantasy game with supernatural elements set in Portugal around the forming of the Knights Templar. It was originally envisioned as being an open-world game, but this has been dropped in favour of a map with zones that are more managable to develop and explore. A roguelite system has also been added, Gardiner revealed, which fitted with the game's story of exploring what happened after death. 
</p>
<p>
For now, Gardiner is pushing on with the project, but admits that its future looks "very tough".
</p>
<p>
"We're down to a skeleton crew, and I am continuing to work hard to try to find further investment or publishing offers for the game. I'm hoping to sometime this year, but we're just trying to hang on to ride out the storm, which a lot of people thought was going to be over in 2025 and I do not see that reality at all currently."

            <p>Sony Pictures is working on a new Starship Troopers movie with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gran-turismo-film-review-a-marketing-exercise-filled-with-contrived-drama">Gran Turismo filmmaker Neill Blomkamp</a> - and to be clear, this is completely separate from Sony Pictures' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">which was announced earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>The upcoming Starship Troopers film from Sony won't be based on the 1997 film that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> draws a lot of inspiration from. Rather, as reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/starship-troopers-neill-blomkamp-1236327071/">Deadline</a>, this Sony Starship Troopers film will instead go back to the 1959 sci-fi novel as its source material, which was written by Robert A. Heinlein.</p>
<p>"Plot details for the new incarnation [are] under wraps, but I betcha the movie is about astronauts versus bugs," reads Deadline's report. So, that sounds a lot like what I assume the Helldivers 2 film - which, again, is also in the works with Sony Pictures - will be about...</p>

</figure>
<p>Back in January, Arrowhead CCO Johan Pilestedt confirmed the Helldivers 2 developer will be involved with the upcoming film, but in a somewhat limited capacity. The exec said the game's development team "are not Hollywood people", and therefore "don't know what it takes to make a movie".</p>
<p>The studio's CEO Shams Jorjani still has some ideas for the Helldivers 2 film, though. Writing on Discord following the announcement, Jorjani quipped he wants as "many A-list actors as possible" to be part of the film, but there is a condition - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-will-be-involved-in-film-adaptation-but-not-as-much-as-you-may-have-hoped">he wants those actors to "get killed violently immediately"</a>.</p>

            <p>People Can Fly - the developer of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outriders">Outriders</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bulletstorm">Bulletstorm</a> - has signed a deal with PlayStation to work on a new project based on an existing Sony series.</p>
<p>Further details remain slim for now, though it has been confirmed the upcoming release is codenamed Project Delta, and that it is based on a franchise to which Sony holds the intellectual property rights.</p>

<p>Word of this upcoming Sony collaboration comes from <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250313-current-report-no-4-2025-conclusion-of-pda-with-sony-delta.pdf">a report published by People Can Fly</a> itself. Here, the studio stated it had entered into a work-for-hire agreement with the PlayStation maker.</p>
<p>So, what could it be? Well, call me optimistic, but I am thinking of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killzone">Killzone</a>. Sure, last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/killzone-developer-done-with-series-guerrilla-says-of-switch-to-horizon">developer Guerrilla made it sound like it was done with Killzone</a>, instead now favouring its Horizon series, but that doesn't mean Sony is… right?</p> <div>

            <p>
The latest <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> game did not perform well for publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, it's been claimed.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, which launched last autumn to a mixed response from fans, resulted in "large losses" for the company, <a href="https://kabutan.jp/news/marketnews/?b=n202503130535">Kabutan analyst Hideki Yasuda stated</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ffxvi-has-apparently-sold-3-5-million-copies-could-be-old-numbers-read-op.1133091/">ResetEra</a>/<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-sales-financial-report-large-loss-square-enix-sequel-unlikely/">TheGamer</a>).
</p>
<p>
Officially, Square Enix is yet to comment on Double Exposure's performance - and there's been no word on Double Exposure's sales figures pubicly at all. Deck Nine, the game's developer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-studio-deck-nine-makes-more-cuts-to-staff">previously announced layoffs at the studio in the wake of the game's launch</a>, and it's unclear what's next for the franchise - despite Double Exposure ending with a message stating that protagonist Max Caulfield would "return".

<p>
Last week, Square Enix issued its most <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/25q3earnings.pdf">recent financial results</a> - which largely focus on the sales of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake and the successful launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> expansion Dawntrail. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps tellingly, there's no notice of how Life is Strange: Double Exposure sold. Instead, Square Enix simply says that its HD gaming division's revenues had fallen due to the fact that unnamed "new titles generated lower sales"  than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster and Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince did over the same period during the previous year.
</p>
<p>
Square Enix doesn't state what the new titles that underperformed were, but does say that the launch of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D helped offset these losses, as it had performed better than initially expected.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Yasuda and Square Enix for more detail. The company is yet to release a transcript of the financial briefing that includes shareholder questions.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposures-first-two-chapters-are-mostly-good-but-making-fans-pay-extra-to-play-early-is-a-huge-mistake">Life is Strange: Double Exposure launched amidst a major backlash from fans</a> upset at how the game handled the ongoing storyline of returning protagonist Max Caulfield, and the impact of players' choice at the beginning of Life is Strange 1. 
</p>
<p>
The situation turned uglier when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-fans-upset-after-square-enix-removes-reddit-posts-featuring-leaked-content-anonymous-developer-comments">Square Enix removed leaked development material from a popular Life is Strange fan reddit</a>, including posts by several anonymous commenters who provided proof they worked at Deck Nine, and who made a number of claims regarding how Double Exposure's story had changed through development, shaped by feedback from Square Enix itself. In response, Square Enix said it had acted to remove the content based on "appropriate legal requirements" for "intellectual property violations".
</p>
<p>
"Like its own hero's dabbling with time travel, Life is Strange: Double Exposure highlights the troubles of trying to revisit old memories, while raising unanswered questions about the future," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review">Eurogamer's Life is Strange: Double Exposure review</a>.
