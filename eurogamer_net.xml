            <p>PlayStation legend Shuhei Yoshida departed the company earlier this week after more than 30 years. Today it's been announced he's landed his first ever video game voice role.</p>
<p>Yoshida has been revealed as part of the cast for Promise Mascot Agency, the next game from Paradise Killer studio Kaizen Game Works (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/promise-mascot-agency-voice-cast-includes-playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-and-deadly-premonition-dev-swery">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>His role? A bright green, bird-like mascot called MonouGe who "just loves games".</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement">Yoshida announced he would leave PlayStation</a> back in November last year. He was the boss of PlayStation Worldwide Studios from 2008 - 2019, after which he was focused on PlayStation's indie developer support.</p>
<p>In 2023, he was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-shuhei-yoshida-awarded-bafta-games-fellowship">awarded the BAFTA Games Fellowship</a> for his contributions to the industry.</p> <div>

<p>"I've been with PlayStation from the beginning, and this is my 31st year with PlayStation," Yoshida said in November, announcing his departure. "And when I hit 30 years, I was thinking, hmm, it may be about time for me to move on.</p><p>"You know, the company's been doing great," he continued. "I love PS5, I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of management who I respect and admire. And I'm so excited for the future of PlayStation."</p>
<p>I'm not sure anyone expected him to move into voice acting, though.</p>

            <p>Chinese conglomerate <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> and Ubisoft's founding Guillemot family are reportedly considering a new venture using a foundation of Ubisoft assets.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-15/tencent-guillemot-family-are-said-to-mull-ubisoft-asset-venture?leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> (paywall), the two companies will create this venture and then move select Ubisoft assets over, with sources close to the matter stating this is an attempt to give Ubisoft's value an overall boost.</p>
<p>Tencent and Ubisoft are said to be in the process of evaluating which assets to include in this venture. "A potential deal would allow Tencent to own a stake in the venture and gain more control over some of Ubisoftâ€™s intellectual properties, while boosting its video game business outside of China," the report reads.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, no final decisions have been made with regard to this alleged venture between Tencent and Ubisoft. However, we already knew Ubisoft was looking at ways to try and increase its value.</p>
<p>As outlined earlier this month, the Assassin's Creed and Far Cry maker has appointed advisors to "review and pursue various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders". Meanwhile, last October, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-considering-buyout-taking-the-company-private-report">Tencent and Ubisoft were considering a buyout</a>. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-discussing-buyout-options-with-tencent">similar report was then released in December</a>.</p><p>Last year was a particularly bumpy one for Ubisoft. The company suffered at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suffers-third-round-of-job-losses-this-year">least three rounds of layoffs</a>, as well as staff walkouts, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">disappointing sales for titles such as Star Wars Outlaws</a>. Ubisoft additionally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-shutting-studios-laying-off-277-employees-as-it-pulls-plug-on-live-service-shooter-xdefiant">pulled the plug on live-service shooter XDefiant</a>, and shuttered a number of studios.</p>
<p>In the last week, Ubisoft delayed the next instalment in its Assassin's Creed series - Shadows - once again. The upcoming game was initially due to release in 2024, before its launch was then pushed to 14th February.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">Assassin's Creed Shadows will now release on 20th March</a>, Ubisoft announced last week.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> merch is releasing, even though we still don't actually have a date for the game itself.</p>
<p>Konami's upcoming remake was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-announced">first announced back in May 2023</a>, and will retain the 2004 original's story. This story follows Naked Snake on an operation deep within the Soviet jungle, some 31 years before the events of Metal Gear.</p>
<p>Around this time last year, it was then suggested by PlayStation that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-gives-2024-release-window-to-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-and-silent-hill-2-remake">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater would release at some point in 2024</a>. However, that obviously did not happen. We are now two weeks into 2025, and a release date still remains unknown. But, what we do have in lieu of a date for the game is a date forâ€¦ Funko Pops. Yay?</p>

<p>The Funko Pops in question are modelled on the two main characters in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater â€“ Naked Snake and The Boss.</p>
<p>Naked Snake's figurine is wielding his combat knife. "This skilled soldier is sure to prove himself an invaluable asset to your POP! Games lineup," reads the Amazon description.</p>
<p>The Boss, meanwhile, has her signature The Patriot weapon in her hands and will also "prove herself an invaluable asset to your POP! Games lineup."</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0D98SHGXZ,B0D98W27ML&amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;tag=distrackers-20&amp;linkId=0ba0328aa880433028e4734d8a191b95&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Amazon sale's page</a>, these Funko Pops will be available on 25th March, in America at least (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/DisTrackers/status/1878859570199875716?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1878859570199875716%7Ctwgr%5E84317e71e7c588a514aa5a0a9e82664bf76eca54%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fmetal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-funko-pops-before-release-date%2F">DisTrackers</a>). So, could we maybe see a release date for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater around then? Well, we will let you know as soon as Konami lifts the lid on the game's launch.</p>

<p>Last year, series producer Noriaki Okamura said Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is being remade as Konami believed that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-is-being-remade-as-konami-says-younger-generation-now-unfamiliar-with-the-series">"younger generation" was now unfamiliar with the series</a>.</p>
<p>Also, did you know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/20-years-later-konami-confirms-fan-suspicions-metal-gear-solid-3s-eva-was-voiced-by-the-little-mermaid">Metal Gear Solid 3's Eva was actually voiced by the same actor who played Ariel in Disney's The Little Mermaid.</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
