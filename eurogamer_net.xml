            <p>Nintendo has announced another game coming to the mature corner of its Switch Online subscription service. That game is shooter Forsaken 64, which first released on Nintendo 64 all the way back in 1998.</p>
<p>When Forsaken 64 arrives on 4th September, it will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-online-adds-mature-games-selection-starting-with-perfect-dark-and-turok">join the likes of Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and Perfect Dark for those members aged 17 and up</a>.</p>

<p>"You are a ruthless mercenary, sent to the condemned remains of Earth as part of a covert operation codenamed Forsaken," the official blurb teases. "Your mission is to infiltrate and destroy the last bastions of the mechanised terror that wiped out all life on the planet. Earth is a death trap riddled with merciless mechanoid adversaries and gangs of rival bounty hunters, and you'll have to brave them all astride your anti-grav pioncycle to make your fortune...or meet your doom." Sounds chill.</p>
<p>As per Nintendo, players will be able to join in either single or multiplayer mode. "Then, select your bike," the company says, noting that each bike has different attributes, and each biker has a "different attitude". So, just find the one you vibe with the most, and drive on into the fray.</p>
<p>"The availability of weapons, enemies, and powerups changes depending on the level you play, so stay sharp," Nintendo closes. You can check out a trailer for Forsaken 64 below.</p>

            <p>Microsoft's Perfect Dark reboot could have been saved from cancellation by Take-Two.</p>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/-perfect-dark-developer-lays-off-staff-after-funding-deal-falls-through">Bloomberg</a>, the publishing giant was in talks with Embracer - which owns Perfect Dark co-development studio Crystal Dynamics - and was willing to acquire the project from Microsoft. Had this deal gone through, the plan would have been for Take-Two to then fund and publish Perfect Dark itself.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>However, according to Bloomberg's sources, this deal was ultimately never realised due to "disagreements over long-term ownership of the Perfect Dark franchise". Crystal Dynamics was therefore forced to abandon the game and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">lay off staff towards the end of last month</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-announced">Perfect Dark reboot was initially announced back in 2020</a>, with Microsoft studio The Initiative set to lead development. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-perfect-dark-reboot-will-be-co-developed-by-crystal-dynamics">Crystal Dynamics was then brought in to support</a> in 2021.</p>
<p>The reboot did not have a smooth time of things, however, and in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-reportedly-made-little-meaningful-progress-since-2020-reveal">it was said "little meaningful progress" had been made</a>. In 2024, it was then said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-perfect-dark-reboot-reportedly-in-a-very-rough-state-and-a-big-protracted-mess">Perfect Dark had become "a big, protracted mess"</a>, and was in a "rough state".</p><p>Things seemed to be taking a turn for the better later that year, though, and we were treated to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/at-long-last-the-perfect-dark-reboot-gets-a-first-gameplay-trailer">first gameplay trailer for Perfect Dark</a>. However, this glimmer of hope was soon extinguished, and in July of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">Microsoft pulled the plug on Perfect Dark and closed down The Initiative</a>.</p>
