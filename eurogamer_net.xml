            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> looks set to let you increase the stats of your Pokémon, fans say, after code snippets relating to the feature were spotted in a fresh datamine. 
</p>
<p>
References to systems for a "stat increase" as well as to a "Hyper Training Service" have been found by <a href="https://x.com/thepokemodgroup/status/1900247443666854310">prolific Pokémon Go dataminers The Pokemod Group</a>, and suggest players will be able to boost a Pokémon's attack, defense or stamina.
</p>
<p>
Hyper Training is a feature from the main Pokémon games that allows you to max out a creature's stats - referred to as its IVs - using a currency known as Bottle Caps.
</p>
<p>
The system means you can turn a Pokémon with good stats into one with better or even perfect stats, making it more competitive in battles, including with other players.
</p>
<p>
Pokémon Go has never had a system like this before, though fans have long discussed how it might work. On the one hand, the ability to boost stats brings with it questions of balance, and concerns over how much a Bottle Cap might be sold for. 
</p>
<p>
On the other, there are plenty of players with 98% stat Pokémon who would love to turn them into perfect 100% Pokémon instead, and secure a "hundo".
</p>
<p>
In Pokémon Go, hardcore fans play and pay repeatedly for the chance to earn hundo stat Pokémon from raid battles, with hundreds of tries likely needed. Any item that could be used to shortcut this system would be a major shakeup, and likely be highly valued.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, the suggestion this potentially-lucrative feature is coming to Pokémon Go now has led to discussion among fans that this is a design decision driven by changes to the ownership of the game.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, it was confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-will-be-sold-to-monopoly-go-maker-scopely-niantic-confirms">developer Niantic planned to sell Pokémon Go to Monopoly Go maker Scopely</a>, as part of a $3.5bn deal.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Niantic for more.

            <p>The Final Fantasy series has now sold over 200m copies across the globe.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> shared the announcement on social media, along with the news the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-pixel-remaster">Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster</a> series has sold over 5m copies worldwide.</p>
<p>The sales figure further cements Final Fantasy as one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time, even if sales have dipped in more recent years.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy is on a par with the likes of Assassin's Creed and The Sims, having sold more than the Sonic the Hedgehog series and the Legend of Zelda series. However, it remains far behind the Mario franchise, Tetris, Call of Duty, Pokémon, GTA, Minecraft, and FIFA.</p>
<p>In terms of sales, the PS1 era was collectively the most successful for Final Fantasy. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> sold almost 15m copies, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-viii">Final Fantasy 8</a> sold 12m copies, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a> sold 8.9m copies. Elsewhere Final Fantasy 12 sold 11.3m, Final Fantasy 15 sold 10.3m, Final Fantasy 13 sold 9.6m, and Final Fantasy 10 sold almost 9m (thanks <a href="https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy#Sales_history">Video Game Sales Wiki</a>).</p>
<p>However, they all pale in comparison to Final Fantasy 14 at 24m sales. In 2021 the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-xiv-the-most-profitable-game-in-the-series">MMORPG was the most profitable game in the series</a>, and in financial reports since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-revenue-kept-afloat-thanks-to-final-fantasy-14">often kept the company afloat</a> where other games have failed to meet expectations.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series has sold over 5 million copies worldwide, and the Final Fantasy series has now sold over 200 million copies across the globe!</p><p>Wherever you joined us on our adventures, thank you. <a href="https://t.co/6eoIoDBXh0">pic.twitter.com/6eoIoDBXh0</a></p></div>— FINAL FANTASY (@FinalFantasy) <a href="https://twitter.com/FinalFantasy/status/1900396747647754617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>More recently, while Final Fantasy 7 Remake sold 8.7m copies, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">both follow-up Rebirth and the next series entry Final Fantasy 16 "did not meet expectations"</a> according to Square Enix.</p>
<p>Still, the 5m sales for the Pixel Remasters - revamped versions of the first six games in the series - is good news for the company, proving both nostalgia and interest in older games from series fans and newcomers.</p>
<p>And with Square Enix's multiplatform strategy, sales are expected to increase. Most recently, Rebirth was released on PC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-final-fantasy-7-rebirths-pc-port-has-promise-but-too-many-problems">even if the port has issues</a>, while the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-brings-mana-and-final-fantasy-pixel-remasters-to-xbox">Pixel Remasters were added to Xbox last September</a> in addition to their previous release on Switch, PC, PlayStation, and mobile.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A Rockstar-approved GTA 5 modding tool is on the cars, I mean cards, for all of you PC players out there.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, and several years after the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>'s enhanced edition on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-5s-next-gen-upgrades-finally-arrive-on-pc">the game's next-gen features finally arrived on PC as part of a free update for all existing users</a>.</p>
<p>Now, Cfx.re - that is to say, the team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-hires-a-team-of-modders-it-had-previously-banned-from-playing-gta-5">Rockstar hired in 2023, and which was behind the popular GTA 5 FiveM and RDR2 RedM multiplayer mods</a> - is working on a "conversion tool" which will "assist the modding community in making their assets compatible with the new upgrade". This is as any custom assets used on FiveM and GTA 5 Legacy are not "natively compatible" with Rockstar's newly-launched PC version of GTA 5 Enhanced.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://forum.cfx.re/t/coming-soon-new-official-modding-utility/5312475">laid out by Cfx.re</a>, the team's upcoming conversion tool will support the following formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dictionaries of multiple drawables (*.ydd)</li>
<li>Generic models, geometry, optional embedded textures and lights (*.ydr)</li>
<li>Complex fragmented skeletons/models used for pedestrians, vehicles, destructible objects, etc. (*.yft)</li>
<li>Texture Dictionaries (also known as TXD) (*ytd.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Cfx.re noted file types such as .ycd and .ybn will not require any conversion.</p>
<p>The tool itself does not have a release date as yet, with Cfx.re stating it still has a few bits and pieces it needs to sort out before it is ready to be debuted. For now, it just says "coming soon", and the team said it will share a more thorough breakdown of what the tool will include at a later date.</p>
<p>As to why this is a pretty big deal, well, Rockstar has been rather strict with mods in the past.  Back in 2017, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ambitious-mod-project-to-put-liberty-city-in-gta5-canned">called time on the 'Liberty City in GTA5' mod</a>, saying that while it "generally [would] not take legal action against third-party projects involving Rockstar's PC games that are single-player, non-commercial, and respect the intellectual property rights of third parties", it would not allow "use or importation of other IP", including its own. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, just this January, the creators of an impressive mod which added a playable version of Grand Theft Auto 4's map to GTA5 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-shuts-down-ambitious-mod-that-put-gta-4s-liberty-city-in-grand-theft-auto-5">removed their own project from the public eye following a discussion with Rockstar</a>. </p>

<p>Following its debut on Steam, GTA 5 Enhanced has welcomed a healthy number of players. At the time of writing, there are still 108,568 of us heisting cars and getting up to who knows what over on Valve's platform.</p>
<p>Despite these numbers, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5s-enhanced-pc-launch-is-off-to-a-good-start-on-steam-but-user-reviews-are-mixed">GTA5 Enhanced user reviews are still sitting with a "mixed" average on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>DC Comics and Sega have released a first look at their Justice League and Sonic the Hedgehog comic book series, including Sonic dressed as The Flash and Shadow as Batman.</p>
<p>The crossover was first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-announces-sonic-and-dc-comic-collaboration-at-sonic-central-stream">announced at the Sonic Central event</a> last September, following a tease on Batman Day earlier the same week.</p>
<p>That first announcement revealed which characters we'd see pairing up, but now we've got a first look at official comic panels of both teams joining forces to save their worlds from a major threat.</p>
