            <p>
Nintendo's determined streak of announcing absolutely anything but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> continues today with the news its beloved Game Boy handheld is getting the Lego treatment later this year.
</p>
<p>
This is far from the first time Nintendo has partnered with Lego, of course; the companies have already released an extensive range of interactive Mario-themed sets, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-lego-set-officially-revealed-by-nintendo">The Legend of Zelda's Great Deku Tree was also Lego-ised</a> last year. Nor is it the first time a Nintendo console has been immortalised in little plastic block form; a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-nes-leaks-online-costs-over-gbp200">Lego version of the original Nintendo Entertainment System</a> launched back in 2020 - and a lovely thing it was too.
</p>
<p>
And now it's the Game Boy's turn, as revealed in the <a href="https://x.com/NintendoEurope/status/1877400377575792847">briefest of video teases</a> shared on Nintendo's social media channels. As the teaser unfolds, we see various Lego pieces glide in seductive soft-focus across the screen, but there's sadly no reveal of the full Lego build just yet.

<p>
Not that it should be too hard to imagine. Fans have been creating their own Game Boys out of Lego for quite some time now, such as this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dTs5m4MGt4">delightful effort</a> from video editor and Lego Masters Australia finalist Nick Lever, which was shared online last year.
</p>
<p>
Should more details surface following today's Lego Game Boy tease, I'll update this story. But for now, all we know for sure is that it'll be arriving sometime this October.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Ubisoft has said it is delaying <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> again, as the company explores sale options.
</p>
<p>
The highly-anticipated next Assassin's Creed game will now launch on 20th March. Previously the game was set to arrive on 14th February, after its initial delay from November 2014.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft said today that it was currently "taking decisive steps" to reshape the company and had now appointed advisors to "review and pursue various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders". In plain English, it sounds like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-considering-buyout-taking-the-company-private-report">Ubisoft is indeed investigating options for a sale</a>, as suggested by several reports late last year. In December, news agency Reuters reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-discussing-buyout-options-with-tencent">Ubisoft was discussing buyout options with Chinese giant Tencent, already a major shareholder, that would take the company private</a>.
</p>
<p>
Going forward, Ubisoft expects to it will "continue to drive significant cost reductions, together with a
highly selective approach to investments". The suggestion seems to be of a continued narrowing of the company's focus, teams and output. 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's statement notes the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-shutting-studios-laying-off-277-employees-as-it-pulls-plug-on-live-service-shooter-xdefiant">recently-confirmed end of shooter XDefiant in December</a>, and the subsequent closure of three studios "in high-cost geographies". 
</p>
<p>"We learned a lot, of course, from this journey," Ubisoft said in a conference call this evening attended by Eurogamer, discussing the end of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-xdefiant">XDefiant</a>, "but we believe it was the difficult but right decision".</p>
<p>
In terms of investments, Ubisoft's statement points to the additional five weeks given to Assassin's Creed Shadows, whose developers will now have more time to incorporate additional changes.
</p>
<p>
"This additional time will allow the team to better incorporate the player feedback gathered over the past three months and help create the best conditions for launch by continuing to engage closely with the increasingly positive Assassin's Creed community," Ubisoft said. 
</p>
<p>During this evening's call, Ubisoft added that it would begin giving some players access to Shadows next week, though the suggestion here was this referred to limited hands-on oppurtunities granted to select individuals.</p>
<p>
Ubisoft additionally said it has suffered "lower than expected holiday sales, mainly for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>" and had also lowered financial expectations due to the discontinuation of XDefiant.
</p>
<p>
"We made good progress on the strategic and execution reviews initiated a few months ago and are confident that this will position Ubisoft for a stronger future," Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot said in a statement. "We have taken decisive steps to reshape the Group in order to deliver best-in-class player experiences, enhance operational efficiency and maximise value creation. We also recently appointed leading advisors and are actively exploring various strategic and capitalistic options to unlock the full value potential of our assets. We are convinced that there are several potential paths to generate value from Ubisoft's assets and franchises.
</p><p>
"Additionally, we are all behind our teams' efforts to create the most ambitious Assassin's Creed opus of the franchise and made the decision to provide an extra month of development to Shadows in order to better incorporate the player feedback gathered over the past three months that will enable us to fully deliver on the potential of the game and finish the year on a strong note."
