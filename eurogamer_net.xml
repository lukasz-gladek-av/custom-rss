            <p>The message "Nier Automata will continue" was the stinger concluding today's celebratory showcase for the game, which covered the game's many cameo appearances, spin-offs, and its passing of 10m worldwide sales.</p>
<p>This video, posted to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> YouTube channel, covered the game's history of releases and adaptations since its initial release in 2017. Having only recently passed 10m sales, it marks a steady increase from December 2024 when it passed 9m.</p>
<p>This announcement came alongside some new art <a href="https://x.com/NieRGame/status/2024800054004138394">posted to official Nier Automata social media platforms</a>.</p>

<p>So what could this final message mean, aside from the obvious indication that Nier Automata will carry on in some form. Well, there's been little word of a sequel to Nier Automata, despite its widespread acclaim and success. There was Nier: Reincarnation, a mobile sequel of sorts that launched in 2021 and was shut down and made unplayable in 2024. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-cancels-unannounced-nier-mobile-game">Tencent also cancelled another Nier mobile game in 2024</a>, which reportedly "struggled to find a monetisation to offset its high costs.".</p><p>You could kill all hope of a AAA direct sequel in your heart, and instead see the tease as an indication of more cameos in other games. These have proven exceptionally popular whenever they emerge: <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/nier-automata-collaboration-pushes-goddess-of-victory-nikke-to-a-half-a-billion-in-revenue/">Goddess of Victory: Nikke saw a 215 percent increase in sales thanks to its Nier Automata collaboration</a>, leaping over $500m in revenue as a result.</p>
<p>One can certainly hope for the former. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/yoko-taro">Yoko Taro</a> has been largely an absent presence from the world of <em>released</em> video games since the Nier Replicant remake in 2021, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-hes-actually-been-working-on-a-lot-of-projects-recently-its-just-that-they-got-cancelled-midway/">stating last year the projects he had been working on were cancelled</a>.</p>
<p>What are you hoping for? If you've not played Nier Automata, you can read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nier-automata-review">Eurogamer's review to see what all the fuss is about.</a> In it, Jeffrey Matulef wrote: "Yoko Taro's eccentric action RPG gets a follow-up that's every bit as surprising as its predecessor with a little help from Platinum Games."</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Jake Solomon, a decorated game designer known for his work at Firaxis on games like XCOM and Marvel Midnight Suns, has announced that his studio Midsummer is going to close. In doing so, he also shared a pre-alpha look at the "Life Sims + The Truman Show" game the studio was making, called Burbank.</p>
<p>Solomon didn't elaborate on the reasons for closure in <a href="https://x.com/SolomonJake/status/2024510423190430181">the statement he released on X</a>. "We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both," he wrote. "Before we close the doors at Midsummer Studios I'd like to share a glimpse of Burbank, the game we poured our hearts into."</p>
<p>Burbank seems to be a game about making TV shows with a cast of characters you can pick up and drop into various customisable situations. It reminds me a lot of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lionheads-secret-best-game-and-one-of-the-greatest-ever-abandonware-games-the-movies-turns-20-today">Lionhead's The Movies</a>.</p>
<p>The Burbank trailer shows somewhat action-figure-like people leading dramatic lives in a small-town location, which you watch as though you would a soap opera on TV. The trailer then reveals that you're the one directing it, choosing the characters who'll be the stars and then adding a support cast from bundles of support cast characters. Then you choose a broad outline for the episode, establish character motivations and behaviour, and go on to unlock new cast abilities as you play.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both. Before we close the doors at Midsummer Studios I'd like to share a glimpse of Burbank, the game we poured our hearts into.</p><p>It's like "Life Sims + The Truman Show," but it's more than that. I believe people are… <a href="https://t.co/RuYvDhdEZO">pic.twitter.com/RuYvDhdEZO</a></p></div>— Jake Solomon (@SolomonJake) <a href="https://twitter.com/SolomonJake/status/2024510423190430181?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>The alluring part seems to be that you're not totally in control, which means your actors and characters have minds of their own, so finding out what they'll do when placed in certain situations becomes a key part of the game. You set their parameters and then watch to see what you've created.</p>
<p>Jake Solomon explained: "It's like 'Life Sims + The Truman Show', but it's more than that. I believe people are storytellers, and I want them to share whatever stories and characters they can dream up. Burbank lets you do that.</p>
<p>"We have moments playing this game where characters come alive in a way we've never experienced. And for an old game developer like me that's special [...] This game was a dream of mine, our team made it come true, so watch and dream with us."</p>
<p>He later added: "Our characters use AI for memory, reasoning and speech. That's what lets you create anyone you want and drop them in any story you write. But all of our art is created by our talented artists. We had no interest in replacing *any* developers with AI."</p>
<p>That is the only other comment he made.</p>

<p>It's a surprising announcement and it's sad, and it's also slightly strange in that it doesn't unequivocally state that this game's journey is over. The language used seems to suggest Burbank could live on, but if the studio is about to close, how could that be? Jake Solomon has given no previous indication the studio was in trouble. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jake-solomon-0247a037_midsummer-is-officially-a-game-changer-activity-7395096938137690112-Zc8d?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAUoxGIBcYD7dzkEFna_Jwj_cI4OhPmSEjo">His last post on LinkedIn</a>, made three months ago, had him saying he was "excited to share more about what we're building soon".</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/from-superheroes-to-soap-operas-xcoms-jake-solomon-unveils-first-details-of-his-new-studio-and-next-gen-life-sim">We last spoke to Solomon in 2024</a>, a couple of years after Marvel's Midnight Suns had charmed us, and after Solomon had left Firaxis to create his own studio and spin-up this new game idea. In that interview, he said Midsummer had been backed by venture capitalists and received funding from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> maker Krafton. I'm assuming that money has now run out. Solomon also talked more about the thinking behind Burbank, and the 'create your own stories' idea.</p>
<p>Marvel's Midnight Suns was released in 2022. It's a card-based, turn-based spin on creating your own Marvel superhero team - and Marvel superhero - and then saving the day. And very good it was too. "Great tactical fun nestled in a sweet-natured superhero dollhouse," wrote Christian Donlan in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-midnight-suns-review-crush-evil-dm-the-avengers-and-find-that-perfect-bedside-table">Marvel's Midnight Suns review</a>.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft is laying off 40 employees at its Toronto studio, which is currently working on the company's long-in-the-works Splinter Cell remake.</p>
<p>In a statement shared with tech outlet <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2026/02/19/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs-splinter-cell-remake-development/">MobileSyrup</a>, Ubisoft said this decision "was not taken lightly". It added it was not a reflection of the "talent, dedication, or contributions" of those impacted by the layoffs at the studio.</p>

<p>"Our priority now is to support them through this transition with comprehensive severance packages and robust career placement assistance," Ubisoft said.</p>
<p>Despite these changes at Ubisoft Toronto, its Splinter Cell remake is still in development, the company confirmed. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-splinter-cell-remake">Ubisoft first announced its plans to remake Splinter Cell in December 2021</a>. At this time, the company said this game is being built "from the ground up" with updated visuals and improved design elements to "match player comfort and expectations". In addition to this, Ubisoft confirmed the game will be linear, and won't feature any open world gameplay, much like the originals.</p><p>In the time since, a job listing revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-splinter-cell-remake-will-update-story-for-a-modern-day-audience">Ubisoft is updating its story for a "modern-day audience"</a>, and that it hopes to bring in new fans to the franchise with this remake. In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splinter-cell-remake-shares-concept-art-but-still-very-early-in-development">the studio then revealed some concept art</a> for its upcoming - but still "very early" in development - Splinter Cell remake.</p>
<p>As well as this remake, Ubisoft Toronto will also remain a "key contributor to several codev mandates and service teams", the company told MobileSyrup.</p>

<p>News of layoffs at the Toronto studio follows an announcement earlier this year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">Ubisoft was initiating a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset"</a>. This saw Ubisoft close two studios, cancel six projects - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sands-of-times-shock-cancellation-does-not-mean-we-are-stepping-away-from-the-franchise-says-remake-team">including its Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a> -  and delay seven games.</p>
