<p>Players will be able to choose from over 100 different mobile suits when the time comes, with Bandai Namco adding these can be 'tuned' for all of the "thrilling, action-packed Gundam battles" ahead.</p>
<p>If you are interested in getting your hands on Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Battle Destiny Remastered, you can pre-order on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1857740/MOBILE_SUIT_GUNDAM_SEED_BATTLE_DESTINY_REMASTERED/">Steam</a> now.

            <p>Renowned actress Laura Bailey portrayed deuteragonist Abby Anderson in The Last of Us Part 2, but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> almost didn't cast her because "she's in everything".</p>
<p>That's coming from The Last of Us creator and Naughty Dog exec Neil Druckmann himself. Druckmann was chatting with Santa Monica Studio's creative director Cory Barlog during a panel at DICE this week, where he said he was "sure it was going to be a different actor" when he was watching the auditions live (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/neil-druckmann-wasnt-going-to-cast-laura-bailey-in-the-last-of-us-part-2-because-shes-in-everything-but-changed-his-mind-after-studying-her-audition-frame-by-frame/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>Even the studio more generally thought Bailey wouldn't be right for the role as Abby, as she had already been in so many other games, including Naughty Dog's own Uncharted series.</p>

</figure>
<p>However, and as we all know, the team changed its mind. Druckmann said the tipping point came after studying the audition videos "frame-by-frame", and noticing a moment of "vulnerability" in Bailey's audition that others hadn't shown. Druckmann then showed this moment to the wider Naughty Dog team, convincing them that Bailey was the right choice for Abby.</p>
<p>Bailey went on to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-2020-live-report">win the Best Performance accolade at the 2020 Game Awards for her portrayal of Abby</a>.</p>
<p>For her role, Bailey received inexcusable online abuse, which didn't just threaten her life, but that of her baby son's as well. During a behind-the-scenes documentary about the game last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2s-abby-actor-reveals-online-abuse-didnt-just-threaten-her-life-but-her-baby-son-too">Bailey confirmed that the "real hardcore death threats" were so concerning</a>, they were passed on to police.</p>
<p>Kaitlyn Dever, who is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-twos-abby-isnt-as-muscular-as-part-2s-because-it-doesnt-play-as-big-of-a-role-in-this-version">set to portray Abby in the second season of HBO's The Last of Us</a> adaptation, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/abby-actress-kaitlyn-dever-protected-by-extra-security-while-filming-the-last-of-us-season-two">required extra security during filming for her own protection</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/castle-crashers">Castle Crashers</a>' has revealed more details of its first DLC for 13 years, and while we don't yet have a firm release date, we do have a window: summer (Q3) 2025.</p>
<p>Last summer - 12 years after it first arrived on Steam, and 16 years after it debuted on Xbox Live Arcade - Castle Crashers announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/castle-crashers-is-getting-new-dlc-16-years-after-it-first-released">getting new DLC on Steam</a> (and only Steam - sorry, Xbox players).</p>
<p>Premium DLC Painter Boss Paradise not only includes new player and weapon artwork for all official characters and new character Paint Junior, but it also adds Steam workshop functionality, so players can create and share their own skins "with the world".</p>

<p>"After 16 years, when it came time to give Castle Crashers some more love, I started by drawing brand new knights," explained Dan Paladin, co-founder and art director at The Behemoth.</p>
<p>"I was able to do this fairly quickly and thought, 'Why shouldn't everyone have the ability to do this?', so - BOOM - the Painter Boss gave us all a perfect opportunity to make a natural shift to creating. People have wanted new characters so often - this allows the whole community to finally share more than we could ever give them!"</p>
<p>Although Castle Crashers debuted on Xbox and is still available on Sony consoles and Nintendo Switch, the $4 DLC (regional pricing is still to be confirmed) is only coming to Steam. You can wishlist it now.</p>
<p>"Much like The Behemoth's last Live Arcade effort, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alien-hominid">Alien Hominid</a> HD, this is a resolutely old-fashioned side-scroller," Dan Whitehead wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/castle-crashers-review">Eurogamer's Castle Crashers review</a>, waaaaay back in 2008.</p>
<p>"Where it differs is in a much less brutal learning curve, a vastly increased amount of peripheral stuff to play with and a generally more rounded gaming experience."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY 12.30pm UK:</strong> The first network test for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has suffered server issues and is unplayable.</p>
<p>The online co-op spin-off has a number of three hour long sessions over the course of the weekend, with the first meant to be from 11am - 2pm UK time today. However, server issues have meant players haven't been able to get past the initial menu.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/fromsoftware_sp/status/1890375131463082321">FromSoftware Player Support</a> has shared a number of messages, noting the server is "congested" before it restarted the server to solve the issue.</p>

<p>It's unclear how long it will take for servers to be reset, or if the remaining sessions will also be affected. After all, this is a network test - and the servers have clearly been tested.</p>
<p>I've contacted Bandai Namco for further details.</p>
<p>Myself, Eurogamer's Ian Higton and IGN's Jesse Gomez were planning to stream the game but have cancelled due to the server issues.</p>
<p>Players have been sharing their experience on social media and calling for FromSoftware to extend the sessions.</p>
<p>This was my view for over an hour of trying:</p>

<p>The test will continue over the weekend for those who registered, we have all the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-beta-test-dates-times-register">details of Nightreign session times</a>.</p>

<p>"As it stands, though, Nightreign provides a delectable hit of Elden Ring in a repeatable microcosm," I wrote. "It's got the difficulty, the levelling, the boss battles, and the sense of discovery, but all at high speed for a new type of challenge, while its grim enemy selection is like a best-of Souls mixtape I'm itching to replay."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
