            <p>BioWare has released a rather hefty patch for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which among a myriad of bug fixes, also adds some quality of life changes. </p>
<p>This includes more filters to its photo mode and new weapon icons. Players will now also be able to bind arrow keys to input mappings, thanks to this recent patch, while screenshot file names from photo mode are now "simplified".</p>
<p>As for those rings, new ones can now be compared against both equipped ring slots. Previously when you picked up a new ring to put on your finger, it would only compare the stats against one of the rings you had equipped. </p>

<p>On the bug side of this Dragon Age: The Veilguard patch, BioWare has implemented over 40 fixes. These cover crashes (BioWare has "eliminated" the causes for some of them - hurrah!), and some odd facial expressions from Rook's first meeting with Emmrich.</p>
<p>Also, companions should no longer get stuck on balance beams now, which I am sure they will be pleased about.</p>

<p>On its release, we awarded Dragon Age: The Veilguard a shiny five out of five stars.</p>
<p>"It is the strongest and loudest answer BioWare could have mustered for the people still doubting whether it could do it. The answer is yes, emphatically. The Veilguard is spectacular. BioWare is back," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>.</p>
<p>The game launched to "solid" sales here in the UK, though has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-sales-solid-in-uk-softer-across-rest-of-europe-report">numbers "nearly 21 percent lower" than Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth across Europe</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sega's iconic fighting series is making its 3D PC debut on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3112260/Virtua_Fighter_5_REVO/">Steam</a> this winter with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-5">Virtua Fighter 5</a> R.E.V.O, 18 years after its original release.</p>
<p>It's a remaster of the fifth entry in the series, but with all the modern requirements: 4K graphics, high-res textures, and rollback netcode support to optimise online play.</p>
<p>It will also include new online modes to compete with up to 16 other players, including Tournaments and League. You can check out the game's intro in the trailer below.</p>

<p>Virtua Fighter 5 was first released in 2006 in the arcades and was followed by PS3 and Xbox 360 ports in 2007. A number of revisions were made over the years since, culminating in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown">Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown</a> on PS4 in 2021. It's this version that is being ported to PC, with the new moniker R.E.V.O.</p><p>Technically it's not the first time it's been playable on PC, though, as Virtua Fighter 5 features as a minigame in Yakuza 6, which is available on PC. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-2">Virtua Fighter 2</a>, the 2D Mega Drive fighter, is also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/71115/Virtua_Fighter_2/">already on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Still, this is excellent news for fans of Sega's somewhat dormant series. In an interview earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-developing-another-virtua-fighter-game">Sega confirmed a new Virtua Fighter game was in development</a>. It's unclear, though, if this was referencing this PC port or a new game entirely - presumably <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter">Virtua Fighter</a> 6.</p>
<p>Both Capcom and Bandai Namco have seen great success with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> and Tekken 8 respectively, so perhaps Sega is hoping its own Virtua Fighter can make a triumphant return.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-announces-flurry-of-projects-including-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi">Sega is also looking to revive classic series</a> like Crazy Taxi, Shinobi, and Jet Set Radio.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> is set to receive "some surprises" later this year, the game's director Feng Ji said, suggesting DLC is indeed on the way.</p>
<p>The game won the fan-voted Game of the Year award at last night's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTDmABPisP8&amp;t=10102s">Golden Joysticks</a>, with Ji making the comment during his acceptance speech.</p>
<p>"Of course, you might have already completed our game," he said. "That's perfectly fine too, Keep following us, and there might just be some surprises waiting for you later this year."</p>

<p>So what could those surprises be?</p>
<p>At the very least, Xbox players are still waiting to get their hands on the game. Its release on Microsoft's platform was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch">delayed as it needed more time for optimisation</a>, though rumours swirled around a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusion-over-black-myth-wukongs-missing-xbox-release-follows-claims-of-playstation-exclusivity">PlayStation exclusivity deal</a>.</p>
<p>At the least, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates">Microsoft reiterated the delay was not due to "platform limitations"</a>. A release date still has not been given, three months after its launch, but could still arrive before the end of the year.</p>
<p>More interestingly, Ji's comment further suggests DLC is on the way. Back at launch, an FAQ on the game's website noted DLC and "non-pay-to-win in-game purchases" may be released in future.</p>
<p>After release, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-05/investor-who-risked-it-all-on-wukong-scores-another-sales-win">Bloomberg</a> reported Game Science was working on an expansion for the game, following in the footsteps of FromSoftware with its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a>.</p>
<p>Multiple rumours have also circulated the DLC will release in early 2025 to coincide with Chinese New Year. So perhaps Ji's surprise is merely a release date announcement this side of Christmas. Looking at you The Game Awards!</p>
<p>"Its dramatic and spectacular boss fights just about keep Black Myth: Wukong afloat, but behind all its glitz and glamour is a frustratingly hollow and rudderless action game," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Eurogamer Black Myth: Wukong review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Patch  v.1.1.248,905 is now available across PS5 and PC. The PS5 patch specifically targets "graphics glitches" on PS5 Pro as well as trophy counting, whilst the Steam patch fixes "an issue that caused interference between game saves and controller vibration", mouse sensitivity and input, and controller issues.</p>
<p>Gameplay fixes across both platforms fix door markers on Brookhaven Hospital map, stops enemies getting hung up on environments, and several other bugs and glitches - the <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/2r/news/jp/ja/update_106">full list of fixes is here</a>.</p>
<p>The patch also resolves a "minor blocker" that prevented some players from escaping the Labyrinth after getting the map, an unspecified "progression-blocking issue" in Brookhaven, and an issue where the final boss was missing for some.</p> <div>

<p>"Overall, the philosophy for any PS5 Pro update should be that we get an upgrade over the base PS5, with no noticeable trade-offs," Digital Foundry's Thomas Morgan wrote earlier this week after breaking down <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-silent-hill-2s-ps5-pro-patch-is-another-update-with-glaring-image-quality-issues">Silent Hill 2 Remake's PS5 Pro patch</a>.</p><p>"The reality for Silent Hill 2 Remake's Pro upgrade though is that there are pros and cons. PS5 Pro does improve the game's performance at 60fps - and gets us to a vastly improved 30fps lock - both of which are welcome improvements."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Oh, my nostalgic heart is happy to tell you that Donkey Kong Land is available now for Nintendo Switch Online members.</p>
<p>The Game Boy classic once again asks players to set off in monkey form to find that banana horde. "Cranky Kong doesn't think Donkey Kong has proven himself to be a hero yet," reads the official description. "So, he decides to work out a deal with the closest villain that he knows."</p>
<p>Yes, K. Rool, that dastardly fiend, has hidden the bananas with a little help from his cronies. And, of course, Donkey and Diddy Kong won't stand for it. You can check out a trailer for its Nintendo Switch Online debut below.</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch Online members can get themselves access to multiple NES, Super NES and Game Boy games.</p>
<p>Those who plump for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack option will also be able to get their mitts on Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance and SEGA Mega Drive games, along with other perks. That includes things like expansions for other Nintendo games, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>'s Booster Course Pass.</p>
