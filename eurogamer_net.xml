            <p>
Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has said there's nothing stopping any of the company's games coming to Nintendo or PlayStation platforms in the future.
</p>
<p>
"I do not see sort of red lines in our portfolio that say 'thou must not,'" Spencer told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth">Bloomberg</a>, adding that it was still too early to discuss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-developer-343-industries-rebrands-confirms-multiple-new-games">Microsoft's plans for the next Halo</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-halo-on-unreal-engine-5-means-for-ps5">now being built in the cross-platform-friendly Unreal Engine</a>.
</p>
<p>
Xbox launched Pentiment, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, Grounded and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> across a mixture of PlayStation and Nintendo Switch consoles earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-just-topped-europes-ps5-download-charts">to some success</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-published-sea-of-thieves-reportedly-surpasses-1m-sales-on-playstation-5">more than 1m sales reported for Rare's popular piratical live-service game</a>. Microsoft will follow this with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">PlayStation launch for Xbox's biggest Christmas blockbuster, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, early next year. The expectation is that many other Xbox games will follow.

<p>
In a wide-ranging interview, Spencer also discussed his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-discusses-potential-xbox-handheld-plans">long-held desire to launch some kind of Xbox handheld</a>. Microsoft is currently working on prototypes and considering the market, Spencer said, though the launch of an official Xbox handheld is still a few years out. (So, no Xbox handheld before <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.)
</p><p>
Spencer also said Xbox still "definitely want to be in the market" to acquire other companies, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-been-12-months-since-microsoft-purchased-activision-blizzard-so-whats-changed">Microsoft's record-setting $68.7bn buyout of Activision Blizzard</a>. That said, deals of similar size were currently unlikely due to the still-ongoing process of merging in Activision teams.
</p>
<p>
The Xbox chief said he was still looking for deals that added "geographic diversity", such as teams in Asia, despite it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matt-booty-implies-tango-gameworks-closure-was-partly-due-to-leadership-change">walking away from Hi-Fi Rush studio Tango Gameworks</a> earlier this year. 
</p>
<p>
"The Xbox business has never been more healthy," Spencer concluded, when asked how he felt about 2025 after a year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">punctuated</a> by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">repeated layoffs</a>. "The business is performing right now, and I think that means a more healthy future for hardware and the games we build."

            <p>Treyarch has shared more details on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> Season 1, including a look at its battle pass' rather unexpected new skins. These include a 'Raccoon Goon' skin for Niran, some kind of parasitic nightmare for Carver (see header image above) and a shark suit also for Carver, because why not.</p>
<p>The Call of Duty team has released a new system for its battle pass, which will now adopt a pages system to replace the sector map. In Treyarch's words, players should think of it all like a book.</p>

<p>"The first Page displays BlackCell Instant Rewards and the second Page shows premium Battle Pass Instant Rewards, followed by 100 in-game Battle Pass rewards across 14 Pages and a Completion Page that is instantly unlocked once all other Pages are completed," it explained, adding these pages include both free and paid content.</p>
<p>As for its content, which the developer noted is pretty ample, highlights include new weapon blueprints (there are 30 of them), those aforementioned operator skins, and some new equipment skins.</p>
<p>Players can get their hands on the premium battle pass for 1100 COD Points, or scoop up the 'Battle Pass Bundle' for 2400 COD Points, "including 20+ Tier Skips".</p>

            <p>
The boss of EA - publisher of EA Sports FC, Battlefield, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> and Dragon Age - is reportedly in the frame to replace Disney CEO Bob Iger. 
</p>
<p>
A new report by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/disney-explores-wider-field-of-candidates-to-succeed-iger-d1876792">The Wall Street Journal</a> states that EA CEO Andrew Wilson is among the top candidates currently being considered as a long-term replacement for Iger, who oversees all of Disney.
</p>
<p>
Iger is expected to leave Disney in 2026, after steering the company for more than 15 years. His tenure has seen the firm acquire Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and much of 21st Century Fox, launch Disney+ and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-acquires-15bn-stake-in-epic-games-making-games-and-entertainment-universe-in-fortnite">sign a $1.5bn deal with Fortnite maker Epic Games</a>.

<figcaption>Wilson formerly served as boss of the FIFA/EA Sports FC franchise.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBM2xyco_Kg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
The Australian-born Wilson has meanwhile served 24 years at EA to date and, while press conferences from the publisher are rarer these days, is the company's most prominent face. Wilson stepped up to become EA's CEO in 2013, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/john-riccitiello-out-as-ceo-of-ea">the resignation of the controversial John Riccitiello</a>.
</p><p>Wilson's time at EA includes years working as the boss of the FIFA franchise and then all of EA Sports, as the company raked in vast revenues from Ultimate Team and ultimately signed divorce papers with FIFA itself. Last year, Wilson re-organised EA into two distinct operations - EA Sports and everything else - dubbed EA Entertainment.</p>
<p>
Iger, meanwhile, who turns 74 in February, is currently on his second stint at Disney. His initial retirement in 2021 lasted just a year, before he returned due to the firing of his successor Bob Chapek.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted EA for comment. 
</p>
<p>So how is this year's FIFA - uh, EA Sports FC? "This is a new FC, with some genuine differences on- and off-pitch," Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc-25-review">Eurogamer's EA Sports FC 25 review</a>. "It's also the exact same FC it's always been."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Tequila Works, the Madrid-based company known for the likes of Gylt and Rime, has filed for insolvency.</p>
<p>As reported by Eurogamer's sister site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rime-developer-tequila-works-files-for-insolvency">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the company founders have also stepped down.</p>
<p>In a statement, newly appointed general manager Térence Mosca said he was "proud of what [the team] has accomplished together". However, due to "prolonged market conditions", the company had no other option but to file for insolvency.</p>

<p>"Since its founding in 2009, Tequila Works' game-development philosophy has always focused on 'creating things with gusto'," the statement read. "We are doing everything we can to provide support and guidance to our teams during this difficult time."</p>
<p>Last month, Tequila Works announced it had laid off a number of staff as part of a studio restructure. At this time, it also made the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rime-developer-tequila-works-lays-off-staff-as-part-of-studio-restructure">decision to cancel an unannounced game</a>.</p>

This multiplatform push followed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stadia-is-shutting-down-in-january">Stadia's shut down last year</a>.</p>
