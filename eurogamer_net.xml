            <p>Have you ever gone on a nice hike with your friends, but then suddenly oh no! The climb is tougher than you expected. You must work together to make it to the summit, but now your tummy is rumbling and you don't have enough food. You turn to your friend, who once looked just like another normal human being, but your hunger has got so much that now they look like a succulent and mouth watering turkey. You take a bite…</p>
<p>Ok, if that has happened to you in real life, I am really very sorry to hear it because… well… wow! But, for developer Team PEAK and publishers Aggro Crab and Landfall, this isn't a horrifying fever dream. Rather this is, in fact, part of a new update for Peak, which adds cannibalism as a feature. Yes, that is what it says in the patch notes.</p>

<p>This latest update for Peak now means that if a player gets hungry enough, the other members of the climbing crew will begin to look like cooked turkeys (see header above), and they can be eaten. Many have shared their rather delighted impressions on social media, with comments such as "LETS GOOOOOOOO" peppering Aggro Crab's feed.</p>
<p>Cannibalism has been a long requested feature for Peak. I am not actually sure how it all started, but Aggro Crab once joked that cannibalism would get it social media fame.</p>
<p>"Guys we can't add cannibalism to Peak," it quipped earlier this month. It re-shared that same post when the new update went live, <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1950280291496710245">simply captioning it</a>: "Fine."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://x.com/LandfallGames/status/1950493639626367375">Landfall joked</a>: "Peak on launch day: Help your friends... Peak two months in: Eat your friends" (it added in a later post it has, in fact, only been one month since the game released).</p>

<p>Peak (which follows a string of other multi-million sellers for Landfall, including Content Warning and Totally Accurate Battlegrounds) is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">Steam</a>, where you can find the full patch notes. Eurogamer contributing editor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession">Christian Donlan called Peak his "new gaming obsession" earlier this year</a>, writing:</p>
<p>"Great climbing, great fun, a very pure take on design. And maybe stay away from the mushrooms. Some of them, anyway."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/being-able-to-cook-and-eat-your-friends-thats-peak-gameplay]]></content:encoded>
