            <p>If you were one of the many Eurogamer readers who lamented the fact that Sorry We're Closed didn't release on consoles as well as PC, well I'm pleased to say I have good news.</p>
<p>Developer à la mode games' eccentric story-driven survival horror game about demons, angels and what happens when both sides collide is now available across Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>You can check out the console launch trailer below.</p>

<p>Along with its console debut, the Sorry We're Closed team has also added some new features to the game, including New Game+ and gyro controls for those playing on Switch or PlayStation.</p>
<p>Here are all the new features coming to Sorry We're Closed, which are available for both PC and consoles today:</p>
<ul>
<li>The demon world is now more accessible than ever with rebalanced combat areas, improved controller sensitivity, aim assist options and new difficulty modes.</li>
<li>Restart the adventure in New Game+ to keep your upgrades and collectables as you explore alternate story paths.</li>
<li>Race against the clock to improve your combat level scores in Time Attack mode.</li>
<li>Motion-controlled aiming, including gyroscope support on Nintendo Switch and motion sensor aiming on PlayStation, for even greater precision.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, that's not all. As well as a console release, the developer has also teamed up with publisher Serenity Forge to reveal a premium physical edition of Sorry We're Closed for both PS5 and Nintendo Switch, which is slated for later this year.</p>
<p>Along with a copy of the game, this edition will also include a holographic sticker sheet (featuring Mimi the rat!), a soundtrack download card of the OST, and a design booklet (including character profiles, art and insight of the game).</p>
<p>The digital game is retailing for $24.99 (I am double checking UK pricing) across platforms. You can find <a href="https://linktr.ee/sorrywe.reclosed">links to purchase Sorry We're Closed here</a>.</p>
<p>That aforementioned physical edition, meanwhile, <a href="https://store.serenityforge.com/products/sorry-we-re-closed-premium-edition">can be preordered here for $44.99</a>.</p>

<p>Our Katharine was rather enamored with Sorry We're Closed on its PC release last year.</p>
<p>"Bold, raw and effortlessly stylish, Sorry We're Closed uses the building blocks of survival horror to tell a compelling and hard-hitting love story to brilliant effect," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sorry-were-closed-review">Eurogamer's Sorry We're Closed review</a>, which comes with a rather impressive four stars.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
