            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss Strauss Zelnick has returned to the subject of AI, this time suggesting the controversial technology could never create anything like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> because "no creativity... can exist by definition in any AI model."
</p>
<p>
Zelnick has taken a measured position on artificial intelligence - a term he's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/artificial-intelligence-is-an-oxymoron-theres-no-such-thing-says-take-two-boss">previously described as an "oxymoron"</a> - in the past, saying that while he's "pretty enthusiastic" about its potential to help the company "do a better job and to do a more efficient job" as a tool, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-boss-doesnt-think-advances-in-ai-will-make-it-easier-to-create-hits">takes "genius" to "create hits"</a> and "genius is the domain of human beings".
</p>
<p>
His latest comments, shared during <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/28/can-ai-create-next-grand-theft-auto-take-two-interactive-ceo-says-no.html">CNBC's recent Technology Executive Council Summit</a>, expand on that perspective, specifically in regard to AI's "derivative" nature. One immediate concern for Strauss is copyright. "We have to protect our intellectual property, but more than that, we have to be mindful of others," he explained. "If you create intellectual property with AI, it's not protectable." Ultimately, Take-Two's content must stand up to copyright laws, he added, while also protecting people's rights, leading to "constraints".
</p>
<p>
But Zelnick also believes the inherently "backward looking" nature of AI - a result of its dependence on big data sets of old information - means it's "derivative" in a way that doesn't suit creativity. "Let's say there were no constraints [on AI]. Could we push a button tomorrow and create an equivalent to the Grand Theft Auto marketing plan?" he continued. "The answer is no. A, you can't do that yet, and B, I am of the view that you wouldn't end up with anything very good. You end up with something pretty derivative."
</p><p>
"There are many, many, many things in life that are predictable based on data," he added. "Anything that involves backward-looking data compute, [AI is] really good for that and that applies to lots of things [but] what we do at Take-Two, anything that isn't attached to that, it's going to be really, really bad at."
</p>
<p>
Referencing Grand Theft Auto specifically, Zelnick added, "What [developer] <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> tries to do, and so far has done over and over again, is create something that approaches perfection... There is no creativity that can exist by definition in any AI model, because it is data-driven."
</p>
<p>
GTA 6 launches on 26th May 2026 following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">delay earlier this year</a>.

            <p>The backlash to the Trump administration's use of AI Halo imagery to promote political causes - notably the use of force by ICE to detain purportedly illegal immigrants - has spread to include strongly worded responses from the original designers of the Halo game.</p>
<p>Jaime Griesemer, who worked as a designer at Bungie for 12 years, on all Halo games up to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-reach">Halo: Reach</a>, told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/halo-ice-developers-react">Game File</a> that: "Using Halo imagery in a call to 'destroy' people because of their immigration status goes way too far, and ought to offend every Halo fan, regardless of political orientation. I personally find it despicable. The Flood are evil space zombie parasites and are not an allegory to any group of people."</p>

<p>His comments refer to <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1982819431894901043">an image posted by the Department of Homeland Security</a> which showed two Spartan soldiers on a Warthog jeep, riding across a Halo ring world, underneath the words "Destroy the Flood" and a call to join ICE. The inference was clear.</p>
<p>Marcus Lehto, the co-creator of Halo and lead designer of Master Chief, added to Game File that: "It really makes me sick seeing Halo co-opted like this." The DHS Flood-related image in particular was "absolutely abhorrent", he said.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Lehto and Griesemer featured in a news story earlier this week responding to the Halo 1 campaign remake, voicing confusion at some of the apparent design decisions in it. And it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-microsoft-be-able-to-stop-the-white-house-using-ai-generated-halo-imagery-to-depict-trump-as-master-chief-and-to-promote-and-recruit-for-ice-depressingly-i-doubt-it">this Halo remake which sparked the flurry of Halo-related AI images used by the Trump administration</a>.</p><p>So far Microsoft - owner of the Halo IP - hasn't noticeably said or done anything about the Trump administration's use of Master Chief and Halo. The ongoing silence speaks volumes. It follows similar inaction by Nintendo when the Trump administration co-opted Pokémon for similar social media use. Thus emboldened, <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1983604918239031569">the Trump administration's provocative use of iconic IP continues, now reaching The Lord of the Rings</a>.</p>
