            <p>
Sony has confirmed its $10 upgrade offer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> Remastered won't apply to anyone who previously had the game's PS4 version via PlayStation Plus, disappointing some fans.
</p>
<p>
Days Gone on PS4 was previously part of the PS Plus Collection, during which time countless subscribers were able to access the game.
</p>
<p>
But, as has been the case with most previous PlayStation upgrades, anyone who simply played Days Gone via PS Plus will need to pay the full $50 price tag, rather than $10.

<p>
"I would've payed $10 for the upgrade just to try it out despite the fact that a remaster for this game is not necessary," wrote AdSevere4623 on reddit, in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1iok0hw/days_gone_remastered_game_redemptions_via_ps_plus/">lengthy thread full of complaints about the issue</a>.
</p>
<p>
"CD Projekt Red gives us free Witcher 3 PS5 upgrade so many years after release and Sony charges $50 if you have PS Plus version," added Mo-Skito.
</p>
<p>
Of course, this isn't the first time this situation has occured. 
</p>
<p>
Another game to offer an enhanced PS5 version with a paid-for upgrade is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> Intergrade. And again, you needed to actually own the PS4 version to be eligible. If you simply had access to Rebirth on PS4 via PlayStation Plus, you couldn't upgrade for less.
</p>
<p>
Things worked slightly differently with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>, which was given away by Sony back during the era of Covid lockdowns. In this case, users with a free copy were then able to apply that game's $10 upgrade to access its PS5 version. But that was a license for the full game - rather than relying on a subscription to access it.
</p>
<p>
Still, some fans say the policy should change to be more akin to that of Xbox - where you can pay a modest amount to upgrade access to titles on Game Pass, and gain their deluxe edition.
</p>
<p>
Others, meanwhile, have pointed to the fact that you can buy DLC for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PS Plus games</a> - such as the Burning Shores DLC for Horizon Forbidden West. Is this add-on much different?
</p>
<p>
"This is as stupid as requiring someone to pay for the full game when purchasing a DLC for a PS+ game," CoolGur878 noted. "And, mind you, PS+ is not a free service."
</p>
<p>
In addition to having fancier visuals, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-gone-definitive-edition-announced-for-pc-and-ps5">Days Gone Remastered will offer a new survival arcade mode named Horde Assault</a>, plus fresh permadeath and speedrun modes for the main game.
</p>
<p>
These extra contents for Days Gone Remastered will also be offered on PC, as a $10 DLC.
</p>
<p>
Days Gone developer was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">recently working on an under-wraps live-service game for PlayStation</a>, though this was reportedly cancelled following Concord's high-profile flop. It's unclear what the developer is putting together next.

            <p>Former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida has said he took the job overseeing indie games for PlayStation because he "had no choice" - and now they're selling better than ever on the console.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/shuhei-yoshida-looks-back-at-31-years-at-sony-playstation-exit-interview/">Venturebeat</a>, Yoshida discussed his 30+ year career at PlayStation, including his move in 2019 from president of SIE Worldwide Studios to overseeing a new initiative focused on independent developers.</p>
<p>"Well, I had no choice," said Yoshida about the move. "When Jim [Ryan] asked me to do the indie job, the choice was to do that or leave the company."</p>

<p>He continued: "But I felt very strongly about the state of PlayStation and indies. I really wanted to do this. I believed I could do something unique for that purpose."</p>
<p>Yoshida explained PlayStation had been criticised by indie developers, that "PlayStation doesn't care about indies". That's now changed, he believes, with indie games on PlayStation selling better than PC in some instances.</p>
<p>"You don't hear that kind of criticism anymore," said Yoshida. "Last year we had lots of anecdotes from our indie partners that their new games were selling better on PlayStation than any other platform. Thats amazing. Some games sold better on PlayStation than on PC. When I started that work five years ago, our indie partners would say that when they released their games multiplatform, the Switch version would sell three to five times more than PlayStation. Bit by bit, that gap has narrowed down. We have a strong team inside the company supporting indies."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement">Yoshida left PlayStation last month</a>, though clarified in this interview that he hasn't retired. He "felt good about the state of [PlayStation's] support for indies" and so decided to leave. As such, he plans to still work with indie developers.</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah. I love working with these younger, talented developers," said Yoshida. "They come up with amazing games every year. Every year when you come to one of these events, a couple of the nominees for game of the year are indies. They're bringing something exciting to the industry. It's a lot of fun. That's my dream job, to be able to help them."</p>
<p>Yoshida also addressed current issues in the games industry, in particular why development has slowed down and so many layoffs have occurred.</p>
<p>"I think it's an overreaction to the Covid situation," he said. "Companies invested too much, including ourselves. Then we had to face reality and make adjustments. If you take out the Covid years you'd have smoother growth over the years."</p>
<p>Yoshida discussed his beginnings at Sony, courting companies like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> and Namco to move development to PlayStation, and his own work on games like Crash Bandicoot and Gran Turismo. "Crash Bandicoot was my first product, though," he said. "Mark Cerny and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> taught me a lot. They trained me as a producer."</p>
<p>A big shift at Sony happened ahead of the PS4. The PS3 was "another hard time", Yoshida explained - a topic also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-playstation-30th-anniversary-interview-with-shawn-layden-it-was-a-fight-to-get-the-sony-name-on-the-machine-they-didnt-want-to-be-associated-with-it">covered recently on Eurogamer by fellow former PlayStation exec Shawn Layden</a>. "We were losing a billion dollars. I thought PlayStation was finished."</p>
<p>As such, with development of the PS4, hardware and software teams worked more closely together to ensure the console was easy to develop for and collaboration could occur. That's how the controller's Share button was created, for instance.</p>
<p>"Starting with PS4 and PS Vita, that wall broke down," said Yoshida. "We became part of the hardware design process. We loved that. Lots of things about the hardware came from ideas and feedback from the game team. So we loved the system. We knew what we were getting. We were making prototypes based on the hardware prototypes."</p>
<p>He added: "But we still didn't know if it was going to succeed, until Microsoft made some great decisions for us. They put the ball on the tee and let us take our swing. We couldn't have asked for better competition."</p>
<p>Since leaving PlayStation, Yoshida has been interviewed a number of times, discussing everything from a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-hasnt-playstation-done-anything-new-with-bloodborne-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-theory">new Bloodborne game</a>, to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ill-fated-nintendo-playstations-first-game-was-a-space-shooter-says-former-exec-shuhei-yoshida">ill-fated Nintendo PlayStation's first game</a>.</p>
<p>And beyond helping indie games, he's starring in one too: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-lands-first-video-game-voice-role-in-promise-mascot-agency">Yoshida has voiced a character in the forthcoming Promise Mascot Agency</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you are one of the many eagerly awaiting Elder Scrolls 6 - which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-announces-the-elder-scrolls-6">first announced all the way back in 2018</a> - well, I am sorry to say I don't have a release date for you <em>just </em>yet.

<p>The upcoming Elder Scrolls 6 has been long in the pipeline. As I've already said, it was first announced over six years ago. At the time of its reveal, Bethesda was keen to make sure everyone knew Elder Scrolls 6 was still a way out, and said it was in pre-production (although we do know it will be released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-confirms-fallout-5-will-be-bethesdas-next-game-after-elder-scrolls-6">before Fallout 5</a>). Then, back in 2021, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-6-in-design-phase-being-built-on-new-starfield-technology">Bethesda said Elder Scrolls 6 was in a design phase</a>.</p>
<p>The studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-wishes-hed-been-a-bit-more-casual-with-his-elder-scrolls-6-announcement">Todd Howard has since said he wished he had been a little more casual with the game's announcement</a>. Additionally, in October 2023, Skyrim's lead designer Bruce Nesmith said Bethesda announced Elder Scrolls 6 when it did in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-6-revealed-so-early-due-to-pitchforks-and-torches">bid to appease any angry mobs which had their "pitchforks and torches" out</a>, desperate to know more.</p>
<p>"But I'm betting you won't hear much in the way of details until a good six months before release," Nesmith said at the time.</p>
<p>So, do you fancy turning yourself into an Elder Scrolls 6 NPC?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Gold Points can still be earned by registering physical games, as long as the game was released by 24th March 2025 (as shown on the eShop). Gold Points can be earned up to two years from a game's original release date in Europe (one year in other countries).</p>
<p>Lastly, Gold Points are valid for 12 months from the date of being earned, expiring at the end of a calendar month. That means Gold Points earned up to and including 24th March can be used to receive a discount on the eShop for another year.</p>
<p>It's unclear why Nintendo is ending this scheme, with the <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/news/7db7f9327a48ec83">announcement</a> simply stating: "We sincerely thank you for using the My Nintendo rewards programme, and apologise for any inconvenience."</p>
<p>Perhaps Nintendo will be switching to a new equivalent scheme for Switch 2 and is ending Gold Points in advance?</p>
<p>In similar news, Nintendo has stated <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/GB/en/pretickets/70020000000101">Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers</a> cannot be redeemed for Switch 2 exclusive games.</p>
<p>These vouchers are available for players with a Nintendo Switch Online membership, allowing them to purchase two games from a select list at a discounted price, including various Nintendo exclusive games.</p>
<p>"Please note that Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers cannot be redeemed for Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games," the purchase page now reads.</p>
<p>Again, it's unclear what Nintendo's plans are here for Switch 2, but change is definitely afoot.</p>
