            <p>You thought the summer showcases were done? Well, no they are not! Capcom has today announced its own showcase, scheduled for next week.</p>
<p>Capcom Spotlight, as it is known, will shine a light on upcoming games Pragmata and Resident Evil Requiem, as well as existing titles <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p>
<p>The whole thing will last for around 40 minutes, Capcom has said, offering us all the "latest news and extended commentary with developer interviews". It will kick off on 26th June, at 11pm here in the UK.</p>

<p>While the specifics of what Capcom will be spotlighting next week remain mostly under wraps for now, this showcase will include some information on the newest update for Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>As for those other games, we got our first look at Resident Evil Requiem earlier this month, when the developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-officially-unveiled-coming-february">introduced us all to Grace Ashcroft and a destroyed Raccoon City</a>.</p>
<p>Our Alex has been hands-on with Resident Evil Requiem already, admitting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-played-resident-evil-9-and-they-heard-me-scream-in-the-booth-next-door">even the relatively small chunk he played made him scream so loudly that those in the booth next door heard him</a>. Bodes well!</p>
<p>Capcom also gave us <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcoms-pragmata-coming-2026-developer-promises">another look at Pragmata earlier this month</a>. This is the studio's long in the works astronaut and small girl-starring game. "Pragmata is a fascinating genre mash-up, and Capcom at its experimental best," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pragmata-is-a-fascinating-genre-mash-up-and-capcom-at-its-experimental-best-hands-on">Eurogamer's hands-on Pragmata preview</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out a little teaser trailer for next week's Capcom Spotlight in the video above. Anything you are particularly looking forward to seeing more of?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Grant Kirkhope, composer of the DK Rap, wasn't aware it would be used in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Nintendo detailed more on its forthcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> gorilla platformer and fans spotted the inclusion of the DK Rap, originally created for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a>.</p>
<p>But Kirkhope was not aware it would be used again in Donkey Kong Bananza. Based on past use, it seems unlikely he'll be credited too.</p>

<p>"Well, what can I say, the worst rap track in the history of rap tracks seems to be back again!" joked Kirkhope to Eurogamer.</p>
<p>"It's so bizarre that people seem to like it now considering the backlash that I got when DK64 first came out, nobody seemed to get the joke except me... haha... I've only had to wait 25 years for that to happen! Actually I think that little kids got the joke but the cool teenagers didn't!"</p>
<p>He added: "My tombstone will read, 'Here lies the body of Grant Kirkhope, he wrote the DK Rap and the Goldeneye Pause Music'... Nothing else will matter!!"</p>
<p>Eurogamer previously spoke to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dk-rap-composer-explains-why-nintendo-didnt-credit-him-in-the-super-mario-bros-movie">Kirkhope about the inclusion of the DK Rap in Nintendo's The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>. Kirkhope was not credited for its use.</p>
<p>"[Nintendo] said we decided that any music that was quoted from the games that we owned, we wouldn't credit the composers - apart from Koji Kondo," he explained. "Then they decided anything with a vocal would get credited, so the DK Rap scores there. But then they decided if we also own it, we won't credit the composers. And that was the final nail in the coffin.</p>
<p>"I said I appreciate you've got your policies and all the rest of it, but by the time the credits roll in the movie to show the songs, the theatre's completely empty, everyone's gone, it's only me and my wife and my two kids sat there going 'look daddy's name!'. I said 'for the sake of a couple of lines of text…', but that was that."</p>
<p>Considering Nintendo owns the DK Rap score, it would appear Kirkhope may once again not be credited for its inclusion in Donkey Kong Bananza.</p>

<p>Donkey Kong Bananza will be released next month and has a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananzas-musical-twist-revealed-plus-dk-rap-is-included">musical twist with Donkey Kong transformations</a>. It will also include a music player to enjoy tracks from the game - presumably the DK Rap will be there too.</p>
<p>Eurogamer also spoke to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banjo-kazooie-sequel-chances-better-than-zero-but-not-much-says-composer-grant-kirkhope">Kirkhope about the possibility of a new Banjo Kazooie game</a>, as well as his work on GoldenEye, and how his music represents nostalgia.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new update for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has been shadow dropped, bringing stronger Nightlords to defeat on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>These limited-time versions of bosses are known as the Everdark Sovereigns and will have new moves and increased power. The first to appear will be an enhanced Adel, Baron of the Night (Gaping Jaw) for this week, to be followed by the Sentient Pest and Darkdrift Knight.</p>
<p>The remaining Nightlords will be added at a later date. At the end of each week the "Sovereign will disappear from the available Expeditions… for now".</p>

<p>Note that these Everdark Sovereigns will only be available once the original form of that Nightlord has been defeated.</p>
<p>What's more, defeating the Everdark Sovereigns rewards players with Sovereign Sigils. These are unique tokens that can be exchanged for special Relics and items. Additional Sigils will be rewarded the first time an Everdark Sovereign is defeated.</p>
<p>"This is only the beginning of the Everdark Sovereign cycle," read the <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/the-everdark-sovereigns-have-emerged-elden-ring-nightreign">update notes</a>. "As the power of the Night ebbs and wanes, the Sovereigns will soon return to the abyss they came from."</p>
<p>At the start of the month, FromSoftware stated that "enhanced fights against existing Nightlords" would be on the way, while a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">duo mode is coming "at a later date"</a>. Even before this, though, dataminers discovered game files for new phases of each Nightlord encounter, so this update was very much expected.</p>
<p>What wasn't expected, perhaps, was the weekly cycle of these encounters. It's a smart live service-esque twist to keep players coming back regularly and exactly what the game needs to extend its longevity.</p>
<p>Once all the Nightlords are defeated, the only reason to return is to complete Remembrances with each character. This may not be attractive enough for some, so seeing the beginning of regular updates is a welcome addition.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-has-confirmed-dlc-but-what-could-be-included">DLC is also on the way</a>, although it's unknown what this will include. Would a Bloodborne pack of returning bosses be too much to ask?</p>
<p>The Everdark Sovereign version of Adel, Baron of the Night is available from today, 19th June until 26th June at 1:59am UK time.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is FromSoftware's online multiplayer spin-off to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>. It's "an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Eurogamer's Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
