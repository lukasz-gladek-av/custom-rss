            <p>The team behind Italian Soulslike Enotria: The Last Song has finally found some resolution to the game's Xbox absence.</p>
<p>As a quick recap, back in March developer Jyamma Games said it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/italian-soulslike-enotria-the-last-song-delayed-avoiding-elden-ring-dlc">would not be releasing its game on Xbox</a> in order to ensure "a superior experience for PC and PS5 players". At this time, it was suggested the studio would reassess an Xbox release once the game had launched elsewhere, and the Enortria team went on to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/enotria-the-last-song-ceo-apologises-to-xbox-community-for-a-choice-that-was-forced-to-make">apologise to the Xbox community for this delay</a>.</p>

<p>However, if we fast forward to September, things get a little more involved. The developer announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulslike-enotria-the-last-song-delayed-indefinitely-on-xbox-as-dev-says-its-being-ignored-by-microsoft">delaying Enotria: The Last Song's Xbox release indefinitely</a>, claiming Microsoft had "decided to ignore us" as it attempted to navigate certification.</p>
<p>When this comment was picked up further, Microsoft went on to apologise to the developer for this apparent oversight. An Xbox release of Enotria: The Last Song was back on the cards. But, when for?</p>
<p>Well, we now have an answer to that question. Enotria: The Last Song will be coming to Microsoft's platform very, very soon. In fact, it arrives tomorrow, 12th December.</p>
<p>"We bring great news for our Xbox players," the team wrote on <a href="https://x.com/enotriagame/status/1866521654765265387">social media</a>. "Enotria: The Last Song is finally ready to be released on [Xbox Series X/S]." Hurrah!</p>

<p>Enotria: The Last Song has been inspired by Italian folklore, and while its setting is dappled in Mediterranean sunlight, there looks to be plenty of darkness lurking within.</p>
<p>"The world has been gripped by the Canovaccio - a twisted eternal play that keeps everything in an unnatural stasis," the game's description reads. "You, Maskless One, are the only one without a given role and master of your destiny. Defeat the fearsome Authors that created it and free the world from stagnation, by harnessing the power of Ardore."</p>
<p>Will you be giving it a go on its Xbox debut?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-stealthy-combat-and-samurai-weapons-detailed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Ubisoft has laid out how <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' combat systems will work, including how its attack types, enemies and arsenal of weapons will differ between its dual protagonists: shinobi Naoe and samurai Yasuke.
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/pt-br/game/assassins-creed/news/1zutGco21KjZ5PUe6EYnpf/assassins-creed-shadows-combat-gameplay-overview">update</a> comes a week after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-will-overhaul-stealth-mechanics-but-still-include-insta-kill-assassination-option">similar deep dive into Assassin's Creed Shadows' stealth</a>, as the game's marketing schedule begins ramping up once more following its previous shock delay. </p>
<p>Shadows is now set to arrive on 14th February 2025 as a pivotal title for Ubisoft - which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-discussing-buyout-options-with-tencent">currently in the middle of talks with Chinese giant Tencent around the company's future</a>.</p>
<p>
As you'd expect, combat once again offers light and heavy attacks, but also new, charged "Posture Attacks" that can be held indefinitely (by holding down the attack button) while you adjust your target.
</p>
<p>
Defensive manouveres once again include dodges (Naoe pulls off a directional roll, Yasuke has a directional dodge-step), parries (Yasuke forces enemies to step back, Naoe pivotes around them) and blocks (unique to Yasuke).
</p>
<p>
The stealth-focused Naoe can become outnumbered when surrounded by enemies, while Yasuke can last longer and pull off a guard-breaking final attack at the end of a combo without pulling off a Posture Attack.

<p>
Both characters can carry two weapons, though Yasuke can also switch between them mid-combo. He can also pull off a unique Sheathed Posture Attack, where he's able to charge up an opening attack while his katana is still sheathed.
</p>
<p>
Naoe has a katana blade, the extendable kusarigama ball and chain, and the tanto dagger - which can be dual-wielded with her Hidden Blade to pull off double assassinations.
</p>
<p>
Yasuke has a long katana, naginata pole arm and kanabo war club for close-up combat, as well as the yumi bow and teppo flint file for ranged fighting - with the former quieter than the other.

<p>
Who will you be using all this weaponary against? Well, the game boasts basic outlaws, Ashigaru conscripts and volunteer army footmen (more aggressive towards Naoe, fearful of Yasuke), roaming samurai ronin, the Samurai Daisho found in military castles, and finally the Guardians - described as "an elite group of badass samurai used as reinforcements".
</p>
<p>
As in past games, flurry attacks will show a blue weapon glint, meaning you'll need to defend an entire sequence in quick succession, while unstoppable attacks again have a red glint. 
</p>
<p>Last month, Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté discussed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-discusses-devastating-impact-of-shadows-diversity-and-inclusivity-backlash">the "devastating" impact of Shadows' diversity and inclusivity backlash</a>, and explained the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-necessary-to-change-narrative-of-ubisofts-inconsistency-in-quality">reasons for Shadows' delay to ensure it arrives with another layer of polish</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Hazelight Studios has shared a little behind the scenes video, filmed within its HQ in Stockholm, and in the process dropped a few teasers for its next game.</p>
<p>The game in question is yet to be officially named, with the only word from Hazelight itself being a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-takes-two-developer-teases-next-project-s-n">mysterious post on social media from October</a>. This post showed a stack of papers and a collection of post-it notes with various annotations scrawled about. The studio's founder Josef Fares was, in fairness, <em>a little more</em> forthcoming with information, adding its name will be "S*** ******N".</p>
<p>Now, though, we are getting closer to The Big Reveal, and the team has released a little video presented by the always entertaining Fares himself, who noted people had called him out for being "cocky". He, however, is fine with this, as he believes when a game is as good as the one Hazelight is cooking up, well, of course he is going to be cocky.</p>

<p>In this same video, Fares also introduces us to the actors playing Mio and Zoe - two characters from the upcoming game, based on Fares' daughters - and gets the team to play some "cool sounds" from the project. The sound they choose to play? It's kind of a squelchy fart noise.</p><p>Then, when one of his fellow developers states the Hazelight team is "fucking shit up", Fares fistpumps his colleague. "We fuck shit up, without fucking up," the founder proclaims, before getting a phone call from The Game Awards' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, Hazelight will be revealing its next project at The Game Awards on Thursday night (or very early Friday morning if you are here in the UK). We here at Eurogamer will be covering the show live, so be sure to join us with a festive tipple or two! Other games also confirmed to be at the show include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-mafia-the-old-country-lead-the-charge-as-more-game-awards-showings-confirmed">Borderlands 4 and Mafia: The Old Country</a>, to name but two.</p>

<p>The hedgehog will be available from 18th December and comes with unique abilities to shake up gameplay, once he's been unlocked.</p>

"The vision was to make a game that allowed players to get into an exhilarating flow state.

<p>A Nintendo Account is required for the download, but so is purchasing an Alarmo. It's currently not on general sale in Europe and America and is only available to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers.</p>
<p>In Japan, subscribers must enter a lottery for a chance to purchase. However, that was recently changed to a pre-order opportunity with delivery not expected until early February 2025.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-no-longer-publicly-launching-99-alarmo-clock-in-japan-this-january">wider launch was planned for mid-February next year</a>, but this has been postponed due to stock shortages.</p> <div>

            <p>Marvel Rivals game director Thaddeus Sasser has said he believes PlayStation sci-fi shooter Concord failed because it didn't bring anything of "unique value" to its players.</p>
<p>Sasser's own game Marvel Rivals released last week across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. After a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/free-to-play-hero-shooter-marvel-rivals-off-to-heroic-start-on-steam">confident start on Steam specifically</a>, the free-to-play shooter went on to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-opening-weekend-sees-10m-players-join-in">welcome over 10 million players on its debut weekend</a>. In contrast, and despite high hopes from Sony, Concord failed to take off in the same way. Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-sales-fail-to-lift-off-on-steam-where-just-660-people-played-at-launch">a lacklustre launch</a> in August, the game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">taken offline just two weeks after its PC and PS5 debut</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/marvel-rivals-dev-concord-failed-it-didnt-bring-any-unique-value/">VideoGamer</a> <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/podcasts/new-videogamer-podcast-3-marvel-rivals-interview-w-thaddeus-sasser/">podcast</a> prior to Marvel Rivals' release, Sasser said he believed Concord didn't bring anything original to the table which would entice players to jump over from other popular shooters already on the market. "There's a switching cost," the director said. "I've already invested in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, I've got 15 skins for Pharah, I'm not going anywhere."</p>

<p>"As a game developer you're always worried until the audience has responded," the Marvel Rivals director continued, admitting he was cautious about releasing another free-to-play hero shooter into the wild.</p>
<p>"The truth is that I don't think anybody can accurately predict this or the game industry would be radically different today. There's a lot of games that come out that people are like 'it's going to do well' then it flops or people come out and go 'it's going to flop' and it succeeds amazingly. So, I think it's really hard to tell ahead of time and you're always worried about that."</p>
<p>Sasser believes Marvel Rivals has the fact that players can take on the guise of well known superheroes in its favour, and this hook gives people a reason to check out the game.</p>
<p>"I don't know about you, but when I heard the concept of the game I was like 'Oh my God I want to go be Storm in a game', 'I want to go be Doctor Strange in a game'. I want to be those heroes in the game, that sounds awesome," he said.</p><p>"And of course my mind immediately leapt to all the cool possibilities you could have with that. That's what I think will pull people in as well too. If we've done our jobs well, they'll love what they play and they'll want to play some more."</p>
<p>The numbers speak for themselves. At the time of writing, there are still 197,120 Steam players in the game, with a 24 hour concurrent player peak of 441,152. Its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/#app_reviews_hash">Steam reviews</a>, meanwhile, sit with a 'Mostly Positive' average.</p>

<p>As for Concord, back in November <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reflects-on-concords-failed-launch-and-removal-after-two-weeks">Sony's president Hiroki Totoki reflected on the brief release and failure of the company's live-service effort</a>, stating "we are still in the process of learning".</p>
<p>The company exec added when it comes to a new IP, "you don't know the result until you actually try it".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Xenoblade studio Monolith Soft is now 100 percent owned by Nintendo. 
</p>
<p>
Based in Tokyo, with a second office in Nintendo's home of Kyoto, Monolith Soft has become a key partner studio for the Mario maker over the past two decades, and has provided development support for some of Nintendo's biggest titles, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>.
</p>
<p>
Now, Nintendo has increased its stake in the company to fully own it, after initially purchasing 80 percent of Monolith Soft from Bandai Namco in 2007. Nintendo then increased its stake to 96 percent in 2011, while the company's original owners retained a symbolic four percent stake.

<p>
Nintendo has not officially announced the change, but its 100 percent ownership of the company was recently added to Monolith Soft's website, as spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-now-owns-100-of-monolith-soft/">Automaton</a>.
</p>
<p>
Monolith Soft began its era as a Nintendo-exclusive studio in 2008 with a range of smaller titles, including Wii shooter Disaster: Day of Crisis and RPG Soma Bringer for Nintendo DS.
</p>
<p>
But it was the 2010 launch of Wii RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> which saw Monolith Soft find its new niche. Three sequels have followed, with Wii U game re-release <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-10">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a>: Definitive Edition set to launch on Switch in March 2025.
</p><p>
In the background, Monolith Soft has also provided extra development support to Nintendo's own internal development houses. It has assisted Nintendo with all three <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon">Splatoon</a> titles, the past three Animal Crossing games, and is now a regular co-developer on The Legend of Zelda series, with credits on Skyward Sword, A Link Between Worlds, Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
What could the studio be working on next for Switch 2?

            <p>Employees at FromSoftware owner Kadokawa are reportedly optimistic about a potential buyout from Sony due to frustration with current management.</p>
<p>Kadokawa suffered a ransomware cyberattack earlier this year, but employees were left disappointed by the response from current president and CEO Takeshi Natsuno.</p>
<p>As a result, employees are said to be "thrilled at the prospect of an acquisition by Sony", according to a new report from Japanese outlet <a href="https://bunshun.jp/articles/-/75402">Bunshun</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/kadokawas-employees-are-reportedly-optimistic-about-a-sony-buyout-because-theyre-itching-for-a-change-in-leadership/">Automaton</a>).</p>

<p>"The people around me are thrilled at the prospect of an acquisition by Sony," a veteran Kadokawa employee told Bunshun.</p>
<p>"That's because there's a certain number of employees who are dissatisfied with the Natsuno administration, which didn't even bother to hold a press conference after peoples' personal information was leaked in the cyberattack. They expect that if Sony were to acquire the company, they would get rid of the president first."</p>
<p>The cyberattack against Kadokawa included video streaming platform NicoNico, as well as personal employee information as part of 1.5 terabytes of stolen data.</p>
<p>Former chairman Tsuguhiko Kadokawa - part of the company's founding family - was reportedly "surprised, but appeared positive" about a Sony acquisition, according to a Bunshun source at the company.</p>
<p>Kadokawa himself resigned from the company in October 2022 following allegations of bribing an official of the Tokyo Olympic Games. Kadokawa denied the charges.</p>
<p>Conversely, economic analyst Takahiro Suzuki told Bunshun Kadokawa had little to gain from the acquisition. "Kadokawa will lose its independence, and management will become stricter," he said. "If they want to keep developing their business as freely as they have until now, [the acquisition] would be a bad choice. They'd have to be prepared for publications that don't lead to IP creation being put under scrutiny."</p>
<p>News of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware">Sony possibly acquiring Kadokawa</a> emerged from a Reuters report last month. The following day, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-acknowledges-takeover-interest-from-sony">Kadokawa acknowledged the takeover interest from Sony</a>.</p>
<p>"The Company has received an initial letter of intent to acquire the Company's shares, but no decision has been made at this time," said Kadokawa at the time.</p>
<p>Still, the news has in part led to a <a href="https://x.com/xMBGx/status/1866510846098338042">sharp increase in Sony's stock value in Japan</a>, which is currently the highest since 2000. As the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/sony-group-shares-hit-record-closing-high-3035c869?">Wall Street Journal reported</a>, stock value has been on the rise for the past month following strong financial results from Sony and its profitable game segment.</p>
<p>As for what's next from FromSoftware, president Hidetaki Miyazaki stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-2-is-not-in-development-says-fromsoftwares-miyazaki">a sequel to Elden Ring is not in development</a>, but the company does have multiple projects in the works.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
