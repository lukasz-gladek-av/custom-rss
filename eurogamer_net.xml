            <p>The director of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has claimed he was able to beat the game solo and without relics, that it's very possible to do so, and wants players to have the confidence to try it themselves.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/elden-ring-nightreign-director-interview-if-he-can-solo-every-boss-so-can-you/">In an interview with CNET</a>, director Junya Ishizaki was asked about how many bosses he had beaten himself, to which he responded: "I can hopefully give you reassurance to know that I have beaten all of the game's bosses. I've seen everything it has to offer, both in multiplayer and as a solo player. So I want you and players to know that this is very possible, and I want you to have the confidence to give it a try yourself. "</p>
<p>In a quick follow up, Ishizaki was asked if he'd solo'd every boss in the game too, to which he confirmed: "Yes. And without relics."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-is-now-easier-for-solo-players">Elden Ring Nightreign was made easier for solo players last week</a>, acting as a salve for those who felt the solo experience was too daunting compared to the difficulty level experienced in groups of three. FromSoftware also announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">duo-mode is in development in response to player feedback</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while many are struggling still and Ishizaki has politely laid out a "Git Gud" to folks, one player has already jazzed up a regular Nightreign run by beating Gaping Jaw with a saxophone controller. This player - Dr. Doot - previously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg3RS_vYxpM">beat Elden Ring with a saxophone without being hit</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-years-agdq-included-someone-speedrunning-elden-ring-bosses-with-a-saxophone">and finished the game on the sax in less than 30 minutes at ADGQ this year</a>.</p> <div>

<p>So what I'm wondering is, when is Ishizaki busting his sax out? If he can't crack it, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-streamer-missmikkaa-completes-elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-on-a-dance-mat">a DDR mat would also suffice</a>.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign has proven to be a solid success despite its drastic departure from FromSoftware norms,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players"> surpassing 3.5 million players yesterday</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
