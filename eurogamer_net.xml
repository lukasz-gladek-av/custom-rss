            <p>The Tomb Raider TV series from Amazon and Phoebe Waller-Bridge looks to no longer be happening.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14569897/Phoebe-Waller-Bridge-gravy-train.html">Daily Mail</a> sources, the project is - much like many animals and people that Lara Croft crosses paths with - "dead". </p>
<p>Meanwhile, when it comes to reports that Game of Thrones' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-thrones-sophie-turner-reportedly-in-talks-to-play-lara-croft-in-amazons-tomb-raider-tv-series">Sophie Turner was set to star as the series' globe-trotting lead</a>, a source said that "this is not going ahead".</p>

<p>The Mail's report comes after <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/jennifer-salke-steps-down-as-head-of-amazon-mgm-studios-segues-to-producing-with-first-look-deal/ar-AA1BNwen?ocid=BingNewsSerp">Jennifer Salke announced she was stepping down as head of Amazon MGM Studios</a> after seven years. Salke was a driving force behind getting Phoebe Waller-Bridge on board with Amazon.</p>
<p>According to an interview with Puck, and reported by <a href="https://screenrant.com/tomb-raider-show-prime-video-phoebe-waller-bridge-no-script-report/">Screen Rant</a>, Waller-Bridge is yet to even produce a script for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a>.</p>
<p>"Tomb Raider, which Waller-Bridge has been working on and which Salke was personally overseeing after announcing a series pickup last May, has now gone through two writers rooms and tens of millions of dollars in development costs," reads the report.</p>
<p>While things aren't looking promising for Amazon's Tomb Raider series, the company is yet to officially announce the project has been scrapped. Eurogamer has contacted the company for more information.</p>

<p>We first got wind of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">Waller-Bridge's Tomb Raider Amazon series in 2023</a>, before it was firmed up further in May last year.</p>
<p>"If I could tell my teenage self that this was happening, I think she'd explode,"  <a href="https://www.tombraider.com/news/movies-and-tv/prime-video-orders-tomb-raider-live-action-series">said Waller-Bridge at that time</a>. "Tomb Raider has been a huge part of my life and I feel incredibly privileged to be bringing it to television with such passionate collaborators. </p>
<p>
"Lara means a lot to me, as she does to many, and I can't wait to go on this adventure. Bats 'n all."

<p>Along with the series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-games-working-with-crystal-dynamics-on-next-tomb-raider">Amazon is also working with Crystal Dynamics on the next Tomb Raider game</a>. Details have remained fairly sparse for the upcoming Tomb Raider since it was announced. In fact, all we really know right now is that it is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-announces-next-tomb-raider-game-made-in-unreal-engine-5">being made in Unreal Engine 5</a> and will have "mind-bending puzzles to solve" and a "wide variety of enemies to face and overcome".</p>
<p>In August last year, Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-huge-huge-task-but-things-are-going-well">development on the upcoming Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon was "going well"</a>, but did not elaborate much further than that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Just in case you were getting anxious about needing a PlayStation Network account to play Marathon - the upcoming reimagined PvP extraction shooter from the Sony-owned Bungie - on PC and Xbox, I have good news - you won't!</p>
<p>In response to a comment shared on Marathon's Discord channel in which one user said they were a tad "spooked" by the idea of having to use a PSN login to play, the Marathon team replied with a clear cut and straight to the point message:</p>
<p>"Marathon will not require a PlayStation Account for players on PC and Xbox."</p>

<p>The conversation around the PlayStation Network - which is an online gaming and media content distribution service - kicked off last year, when Sony announced it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">retroactively making accounts mandatory for Helldivers 2 on PC</a>. At this time, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> publisher said this was all to do with safety and security, adding it was always meant to be a requirement for Helldivers 2 players on PC, but due to issues at launch, linking was made optional for a period of time.</p>
<p>However, the company's decision was met with intense backlash from the community, which included the game getting an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">influx of negative reviews on Steam</a>. Sony ultimately <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">overturned its-then plans to enforce mandatory PSN linking for Helldivers 2 players on PC</a>, and has since softened its PSN stance further afield.</p>
<p>In January of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-pulls-controversial-psn-account-requirements-for-marvels-spider-man-2-and-other-games-on-pc">Sony announced it was going to be removing those mandated PSN account requirements</a> from a number of its PC releases, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarok</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Remastered, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> and The Last of US Part 2 Remastered.</p>
<p>It still wants to give players an incentive to sign up to a PSN account, though. On the PC release of The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered earlier this month, the team at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastereds-pc-specs-and-features-detailed-as-sony-reiterates-no-psn-account-required">Sony used the promise of 50 in-game points to activate bonus features</a>, along with a new Ellie skin featuring<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-hate-directed-at-the-last-of-us-part-2-naughty-dog-boss-says-next-game-about-the-entirely-uncontroversial-topics-of-faith-and-religion"> Jordan A. Mun's jacket from Naughty Dog's upcoming Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> to entice players to login.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, it is unknown if Sony will do something similar to encourage players to use a PSN account while playing Marathon. We have asked PlayStation for a comment.</p>

<p>Bungie - which also makes Destiny - first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-returns-to-its-roots-with-a-pvp-twist-on-classic-fps-series-marathon">announced it was reviving Marathon back in May 2023</a>, but very little has been heard about it since.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-quietly-removes-explicit-game-featuring-extreme-sexual-violence-from-steam-in-uk<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><strong>Content Warning: This article includes references to extreme sexual violence, please read on at your own discretion. </strong></p>
<p>Valve has removed a Steam game which contained explicit sexual violence from sale in various countries, including the UK, following media attention. </p>
<p>The Steam page for No Mercy described the game as "a 3D choice-driven adult visual novel with a huge focus on incest and male domination". Gameplay footage seen by Eurogamer included non-consensual sex.</p>
<p>When No Mercy first came to our attention, Eurogamer contacted Valve for comment regarding the game's themes and graphic content, and asked why it had been allowed onto the PC storefront, but we did not hear back. Now, Valve has quietly removed No Mercy from sale in the UK and other countries.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, UK technology secretary Peter Kyle berated Valve for allowing No Mercy to be sold. "We expect every one of those [tech] companies to remove content as soon as they possibly can after being made aware of it," Kyle told <a href="https://www.lbc.co.uk/tech/steam-violent-misogyny-video-game-no-mercy/">LBC</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/uk-minister-slams-valve-for-explicit-game-promoting-non-consensual-sexual-contact-and-sexual-violence">GamesIndustry.biz</a>). "That's what the law requires, it is what I require as a secretary of state, and it is certainly how we expect platforms who operate and have the privilege of access to British society, and British economy, to do."</p>
<p>While No Mercy's Steam page did warn that the game included violent, graphic imagery and themes, Valve's storefront allows anyone to view product pages by simply inputting a date of birth via a drop-down menu, with no further checks necessary. </p>
<p>The Game Ratings Authority, which administers the PEGI system in the UK, stated "games on Steam can optionally apply for a PEGI age rating via our classification process", however this is "not mandated by the platform" ahead of a game's release on the storefront.</p>
<p>It added the Games Rating Authority had "not classified this game" prior to its release on Steam, and nor had it been requested to do so since.</p>
<p>In an additional statement shared with GamesIndustry.biz, CEO of Women in Games Dr Marie-Claire Isaaman said the organisation was "appalled by recent reports surrounding a Steam game, which encourages players to 'become every woman's worst nightmare' and 'never take no for an answer'."</p>
<p>Isaaman said the availability of games such as No Mercy on Steam was "utterly unacceptable", as it "sends a clear and distressing message: that violence against women is not only tolerable, but playable".</p>
<p>"That message has no place in our industry, our communities, or our society," Isaaman said.</p>
<p>GamesIndustry.biz has also now reported that No Mercy is unavailable for sale in Australia and Canada.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has again reached out to Valve for comment on No Mercy, asking why it was ever allowed on Steam, and about its subsequent removal from the platform.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
