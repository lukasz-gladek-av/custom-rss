If it's charity speed runs you want, then it's charity speed runs you'll get; Awesome Games Done Quick organisers have announced the annual seven-day event will return in January 2025, and its full speedrun schedule is available to peruse now.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 runs from 5th-12th January next year, featuring over 130 speedruns across its duration. And as per its <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/52">newly released schedule</a>, the line-up is a typically eclectic one, covering everything from triple-A blockbuster titles and indie games to retro classics and other assorted oddities.
</p>
<p>
Proceedings get underway at 4:30pm GMT on Sunday, 5th January, with an introductory pre-amble ahead of an All Parts speedrun of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin">Pikmin</a> on Switch by RayOken. Things then come to a close seven days later with a Map Randomizer Race speedrun of Super Metroid - starring Andy, Eddie, imyt, and Oatsngoats - at 4:10am on Sunday, 12th January.

<p>
Inbetween, there's everything from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine</a> to The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, as well as the traditional Awful Games Done Quick block - which this year kicks off with Superman 64 at 3:24am on Thursday, 9th January, before forging onward with the likes of Golf With Your Grandmother, Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing, and the superbly named Doronko Wanko. Also of note is the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a> speedrun on Saturday, 11th January, which will be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1sjLtAk3EU">accompanied by a live rock band</a> playing renditions of its in-game tunes.
</p><p>
If you're looking to attend Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 in-person, it's being held at the Wyndham Grand in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for the second time in a row, and <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/FMfcgzQXKDWWRRbtgZMmlScwxxFHLgbX">registration is now open</a>. Of course, if that's too much of an impractical trek, the whole thing is also being streamed online <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick">via the Games Done Quick channel on Twitch</a> as it happens.
</p>
<p>
Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 is once again raising money for the Prevent Cancer Foundation, after this year's event amassed £1.9m for the charity back in January. Its sister event, Summer Games Done Quick 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-games-done-quick-2024-raises-19m-taking-its-lifetime-charitable-total-to-40m">raised £1.9m for Doctors Without Borders</a> in July, taking the organisation's lifetime charitable total to over £40m.
