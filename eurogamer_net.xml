Call of Duty veteran Michael Condrey has reportedly been fired as the head of 2K Games studio 31st Union after its debut project, free-to-play hero shooter Project Ethos, recieved a muted reponse on its reveal toward the end of last year.
</p>
<p>
Condrey, who co-founded Call of Duty developer Sledgehammer Games, was confirmed to be leading 2K's 31st Union in 2019. A year later, Condrey <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2k-rebrands-studio-headed-by-sledgehammer-co-founder-to-31st-union">teased</a> the studio was working on an "ambitious and inspired new IP" - but it wasn't until last October that the game, now known as Project Ethos, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-veteran-reveals-project-ethos-a-roguelike-hero-shooter-backed-by-2k">finally revealed</a>.
</p>
<p>
Project Ethos was officially described as a free-to-play "roguelike hero shooter", and featured a colourful art style reminiscent of Blizzard's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>. Unfortunately, its unveiling came just months after consumer apathy led to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">rapid demise of PlayStation's Concord</a> - and it appears there wasn't much enthusiasm for Project Ethos either.

<p>
In a <a href="https://kotaku.com/michael-condrey-projet-ethos-31st-union-2k-games-1851756173">new report by Kotaku</a>, sources claim Project Ethos - which is said to have faced a "challenging and rocky development cycle" under Condrey - was revealed to "little fanfare or apparent player interest". That seemingly sparked a chain of events leading to Condrey's reported firing as 31st Union's studio head earlier this week.
</p>
<p>
In a statement provided to Kotaku, 2K confirmed Condrey's departure as 31st Union president, saying he would be "transitioning his role in the short term to focus on advising on the future of Project Ethos". The publisher also insisted it remains "very committed to the forward path for Project Ethos and the people and culture of the 31st Union studio."
</p>
<p>
"We are grateful to Michael Condrey," it added, "for the dedication, passion and work ethic it took to build an incredible team and shape the vision of 31st Union."
</p>
<p>
2K, of course, has packed slate of major releases over the next 12 months, with Civilization 7, Borderlands 4, Mafia: The Old Country, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> creator Ken Levine's Judas, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> behemoth <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> all on the way.

            <p>
Valve has quietly implmented a useful new Steam feature warning users - and potential purchasers - how long it's been since an early access game last received an update.
</p>
<p>
Steam early access has unquestionably helped a huge number of games get over the development finish line since its introduction in 2013, including some major success stories - Hades, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rimworld">RimWorld</a>, Rust, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a>, and Larian Studios' 2023 smash hit <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> were all early access releases, for instance. But many titles never make it that far, ending up abandoned and languishing in early access forever.
</p>
<p>
And historically, it's not always been easy to distinguish the abandoned games from those still in active development - not without poking around though user reviews and developer update, at least. But now - as spotted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lhgj6fphkx2y">SteamDB on Bluesky</a> - Valve is seemingly looking to make that process easier by placing a warning on early access titles that haven't been updated in a year, enabling users to make a more informed purchasing decision.

<p>
Users viewing an affected release will now see a message in its early access box warning, "The last update made by the developer was over [x] months ago. The information and timeline described here by the developers here may no longer be up to date." The message appears to trigger after 12 months without an update, increasing monthly then yearly from there.
</p>
<p>
Valve hasn't publicly detailed its thinking behind the new feature, something it occasionally does over on the official Steam blog, but it's certainly a useful addition given the increasing number of games adopting the Steam early access development model - a figure that's risen from seven in 2013 to 2,605 last year, <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/?tagid=493">according to SteamDB</a>.
</p>
<p>
Valve's ongoing Steam finessing has also brought the likes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-adds-game-recording-function-to-steam-and-it-works-on-steam-deck">video game recording</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-client-update-adds-swathe-of-nifty-features-including-notes-and-ability-to-watch-films-while-you-play">pinned notes</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-valve-is-introducing-a-new-review-system-to-filter-out-unhelpful-reviews">enhanced review filtering</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-families-officially-launches-out-of-beta">new family sharing options</a> to the platform in recent years. It additionally introduced the ability for Steam users to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-can-now-hide-your-steam-games-from-public-view">mark individual titles in their library as private</a> last March, preventing prying eyes from watching as they fire up Saucy Bum Game 4.
