            <p>
Developer NetherRealm has surprise-launched a Definite Edition of 2023's divisive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a>, and some fans are taking it as a sign that development is coming to an end.
</p>
<p>
NetherRealm released its Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition overnight on Switch, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC with minimal fanfare. It bundles together the main game, its Khaos Reigns story expansion, Shang Tsung, two Kombat Packs featuring additional fighters and Kameo characters, some in-game currency, and a selection of skins. Animality finishing moves have also been added in a free update for all players.
</p>
<p>
All that equates to around 18 months of post-launch support following Mortal Kombat 1's divisive arrival back in 2023. Chris Moyse criticised the game's "receding features, underbaked mechanics, and a dated online experience" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-1-review">Eurogamer's Mortal Kombat 1 review</a>, and the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-1-players-hit-back-at-freemium-model-dlc-pricing">drew further complaints</a> as the extent of its aggressive post-launch monetisation became clear. In the time since, NetherRealm has continued its schedule of DLC releases - now collected in the Definitive Edition - culminating in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/our-first-look-at-terminators-t-1000-mortal-kombat-1-finisher-is-terrifying">arrival of Terminator's T-1000</a> in March.

<p>
However, following the character's release, there's been little talk of future DLC plans, beyond a couple of skins intended to tie-in with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-film-poster-reveals-first-look-at-karl-urbans-johnny-cage">this year's Mortal Kombat movie sequel</a>, and player numbers - on Steam at least - have settled in the low thousands, barely higher than those of the now-six-year-old <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-11">Mortal Kombat 11</a>. It's in this context fans are interpreting the launch of Mortal Kombat 1's Definitive Edition as a development death knell, with many mocking NetherRealm boss Ed Boone's <a href="https://x.com/interloko/status/1922693458772312189">earlier promise</a> the studio would "work on the game for years to come", and his <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1838566106119749948">more recent commitment</a> to "supporting Mortal Kombat 1 for a long time to come."
</p>
<p>
"The arrival of the definitive edition meant it was over with the previous games, so... I guess that was it," noted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1kmhhqw/this_means_its_over/">one poster on the Mortal Kombat subreddit</a>, which is currently awash with similar sentiments of largely resigned apathy. Others have pointedly resurfaced claims made by a reliable leaker last year that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1h0eozm/mortal_kombat_1_leaker_says_all_year_3_content/">Mortal Kombat 1 development would be ending</a> amid poor DLC sales. "We can always hold out hope for more Beige skins with red trim," joked another.
</p>
<p>
Mortal Kombat publisher Warner Bros. (which reported a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-failed-to-launch-a-game-last-quarter-resulting-in-48-drop-in-gaming-revenue">48 percent drop in gaming revenue</a> earlier this week) hasn't explicitly confirmed the end of Mortal Kombat 1's development following its Definitive Edition release, but we've contacted the company for more information.
</p>
<p>
Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition, should you be interested, costs £54.99/$69.99 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, while Switch players can pick it up for $59.99. There's also a £49.99/$59.99 Definitive Edition Upgrade ($49.99 on Switch) for Mortal Kombat 1 owners wanting to get everything in the new version without purchasing each bit of DLC separately.

Infamous idle game Cookie Clicker is getting launched for actual consoles - so prepare to never turn your TV off, ever again.
</p>
<p>
The bizarre browser-based bakery time-waster <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infamous-idle-game-cookie-clicker-is-getting-a-steam-release">previously got a launch on Steam back in 2021</a>, so perhaps its forthcoming leap to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S shouldn't come as a total surprise.
</p>
<p>
Word of Cookie Clicker's impending console launch was first <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/orteil42/783558195490832384/hey-so-opti-got-a-couple-chickens-at-his-cool-new">noted by the game's creator Orteil42 on his Tumblr page</a>, prompting <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1kmzf5z/cookie_clicker_is_coming_to_switchxboxplaystation/">fans on reddit</a> to quickly find freshly-prepped product pages on the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/cookie-clicker/9n7l3v49zs5t">Microsoft Store</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10008761/">PlayStation Store</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/cookie-clicker-switch/">Nintendo eShop</a>.

<p>
Cookie Clicker's eShop page specifically lists a release date for the game's console version - 22nd May - and a price, $4.99. This is the same amount that Cookie Clicker also costs on Steam - and here in the UK, that translates to £4.29.
</p>
<p>
Originally launched in 2013, Cookie Clicker is a menace to productivity and your home energy bill (unless you play at work, then good luck to you). From humble beginnings clicking to create virtual cookies, you can create a sci-fi baking empire powered by increasingly odd means - and also by employing lots of virtual grannies. The longer you leave the game running, the more you make, and the deeper you get sucked down its doughy rabbit hole.
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/">browser version is still available</a>, and still free. Sorry.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>In-person work provides "a kinetic energy that fuels creativity", CEO says.</p>

            <p>
EA has detailed a new in-office working policy that will see all local employees return at least three days a week, and largely phase out remote roles.
</p>
<p>
The changes mean any employee living within a 30-mile radius will be required to commute at least three days a week under a new hyrbid policy. 
</p>
<p>
Employees working outside of that 30-mile radius will continue to work remotely unless their role is designated oherwise - though there's uncertainty over EA saying it will additionally  "sunset the Offsite Local work model" over the next "three to 24 months", depending on location.
</p>
<p>
Staff members this affects told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring">IGN</a> they believe this means existing remote workers will have their "exemptions" removed over the next two years, with uncertainty over any remote working after that time. 
</p>
<p>
Certainly, it sounds like fully remote work will be an exception going forward. Any exception to the above policies or future hiring for a remote position will need direct approval from EA CEO Andrew Wilson or company president Laura Miele, the latter said in an email, describing the changes as a shift from "a decentralised approach to a globally consistent, enterprise-wide work model".
</p>
<p>
Explaining the changes, Wilson said in-person work was EA's preference as it provided "a kinetic energy that fuels creativity, innovation, and connection, often resulting in unexpected breakthroughs that lead to incredible experiences for our players".
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted EA for detail on how this policy will impact the company's UK studios. 
</p>
<p>Numerous employers are attempting to bring staff back to offices following years of remote working - to a mixed response. In March 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developers-blast-rockstars-reckless-decision-to-return-to-office-full-time">developers working on GTA 6 criticised Rockstar for telling employees they must return to the office full-time</a> with just a month's notice, calling the decision "reckless". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Call%20of%20Duty:%20Black%20Ops%206%20developers%20protest%20over%20office%20working%20policy">Protests were held by Call of Duty developers</a> in autumn last year over Activision's return-to-office plans, around the same time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Ubisoft%20staff%20told%20to%20strike%20over%20remote%20working%20changes">Ubisoft workers also went on strike in Paris</a>. And in late 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-tells-most-employees-to-return-to-the-office-part-time-or-take-a-severance-package">Roblox told most employees to return to the office part-time or take a severance package</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The tour will include special guests and events, but details for each stop will be confirmed later. It's unclear if Kojima himself will be part of the tour, though <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1922846867886354810">he has shared the announcement himself</a> on social media.</p>
