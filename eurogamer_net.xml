            <p>Last night, we got our first good look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>'s upcoming James Bond game, 007: First Light. While the developer has said that First Light - or as it was previously known, Project 007 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-a-fresh-faced-whipper-snapper-of-a-james-bond-in-007-first-light">will serve as an origin story for the spy</a>, and not be a "gamification" of any of the films that have come before, last night's trailer still had a fair few nods to Bonds of the past.</p>
<p>Please note, I will be talking about events from the James Bond series generally below, <strong>so please be aware of potential spoilers for the films and books if you haven't already enjoyed them for yourself</strong>.</p>

<p>First up, there is this Bond's facial scar. As you can see in the trailer above, this young Bond may be fresh faced when it comes to life as an agent, but he has clearly had a few scrapes already, earning himself a long thin scar down his cheek.</p>
<p>While the Bonds in the films have not boasted a scar like this, the book version of Bond did. Ian Flemming wrote that Bond had a three-inch long, thin vertical scar running down his right cheek. You can see some artwork of this book-based Bond below.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Meanwhile, given his overall look in the game, many have surmised that the actor playing James Bond in First Light is Patrick Gibson from Dexter: Original Sin (I have asked IO if they can confirm this).</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Paramount</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In addition to this physical trait, there are also multiple other nods to the James Bond book and film series scattered throughout First Light's trailer that hint to the story, such as Bond's parents dying in a climbing-related accident.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the trailer says 009 is a "master manipulator", which made me think this was a little tease for him being a bit of a bad egg that fooled and betrayed his country a la Sean Bean's 006 from GoldenEye. A little number flip there from IO?</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>MGM</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>On the cars and gadget side of things, because of course Bond is going to have cars and gadgets, First Light again is honouring the series that has come before.</p>
<p>In IO's trailer, Bond can be seen entering Q branch, where he selects one from a number of watches. This watch obviously does more than tell the time, and triggers a blast from a nearby motorbike, which again is in keeping with Bond's watches from the series.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>IO</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While in the Sean Connory era, Bond often sported a Rolex Submariner, in many of the later films he changed things up a bit, with the agent wearing watches such as a Pulsar LED digital and a Seiko 0674 LC at times. </p>
<p>In 2006's Casino Royale, which marked Daniel Craig's first outing as the MI6 agent, Vesper Lynd commented on Bond's watch: "Rolex?" she asks. "Omega," he replies. Bond's watches are a big deal, and in First Light, <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/1930380893811610084">IO has partnered with Omega</a> once again.</p>

<p>Speaking of partnering with a known Bond-brand again, of course we will see the agent in an Aston Martin in First Light.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>IO</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This vehicle is slicker than Moore's bus from Live and Let Die, but it is the same as the actors' yellow Aston Martin DBS from The Persauders, so another little nod to the series' legacy.</p>

<p>Additionally, we can see IO's Bond chasing down a red sports car in the First Light trailer, which reminded me a bit of the playful chase between Pierce Brosnan's Bond and Xenia Onatopp in GoldenEye.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>MGM</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Setting the scene further, then, we also saw a chess game being played during last night's trailer. Now, we don't clearly see <em>who </em>is playing chess here, so it could be Bond flexing his prowess like he often does at cards. And is that a martini, shaken not stirred?</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>IO</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That said, in From Russia with Love, there is a scene where Bond baddy Kronsteen plays chess, so as soon as I saw this moment in the First Light trailer, I thought of that. Essentially, baddies play chess, right?</p>
<figure>
<p>

<p>There is a clip towards the end of the trailer where a speed boat zips through some islands very much like those from The Man With the Golden Gun (Khao Phing Kan, but known also as James Bond Island, no less). This is one of my favourite James Bond locations, so I was pleased to see this pop up. </p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>IO</cite></span></figcaption>

<p>Also, the Junks in this scene are much like those of Scaramanger's.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>MGM</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Last up for this piece (I am sure I will be doing more, because guys, it's Bond!), the music played over the trailer was the theme from On Her Majesty's Secret Service. You can have a listen to it below. </p>

<p>007: First Light is set for release in 2026. Towards the end of last year, IO said it hopes its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy">upcoming James Bond origin story will be the start of a trilogy</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/iois-james-bond-game-name-officially-announced-ahead-of-full-reveal-this-week">007: First Light will also feature again later this week during IO's own showcase</a>, which is scheduled for Friday, 6th June, at 6pm PDT. That's 2am on 7th June for those of us in the UK.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Today's the day. After months and years of speculation about what Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> will be, today, it releases in the wild. You'll be able to get your mitts on it and tell us what you think. Are you as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-a-couple-of-hours-mario-kart-worlds-open-world-left-me-slightly-underwhelmed-but-is-there-more-to-it">excited by Mario Kart World</a> as the, um, world seems to be? What do you make of the Switch 2 upgrades for games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/welcome-tour-is-the-switch-2s-welcome-surprise-and-might-even-be-worth-your-8-quid">Is Welcome Tour really worth the £8 Nintendo is asking for</a>? And Will the Switch 2 launch go as smoothly and successfully as Nintendo hopes?</p>
<p>We'll be covering all aspects of the Switch 2 launch and gathering everything together here so you can see at a glance what's been going on. We'll be keeping an eye on any launch issues there may be, any launch stock there may be, and how the world is reacting to playing Nintendo's new machine. And that includes you - we want to hear what you think in the comments below.</p>

    <p>I was just on Radio 5 Live chatting about Switch 2. Adrian Chiles has given me permission to just play the console for the rest of time basically, so I guess this may be the last you hear from me XD Guys, it has been a pleasure!</p>

    Like my colleagues, I am also sat waiting impatiently for a package to arrive. It's quite rude of the post to be this late, frankly. Don't they know I need to be playing F-Zero GX on a Switch 2 right now, even though I have a copy on a shelf next to me I could already be playing?

    <p>Not everyone can or wants to jump into a new console on day one, but thankfully the Switch is still home to loads of games and it's doubtful you've played all of them. Our own Christian Donlan reckons you should <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-the-week-the-switch-2-launches-is-it-too-late-to-buy-one-last-switch-game-not-if-its-burnout">get Burnout Paradise</a> if you're yet to give it a whirl.</p>

      <p>Nintendo has hidden the SD card slot again</p>
    <p>If you know where the SD card slot on the Switch 2 is, this might seem obvious, but trust me when I say we have plenty of data to show that a lot of people couldn't find it on the OG Switch. So, if you are struggling to locate the slot on the Switch 2, it's under the kickstand. More info is in our handy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/where-is-the-switch-2-sd-slot">guide on how to locate the Switch 2 SD card slot</a>.</p>

    <blockquote><cite>H1ppyDave says:</cite> Screen protector - use a credit card with a piece of cardboard folded over it. For that bubble I’d personally Lift it carefully back up (Inuse a guitar plectrum but anything thin made of plastic should do) and let it resettle.</blockquote>
<p>OMG, H1ppyDave, you're a star. I had been pressing it with just a cloth and had no luck. Used your suggestion and now I'm bubble-free! May your Switch 2 launch day be wonderful!</p>

      <p>Waiting on Argos from the wilds of Scotland</p>
    <p>I am sitting at my desk, twitching like an anxious meerkat because I really, <em>really</em> want my Switch 2 to arrive. One small sound from outside, and I look up and out of the window, hoping it is that glorious DPD van pulling up outside my front door. So far, though, it hasn't been. Boo :( </p>
<p>I live in the wilds of Scotland, and Matt has joked the delivery driver is probably still trying to work out how to get to my house. I really hope they figure it out soon...</p>

    <p>Anyone good with screen protector woes? I applied a tempered glass protector, and it seemed to go perfectly, but then this spot never filled in properly. Is this a "get a new protector" situation? Anyone managed to fix this before? You are my only hope Eurogamer readers.</p>
