            <p>
It's been an eventful news day for fans of adorably sinister horror series <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a>. Not only has the upcoming third instalment received a 10th October release date on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and  - as newly confirmed - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, publisher Bandai Namco has announced an Enhanced Edition of the original game, <em>and</em> a brand-new VR instalment.
</p>
<p>
Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition, which seems as good a place as any to start, promises a bit of a glow-up for developer Tarsier Studios' acclaimed 2017 original. This time around, players can experience raincoat-wearing protagonist Six's strange, dark escape from the mysterious, floating Maw at 4K resolution and 60fps. There's also talk of "RTX reflections, water effects, more particles, and volumetric lighting", plus a choice between Quality and Performance modes, depending on whether you prefer to prioritise visuals or framerate.
</p>
<p>
Bandai Namco has given Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition an official launch date of 10th October, but it's available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC right now for anyone that pre-orders developer Supermassive Games' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares 3</a>. Switch 2 is also getting the Enhanced Edition, but not until October.

<p>
As for that VR version, it's title Little Nightmares: Altered Echoes and... that's pretty much all we know so far. Bandai Namco is yet to confirm a developer, even the platforms it's targeting, but we do get a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CvZB0nFaoE">45-second announcement trailer</a> to tide us over. "Every step echoes closer," the publisher teases, "does this tune sound familiar, little ones?" Also promising is the newly teased Little Nightmares stop-motion project, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Bandai%20Namco">looks eerily beautiful in its brisk reveal trailer</a>, although there's no hint as to when or even <em>where</em> this might eventually show up. Is it related to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nightmare-before-christmas-director-bringing-little-nightmares-to-tv">Little Nightmares TV show announced back in 2017</a>? Time will tell.
</p>
<p>
So to recap: Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition is out now for those that pre-order Little Nightmares 3, otherwise both games launch on 10th October. Little Nightmares: Altered Echoes, meanwhile, exists, and there's not much else to say. As to what original Little Nightmares developer Tarsier Studios is up to now, having walked away from the series after part 2, that'll be Reanimal. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-nightmares-studios-reanimal-is-more-kids-in-dark-places-but-now-with-co-op">another kids-in-dark-places horror adventure</a> (but with added co-op) that's coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC later this year.
