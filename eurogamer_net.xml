Thoughts might be turning toward <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a> 2 - and developer FuturLab has now shared a fresh look at its recently announced hose-'em-up sequel - but the original also just got another free update, letting hardened sprayers unload their nozzle somewhere new.
</p>
<p>
Starting with PowerWash Simulator 2, FuturLab's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH6DJo5Ou3E">latest trailer</a> provides a whistlestop tour of the sequel's new features, which include a fruity truck, a new furnishable HQ, split-screen co-op, and more. It doesn't say much we didn't already know, admittedly, but once you've watched the trailer you can always <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-simulator-2-announced-and-its-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">delve a little deeper into the sequel</a> elsewhere on Eurogamer.
</p>
<p>
But if you're looking for something new to hose in the more immediate term, there's The Muckingham Files 5. This latest free update for the original PowerWash Simulator introduces Muckingham's Dessert Parlour, where players will be assisting Gemma Smetana by bringing the building's sugar-blasted interior back to a gleaming sheen.

<p>
"You'll be tasked with tackling this sticky mess of cake, ice cream, and jam," FuturLab explains, "to transform this local hangout to its former treat filled glory."
</p>
<p>
PowerWash Simulator's free The Muckingham Files 5 update - which follows on from <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1290000/announcements/detail/542229141158625303">February's paid Wallace &amp; Gromit DLC</a> - is available now on all platforms. And despite the looming presence of PowerWash Simulator 2, which is currently set to arrive later this year, FuturLab still isn't done with the original. According to the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1290000/announcements/detail/542229141158625303">studio's 2025 PowerWash Simulator 1 roadmap</a>, two free updates are due this year, meaning we're one down and one to go.

            <p>
As part of tonight's Galaxies Gaming Showcase, developer Remedy Entertainment has shown off a little more of its upcoming three-player co-op Control spin-off, FBC: Firebreak, with a more substantial reveal now confirmed to be airing next Thursday, 24th April.
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak, for the uninitiated, casts players as members of the Federal Bureau of Control's Firebreak division, a team of volunteer first responders charged with roaming the ever-changing Oldest House and keeping its unconfined paranatural anomalies in check.
</p>
<p>
When last we saw FBC: Firebreak, Remedy was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-multiplayer-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-asks-the-question-what-happens-when-the-offices-post-it-notes-fight-back">showing off a mission involving a rampant spread of sentient Post-It notes</a>, but its latest trailer - which maintains the same quippy tone - goes all in on rampaging furnaces and an outbreak of pink exploding goo (AKA Exogenic Mass) as players attempt to regain control of the Oldest House's Maintenance Sector.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="FBC: Firebreak – Hazards of the Job Trailer (Galaxies Games Showcase)" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Cn1wuzmaf8?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
These are just two more of the otherworldly hazards players may face as their team embarks on new Jobs at the behest of FBC uppermanagement, each chaotic mission taking them to different areas of the Oldest House - some familiar and some new - and featuring different mechanics, enemies, objectives, and even status-effect-style conditions.
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak already looks to offer a promising extradimensional twist on the co-operative shooter - and one mercifully free of time-sucking live-service trappings, at that - and it's set to launch for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this "summer". However, those eager to learn more about Remedy's latest can tune into a <a href="http://twitch.tv/remedygames">special Twitch livestream</a> at 6pm BST/10am PDT next Thursday, 24th April, when the studio is promising "brand new content and exciting news".
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak isn't the only game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/max-payne-1-2-remake-enters-full-production-control-2-features-in-playable-form">currently in the works at Remedy</a>, of course. It's also collaborating with Rockstar to remake <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> 1 &amp; 2, and there'll be more opportunity to revisit the Oldest House away from FBC: Firebreak thanks to fully fledged sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/control-2">Control 2</a>.
