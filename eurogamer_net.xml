            <p>
EA has reportedly cancelled its single-player Black Panther game and closed the studio behind it, resulting in an unspecified number of layoffs.
</p>
<p>
EA Entertainment president Laura Miele shared the news in an email to staff <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-games">seen by IGN</a>, insisting today's Black Panther cancellation, the closure of Cliffhanger Games, and the resulting job losses - as well the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reportedly-lays-off-over-300-employees-cancels-new-titanfall-game">recent cancellation of other projects</a>, including an unannounced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> game at Respawn - would help the publisher "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities."
</p>
<p>
EA declined to comment on the number of employees impacted by its latest round of layoffs when approached by IGN (these will reportedly also affect members of the publisher's mobile and central divisions), but the website says it understands fewer individuals will be affected compared to the 300 job cuts recently made across Respawn and several other teams.
</p>
<p>
"These decisions are hard," Miele wrote. "They affect people we've worked with, learned from, and shared real moments with. We're doing everything we can to support them - including finding opportunities within EA, where we've had success helping people land in new roles."
</p>
<p>
EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-single-player-black-panther-game-from-new-studio">announced its Black Panther title</a> back in 2023, confirming it would be handled by its then-new Cliffhanger Games studio in collaboration with Marvel Games. Although few details were shared at the time, it was described as a third-person title set in an "expansive and reactive" version of Wakanda, and still "early in development". Nothing has been seen of the project since then, but a job listing in 2024 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-black-panther-game-will-be-open-world-recruitment-ad-suggests">indicated it would be an open-world game</a>.
</p>
<p>
Black Panther's cancellation follows EA CEO Andrew Wilson's comments last year that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-further-lay-offs-this-time-likely-to-affect-around-670-employees">publisher would be moving away from "future licensed IP"</a>. And while Miele insisted EA will continue to invest in developer Motive's Iron Man project and Respawn's third Star Wars: Jedi game, she suggested the focus will now be on a small number of its own franchises, specifically Battlefield, The Sims, Skate, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>. That's in addition to Bioware's next <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>.
</p>
<p>
Notably, EA also recently announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-its-pausing-development-on-future-rally-games-as-wrc-partnership-ends">ending its licensing partnership with the World Rally Championship</a> and "pausing development" on all future rally games - a move which resulted in an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-it-is-reducing-roles-at-codemasters-and-redeploying-as-many-as-possible">undisclosed number of additional layoffs</a> at Codemasters.
</p>
<p>
A second Black Panther project - publisher Skydance Games' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, which is being penned by Uncharted writer Amy Hennig - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amy-hennigs-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-into-next-year">recently delayed into next year</a>.
