            <p>Judging by reactions online across the world, the cost of the Switch 2 and its software has proven to be controversial. Perhaps Nintendo knew this, considering it didn't include the price in the actual <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">Direct presentation</a>.</p>
<p>Here in the UK, the console will cost £395.99, or £429.99 bundled with Mario Kart World, when it launches on 5th June. That's compared to the £280 launch price of the original Switch, and £310 launch price of the OLED.</p>
<p>It's the increase in the cost of games themselves, though, that's proven most shocking. Mario Kart World, for instance, will cost £74.99 for a physical copy, or £66.99 digitally. That's an increase from £49.99 for most brand new original Switch games.</p>

<p>Donkey Kong Bananaza, meanwhile, is slightly cheaper: £66.99 for a physical copy and £58.99 digital. There's the Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour game too, which will cost 990 yen <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/aahea/index.html">according to the Japanese website</a> - that's around a fiver.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-physical-releases-will-just-have-a-download-key-on-the-card">some Switch 2 physical game cards won't actually include the full game</a>, but include a download key instead. As for the difference between physical and digital pricing, this appears to be a shift towards pushing digital games - especially with the addition of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-unveils-virtual-game-cards-thatll-let-you-share-you-digital-switch-and-switch-2-games">sharable Virtual Game Cards Nintendo revealed last week</a>.</p>
<p>Still, accounting for inflation, the Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle works out cheaper in the UK than the original Switch with a copy of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a> in 2017.</p>
<p>To directly compare the consoles alone, £280 for the original Switch works out at £367.40 today with inflation, still cheaper than Switch 2. However, throw in the big launch game and it's a better deal - an original Switch with a separate copy of Breath of the Wild cost £340 at launch in 2017, which works out at £446.13. That's pricier than the Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle.</p>
<p>Over in Europe, the Switch 2 console costs €469.99, or €509.99 for the Mario Kart World bundle. That's equivalent to the cost in the UK.</p>
<p>It's a different story in other parts of the world, however.</p>
<p>In Japan, for instance, Nintendo will be selling a region-locked console at a lower price, in a bid to stop importers due to the weak yen.</p>
<p>The Japan-only console will cost 49980 yen (around £258.95), but will only play Japanese games in Japanese language, with a Japanese Nintendo account.</p>
<p>A more expensive Switch 2 with multilingual support will also be available at 69980 yen, around £362.57. That's still slightly cheaper than in the UK, though doesn't account for import costs.</p>
<p>As for the price of Mario Kart World in Japan, it'll be 9980 yen compared to the cost of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> on the original Switch at 6578 yen. As Dr. Serkan Toto, CEO of Kantan Games, wrote on social media, that's 52 percent more expensive, which is a higher jump than the 33 percent rise from $60 to $80 in the US.</p>

<p>As for the console itself in the US, it costs $450, but there are fears this could rise to as much as $600 if impacted by new tariffs from the Trump administration.</p>
<p>Tariffs - taxes charged on products when they enter the country - could be as much as 46 percent on products from Vietnam, which is where the majority of Switch 2 manufacturing has taken place, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438">Kotaku</a> has reported.</p>
<p>David Gibson, analyst at MST Financial, confirmed to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a781c853-3fed-4dfc-b940-4137546180de">The FT</a>: "Export data combined with finished product codes confirms that Nintendo shipped finished Switch 2 [from Vietnam] across five days in January for a total of 383,000 units with all of them going to the USA."</p>
<p>He added: "I suspect this occurred to test the distribution system and get ahead of the risk of tariffs. I expect the numbers to have ramped-up significantly in February and March."</p>
<p>Wrote Niko Partners director of research and insights <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1907545230699610327">Daniel Ahmad on social media</a>: "Nintendo shifted its manufacturing to Vietnam to avoid tariffs and with today’s reciprocal tariff announcements they're likely going to end up paying tariffs anyway."</p>
<p>Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis also suggested to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive">IGN</a> Nintendo "probably had a range of pricing for the US market in play up until the last minute due to the uncertainty on import tariffs", which is why the price wasn't included in the Direct.</p>
<p>However, analysts don't believe the pricing will impact sales of Switch 2 initially.</p>
<p>"Based on what we're seeing across the market, sales to higher-income or more affluent households likely won't be impacted by this pricing," Circana analyst Mat Piscatella told IGN. "And, of course, we have the price insensitive super enthusiasts that will do and pay whatever it takes to acquire the Switch 2 at launch. Therefore, because of the limited quantities that will be available during the launch year, I do not anticipate this pricing to hinder year one sales volumes.</p>
<p>"The true test will come in year two, as supply is likely to become more readily available, and the addressable market will be forced to widen. So, we'll have to see what happens over the next 9-12 months."</p>
<p>And compared with Sony's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> at £699.99 and Valve's Steam Deck OLED at £479.00, the price of Nintendo's new console still appears reasonable.</p>
<p>Of course, this all depends on whether consumers are able to pre-order, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-pre-orders-will-prioritise-players-with-the-most-switch-playtime">Nintendo is enforcing strict criteria on pre-orders</a> from its own Nintendo store in a bid to reduce scalping. That's based on playtime and the requirement of a Nintendo Online account.</p>
<p>In the meantime, multiple online UK retailers have already gone live and sold out of Switch 2 stock, without the need to meet Nintendo's criteria.</p>

            <p>Switch 2 editions of both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a> will include a number of new features, including achievements.</p>
<p>Both games are getting Switch 2 editions on the console's release, which will boast things like improved visuals and loading times, as well as a second save slot.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, over on the Nintendo Switch Online app (which is being rebranded Nintendo Switch app later next month), users will be able to access Zelda Notes. Zelda Notes is a "new feature that can help you get even more out of your adventures in Hyrule", and is "designed to provide a more streamlined gameplay experience".</p>

<p>Zelda Notes looks pretty nifty, I have to say. It will include things like a voiced navigation guide, all-new voice memories which were not in the original games (with Breath of the Wild having Zelda's memos, and Rauru also confirmed to be chirping up in Tears of the Kingdom), and autobuild sharing in Tears of the Kingdom.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the My Play Data section will keep track of achievement-like medals, which players can earn for doing things such as traveling a great distance across Hyrule, defeating enemies, scooping up those precious rupees, and so on and so forth. Medal names included things like "Monster's Bane", "Treasure Hunter", and "Citizen of Hyrule".</p>
<p>You can then compare your various achievements with others via the Global Play Data section. The Achievements section here has headers such as "Locations Visited" and "Quests and Adventures Cleared".</p>
<p>You can check out the full video breaking down the Switch 2 editions of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom below. I now wonder if this will open up the door for more <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">Switch 2 games</a> to get achievements. </p>

            <p>Nintendo has confirmed the battery life for its upcoming console, the Switch 2.</p>
<p>After a rather choc full Direct yesterday, which gave us a look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">Switch 2 games</a> such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-first-dual-mouse-mode-game-is-wheelchair-basketball-drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-announced-as-switch-2-launch-title-complete-with-24-player-races-new-modes-and-more">Mario Kart World</a>, a few more little titbits of information have started making the rounds.

<p>As shared on a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250402.html">separate spec sheet for Switch 2</a>, Nintendo's next console will house a Lithium ion battery, with a battery capacity of 5220 mAh. Meanwhile, its battery life is "Approx. 2 - 6.5 hours". Nintendo notes this is just an "estimate" life span, and adds "the battery life will depend on the games you play and usage conditions".</p>
<p>While Nintendo itself doesn't go into specifics about which games it is referring to here, it is fair to assume that playing a smaller indie game on a pleasant spring afternoon with a mild breeze blowing will see the console lasting longer in its handheld mode than if you were having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">a full blown battle in Elden Ring</a> during a 40°C heatwave.</p>
<p>Charging time for the console, meanwhile, is approximately three hours while in sleep mode.</p>
<p>To compare the upcoming Switch 2's battery life to other Switch devices, here's what <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/How-Long-Does-the-Battery-Charge-Last-1630015.html#:~:text=Once%20fully%20charged%2C%20the%20battery,approximately%204.5%20to%209%20hours.">Nintendo's support page states</a>:</p>
<p>Once fully charged, the battery duration for the console varies depending on model and on the software application and functions being used.</p>
<ul>
<li>For Nintendo Switch - OLED Model with a serial number that starts with "XT", the battery life is approximately 4.5 to 9 hours.</li>
<li>For Nintendo Switch consoles with a serial number that starts with "XK", the battery life is approximately 4.5 to 9 hours.</li>
<li>For Nintendo Switch consoles with a serial number that starts with "XA", the battery life is approximately 2.5 to 6.5 hours.</li>
<li>For Nintendo Switch Lite, the battery life is approximately 3 to 7 hours.</li>
