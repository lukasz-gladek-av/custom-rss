            <p>Oh, Funko Pop. What have you done? Well, unless my eyes are deceiving me, I think you may have let slip a yet-to-be-aired and potentially pivotal plot point for the second season of Amazon's Fallout adaptation.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of spoilers (past and perhaps future) for Fallout season two below.</strong></p>

<p>Images of an <a href="https://x.com/AmusementTimeYT/status/2010966559385329789">all-new</a> <a href="https://x.com/FunkoPOPsNews/status/2010946498477928916">Funko Pop</a> based on Amazon's Fallout series have started making the <a href="https://pops.today/television/1915-caesar">rounds online</a>, and correct me if I am wrong, but they appear to show Macaulay Culkin's character Lacerta Legate as Caesar. That is to say, the head of the Fallout faction known as Caesar's Legion.</p>
<p>Caesar's Legion plays a not insignificant part in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>, which large parts of the show's second season is based on.</p>
<p>In the show, we meet Caesar's Legion when naive and trusting vault dweller Lucy gets captured by the faction, and popped up on a crucifix to think about what she has done (which was answer a cry for help, damn this wasteland!). We also discover that the Legion is in the midst of a civil war, following the death of the faction's founder. There are now two members who are vying to be the heir, or the new Caesar.</p><p>However, neither of the two potential faction leaders look anything like the upcoming Caesar Funko Pop, which you can see below. Instead, this model looks a lot more like Culkin's high-ranking Lacerta Legate. So, I am going to hazard a guess that something is going to go down at some point during the series' next four episodes, and Lacerta Legate ends up as the man on top.</p>
<p>To compare to the games, in Fallout: New Vegas, players who follow the Legion questline all the way through the end can either cure Caesar of his illness, or kill him. If he dies, Lucius - the leader of the Praetorian Guard - takes over, at least until the finale.</p>
<p>So, do you hope Lacerta Legate becomes the leader of Caesar's Legion in the Fallout show?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-renews-fallout-for-third-season-six-months-before-second-arrives">Fallout was renewed for a third season back in May of last year</a>, months before season two made its debut. Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-3-now-being-written-collaborations-between-show-and-games-discussed">Bethesda's Todd Howard confirmed the third season was already being written</a>, with filming expected to kick off this May.</p><p>As for season two, its episodes are currently airing weekly over on Amazon Prime. And as for other potential Bethesda adaptations, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation">Todd Howard recently told Eurogamer he "can't rule in or rule out an Elder Scrolls thing in the future"</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">Monolith Productions' closure last year</a> remains one of the hardest gut punches the Western games industry has seen recently. From iconic shooters like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-fear-pc">FEAR</a> to the inventive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review">Shadow of Mordor</a> &amp; Shadow of War, the studio always excelled, no matter the genre. Now, unearthed materials allegedly recovered from a discarded HDD used at the studio have revealed work done on a non-Arkham Batman game for Warner Bros.</p>
<p>MrTalida, a renowned "video game enthusiast and archivist," shared their findings <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrtalida.bsky.social">via Bluesky</a> on 13th January. Moreover, an Internet Archive upload was made available for anyone curious about the unmade project. Needless to say, those files should only be accessed at your own risk.</p>
<p>According to the user, the materials go back as far as April 2009 and up to January 2010. It all seemingly belongs to a game that never came close to being anywhere near done. The info and videos mostly deal with isolated gameplay ideas, audio systems, concept art, and development schedules.</p>
<p>There are, however, fragments which present an aesthetic closer (if not the same) to Christopher Nolan's Batman movies. If we also take the time frame into account, we can theorize this could've been a tie-in of sorts, or at least a title which existed outside of the continuity started by Rocksteady's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-asylum-review">Arkham Asylum</a> in 2009.</p><p>This isn't the first time we've seen footage of Monolith's cancelled Batman game. In 2024, more substantial clips of an advanced build of the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-game-that-became-shadow-of-mordor-footage-surfaces-online">popped up online</a>. However, this new batch of materials gives us a closer look at the studio's overall plans, as well as the iconic tank-like "tumbler" Batmobile from the Nolan movies.</p>
<p>Eventually, the project was scrapped and gave way to what became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor">Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a>, a refreshing take on the Lord of the Rings IP that borrowed more than a few tricks from Rocksteady's Batman playbook, so in the end, the studio's slightly different approach to the Dark Knight survived… kind of.</p>
