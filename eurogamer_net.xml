            <p>
Beleagured high street chain GAME has begun auctioning off the fixtures and fittings from its Basingstoke head office and main warehouse, following the site's recent closure as part of the company's continued assimilation by its parent firm.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-wont-have-in-store-switch-2-pre-orders">first reported on the closure of GAME's headquarters earlier this week</a>, with the expectation of job losses. 
</p>
<p>
The move is yet another step in the brand's demise as its own entity, as it becomes just another arm of the Frasers Group, which also owns House of Fraser and Sports Direct.
</p>
<p>
GAME's Basingstoke facility had served as its headquarters for more than two decades. Now, dozens of office and kitchen items, warehouse equipment and a few more unusual oddities are all up for auction on <a href="https://bidonline.ncmauctions.co.uk/auctions/9241/ncm-au11168">bidding site NCM Auctions</a>.
</p>
<p>
Items listed include a shopfloor pirate ship display unit for products from TY, the maker of Beanie Babies. That's currently going for £40. Alternatively, you can buy the company's breakroom football table for £120, or a perspex-fronted poster of CJ from Grand Theft Auto San Andreas for £30.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Untitled-1_SP3fwr5.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>GAME</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Several of the photos give a glimpse behind the scenes in the Basinstoke office - at its board rooms, where <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-u-turns-on-pokemon-card-price-hustle-that-caused-cost-to-almost-triple">decisions like the one to sell Pokémon cards for almost triple the price</a>, were presumably made. One meeting area has a poster for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> expansion Forsaken on the wall. Another small room has a wall decorated with a mural of Nintendo characters.
</p>
<p>The downside? The items are all collection only, so you'll need to be in Basingstoke yourself later this month to pick them up. Suddenly GAME's oversized £10.99 delivery price for those Pokémon cards doesn't seem so bad.</p>
<p>
While GAME's brand still exists, it has largely been reduced nationwide to a concession area within other Frasers Group stores - typically in Sports Direct. 
</p>
<p>
The changes have meant the loss of hundreds of dedicated GAME staff, a continued shift towards GAME's focus of selling toys, and a loss of all the chain's previous customer programmes. 
</p>
<p>
As Eurogamer previously reported, you <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-wont-have-in-store-switch-2-pre-orders">won't be able to pre-order a Switch 2 in-store at GAME</a>. Indeed, Eurogamer has been told by GAME staff that in-store pre-orders will now no longer offered for any item, despite outdated messaging on the company's website saying otherwise.
</p>
<p>
Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-the-fall-of-game-no-games-no-accessories-instead-we-received-136-zendaya-action-figures">Eurogamer reported on GAME's various ongoing issues as it is further integrated into Sports Direct's Fraser Group, and suffers store closures, redundancies, and stock problems</a>.

            <p>
Tequila Works, the indie developer behind Deadlight, Rime and Gylt, is selling off all of its assets in an open auction after declaring bankruptcy at the end of last year. 
</p>
<p>
The rights and trademarks to its games and several unfinished prototypes are now <a href="https://www.escrapalia.com/en/event/evento-de-subasta-activos-intangibles-de-tequila-works-s-l-202503311113069684">listed for sale on auction website Escrapalia</a>, with bids being taken for the next 32 days.
</p>
<p>
Rime and Gylt are currently both fetching the most interest, with around 150 bids for each and an asking price of €15.5k (£13.5k) for each. At the time of writing, Deadlight is going for €2600 (about £2250).
</p>
<p>
Intriguingly, this sale also reveals prototypes for other Tequila Works projects, sold as "vertical slices" the company likely made to pitch to publishers. 
</p>
<p>
The Ancient Mariner is described as an open-world narrative action adventure "focused on human emotions as the engine of gameplay". 
</p>
<p>
Dungeon Tour, meanwhile, would have been a "mid-core cooperative party game for up to four players" where you managed a horde of tourists through dungeons. Tequila Works says it was aiming for a visual and narrative style featuring "dark and absurd humour, in a conceptual mix between Overcooked and Dungeon Keeper".
</p>
<p>
Then there's Brawler Crawler, a multiplayer title focused on combat in "a chaotic urban universe where the player explores and struggles to master their own combat style". This would have featured procedurally-generated lanes with tough raids and bosses.
</p>
<p>
Back in November 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gylt-and-rime-studio-tequila-works-files-for-insolvency-says-prolonged-market-conditions-left-no-other-option">Tequila Works announced it was filing for insolvency</a> as "prolonged market conditions" had left it no other option. Founded in Madrid in 2009, the company's most recent game was Song of Nunu: A League of Legends Story, which was released under the now-defunct Riot Forge publishing label.
</p>
<p>Announcing the company's shutdown, Tequila Works boss Térence Mosca said he was "proud of what [the team] has accomplished together".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Black Mirror may show us a variety of near-future dystopias, but at least those unfortunate to live through one of them can play Balatro.</p>
<p>The poker-themed roguelike Balatro became a smash hit on its release last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poker-themed-roguelike-balatro-deals-out-1m-sales-in-first-month">selling 1m copies in its first month</a>, and things have only gone from strength to strength for solo developer LocalThunk. Along with scooping up numerous awards, most recently including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">BAFTA for best debut game</a>, Balatro has now made an appearance on TV.</p>

<p>Yes, Balatro is in the new Black Mirror series, in the third episode of its seventh season. This episode is called Hotel Reverie, and its synopsis reads thus: "A high-tech remake of a classic film sends its A-list star into another dimension, where she must stick to the script if she ever wants to make it home."</p>
<p>Balatro is a pastime of the A-list star's agent. When the two are on the phone together early on in the episode, the card game can be seen on the agent's laptop.</p>
<p>This moment was spotted and shared on social media, with LocalThunk quickly responding. "So uh Balatro is now canonically in Black Mirror," the developer wrote. The show's creator Charlie Brooker then replied with a saluting emoji.</p>
<p>I wonder where Balatro may show up next? Hollywood, perhaps. </p>

            <p>
The director of A Minecraft Movie has reacted to the chaotic scenes seen in some cinemas as viewers interrupt screenings to stand up, scream and empty buckets of popcorn over other people.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">A Minecraft Movie is a breakout success that's performed far beyond initial expectations</a>, seemingly fuelled by its viral nature among younger viewers. In particular, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">videos on social media have shown crowds reacting wildly to the film's now-notorious "Chicken Jockey" scene</a>.
</p>
<p>
But while the trend may be popular, it hasn't gone down well with all cinema goers. Viewers have been removed from showings for disruptive behaviour and <a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/mat-su/2025/04/08/wasilla-police-eject-rowdy-teens-from-minecraft-movie-showing/">police have been called</a> as the trend has continued - escalating now to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/people-are-taking-live-chickens-into-screenings-of-the-minecraft-movie-now-as-chicken-jockey-meme-gets-out-of-hand">disturbing incident where someone brought a live chicken into a screening</a>.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps unusurprisingly, A Minecraft Movie director Jared Hess doesn't sound too bothered about it all. 
</p>
<p>
"It's way too funny," Hess told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/movies/chicken-jockey-minecraft-movie.html">New York Times</a>. "It's been a total blast. I'm just laughing my brains out every time someone sends me a new video.
</p>
<p>
"Just the fact that people are making memories at the movies  - that's what it's all about," Hess continued. "That's why we do it. I never could have anticipated this level of passion and fun and craziness that's happening."
</p>
<p>
Is it okay to dump your popcorn over other people? Hess seems to think so. 
</p>
<p>
"No one's going to get hurt from popcorn," he concluded. "Look, when I go to the movies with my kids, it’s like a popcorn massacre that happens and they're not throwing anything, but it ends up on the ground, regardless."
</p>
<p>
Just spare a thought for the minimum wage employee who has to come along a clear it up.
</p>
<p>
As you'd expect, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">the success of A Minecraft Movie has already sparked talk of a sequel</a>.
</p>
<p>"Lovely performances elevate a movie that captures Minecraft's many bits and pieces but not its creative spirit," Christian Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">Eurogamer's A Minecraft Movie review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
