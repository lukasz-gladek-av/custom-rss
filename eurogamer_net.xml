            <p>One of Japan's biggest retailers began offering a PS5 rental service last week, but it's already fully booked thanks in large part to the popularity of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>
<p>GEO began offering the service on 28th February, neatly timed with the release of Capcom's latest monster hunting game. It's surprisingly cheap too, with a week's rental at around a fiver and two weeks for under a tenner.</p>
<p>However, the availability is completely blocked out until mid-April across all regions, as <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japans-new-ps5-rental-is-massively-popular-with-service-fully-booked-across-all-regions/">Automaton</a> reported. No appointments beyond this date are open for booking.</p>

<p>Japanese players are notorious for maintaining the quality of their gaming tech, but I'm not convinced a similar service would work here in the UK. Too many sticky controllers.</p>
<p>GEO hasn't stated how many consoles are available for rental, but the service is being provided across its 400 stores nationwide - the fact it's booked up proves the service (and Monster Hunter Wilds) are extremely popular.</p>
<p>In fact, it's yet another example of the impact Capcom's game is having over in Japan.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Eurogamer reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-delectable-cuisine-causes-cheese-naan-sales-to-surge">cheese naan sales are on the rise thanks to Monster Hunter Wilds' delectable food scenes</a>.</p>
<p>One Tokyo-based Nepalese restaurant thanked Monster Hunter directly for boosting its cheese naan sales.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">Monster Hunter Wilds reached the highest concurrent player numbers on Steam for the series</a>, quickly reaching over 1.3 million players just a couple of days after launch. That's over four times higher than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a>, which reached more than 300,000 concurrent players.</p>
<p>Not only that, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">Monster Hunter Wilds is Capcom's fastest-selling game ever</a>, reaching over 8m units sold in just three days across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>"The most exhilarating and refined Monster Hunter yet, even if its attempts to balance the old and new don't always quite coalesce in its ongoing quest to please all audiences," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Eurogamer Monster Hunter Wilds review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Minecraft developer Mojang has announced a new Minecraft Live event, to be held on 22nd March at 6pm UK time, and teased that it will contain "new game drops".
</p>
<p>
Does this mean new "drops" in existing Minecraft games, or the dropping of new Minecraft games entirely? The event's brief teaser video does not say.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, however, the teaser does note that "exclusive movie content" is also on the way, separate to the ambiguous dropping mentioned above.

Mojang's Minecraft Movie tie-in is likely the A Minecraft Movie Hero Pack which leaked online last week. It contains character skins for the upcoming film's main roster - including a beardy Jack Black as Steve, and Aquaman in a pink jacket.

At <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-live-digital-showcase-returns-later-this-month-with-news-about-our-games-and-more">the last Minecraft Live, in September 2024</a>, Mojang announced it was ditching its singular big summer update for multiple updates spread throughout the year. The next of these, presumably, will be revealed later this month.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/295k-minecraft-fans-criticise-lack-of-new-content-in-stop-the-mob-vote-petition">Minecraft Live has also now ditched its long-running mob vote</a>, after the process for voting on new creatures became too controversial, and some fans complained about their choices getting sidelined. Democracy!
</p>
<p>
In case you missed it, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecrafts-final-movie-trailer-is-more-of-the-same-but-at-least-jennifer-coolidge-is-in-it">Minecraft film's final trailer arrived last week and features Jennifer Coolidge being Jennifer Coolidge</a>, which is something to recommend about this movie at least. The film itself is out on 4th April.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflixs-witcher-casts-first-game-exclusive-character.1126701/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-witcher-casts-first-game-exclusive-character<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The fourth season of Netflix's Witcher adaptation is on its way, and we've now got word of a new character for the show. That's not <em>too </em>exciting in itself, but this particular addition to the show marks a notable change. You see, this is the Netflix series' first game-exclusive character to pop up on the small screen.</p>
<p>Since its conception, Netflix's Witcher team has refrained from adapting anything particularly game-specific, sticking instead with characters and beasties based on Andrzej Sapkowski's novels and short stories. Of course, there has been the occasional reference back to CDPR's own Sapkowski-based works, such as Henry Cavill's Geralt taking a nice, steamy bath (see header image above).</p>
<p>That's changing for the show's fourth season, however, with the reported addition of actor Jack Myers. According to Witcher fan site <a href="https://redanianintelligence.com/2025/03/01/netflixs-the-witcher-casts-its-first-character-from-the-games/">Redanian Intelligence</a>, Myers - who has starred in the likes of The Crown and Call the Midwife, as well as lending his vocal talents to games such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> and Dying Light 2 - has landed the role of Roderick de Wett, a character from the original Witcher game.</p>

<p>Now, if you haven't heard of Roderick de Wett, don't worry - he didn't exactly have a huge role in the first Witcher. He was a Nilfgaardian Count, and member of the religious knightly order known as The Order of the Flaming Rose (or sometimes just The Order).</p>
<p>Roderick isn't an especially nice chap, and Geralt isn't a fan of his. To give you an idea of his personality, here is what his <a href="https://www.playgwent.com/en/decks/61e8445b4b99d146d6c747b9631a83ce">Gwent card reads</a>:</p>
<p>"Count de Wett is exceptionally loathsome and arrogant, but at least he enjoys a little dice poker on the side."</p>
<p>While Roderick only - thus far - appears in CDPR's video game, there is a potential link to Sapkowski's written Witcher work. A Nilfgaardian noble by the name of Joachim de Wett pops up in books Time of Contempt, The Tower of the Swallow and The Lady of the Lake. Meanwhile, <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Joachim_de_Wett#Trivia">Joachim's skull can also be found in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>. Given the name and both characters' backgrounds, it seems likely they are related in some way.</p>

<p>Myers won't be the only new face on the scene when The Witcher season four makes its debut.

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witchers-liam-hemsworth-hadnt-watched-netflix-show-or-read-the-books-before-geralt-casting">Hunger Games star Liam Hemsworth is set to take on the mantle of The Witcher's white-haired monster hunter</a> for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-5-will-be-its-last">show's final two seasons</a>, following the departure of Henry Cavill.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Until Dawn remake studio Ballistic Moon has reportedly "effectively closed", amid claims only a handful of employees "at most" remain - none of them developers.
</p>
<p>
Ballistic Moon, which is based in the UK, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-remake-studio-ballistic-moon-lays-off-staff-ahead-of-the-games-release-in-october">confirmed a round of redundancies last year</a>, saying it had made the "tough decision to significantly scale down our team to secure the future of our studio." However, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-effectively-closed/">new report by Insider Gaming</a> claims the studio quietly made a second round of redundancies toward the end of last year.
</p>
<p>
According to the publication's sources, roughly 40 employees were let go in October, with remaining staff kept on to provide post-launch support for Ballistic's Until Dawn remake. However, it's claimed these developers - equating to around 20 employees - lost their jobs in December, leaving only the studio's founders and "possibly" a handful of employees "at most". Reportedly, Ballistic's entire PR, marketing, and development teams are now gone.

<p>
"People are sharing bugs they've found in the game to make the team aware," a source told the publication, "but there is no one working on patch support for the game anymore."
</p>
<p>
Insider Gaming claims the job losses follow unsuccessful attempts by Ballistic's founders to pitch new projects, secure funding, and keep things "moving forward". It's also said discussions were had with Sony to secure funding for additional Until Dawn updates, possibly even another game, but they never reached fruition. Eurogamer has reached out to Ballistic for comment.
</p>
<p>
Word of additional redundancies at Ballistic comes as job cuts and studio closures continue across the games industry. February alone saw the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and Warner Bros. Games San Diego shut their doors</a>, with layoffs also confirmed at Marvel Rivals' US development team, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/callisto-protocol-studio-confirms-layoffs-as-former-employee-claims-most-of-the-devs-affected">The Callisto Protocol developer Striking Distance</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surgeon-simulator-developer-suffers-more-layoffs-says-it-will-scale-back-operations">Surgeon Simulator studio Bossa Games</a>.
