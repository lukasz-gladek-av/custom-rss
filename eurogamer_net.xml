            <p>What were the chances Blizzard would find a way to monetise arguably the most exciting feature coming to World of Warcraft in years? High, it turns out. Blizzard will introduce a premium currency to the game, specifically for housing, called Hearthsteel.</p>
<p><a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24242736/developer-insight-hearthsteel-virtual-currency-and-housing-in-midnight">Blizzard announced the Hearthsteel currency in a blog on Friday evening</a>, explaining that you will be able to use it to buy items and furniture when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcraft-is-getting-player-housing-in-december-ahead-of-midnight-expansion-launch">the housing system arrives in December</a>. Almost immediately, the post clarified that, "The VAST majority of Housing items are (and will continue to be) earnable in-game."</p>
<p>Think of it similar to how mounts are currently handled: there'll be a few available to buy with real money, but most of them will only be earnable in the game. And those race- and class-based housing options the game will have, such as undead-themed buildings for undead characters: they won't be available to buy.</p>
<p>But as much as the blog did to pre-empt and address topics for backlash, backlash did inevitably follow. As of the time of writing, the official blog has more than 500 comments and <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/developer-insight-hearthsteel-virtual-currency-and-housing-in-midnight/2196144">the official forum post has more than 2500</a>.</p><p>"Absolutely not," wrote Uddermassage in the game's forum. "You need to go back to the drawing board. This microtransaction crap can go jump in a lake." Rambush, meanwhile (I like these names), said, "I can't believe someone seriously typed this up and thought to themselves, 'Yeah, that's reasonable, they’ll go for that!'"</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The concern is understandable. This is the first actual premium currency World of Warcraft has had. You can already buy gold, and you can directly buy items such as mounts, but there's not a separate currency for this. The only separate currency the game has is Trader's Tender, for the Trading Post, which is entirely earned and used for a kind of battle pass-like system. This, then, is a notable change.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are deeper suspicions as to Blizzard's intentions here - or rather, the intentions of Blizzard's owner, Microsoft. Remember, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-push-for-high-xbox-profit-margins-behind-job-cuts-publishing-on-playstation-and-cancellation-of-projects-like-perfect-dark-claims-report">Microsoft is reportedly pushing its gaming division to operate with a 30 percent profit margin</a>, and there are few more reliable cash generators than the monthly subscription-fuelled World of Warcraft. Might Hearthsteel have been pushed through because of this? Perhaps the timing of the announcement is just bad.</p><p>Questions, questions; the answers will be provided when Blizzard unleashes housing in World of Warcraft in December. So far the feature looks fantastic, having spent years in development to develop ideas like neighbourhoods and groups of people living alongside each other. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-kind-of-a-sociological-experiment-for-blizzard-world-of-warcraft-neighbourhoods-azeroth-nimbys-and-curtain-twitching-drama-is-all-part-of-the-plan">"It's a kind of a sociological experiment," Blizzard told us recently.</a></p>

            <p>Yoshi's appearance along with a few other potential story spoilers for the upcoming Super Mario Bros Movie sequel - The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> Movie - have started trending on social media thanks to, of all places, Pillsbury. Yes, the American brand of baking products has seemingly leaked a few of things we will be seeing on the film's release.</p>

<p>While Yoshi's face is beaming away on the front of a box of pre-cut sugar cookies shaped like green spotted eggs, you can also see Nintendo's famed plumber Mario riding on his back on the other side of the packaging.</p>
<p>Along with Yoshi soaring through the air, this box of cookie shapes also features the Comet Observatory, which is the home of Rosalina and the Lumas. This one image all but confirms her appearance in the upcoming film (though, given it is called The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, this isn't exactly a surprise).</p><p>Another little image worth drawing attention to on this cookie box, meanwhile, is the graffiti tag in the upper left corner of the maze puzzle on the back of the package. Correct me if I am wrong, but that sure looks like Bowser Jr. to me.</p>
<p>You can check out images of Yoshi, Mario, Bowser Jr.'s  graffiti and the Comet Observatory below. At the time of writing, the cookies are still listed online via <a href="https://shop.topsmarkets.com/store/tops-markets/products/83425108-pillsbury-ready-to-bake-yoshi-egg-sugar-cookie-dough-9-1-oz">TopsMarkets</a>, but are currently out of stock. </p>

<p>Despite what I first thought when I saw these images last night, this isn't actually our first look at Yoshi in The Super Mario Galaxy Movie. After a spot of internet searching this morning, I also came across posts with images of Old Spice underarm and body spray, with Nintendo's green dinosaur-like creature smiling back. These images were first shared last month, but it seems no one thought they were real (until now).</p><p>While Yoshi features on a spray called Brooklyn Bounce, which is described as having a "smashed fruit" scent, Luigi also pops up on a can of Desert Detour along with a Tostarenan from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>'s Sand Kingdom. Desert Detour apparently smells like "vanilla sounds" (not sure how that works).</p>

<p>Last week, it was reported we will be getting a trailer for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie later this month, as it is allegedly attached to the upcoming release, Wicked: For Good.</p>
<p>Many have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-apparently-a-very-good-mario-themed-reason-you-should-go-and-see-wicked-for-good-this-november">now shared their hopes that Rosalina will be voiced by Ariana Grande</a>, who plays Glinda the Good in the Wicked film adaptations.</p>

            <p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> continues to grow increasingly popular this Winter, the demands for duo queue are only getting louder as pairs of players are getting a little tired of getting wiped out by teams of three.</p>
<p>As of writing, players have two supported options. You can queue up as a solo player and opt not to fill up your squad with strangers, which will match you with other solo players. Alternatively you can queue up as a team of three which will obviously slap you into games with full squads of three.</p>
<p>However, if you queue up as a party for two and opt not to fill your empty spot with a third player, you'll still be queued up against teams of three rather than other duos. This means those without a third wheel are forced to play in matches at an unavoidable disadvantage.</p>

<p>"EMBARK please make duos mode, that's in my opinion [the] only thing this game is currently missing," wrote user MediumDefinition2480 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oqta8j/embark_we_are_in_desparate_need_of_duos_mode/">on the Arc Raiders Reddit</a>. "I am really tired of playing against trios while I want to play with my friend." That post is sitting on just under 10,000 upvotes at the time of writing, and is just one of a variety of similar posts begging for official duo support.</p><p>The reason why this may <em>not</em> have official support is down to fears of splitting the player base, and not wanting to split the online lobbies into three separate groups of players: solo, duos, and full squads. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-breaks-another-concurrent-record-as-player-count-soars">While Arc Raiders is incredibly popular right now</a>, as time goes on, having a three-way-split could in theory lead to extended queue times.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has received a selection of new map conditions that are mixing up the typical experience significantly for players. As part of these new conditions, an underground bunker on Spaceport has been introduced, with a mysterious puzzle that still appears unsolved.</p>
<p>First introduced over the weekend the three major map condition additions are night raids for Blue Gate, Electromagnetic Storms (across Dam Battleground, Spaceport, and Blue Gate), plus the Hidden Bunker on Spaceport. You can also now see the Harvester event on the Blue Gate map, which previously was locked to Dam Battlegrounds.</p>
<p>Now, all of these are cool, but the Hidden Bunker is the particularly intriguing one. This event requires several antennas to be turned on across the map by players, which in turn opens doors in the South West portion of the map.</p>

<p>There's good loot in this bunker, sure. However, more intriguingly are data upload terminals and other odd objects that have a portion of the community certain that there's more to find in the Hidden Bunker. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/hidden_bunker_mega_thread/">A Reddit Megathread on the Arc Raiders Hidden Bunker</a> started picking apart the bunker, pointing out strange machines and wiring spread across the bunker with seemingly no purpose.</p><p>As for the data terminals, people also believed that there was more to this part of the bunker. However, it's worth noting that as of this morning there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-trials-are-the-perfect-way-to-do-ranked-in-extraction-shooters#:~:text=Rather%20than%20some%20kill%2Dfocused,world%2C%20or%20even%20gathering%20plants!">a weekly trial</a> for data uploads, so it's entirely possible that all they're for is a nice bump in XP when used and weekly challenges.</p>
<p>Whether or not players will uncover more secrets in the Hidden Bunker is something to keep an eye on. Meanwhile,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-breaks-another-concurrent-record-as-player-count-soars"> Arc Raiders broke yet another concurrent player record last weekend</a>, showing continuing growth post-release and remaining at the top of Steam's top playing charts.</p>
