            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> has just turned two, which doesn't make any sense because there is no way that I am two years older than I was when it first came out, so I think Larian is lying.</p>
<p>But even so, the studio has released a few surprising stats about its critically acclaimed party-based RPG to mark the occasion.</p>

<p>So, it turns out that 2.07 percent of Baldur's Gate 3 players managed to defeat twenty opponents while drunk. Fair to say this will be in-game intoxication, because I am sure there have been plenty of wines and beers consumed while playing, and far more than 2.07 percent of us will have been a little tipsy while negotiating the world with Shadowheart and co (don't lie, it is not just me who does that).</p>
<p>Additionally, 3.87 percent of players managed to defeat Gortash in Wyrm's Rock without activating any traps. The developer noted those on Steam are a bit more canny with their footwork than those of us playing on Xbox or PlayStation, with 4.37 percent of players on Valve's platform successfully avoiding triggering traps (I am not one of them).</p>

<p>Also, 1.1 million players have completed Baldur's Gate 3 in Tactician Mode, one of the game's highest difficulty settings. Following that, almost half a million players "thought it would be fun" to complete Baldur's Gate 3 in Honour Mode, which builds on Tactician Mode by adding things like tougher bosses, stricter rules and a single save slot.</p>
<p>Of those half a mil, 4,647 players managed to beat Honour Mode with a Level 1 character. Meanwhile, 31,180 players beat Honour Mode as a Jack of All Trades.</p>

<p>Now, I play as a Barbarian in my own real world D&amp;D campaign, so I like this next stat because it speaks to my character (she's called Quinn). Larian has revealed 8.21 percent of players thought to use an enemy as an improvised weapon against another. These are my people!</p>
<p>350 players also respecced Minsc into a Death Domain Cleric, to which Larian asked: "Are you folks doing okay?"</p>
<p>Now, this stat is quite heartwarming. Apparently 598 players adopted a child with Wyll, which is cute.</p>

<p>Larian has also celebrated 265m mod downloads since it released Patch 7 (which<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-next-week-on-pc-bringing-modding-support-and-more-evil-endings"> introduced mod-support to the fantasy role playing game</a>). Of those, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-gives-baldurs-gate-3s-withers-a-pair-of-big-naturals-to-celebrate-100m-mod-downloads">over 250,000 of all downloads are Withers Big Naturals</a>, a mod which, yes, gives Withers breasts.</p>

<p>"Crazy to think it's only been two years. It's truly been life changing," <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1952106606864253253">studio founder Swen Vincke wrote on social media yesterday</a>, celebrating Baldur's Gate 3's anniversary. "Probably worth writing about one day. But I can spoil the biggest takeaway. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">BG3 was what allowed us to do our next crazy thing</a>. </p>
<p>"How that will pan out is anyone's guess but I can assure you we're working hard to ensure you'll have plenty of fun. Like really - loads of it. In a surprising way. And I can't wait to show you. But you'll need to be patient / we'll need a bit of time to make it all work. It'll be worth it though."</p>
<p>As for what that next "crazy" thing is? Well, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-wants-baldurs-gate-4-but-isnt-in-a-hurry">all we really know for now is it isn't Baldur's Gate 4</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-celebrates-second-anniversary-with-obscure-stats-and-the-revelation-over-250k-of-us-opted-to-see-withers-big-naturals]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Workers at Raven Software, the Activision subsidiary known for its contribution to the Call of Duty series, have ratified their first union contract with Microsoft, three years after unionisation efforts began.</p>
<p>Unionisation efforts within Raven Software started in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/qa-testers-at-activision-blizzards-raven-software-announce-intent-to-unionise">January 2022</a>, following strike action protesting the firing of 12 members of the developer's QA team. Eventually, in May of that year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/qa-testers-at-activision-blizzard-studio-raven-software-successfully-vote-to-unionise">the vote to unionise was won</a>, despite Activision Blizzard's anti-unionisation manoeuvres, which included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-sent-anti-union-emails-ahead-of-pivotal-raven-software-vote">sending emails asking recipients to "please vote no"</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the Communications Workers of America (CWA) has announced workers at Raven Software have "unanimously voted" to <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/raven-software-workers-secure-first-contract-microsoft">ratify their first union contract between Game Workers Alliance-CWA (GWA-CWA) members and Xbox maker Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p>The contract guarantees a 10 percent wage increase over two years, with "additional raises through merit and promotions, after going 18 months without wage increases and 45 months without promotions".</p>
<p>In addition, the contract promises an "elimination" of crunch time. Seven days notice is now required for any mandatory overtime, and there is to be no "excessive overtime on back-to-back weeks" and "no mandatory overtime of any duration for the majority of weeks in a quarter".</p>
<p>Job descriptions will also become defined with this contract in place, while the promotions process will be made more clear.</p>
<p>"After more than three years of organising and bargaining, seeing it finally pay off feels incredible," Erin Hall, QA tester at Raven Software and member of the bargaining committee, said today. "From day one, we made it a priority to include every voice in the room, and the contract we came out with reflects what we need - better pay, real career paths, and protection from burnout. It's a contract that actually values the work QA does. I'm proud of what we accomplished, and I hope it shows other game workers that organising works - and it's worth it."</p>
<p>"Going from organising to sitting across the table from one of the largest tech corporations in the world was a huge learning curve, but we never lost sight of why we were there," added Autumn Prazuch, another QA tester at Raven Software and bargaining committee member. "We fought hard for raises and job structures that will finally make QA a sustainable career path, and we were able to negotiate limitations on mandatory crunch. Ratifying this contract is a win for game workers everywhere who are ready to take the first step toward a better future."</p>
<p>CWA District 4 Vice President Linda L. Hinton called the contract between CWA members and Microsoft "proof that when video game workers organise, they can win lasting changes in the workplace".</p>
<p>Said Hinton: "By reaching an agreement with Microsoft that puts limits on excessive sustained overtime, also known as crunch, these members are tackling one of the most exploitative practices in the industry and setting new standards for quality assurance testers and video game workers overall.</p>
<p>"We are pleased to welcome these members into the CWA District 4 family."</p>
<p>Today's news comes just a couple of months after workers at ZeniMax Media voted to ratify their first union contract with parent company Microsoft. In May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cwa-negotiates-new-contract-for-zenimax-including-substantial-wage-increases-and-a-credits-policy-for-qa-staff">the two parties reached a tentative agreement</a>, following almost two years of negotiations.</p>
<p>As for Raven Software, it is currently working on the next Call of Duty entry - Black Ops 7 - with Treyarch. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-promises-to-be-most-mind-bending-black-ops-ever">developers have promised this will be the "most mind-bending" Black Ops release yet</a>. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/raven-software-workers-celebrate-win-following-three-year-battle-for-microsoft-union-contract]]></content:encoded>
