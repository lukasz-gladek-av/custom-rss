            <p>Nintendo has essentially confirmed in all but name that Rainbow Road will indeed be part of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> on the game's release this summer.</p>
<p>However, while Rainbow Road is a part of the upcoming Mario Kart title, it isn't going to be available to zip around from the off. Rather, players will need to "conquer" all Grand Prix cups. Then, so says Nintendo, "rumour has it a certain colourful course will appear".</p>
<p>So, yep, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-leak-confirms-iconic-tracks-return">that'll be Rainbow Road</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-mario-kart-world-direct-live-watch-here">Nintendo's Mario Kart World Direct this afternoon</a> showing a colourful beam leading up to the sky above.</p>

</figure>
<p>Other courses confirmed for Mario Kart World include the all new icy Starview Peak and the spoooooky Boo Cinema, as well as returning series entries like Toad's Factory, Peach Beach and Wario's Galleon.</p>
<p>On the characters side of things, we will of course be able to play as Mario - this is his series after all - as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-moo-moo-meadows-cow-is-the-true-star-of-nintendos-switch-2-direct">new racers like Cow</a>, Spike and Goomba (Ed and I want to know how he drives without arms. And, while we are on it, I still have questions about King Boo's driving abilities).</p>
<p>These drivers will be able to use new items, such as Kamek. Yes, Kamek is an item, and his magic will "transform" your racing rivals into, at least as far as today's Direct has shown us, Chargin' Chucks - those large burly Koopas in football gear. "What other mysterious effects will happen," Nintendo teased in today's showcase. I don't know Nintendo, I don't know!</p>
<p>Next up, we have Mario Kart World's support features, handy for those new to the series or for those who, like my god children, are too small to actually be able to control what's going on but still want to be part of the fun.</p>
<p>These features include Smart Steering (often needed when small humans are involved), Auto-Accelerate and Auto-Use Item. There are also Tilt Controls, which are compatible with the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s Joy-Con wheel.</p>

<p>Mario Kart World will also have new tricks. There's Charge Jump, which can be used while holding the drift button while driving straight ahead. These jumps can enable racers to jump over obstacles such as an oncoming vehicle, "grind along powerlines", and move out of the way of an oncoming rival attack such as a green shell. This jump will also allow the jumper to wall ride for a bit should they jump towards a wall (obviously).</p>
<p>Another new trick arriving with Mario Kart World is Rewind, which does exactly as it says on the tin. Racers can rewind the action, but - and this is important - only for them. Other racers will still be charging ahead as normal.</p>

<p>Our Tom has already taken the upcoming game for a whirl, calling Mario Kart World "undoubtedly Switch 2's killer app" and one he can't wait to play more of.</p>
<p>"Mario Kart World's reinvention of the series may be a gamble, but it's absolutely one I think will pay off. With a web of possible routes and hours of time likely to be spent exploring every corner of its highways, deserts and mountains - or racing to stay ahead of the competition in Knockout Tour - it's just as well the game's a Switch 2 launch title," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">Eurogamer's Mario Kart World preview</a>.</p>

            <p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> Editions of both Zelda games won't support cloud saves for data backup, and it's currently unclear why.</p>
<p>On the store pages for both <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Breath-of-the-Wild-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787250.html">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Tears-of-the-Kingdom-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787249.html">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> on Switch 2, a disclaimer reads: "Please note: this software does not support the Nintendo Switch Online paid membership's Save Data Cloud backup feature."</p>
<p>This same disclaimer is not present for other Switch 2 Edition games - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>, or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> - so it's unclear why this is only impacting Zelda games.</p>

<p>What's more, this disclaimer is only on the US and EU store pages. The <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000096248">Japanese page</a> still states the Nintendo Switch Online paid membership is required for the use of the save data storage service (machine translation).</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Nintendo for clarification.</p>
<p>Why does this matter? As a user on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-nintendo-switch-2-editions-of-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-do-not-support-cloud-saves.1166340/">ResetEra</a> noted, players can import their save file from the original Switch to continue using the Switch 2 Edition of the game, but then won't be able to create a new cloud save file as they continue.</p>
<p>What's more, it seems even if players start a fresh save using the Switch 2 Edition, they still won't be able to backup their save file.</p>
<p>But why exactly would this only be the case for Zelda and not other games? For now, the reason is unknown.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 Editions of original Switch games do bring plenty of upgrades. The Zelda games, for instance, have improved visual performance as well as an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/achievements-can-be-earned-in-switch-2-editions-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom">updated app with achievements</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-zelda-ports-let-players-repair-equipment-using-accompanying-app">new method to repair equipment</a>.</p>
<p>In the UK, these <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-edition-ports-of-og-switch-games-cost-65-in-uk">complete updated editions for the new console will cost £65</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-edition-games-will-be-complete-on-the-card-without-a-download-nintendo-confirms">all data included on the game card</a> - something Nintendo clarified following confusion.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-clarifies-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-switch-2-edition-doesnt-include-its-paid-dlc">Breath of the Wild won't include the original game's DLC on Switch 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bethesda is yet to officially announce its highly-anticipated The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake, but we all know it's real. Along with those  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">screenshots on developer Virtuos' website</a>, references to the project have also been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-references-now-found-on-bethesdas-website">spotted on Bethesda's own website</a>. It is safe to say with this remake it's just a case of when, not if.</p>
<p>So, where does that leave the team working Skyblivion, the volunteer-based project by TESRenewal seeking to remake Oblivion in the Skyrim engine? Has news of an official remake caused the bounce to go from their collective bungee? (To paraphrase Wallace and Gromit, there.)</p>

<figcaption>Our Jim has thoughts on the Oblivion remake, or rather, the lack of a Morrowind remake. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH0bzE6hGhE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Well, no, this is not the case at all. <a href="https://x.com/rebelzize/status/1912175393148199140">Writing on social media</a>, project lead Rebelzize said Bethesda's impending announcement "changes nothing" as far as the team working on Skyblivion are concerned.</p>
<p>Rebelzize said the "real remake is the friends we made along the way", before stating the Skyblivion mod was and remains "a passion project".</p>
<p>In fact, Rebelzize sees it as a "win-win" for the Oblivion community which will get "twice the amount of Oblivion this year".</p>

<p>"All love and no hate towards the people who made the official remaster," Rebelzize wrote.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Rebelzize/status/1912505305163792886">subsequent post</a>, Rebelzize added: "Since this got a lot more attention [than] I expected, let me just say I hope you will enjoy either the official or our remake. Either way thanks for the support and be kind to one another."</p>
<p>Team Folon - the group behind the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-closes-in-on-1m-downloads-as-team-folon-gears-up-for-next-fix">ambitious Fallout London mod for Fallout 4</a> - shared Rebelzize's post, writing: "We stand by you. All our love Skyblivion team."</p>

<p>As mentioned, Skyblivion is a voluntary project that fans of The Elder Scrolls games have been working on quite some time. The Skyblivion team has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-a-video-of-skyblivion-which-is-oblivion-in-skyrim">steadily documenting its progress for over a decade now</a>, and I think I just felt myself age as rapidly as that chap in The Last Crusade.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a <a href="https://skyblivion.com/">Skyblivion blog post</a> shared a roadmap for the mod's release, affirming it will "close shut the jaws of Oblivion in 2025".</p>

<p>Earlier this month our Jim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">called upon Bethesda to remake Morrowind rather than Oblivion</a>. "You cowards," Jim wrote, calling Morrowind a "special game, where a beautifully unique fantasy setting is locked away behind technology and interface design that has aged particularly badly".</p>
<p>Think he's on to something?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
