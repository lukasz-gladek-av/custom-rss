            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> reached nearly one million concurrent players on PC last month, as the extraction shooter continues to grip players heading into 2026. That doesn't even take into account console players!</p>
<p>This information comes from <a href="https://pdf.irpocket.com/C3659/YpwX/MxJ9/q7uK.pdf">the latest Nexon investor presentation / report</a>, which broke down the performance of the publisher and its numerous games. When covering Arc Raiders, president and CEO Junghun Lee and CFO Shiro Uemura revealed the extent of its success since launching late last year.</p>
<p>For one, the game has sold 14 million copies to date, bringing in 27.7 billion South Korean Won (~ 18,799,543m USD). The presentation also revealed Arc Raiders has brought in approximately six million weekly active users to date.</p>

            <p>There was a conspicuous absence during the Diablo anniversary 'spotlight' broadcast yesterday: no mention of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> release for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> or for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-ii">Diablo 2</a>: Resurrected.</p>
<p>This was something I had intended to find out about when I visited Blizzard headquarters a couple of weeks ago, while exploring these 'spotlight' announcements under embargo. But when I raised the question of a Switch 2 release in a group Diablo 2: Resurrected interview, it was commandeered by a Blizzard PR who explained to me the company had nothing to say on the matter - either about a Switch 2 version of Diablo 2: Resurrected or Diablo 4.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Diablo 2: Resurrected is available for Switch 1, but people are eager for a Switch 2 version to make use of the newer hardware's greater power.</p>

<p>Why the silence? I would be amazed if Blizzard was <em>not </em>doing Switch 2 versions of either game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hands-on-with-diablo-3-on-nintendo-switch">Blizzard had great success bringing Diablo 3 to the original Switch</a> hardware, after all, so a precedent is already there. And I don't see that Diablo 4, a three-year-old game, does anything too demanding for Switch 2 to cope with. The exception is the always-online nature of the game, whereby you log-in to Blizzard's Battle.net servers to play. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-proper-switch-2-version-coming">Blizzard is bringing Overwatch to Switch 2 this year</a>, which works in the same way.</p>
<p>As for Diablo 2: Resurrected, an upgraded Switch 2 version simply makes sense, especially in light of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-announces-diablo-warlocks">Blizzard's recent warlock class release</a> and apparent ongoing active development of the game.</p>
<p>But there's a bigger reason why I think Switch 2 versions of Diablo are an inevitability, and it has to do with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-hearthstone-isnt-on-console-switch-or-steam-deck-but-increasingly-likely-to-happen">what Hearthstone's executive producer Nathan Lyons-Smith said</a> during a different interview on the same Blizzard trip. While talking about a possible Switch 2 or Steam Deck release, he said, "In the future as we explore console and handheld, we'd probably go as wide as we could. Certainly we have a different owner now than we did three years ago and they're more invested in Xbox and 'anything's an Xbox'. Their high-level goal [being] games playable anywhere."</p>

<p>That's a point worth underlining: it's been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">three years now since Xbox owner Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard for a colossal sum of money</a>, which is more than enough time to impress itself and its values upon Blizzard. And Microsoft's big current gaming push is, as Lyons-Smith mentioned, having Xbox everywhere, be it on PlayStation 5, PC, or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rog-xbox-ally-x-review">the Asus Rog Ally X handheld it collaborated on</a> recently. The Play Anywhere pitch is that you buy an Xbox game once and can play it on any device Xbox exists on. Surely that expands to Switch 2, too?</p>
<p>By the way, Diablo 2: Resurrected was added to Steam and Game Pass yesterday as part of the big 30th anniversary announcement, which feels like a related footnoted under this same idea.</p>
<p>I think it's only a matter of time before we see Diablo 4 and Diablo 2: Resurrected on Switch 2; perhaps even the Blizzard silence could be interpreted as a hint such things are in development. But if not now then when could such an announcement happen? Well, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-3-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch">the Diablo 3 Switch 1 announcement happened around Gamescom 2018</a>, an event Blizzard tends to favour, which takes place in August. But I think it's more likely Blizzard is keeping its powder dry for its own show, BlizzCon, in September. Time, I suppose, will tell.</p>

            <p>Blizzard bringing a new playable character to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-ii">Diablo 2</a>: Resurrected - the first new character the game has had in 25 years - could be the start of an era of active development for the classic game, potentially seeing it evolve like a modern game does.</p>
<p>To recap quickly: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-announces-diablo-warlocks">Blizzard shadow-dropped the warlock for Diablo 2 last night</a> as part of a paid expansion release and a wider 30th anniversary celebration for the Diablo franchise. Not only was this unexpected but it's a 'testing the waters' moment; should the warlock go down well, Blizzard will take it as a green light to explore more of this kind of thing going forward.</p>
<p>"We are excited for the opportunity we have right now to see what the community says about what we're making," said Timothy Vasconcellos, lead designer on the Diablo Legacy team, during a Diablo 2 interview at Blizzard headquarters a couple of weeks ago, which I was a part of. "And if we're trusted with that legacy and if it's a positive reception and they say: no you guys actually did do this very intricate dance preserving the 1999 game, then maybe we can think about how we pursue those opportunities in the future. But we have to nail that otherwise we kill the game in trying to progress it forward."</p>

<p>"We still have millions of people who play Diablo 2 - millions of them," lead producer Matthew Cederquist added, with a heavy emphasis on the "millions". "We saw the 30th anniversary of the franchise itself as a really great opportunity to surprise and delight. I don't think anyone expects a new class and all these features in Diablo 2, and I think that's going to be a moment that's like, 'I'm sorry, what did you say? You did what?' People won't believe it until we put it in their faces. And I sure hope it's as epic to the players as we find it. But is it a declaration of something new [going forwards]? We're going to have to see what the players say."</p>
<blockquote><em>"We don't want to mess up the Mona Lisa. We're not going to give her some sunglasses and a new hairdo"</em></blockquote>
<p>Understandably, bringing a new class to a treasured game like Diablo 2 was a nervy moment for the team. To my eyes, which aren't particularly accustomed to Diablo 2, the warlock feels at home in the game (I had a chance to play it for half-an-hour or so). Blizzard said a lot of effort went into making the class feel like it was designed in the year 1999, which I think it does. The team at Blizzard, more than anyone, perhaps, is aware of what's at stake if it messes around with the recipe too much.</p>
<p>"We don't want to mess up the Mona Lisa," Cederquist said. "We're not going to give her some sunglasses and a new hairdo. But at the same time, does it feel weird [adding a new class]? No. Do we have to honour that legacy of what was created? Yes."</p>

<p>Incidentally, the versions of the warlock differ in the Diablo games it's coming to - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, Diablo 2, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-immortal">Diablo Immortal</a>. Broadly, there's a lore-based thread running through them, with all three telling a connected story of the warlock appearing in the world of Sanctuary. This starts in D2 and runs through Diablo Immortal and then Diablo 4. Diablo 2's warlock take also pulls on the game's more hardcore appeal, especially in the demon taming skill tree, which is unique to D2, whereby you can tame demons and have them fight with you as pets or consume them for bursts of power. It's fiddly but incredibly satisfying to do.</p><p>Should the community like the warlock, then, and want more, it will lead to a broader exploration of what Blizzard can do with Diablo 2. This might involve meaningful reworks of classes already in the game, for example, although were this to be the case, Blizzard wouldn't spring it on you like it did the warlock. "Let's say if we wanted to change Barbarian for some reason: I wouldn't want to surprise people with that," Cederquist said. "That is working with the community hand in hand, to listen to their feedback about the changes that we would make if we wanted to."</p>
<p>There's a bigger concern with this, though, and it's what happens to the preserved and restored Diablo 2 experience that millions of people clearly still enjoy? It's not a classic experience any more if it's changed. To this end, we've reached a divergence point. There are now, effectively, two versions of Diablo 2: Resurrected. There's a progressive version represented by Reign of the Warlock, which is the paid expansion the warlock is a part of, and there's the classic version known as Diablo 2: Resurrected.</p>
<p>"It's the reason why we separated out Reign of the Warlock and whatever future stuff we have, so that we do have the opportunity to change with feedback, but also preserve what people love in Resurrected, and all that data set is totally split," Cederquist explained. "Resurrected is going to time-stamp. If you don't want to play a warlock for whatever reason and you hate loot filters, you can still have Resurrected and it's going to stay there. If we make any future changes to any classes or whatever, it's going to happen in that Reign of Warlock space."</p>
<p>It's a big week for Diablo 2, not only with the addition of a new class, but also because it was released on Steam yesterday and on Game Pass (the Reign of the Warlock expansion is not included on Game Pass). There are already "millions" of people playing the game, as Cederquist said, and these releases potentially widen the game to millions more.</p>

            <p>Jason Momoa will star in the live-action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> film adaptation from Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions.</p>
<p>As shared by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/jason-momoa-helldivers-release-date-1236715868/">Deadline</a>, Momoa - who is no stranger to video game adaptations, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-trailer-gives-first-look-at-block-stars-jason-momoa-and-jack-black-in-action">with Minecraft</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecrafts-jason-momoa-and-wrestler-roman-reigns-tapped-for-street-fighter-roles">Street Fighter already to his name</a> (there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/aquaman-jason-momoa-set-to-star-in-just-cause-movie">even some Just Cause talk several years ago</a>) - will join Fast and Furious director Justin Lin on the film, which is based on Arrowhead's delightfully chaotic space-based shooter.</p>
<p>While further specifics on who Momoa will play in Helldivers remain unknown, it was confirmed the film will release next year, on 10th November.</p>
<p>The Helldivers film was initially announced back in January 2025, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">along with a Horizon Zero Dawn adaptation</a>. Soon after, Arrowhead's Johan Pilestedt confirmed the developer will be involved with the upcoming film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-will-be-involved-in-film-adaptation-but-not-as-much-as-you-may-have-hoped">but in a somewhat limited capacity</a>.</p>
<p>Lin's involvement was then confirmed in December. Some were disappointed to learn that Lin is not a gamer himself, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-announced-helldivers-movie-director-may-not-be-a-gamer-but-he-has-worked-on-multiple-fast-furious-films">the director actually used this to his advantage when pitching his take for the film</a>. Arrowhead went on to show its support of Lin, stating it trusts the Helldivers film director, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-trust-justin-arrowhead-ceo-responds-to-helldivers-2-community-asking-for-film-director-to-play-the-game">shutting down any comments suggesting the director should at least try the game before taking on the adaptation</a>.</p>

<p>As for Momoa, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2026s-street-fighter-movie-gets-first-look-trailer-and-it-includes-a-great-reference-to-the-series-most-famous-bonus-stage">he is playing Blanka in Street Fighter</a>, which is set to release on 16th October.</p>
<p>In the meantime while we wait for Sony's Helldivers film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-largest-fan-film-premieres-today-and-even-arrowhead-is-waiting-to-watch">there is a fan made release available to watch now</a>. Created by volunteers at YouTube channel Plot Coalition, the film is almost an hour in length, making it longer than any other Helldivers fan project made to date.</p>
