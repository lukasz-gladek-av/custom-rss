            <p>Modded <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> guns and equipment are being sold on Ebay with tailored gun parts and effects. However, as of writing, it doesn't appear this grey market of modded loot is particularly profitable.</p>
<p>Ebay - a public e-commerce marketplace - is no stranger to gaming related side hustles, with numerous account, cosmetic, and service sellers setting up camp there over the years with the release of popular online video games. Eurogamer reached out to one Borderlands modded gun merchant to find out how it's going.</p>
<p>"It is fairly difficult to do as they have included a new encryption method to the guns this year that makes doing specific builds very very hard and will take, I would imagine, a long time to get perfected" states one Borderlands modded weapon reseller to Eurogamer under anonymity.</p>

<p>This new encryption method implemented by Gearbox not only makes the act of modding the exact weapon you want difficult, it's also making prospects of profit for resellers unlikely due to the cost of getting the decrypted values for weapons people will actually pay for. When asked how successful business is, the seller told Eurogamer:</p>
<p>"Not very successful. I've sold maybe three or four since release, which is around £15 to £20, which doesn't even cover the costs to build the guns, but I don't do this to make money or profit.</p>
<p>"To make the modded guns you often need to pay for tables that data miners have made that breakdown gun parts. Each part of the gun has an encrypted value, so does the rarity, manufacturer, level etc and the tables can be expensive to buy at around £50 to £100."</p><p>As such, at the moment, it appears that the grey market for selling modded Borderlands 4 loot is more for the hobbyists rather than those looking to make a buck from a hot new release (unless you're a data miner able to sell off valuable info, rather than the sought after weapons themselves).</p>
<p>Whether or not this will become a great problem as time goes on, and more of the game's loot encryption is broken down and made publicly available, remains a potential problem for the future. Although as a PvE game, the modded gear seller made an argument for why the practice of modding isn't doing any harm:</p>
<p>"Borderlands games have always been modded and I've modded them since Borderlands 1 and every game in between. It's a <em>huge</em> part of why I love the games so much."</p>

            <p>The president of Brazil Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (Lula) has signed a ban on loot boxes for under 18s into law. This ban is set to go into effect in March 2026.</p>
<p>This ban comes as part of <a href="https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2023-2026/2025/lei/L15211.htm">a wider digital protection law</a> aimed at protecting young people from abuse and exploitation online. Chapter seven of the law focused on electronic games prohibits loot boxes aimed at children or adolescents for games without an 18+ age rating.</p>
<p>In addition, the law requires games that are likely to have adolescents interact with other people through text, audio, or video messages to adhere to <a href="https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2023-2026/2024/Lei/L14852.htm#art16">legal safeguards.</a> These include a report system, information on the progress of said reports, and instruments to request review and reconsideration of imposed penalties.</p>

<p>Debates surrounding a loot box ban have been widespread and global for years now. Back in 2022 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dutch-political-parties-back-gaming-loot-box-ban">Dutch political parties backed a loot box ban</a>, however after some deliberation there was no outright ban. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43906306">Loot boxes were declared illegal in Belgium back in 2018</a>, though in the following years<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-study-claims-belgiums-loot-box-law-isnt-being-enforced"> it's become clear this hasn't been strictly enforced</a>. The UK has slapped <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-jagex-and-miniclip-broke-loot-box-advertising-rules">some game companies on the wrist due to not declaring loot boxes in advertisements</a>, but a ban has been far from reach.</p><p>As such, this Brazilian ban for under 18s is a big step forward for those against loot boxes, putting up barriers between what many consider gambling mechanics and younger people. It's been a long time coming, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/brazilian-authorities-to-investigate-loot-boxes">with investigations into loot boxes starting in 2021</a>. There remain two larger questions: will clear age ratings for games actually prevent young people from buying loot boxes in games they want, and will this law's implementation in a strong market for video games influence change in the industry at large?</p>
