<p>The GTA community is eager to hear more about the next instalment in the series, and once again have theorised Rockstar left a clue about the upcoming game in its GTA Online promotional material.</p>
<p>The material in question shows a character leaning on a car, while looking up at the Darnell Bros Garment Factory. But, it isn't the character or the factory that has caught the attention of eager fans. It is the moon that shines down on the scene from the upper corner.</p>

<p>The moon in this image is a waning gibbous, and the moon here in the real world will be at the same phase on 22nd November. That's a week on Friday, and fans believe this is a sign from the developer, telling them the date of the next GTA 6 trailer.</p><p>While this all may seem a bit of a longshot, this isn't the first time GTA players have turned to the moon for GTA 6 clues.

<p>So, stay tuned for more (potential) GTA 6 news next Friday, I guess!</p>

            <p>
Smash hit smartphone app Pokémon TCG Pocket will add its first big expansion of fresh cards in late January, according to a new leak. 
</p>
<p>
A datamine of the game's event schedule posted by <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1855422922384351518">Centro Leaks</a> suggests the game's currently-untitled first expansion will arrive on 29th January - with the caveats that final dates are still subject to change. 
</p>
<p>
That current plan would mean a roughly three-month window between the launch of Pokémon TCG Pocket and the arrival of a flurry of new cards - which feels about right?
</p>

<p>
That said, there's also suggestion of a special booster pack due for launch in December - which points to a smattering of extra cards arriving slightly sooner to tide fans over. 
</p>
<p>
Other upcoming additions to Pokémon TCG Pocket spotted in the datamine include a new card rarity, and rare picks being added to the Wonder Pick mechanic.

Pokémon TCG Pocket looks to be off to a great start, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-passes-30m-downloads-in-a-week">$12m earned over the game's first four days</a> and more than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-off-to-strong-start-reportedly-earns-12m-in-four-days">30m downloads after a week</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Pokémon TCG Pocket is heavily built around the opening of trading card game packs, though you can also play a simplified version of the classic trading card game via the app as well.

Nintendo will hold a special Direct broadcast later today - but, once again, it's not to announce <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Instead, the Super Nintendo World Direct will focus on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-expansion-for-super-nintendo-world-opens-in-spring-2024">upcoming addition of Donkey Kong Country</a> to Universal Studios Japan. 
</p>
<p>
Announcing the broadcast, which is scheduled for 10pm UK time tonight (that's 2pm Pacific or 5pm Eastern), Nintendo said the stream would last for roughly 10 minutes and that no information on upcoming games will be featured.

"Please note, there will be no game announcements or mentions of the Nintendo Switch successor during this presentation," Nintendo noted.
</p>
<p>
Super Nintendo World finally opened its doors at Universal Studios Japan in late 2020. A slightly smaller version, at Universal Studios Hollywood, opened in early 2023. 
</p>
<p>
Two other incarnations of Super Nintendo World are under construction and due to open in 2025. These will be located at Universal Studios Singapore and at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/universal-floridas-super-nintendo-world-park-gets-may-2025-opening-date">Universal Epic Universe in Florida, the latter of which will include Donkey Kong Country from the off</a>. 
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a> is set to add a new rollercoaster, Mine-Cart Madness, that is designed to make riders feel like their cart has jumped the track. Will we get to see Mario creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> riding it tonight?
</p>
<p>Earlier this year, we reported on <a href="https://orlandoparkstop.com/news/rumors/possible-zelda-ride-concept-to-replace-lost-continent-in-islands-of-adventure/">whispers that a Zelda area is being considered next</a>, after Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma was spotted in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-of-legend-of-zelda-producer-eiji-aonuma-at-universal-studios-pulled-offline">quickly-yanked official Universal video</a>.</p> <div>

While Nintendo fans wait for news on Switch 2, Nintendo itself has been busy releasing the last wave of major games for its current Switch hardware, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-the-nintendo-museum-a-joyful-celebration-of-machines-magic-and-the-art-of-play">opening a museum</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-music-app-sees-mario-maker-take-on-spotify-and-youtube-playlists">launching a smartphone music app</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-just-unveiled-an-alarm-clock-that-plays-mario-coin-noises-when-you-roll-over">announcing an alarm clock</a>.

Speaking to Eurogamer this month, a prominent video games industry analyst said it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-now-very-unlikely-before-2025-analyst-says">now "very unlikely" Nintendo still had plans to detail Switch 2 this year</a>.

            <p>Over 30 million people have pre-registered for Infinity Nikki.</p>
<p>Consequently, Infold Games confirmed all registration milestones have been unlocked, meaning players across PC, PS5, and mobile devices will secure a four-star outfit, 20 Resonite Crystals, 300 Threads of Purity, and 50,000 Blings.</p>

<p>To mark the achievement, Infold dropped a new gameplay overview trailer subtitled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54yRMWCF3hs">Unfold Your Whim</a>, "offering a glimpse into the journey ahead".</p>
<p>Infinity Nikki tasks players with collecting Whimstars and special outfits that give Nikki unique abilities.</p>
<p>"Each new ability allows Nikki to explore deeper, discover hidden paths, and interact with the vibrant open world around her," Infold teases. "Alongside her, Momo, her loyal companion, offers a camera feature for players to capture memorable moments throughout their adventure."</p>
<p>For some, this milestone may not be surprising. In August, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-dress-up-adventure-from-legend-of-zelda-dev-has-over-12-million-pre-registrations">over 12 million of us had already signed up</a> for the "cosy open-world adventure" follow-up to the highly successful mobile series of dress-up games.</p>
<p>We still don't have a release date for Infinity Nikki yet, however when the time does come, it will be available across PlayStation and PC, alongside Android and iOS devices. In the meantime, you can still <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/news/2">sign up for the Infinity Nikki playtest here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
