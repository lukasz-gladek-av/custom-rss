            <p>Xbox has roped in a famous film director for its latest brand trailer.</p>
<p>The trailer in question is titled "Wake Up" and is directed by none other than David Fincher, as in Seven and Fight Club's film director.</p>

<p>Xbox's trailer begins with a poor ol' rat by the name of Horatio waking up to start another day at his desk job with all the other overworked rats out there. Of course, he does manage to get some exercise in beforehand by running on a giant wheel, but even this healthy start isn't enough to distract from the mundanity of his job.</p>
<p>However, once Horatio finally makes it through "a day in the rat race" (oooh, I get it!), he boots up his Xbox to connect with his friends, and this "much-needed dose of fun transforms him into the human he always was", Xbox states. Ahhh.</p>
<p>Xbox isn't the only company to use gaming as an escape from the real, mundane world as a marketing beat. Who can forget <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-targets-unexpected-demographic-in-quietly-devastating-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-ad"> Nintendo's quietly devastating trailer for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> that showed a real life, 'everyday' man going about his business in a rather subdued manner.</p>
<p>You can check out the latest Xbox trailer for yourself below.</p>

<figcaption>In Xbox's Wake Up, directed by David Fincher and Romain Chassaing, a wonderfully off-beat fairy tale unfolds: Horatio, a rat, rekindles his humanity through the joy of gaming. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEv-s1dWGEQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>This trailer doesn't quite live up to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remembering-david-lynch-and-his-wonderfully-surreal-playstation-2-adverts">David Lynch's surreal PlayStation trailers of a time gone by</a> (and to be fair, what could), but all the same, I quite enjoyed it. What did you think?</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Xbox news, earlier this week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-announces-june-showcase-event-reveals-game-getting-this-years-big-spotlight">Microsoft locked in the date and time for its annual June announcement extravaganza</a> and revealed that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2 will be getting a dedicated deep dive directly after.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
