            <p>While we are all here frothing at the mouth in anticipation for more Grand Theft Auto 6 news, developer Rockstar is casually sharing a trailer for a Danny Dyer-fronted film instead.</p>
<p>The film in question is Marching Powder, which has been <a href="https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/movies/danny-dyer-marching-powder-film-interview-stephanie-leonidas-162145794.html">described as a "Bridget Jones with the C-word"</a>. In Marching Powder, Dyer stars as Jack, an ageing, drug-taking football hooligan.</p>
<p>"From our friends Nick Love and Danny Dyer, the absolute legends behind The Football Factory..." Rockstar wrote on social media, with an accompanying trailer. "[Marching Powder] - a proper naughty comedy out tomorrow in the UK and Ireland." The studio then shared a link for tickets.</p>

<p>Now, in fairness to Rockstar, this isn't a totally random trailer for the company to share.  <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> actually produced sports drama film The Football Factory, which was released in 2004, so the team does have a connection to Nick Love and Danny Dyer's films.</p>
<p>But, even so, this post has caught the attention of Rockstar's gaming community, who are crying out for another GTA 6 trailer, not a footy film trailer.</p>
<p>"Okay. Y'all are definitely trolling now," reads one reply. "Doing anything except giving us content for the biggest game of all time," another adds. One social media user quipped that Rockstar had "dropped the wrong trailer" with its latest post.</p>
<p>GTA 6 is set to release this autumn - a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">window publisher Take-Two Interactive remains confident of</a>. </p>
<p>
But, even though in the grand scheme of things we should be getting our hands on the next Grand Theft Auto game relatively soon, we still haven't actually seen or heard that much about it. In fact, we've only had one trailer, which was released over a year ago. Surely the developer is going to tell us something more soon... right?</p> <div>
