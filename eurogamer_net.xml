<p>
Published by Bandai Namco, Unknown 9: Awakening felt like an attempt to recapture the sci-fi adventure of Assassin's Creed, in a modern Tomb Raider-style globe-trotting story that featured secret societies vying over the remnants of an ancient civilisation. 
</p>
<p>First announced in 2020, the project drew interest due to its intriguing debut trailer featuring a younger version of protagonist Haroona (played in the final game by Anya Chalotra, AKA Yennefer in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s The Witcher). It was the first project from the Montreal-based Reflector, co-founded by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-unity">Assassin's Creed Unity</a> creative director Alexandre Amancio. </p><p>
The game was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unknown-9-awakening-is-an-ambitious-new-transmedia-bid">meant to act as a central point for the franchise as a cross-media brand</a>. Just this week, a second season of the Unknown 9: Out of Sight tie-in podcast was launched, while the fourth issue of its graphic novel series Unknown 9: Torment arrived. There's also a web series, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-juTgG_tIEeJ4DSnPrGAUMYAK9o-JW9H">Unknown 9: Passage</a>, which you can go watch on YouTube. 
</p>
<p>
"Unfortunately, I was affected by the layoffs at Reflector Entertainment, which means I'm currently looking for a job as a Narrative Designer or Game Writer. If you hear of any opportunities, please let me know," one staff member who lost their job wrote.

Eurogamer has contacted Bandai Namco for comment.
