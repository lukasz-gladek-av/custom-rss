            <p>While every site you've ever visited in 2025 seems intent on summarising your year even for things you absolutely don't need to be summarised (the cards I completed in <a href="https://asana.com/year-in-review/log-in">Asana</a> this year? Uh, no thanks), there's one wrapped message you probably won't be getting this year: Xbox.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-is-not-doing-an-xbox-wrapped-this-year-but-does-have-big-plans-for-the-25th-anniversary">WindowsCentral's</a> Jez Corden, who recently suggested that the Xbox summary isn't just late this year, but may not be coming at all.</p>

<p>"Some of you have been asking me if Xbox would be doing its own Year in Review' style recap of your gaming habits for 2025," Corden wrote. "My sources suggest that Xbox is not doing a 'Wrapped' this year. And there's potentially a good reason."</p>
<p>As for what those good reasons are? Corden says next year will kick-off a "confluence of major anniversaries not just for Xbox, but some of its subsidiary properties too".</p>
<p>"Xbox is having its 25th anniversary, alongside Halo itself. Blizzard is also having its 35th anniversary, and Bethesda is having its 40th anniversary too," he stated. "Xbox was launched as a brand on November 15, 2001. Blizzard launched in February, 1991, and Bethesda launched in June, 1986.</p>
<p>"As such, a lot of the 'marketing budget' that would've typically been allocated to something like an Xbox Wrapped is being poured into efforts to celebrate these major milestones for Xbox, its brands, and some of its games."</p>
<p>Sony's 2025 Wrap-Up and Steam Replay 2025 are already live, by the way. If you've yet to see yours, head to the <a href="https://wrapup.playstation.com/en-gb">official website</a> for PlayStation, or pop over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/replay/76561198023003792/2025">Steam</a> to see what's been keeping you busy there this year.</p>
<p>It's been a tough year for Xbox, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">with thousands of layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">cancelled games</a>, including The Initiative's Perfect Dark, Rare's Everwild, and an unannounced ZeniMax MMO, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-us-console-unit-sales-just-reached-an-all-time-november-low">flagging hardware sales</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-expert-opinion">even its tentpole shooter, Call of Duty series, is struggling</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft's president of game content and studios, Matt Booty, however, reports, Xbox will be hosting one of its Dev Direct streams in January, claiming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/well-have-more-stuff-next-year-after-being-somewhat-absent-from-the-game-awards-xbox-boss-teases-a-dev-direct-for-january-2026">"we've got more stuff coming up than we can fit in one show"</a>. That means we can probably expect updates on the upcoming Fable game and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> series, and perhaps a couple of updates from other games that come under the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> umbrella.</p>
