            <p>
Microsoft has locked in the date and time for its annual June announcement extravaganza, the Xbox Games Showcase, and revealed that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2 will be getting a dedicated deep dive directly after. 
</p>
<p>
The Xbox Games Showcase 2025 will air on Sunday, 8th June at 6pm UK time - that's 1pm Eastern or 10am Pacific if you live over the pond. 
</p>
<p>
As soon as that finishes, Microsoft will roll straight into The Outer Worlds 2 Direct, a longer look at Obsidian's upcoming sci-fi role-playing game sequel. In previous years, this slot has been saved for looks at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> (in 2023) and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> (in 2024).
</p>
<p>While certainly an important game in Microsoft's line-up, The Outer Worlds 2 does not quite feel like it has the same oomph as those games. Perhaps this was a slot previously pencilled in for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-fable-reboot-delayed-into-next-year">Fable, before its delay to 2026</a>?</p>
<p>
Microsoft is the first of the big three console makers to detail its event plans for June, during the week previously taken up by E3. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-dates-confirmed">Summer Game Fest</a>, the online livestream fronted by The Game Awards' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>, will air a couple of days beforehand, on Friday 6th June. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">Switch 2, lest you forget, is due to launch on Thursday 5th June</a>. Will there be another Nintendo Direct around then too?
</p>
<p>
The coming weeks will likely see additional showcases announced by other publishers - in the past, EA, Capcom, Ubisoft and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> have held dedicated events during this time period. And what will PlayStation have to offer? We'll let you know as soon as we do.

            <p>The Witcher spin-off studio The Molasses Flood has been absorbed into parent company CD Projekt Red.</p>
<p>The news was shared with a <a href="https://www.themolassesflood.com/">brief statement on the studio's website</a>. "We want to let you know that on April 1, 2025, The Molasses Flood LLC ('TMF') merged with CD Projekt Red Inc. ('CDPR Inc.'), a company being a part of the CD Projekt Group," the notice reads.</p>
<p>"As a result of the merger TMF, in its former legal state (of a separate legal entity) ceased its operations, while CDPR Inc. assumed the rights and obligations of TMF."</p>

<p>The studio assured that this merger "will not affect the availability or distribution of The Flame in The Flood and Drake Hollow video games", and these titles will continue to be published by CD Projekt Group.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/damian-isla-815a46_well-its-the-end-of-an-era-tucked-away-activity-7315404560620044288-Qazy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAoO_OkB-VfPR7dhiZ-PZ-9sf_EfWliEy1k">post on LinkedIn</a>, The Molasses Flood co-founder Damian Isla called this merger a "GOOD AND HEALTHY thing for the studio", and something that had been expected for some time now.</p>
<p>"It breaks down some organisational barriers, and better integrates the TMF team with the rest of the amazing CDPR org," Isla wrote, before announcing he had departed the studio.</p>
<p>"Last Monday - the last day of TMF's legal existence! - was also my last day at the studio," the developer shared. "Obviously this is a big change. TMF has been a huge part of my life for the past decade plus, and I'm proud [to] have been a part of building something that lasted as long as TMF did, in a market environment often quite hostile to tiny teams like ours."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-buys-the-flame-in-the-flood-developer-the-molasses-flood">CD Projekt acquired The Molasses Flood</a> for an undisclosed fee back in 2021. The studio was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-red-announces-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-future-witcher-projects-outlined">tasked with bringing a part-solo, part-multiplayer experience set in The Witcher series to life</a>. However, this project - known as  Project Sirius - has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-spin-off-project-sirius-sounds-like-its-being-rebooted-from-scratch">hit a number of stumbling blocks since its conception</a>.</p>
<p>CD Projekt <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekts-stalled-the-witcher-spin-off-now-has-a-new-framework">shared an update on Project Sirius</a> in 2023, announcing its "work on defining a new framework" was now complete, but that news was followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-spin-off-studio-the-molasses-flood-hit-by-layoffs-following-project-reboot">layoffs at the Boston-based studio</a>.</p>
<p>Reflecting on this week's news, Isla said Project Sirius has a "bright future" and is "going to be an amazing game" on its release. </p>
<p>"I cannot wait until the rest of the world learns about what we've been working on," Isla wrote.</p>

<p>Elsewhere at CDPR, in December last year the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">studio lifted the lid on The Witcher 4</a>. This new saga will shift its focus away from Geralt of Rivia and toward a new protagonist in Ciri (pictured above).</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the developer confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-after-2026-so-could-it-be-a-next-generation-game">it doesn't plan to release The Witcher 4 by the end of 2026</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
