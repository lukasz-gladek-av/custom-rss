            <p>Nintendo has essentially confirmed in all but name that Rainbow Road will indeed be part of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> on the game's release this summer.</p>
<p>However, while Rainbow Road is a part of the upcoming Mario Kart title, it isn't going to be available to zip around from the off. Rather, players will need to "conquer" all Grand Prix cups. Then, so says Nintendo, "rumour has it a certain colourful course will appear".</p>
<p>So, yep, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-leak-confirms-iconic-tracks-return">that'll be Rainbow Road</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-mario-kart-world-direct-live-watch-here">Nintendo's Mario Kart World Direct this afternoon</a> showing a colourful beam leading up to the sky above.</p>

<p>Other courses confirmed for Mario Kart World include the all new icy Starview Peak and the spoooooky Boo Cinema, as well as returning series entries like Toad's Factory, Peach Beach and Wario's Galleon.</p>
<p>Here are the Mario Kart World courses confirmed this afternoon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mario Bros. Circuit</li>
<li>Crown City</li>
<li>Salty Salty Speedway</li>
<li>Starview Peak</li>
<li>Boo Cinema</li>
<li>Toad's Factory</li>
<li>Peach Beach</li>
<li>Wario's Galleon</li>
</ul>
<p>On the characters side of things, we will of course be able to play as Mario - this is his series after all - as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-moo-moo-meadows-cow-is-the-true-star-of-nintendos-switch-2-direct">new racers like Cow</a>, Spike and Goomba (Ed and I want to know how he drives without arms. And, while we are on it, I still have questions about King Boo's driving abilities).</p>
<p>These drivers will be able to use new items, such as Kamek. Yes, Kamek is an item, and his magic will "transform" your racing rivals into, at least as far as today's Direct has shown us, Chargin' Chucks - those large burly Koopas in football gear. "What other mysterious effects will happen," Nintendo teased in today's showcase. I don't know Nintendo, I don't know!</p>
<p>Here are some of the Items confirmed for Mario Kart World, with some returning favourites as well as some newbies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coin Shell (makes coins appear)</li>
<li>Ice Flower (freeze your rivals and send them spinning)</li>
<li>Hammer (embrace your inner Hammer Bro)</li>
<li>Mega Mushroom (go big or go home)</li>
<li>Feather (handy for avoiding attacks)</li>
<li>Kamek (see above)</li>
<li>Bullet Bill (blast through the ranks)</li>
<li>Lightning (zap your racing rivals)</li>
</ul>
<p>Next up, we have Mario Kart World's support features, handy for those new to the series or for those who, like my god children, are too small to actually be able to control what's going on but still want to be part of the fun.</p>
<p>These features include Smart Steering (often needed when small humans are involved), Auto-Accelerate and Auto-Use Item. There are also Tilt Controls, which are compatible with the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s Joy-Con wheel.</p>

<p>There's more! Here are the various modes and battles coming to Mario Kart World: </p>
<ul>
<li>Time Trials</li>
<li>VS Race</li>
<li>Teams</li>
<li>Balloon Battle</li>
<li>Coin Runners</li>
</ul>
<p>"Battle Mode is back and more hectic than ever! Burst your rivals’ balloons with items in Balloon Battle or secure the gold by collecting the most coins in Coin Runners," reads the Battle Mode's official blurb from Nintendo. "And this time around, if you pop all of your rival’s balloons, they are out!"</p>
<p>Mario Kart World will also have new tricks. There's Charge Jump, which can be used while holding the drift button while driving straight ahead. These jumps can enable racers to jump over obstacles such as an oncoming vehicle, "grind along powerlines", and move out of the way of an oncoming rival attack such as a green shell. This jump will also allow the jumper to wall ride for a bit should they jump towards a wall (obviously).</p>
<p>Another new trick arriving with Mario Kart World is Rewind, which does exactly as it says on the tin. Racers can rewind the action, but - and this is important - only for them. Other racers will still be charging ahead as normal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, if hunger strikes when playing Mario Kart World, there is the option to "make a pit stop" for some grub. Dash Food, as this is known, is some to-go orders that will give players "a speed boost and sometimes also unlock outfits that can be donned from the character selection screen". Nintendo promises a large selection of dishes and outfits to discover on the game's release.</p>
<p>Our Tom has already taken the upcoming game for a whirl, calling Mario Kart World "undoubtedly Switch 2's killer app" and one he can't wait to play more of.</p>
<p>"Mario Kart World's reinvention of the series may be a gamble, but it's absolutely one I think will pay off. With a web of possible routes and hours of time likely to be spent exploring every corner of its highways, deserts and mountains - or racing to stay ahead of the competition in Knockout Tour - it's just as well the game's a Switch 2 launch title," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">Eurogamer's Mario Kart World preview</a>.</p>
<p>More to come...</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
