            <p>The team behind open-world adventure RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> is ending support for those on PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>Developer HoYoverse has said it made this decision because of "limitations related to hardware performance and platform application size".</p>

<p>The PS4 version of Genshin Impact will be removed from the PlayStation Store later this year, on 10th September. Then, on 25th February next year, all of the in-game purchases will be removed from both the PlayStation Store and the in-game shop.</p>
<p>"Before Genshin Impact's update discontinuation on PS4, any items purchased from the PlayStation Store but not yet claimed in-game can still be obtained by logging into Genshin Impact on PS4," the team assured.</p>
<p>Service for those playing Genshin Impact on PS4 will then officially end on 8th April, 2026. "Any items purchased from the PlayStation Store but not yet claimed in-game can only be claimed by logging into Genshin Impact on PS5 after this date," the developer said.</p>
<p>HoYoverse noted that those on PS5 will not be impacted by these changes, and the game will "continue to operate normally" on the console, as well as other available platforms. It has advised anyone playing on PS4 to transition over to either PlayStation 5 or other supported platforms. "Your game progress will not be affected," it said.</p>
