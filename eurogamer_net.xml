            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> Studios has announced a closed alpha test for its forthcoming extraction shooter PUBG: Black Budget.</p>
<p>The game promises to redefine the genre, with a focus on exploration and discovery as opposed to survival and combat. It's set on a mysterious island trapped in a time loop by a supernatural phenomenon.</p>
<p>It faces stiff competition, however, as the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> and Escape from Tarkov have recently released, not to mention the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/escape-from-duckov-is-not-what-i-was-expecting-at-all-and-its-another-startling-reminder-that-perhaps-were-going-about-this-whole-making-games-business-all-wrong">parody Escape from Duckov</a>, as well as the recent Battlefield and Call of Duty releases.</p>
<p>Perhaps, though, PUBG Studios is looking to capitalise on those successes to bolster interest in Black Budget.</p>
<p>The test will take place on Steam for players across North America, Europe, and Asia in two sessions. The first will be 12th - 14th December; the second from 19th - 21st December. That's across two weekends.</p>
<p>Players can sign up for access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4077740/PUBG_Black_Budget/">Steam</a>.</p>

<p>Project Black Budget, as it was initially known, was<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-people-behind-pubg-plan-to-take-on-escape-from-tarkov-and-dmz-with-an-extraction-shooter-of-their-own"> first spotted in a Krafton financial report back in 2023</a>, described as including "an ever-changing PvPvE open-world and satisfying gunplay that deliver unpredictable and exciting experiences". It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-studios-project-black-budget-will-release-sooner-than-expected-says-publisher-krafton">appeared to be aiming for a 2024 release</a>, but its release date remains TBA.</p>
<p>Still, next month's test will provide a first hands-on opportunity, suggesting a full launch could finally be on the horizon.</p>

            <p>Actor Doug Cockle, who is known to many as the gravelly voiced Geralt of Rivia in CD Projekt Red's The Witcher games, has again said he was "sad" to see Henry Cavill step away from the same role in Netflix's series. However, he believes Liam Hemsworth "holds up pretty well" in the show's fourth season.</p>

<p>Hemsworth was first announced to be joining the cast of Netflix's The Witcher adaptation in 2022, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-4-henry-cavill-replaced-as-geralt">Cavill said he would be "laying down [his] medallion and [his] swords"</a> when the third season wrapped. Many were upset by this decision, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-voice-actor-sad-about-henry-cavill-leaving-the-witcher-netflix-show">even Cockle himself said he was disappointed to see Cavill go</a>.</p>
<p>But now, reflecting on the Geralt cast change once more, Cockle has said that while Cavill was certainly "a fantastic Witcher", having seen the latest season of Netflix's series, he also thinks Hemsworth is pretty good too.</p>
<p>"I think Liam holds up pretty well," Cockle told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/fantasy-shows/geralts-game-actor-says-he-was-sad-to-see-henry-cavill-go-but-that-liam-hemsworth-holds-up-pretty-well-in-the-witcher-season-4-hes-made-it-his-own-character/?s=31">GamesRadar+</a>. "He's different. He's made it his own character, and that's what he should have done as an actor, and I think he's done a fantastic job." Cockle added he is looking forward to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-5-will-be-its-last">fifth and final season of Netflix's Witcher adaptation</a>, and "seeing where it goes".</p><p>Back in April last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witchers-video-game-voice-star-weighs-in-on-netflix-adaptation">Cockle admitted there were some choices made by Netflix during the adaptation's run so far he didn't understand</a>. However, he also appreciated the need "to give different mediums their space". The show's "gotta have room to be its own thing", Cockle said at the time.</p>

<p>Cockle is set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-of-town-that-was-definitely-doug-cockles-white-haired-monster-hunter-in-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer">reprise his role of Geralt in The Witcher 4</a>, which will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">feature Ciri as its lead</a>. CD Projekt previously confirmed its next Witcher game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-after-2026-so-could-it-be-a-next-generation-game">won't be launching until after the end of 2026</a>, suggesting it might even be a next-gen release.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, it was revealed that Karel Kolmann - a key member of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> development team - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-bolsters-the-witcher-4-team-with-key-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-talent">had made the jump to CD Projekt to work on The Witcher 4</a>.</p>
