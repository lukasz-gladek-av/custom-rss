            <p>MindsEye, the new game from former GTA producer Leslie Benzies, has finally been given a release date.</p>
<p>The game was originally revealed as part of the Everywhere project from Benzies' studio Build A Rocket Boy; then in October last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-to-publish-former-rockstar-and-gta-producers-mysterious-blockbuster-mindseye">Hitman developer IO Interactive announced it would be publishing MindsEye</a>.</p>
<p>Now it has a firm release date: 10th June 2025, across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. And there's a new story trailer to go with it too.</p>

<p>The trailer for the action-adventure thriller introduces the near-future desert metropolis of Redrock City, as well as the eccentric tech boss Marco Silva eager to change the course of human evolution.</p>
<p>"We can’t wait for players to immerse themselves in our tightly crafted game, MindsEye, with a thought-provoking story where technology and ambition collide, and the inevitable consequences unravel," said Benzies.</p>
<p>Adam Whiting, assistant game director at Build A Rocket Boy, told Eurogamer the team isn't worried about a June release clashing with the traditional E3 and Summer Game Fest period. "It maybe allows us to actually talk to players, engage with players around that time in a meaningful way," he said. "We're just very excited for players to finally get the chance to play."</p>
<p>Further, Whiting confirmed that the developer is still working on Everywhere. "MindsEye is a standalone game, but it is kind of connected," he said. "You can access it through Everywhere as a platform, but mostly we're really focused on MindsEye."</p>
<p>Everywhere was first revealed at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> in 2022, though its purpose confused players and rumours swirled around cryptocurrency and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a>. Benzies flatly denied this to Eurogamer during a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-producers-not-crypto-project-everywhere-is-part-episodic-blockbuster-part-roblox-rival">preview of the project in March 2023</a>.</p>
<p>It is, essentially, a platform for user-generated content, akin to Roblox, with MindsEye as a primary example from the developer itself of what can be achieved. More recently, MindsEye has taken centre stage with Everywhere humming away in the background.</p>
<p>MindsEye will be available as a standalone game for £54.99 / $59,99 / €59.99.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layoffs-hit-gta-producers-everywhere-studio">company was hit by layoffs in early 2024</a>, a month after completing a fresh $110m funding round from investor NetEase.</p>
<p>Whiting noted to Eurogamer the industry's rapid expansion during the Covid-19 pandemic, which was followed by global layoffs. "We're seeing a lot of that stuff happening in the industry right now and it makes me sad because the games industry is full of so many very talented, very lovely people," he said. "But it's this period of the ebbs and flows, the peaks and troughs, and maybe it's in a bit of a trough now, but I'm sure it'll peak again soon."</p>
<p>He also noted that NetEase's recent, apparent pullback from video games hasn't affected the studio negatively. "Certainly, there's nothing that's let us to make any compromises or anything like that," he said.</p>
<p>"You know Leslie, he's a visionary, and he doesn't want to compromise on that vision for anything at all."</p>

            <p>Krafton has patched out a bug in its early access release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">InZoi</a>, which allowed players to run over children with a car and kill them.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/inZOI/comments/1jldd0w/i_dont_think_that_krafton_realizes_that_you_can/">post on the InZoi subreddit</a> titled "I don't think that Krafton realises that you can run over children in inZOI" had started making the rounds. Attached to this post was a clip from the game, showing a player hitting a child with the front of their car.</p>
<p>Once the car hit the child, the child was then launched ragdolling across the ground in front of them, with the impact ultimately killing them.</p>
<p>While the developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-like-inzoi-has-16-different-types-of-deaths-so-watch-out-for-slippery-bathroom-floors">previously confirmed characters in InZoi could die from getting hit by a car</a>, with game director Hyungjun 'Kjun' Kim warning players they "might want to be careful" near the road, it was never said that children would also be subjected to this death.</p>
<p>Krafton has now addressed this bug. In a statement shared with Eurogamer, a Krafton spokesperson said:</p>
<p>"This issue was caused by an unintended bug that has been resolved in the latest patch. These depictions are highly inappropriate and do not reflect the intent and values of inZOI. We understand the seriousness of this matter and age-appropriate content and we are strengthening our internal review processes to prevent similar incidents in the future."</p>

<p>Our Matt has been playing InZoi, and while he appreciated its "expansive customisation" and "richly detailed worlds", he was a touch disappointed with Krafton's life-sim game.</p>
<p>"The trouble is, it's all so <em>soulless </em>– its flashiness failing to mask a lack of personality. Where The Sims feels tuned for maximum chaos and carnage (sometimes exhaustingly so), InZoi barely mustered a single memorable event in the six hours I played. I milled about its empty streets, trudged around its handful of notable landmarks, sang a song in a park, and unsuccessfully tried to strike up a friendship with strangers before returning home," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-25-years-of-the-sims-could-inzoi-be-about-to-steal-its-crown">Eurogamer's InZoi impressions feature</a>.</p>
<p>"By the time I'd tired of redecorating and had clicked on everything in my apartment at least twice, I was genuinely wondering how I was going to fill the rest of my virtual day as InZoi's clock – glacially slow even on its fastest setting - ticked on by."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
