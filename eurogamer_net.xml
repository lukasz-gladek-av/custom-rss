            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> Ballistic is a new 5v5 mode launching next week in early access within the main Fortnite client. 
</p>
<p>
It's also Epic Games' first proper foray into first-person for Fortnite - a move that has been long-awaited by some fans.
</p>
<p>
Ballistic arrives on Wednesday 11th December with one map - Skyline 10 - plus a limited number of weapons and items. These will all be expanded over time based on player feedback, Epic Games has said. 
</p>
<p>
Matches begin with players sorted into teams of either attackers or defenders. Attackers must deploy a payload - a Rift Point Device - while defenders must stop them. Players swap sides after six rounds, and the game is over when one team wins a seventh round in total.
</p><p>
If it all sounds a bit <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> or Valorant, well, there's clearly inspiration here. But, of course, Fortnite is already full of character skins - which will all be supported - and so the different loadouts you get here seem more customisable.

<p>
Each match begins with players picking one of five Flex Gadgets, such as proxy mines, bubble shields, and different types of grenade that can launch you (and your enemies) or mark them for your teammates. 
</p>
<p>
As with most other Fortnite shooter modes, Ballistic will host both Ranked and Unranked modes, with the former offering a ladder to climb and penalities if you leave matches. 
</p>
<p>
The addition of Fortnite Ballistic follows yesterday's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-og-will-rotate-chapter-1-seasons-every-couple-of-months">arrival of Fortnite OG as a newly-permanent mode</a>, and last week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-6-season-1-map">launch of Chapter 6 for the game's main battle royale</a> offering. 
</p>
<p>
Next up? Epic Games has already begun teasing a fresh update for its main <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a> mode that seems like it may feature the Storm King...

            <p>Deck Nine Games, the studio behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a> and last year's The Expanse: A Telltale Series, has confirmed further layoffs.</p>
<p>In a statement, CEO Mark Lyons said it had been "an extremely difficult decision" but "reflect[ed] the challenging times many companies in our industry are currently facing".</p>
<p>Lyons' words stopped short of confirming how many staff had been impacted by the most recent round of cuts, or how it will affect its development pipeline.</p>

<p>"Today we are sad to share the news that we must say goodbye to some of our talented team members," the statement began.</p>
<p>"This was an extremely difficult decision and reflects the challenging times many companies in our industry are currently facing. We are extremely grateful to every individual who has dedicated their hard work, passion, and commitment to making transformative entertainment with us.</p><div>

<p>"To those of you leaving the studio due to these changes, thank you for sharing your talents with us. We are proud of what we were able to accomplish together and we are committed to supporting you in this transition in any way we can."</p>
<p>The statement closed on asking players and fans for their "support and understanding" at this time.</p>
<p>These are the second round of layoffs this year alone. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-true-colors-studio-deck-nine-lays-off-20-of-staff">Deck Nine also laid off around 20 percent of its workforce back in February</a>. A couple of months later, an investigation into Deck Nine showed that although its games celebrated diversity and inclusivity, its own culture allegedly fostered toxicity, hate speech, harassment, crunch, bullying, and abusive leadership as a result of inaction from senior management.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
