            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a> has never been short on explosive tools of destruction, but the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/27/helldivers-2-siege-breakers-premium-warbond-drops-february-3/">Siege Breakers update</a>, new warbond included, aims to take things to the next level. Moreover, a terrifying old threat from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-review">first Helldivers</a> could be back soon.</p>
<p>Via the official PlayStation Blog (as shared above) and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/509603414731131980?l=english">Steam</a>, PlayStation and Arrowhead Studios have announced the full scope of this next content update set to arrive on 3rd February. As always, it's partially defined by a new premium warbond packed with new weapons and cosmetics. This pass can be obtained with Super Credits which you either buy or slowly amass by completing certain objectives in the game.</p>
<p>The SA-7 Headfirst and SA-8 RAM armour sets are prominently featured in the trailer, which you can watch below, but it's the new primary weapon and the three new stratagems which steal the show.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9E9-iGwK_4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>

<p>The "shotgun-like" LAS-16 Trident makes a return with six beams now blasting the enemies of Super Earth apart. On the stratagem front, the CQC-20 Breaching Hammer will no doubt become a new favourite, as it can just smash the old-fashioned way or go big and loud with an explosive charge that makes me fear for my fellow <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a>' lives.</p><p>Heavy weapons also get a boost through the GL-28 Grenade Launcher and EAT-411 Leveller stratagems. The former is self-explanatory and can fire a "non-stop" barrage of nades, but the latter is a next-level rocket launcher with a high-yield missile. Defence isn't being left behind either, as the throwable G/SH-39 Shield generates a shield that deflects heavy projectiles while you do your thing or catch your breath.</p>

<p>"Emotes, patterns, and more" are part of the new warbond as well, but it's the trailer's final seconds that unnerve us, as a new massive threat might be on the horizon: Helldivers 1's cyborgs. Whether they'll be treated as a totally separate faction or as part of the Automaton horde remains to be seen, but most veterans on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/">Helldivers subreddit</a> seem to agree on what's coming next for Super Earth's forces.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-pc-reduced-installation-size">heavily reducing the game's install size</a> following substantial player complaints, it appears that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-just-learned-there-is-a-helldivers-2-rogue-lite-mode-prototype-at-arrowhead-and-now-i-really-want-to-try-it-out">development of new content</a> is once again full steam ahead. Moreover, the live-action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-announced-helldivers-movie-director-may-not-be-a-gamer-but-he-has-worked-on-multiple-fast-furious-films">Helldivers movie</a> is gaining momentum fast.</p>

            <p>
The Competition Appeal Tribunal has ruled a £656m market rigging lawsuit filed against Valve by digital rights campaigners can proceed, meaning 14m Steam users in the UK could receive compensation.
</p>
<p>
The lawsuit was originally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-being-sued-for-656m-in-uk-amid-accusations-of-market-rigging-through-steam">filed by digital rights activist Vicki Shotbolt in June 2024</a>, accusing Valve of rigging the PC games market and deliberately "shutting out" competition through Steam. Shotbolt had argued Valve imposed price parity clauses on publishers and developers, preventing them from selling titles at cheaper prices on rival platforms - limiting consumer choice and harming competition in turn.
</p>
<p>
Shotbolt's suit further alleged Valve's decision to prohibit consumers from purchasing DLC for their Steam games on rival platforms also restricted market competition, which, when combined with an "excessive commission of up to 30 percent" caused "inflated prices on its Steam". As such, it asserted UK consumers are paying too much for purchasing PC games and DLC.
</p>
<p>
In response, Valve had argued the case should not be certified to proceed toward a trial, but (as <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2g1md0l23o">per the BBC</a>) the Competition Appeal Tribunal has now ruled otherwise. "A hearing to consider the PCR's application for a collective proceedings order ("CPO") took place on 14 October 2025," a notice in the tribunal's website explained. "On 26 January 2026, the Tribunal issued its judgment granting the CPO application ([2026] CAT 4)." Eurogamer has approached Valve for comment on the ruling.
</p><p>
Shotbolt's lawsuit is being handled by legal firm Milberg London LLP, which specialises in group action cases against large companies (the firm was also behind a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sued-for-5bn-for-ripping-people-off-on-playstation-store">2022 filing against Sony</a>, which was similarly accused of abusing its market power). The collective action claim argues 14m people in the UK have been overcharged for PC games as a result of Valve's actions, and is seeking compensation of between £22 and £44 for each one.
