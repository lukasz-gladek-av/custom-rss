            <p>The Final Fantasy series has now sold over 200m copies across the globe.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> shared the announcement on social media, along with the news the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-pixel-remaster">Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster</a> series has sold over 5m copies worldwide.</p>
<p>The sales figure further cements Final Fantasy as one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time, even if sales have dipped in more recent years.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy is on a par with the likes of Assassin's Creed and The Sims, having sold more than the Sonic the Hedgehog series and the Legend of Zelda series. However, it remains far behind the Mario franchise, Tetris, Call of Duty, Pokémon, GTA, Minecraft, and FIFA.</p>
<p>In terms of sales, the PS1 era was collectively the most successful for Final Fantasy. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> sold almost 15m copies, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-viii">Final Fantasy 8</a> sold 12m copies, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a> sold 8.9m copies. Elsewhere Final Fantasy 12 sold 11.3m, Final Fantasy 15 sold 10.3m, Final Fantasy 13 sold 9.6m, and Final Fantasy 10 sold almost 9m (thanks <a href="https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy#Sales_history">Video Game Sales Wiki</a>).</p>
<p>However, they all pale in comparison to Final Fantasy 14 at 24m sales. In 2021 the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-xiv-the-most-profitable-game-in-the-series">MMORPG was the most profitable game in the series</a>, and in financial reports since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-revenue-kept-afloat-thanks-to-final-fantasy-14">often kept the company afloat</a> where other games have failed to meet expectations.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series has sold over 5 million copies worldwide, and the Final Fantasy series has now sold over 200 million copies across the globe!</p><p>Wherever you joined us on our adventures, thank you. <a href="https://t.co/6eoIoDBXh0">pic.twitter.com/6eoIoDBXh0</a></p></div>— FINAL FANTASY (@FinalFantasy) <a href="https://twitter.com/FinalFantasy/status/1900396747647754617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>More recently, while Final Fantasy 7 Remake sold 8.7m copies, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">both follow-up Rebirth and the next series entry Final Fantasy 16 "did not meet expectations"</a> according to Square Enix.</p>
<p>Still, the 5m sales for the Pixel Remasters - revamped versions of the first six games in the series - is good news for the company, proving both nostalgia and interest in older games from series fans and newcomers.</p>
<p>And with Square Enix's multiplatform strategy, sales are expected to increase. Most recently, Rebirth was released on PC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-final-fantasy-7-rebirths-pc-port-has-promise-but-too-many-problems">even if the port has issues</a>, while the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-brings-mana-and-final-fantasy-pixel-remasters-to-xbox">Pixel Remasters were added to Xbox last September</a> in addition to their previous release on Switch, PC, PlayStation, and mobile.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A Rockstar-approved GTA 5 modding tool is on the cars, I mean cards, for all of you PC players out there.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, and several years after the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>'s enhanced edition on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-5s-next-gen-upgrades-finally-arrive-on-pc">the game's next-gen features finally arrived on PC as part of a free update for all existing users</a>.</p>
<p>Now, Cfx.re - that is to say, the team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-hires-a-team-of-modders-it-had-previously-banned-from-playing-gta-5">Rockstar hired in 2023, and which was behind the popular GTA 5 FiveM and RDR2 RedM multiplayer mods</a> - is working on a "conversion tool" which will "assist the modding community in making their assets compatible with the new upgrade". This is as any custom assets used on FiveM and GTA 5 Legacy are not "natively compatible" with Rockstar's newly-launched PC version of GTA 5 Enhanced.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://forum.cfx.re/t/coming-soon-new-official-modding-utility/5312475">laid out by Cfx.re</a>, the team's upcoming conversion tool will support the following formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dictionaries of multiple drawables (*.ydd)</li>
<li>Generic models, geometry, optional embedded textures and lights (*.ydr)</li>
<li>Complex fragmented skeletons/models used for pedestrians, vehicles, destructible objects, etc. (*.yft)</li>
<li>Texture Dictionaries (also known as TXD) (*ytd.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Cfx.re noted file types such as .ycd and .ybn will not require any conversion.</p>
<p>The tool itself does not have a release date as yet, with Cfx.re stating it still has a few bits and pieces it needs to sort out before it is ready to be debuted. For now, it just says "coming soon", and the team said it will share a more thorough breakdown of what the tool will include at a later date.</p>
<p>As to why this is a pretty big deal, well, Rockstar has been rather strict with mods in the past.  Back in 2017, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ambitious-mod-project-to-put-liberty-city-in-gta5-canned">called time on the 'Liberty City in GTA5' mod</a>, saying that while it "generally [would] not take legal action against third-party projects involving Rockstar's PC games that are single-player, non-commercial, and respect the intellectual property rights of third parties", it would not allow "use or importation of other IP", including its own. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, just this January, the creators of an impressive mod which added a playable version of Grand Theft Auto 4's map to GTA5 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-shuts-down-ambitious-mod-that-put-gta-4s-liberty-city-in-grand-theft-auto-5">removed their own project from the public eye following a discussion with Rockstar</a>. </p>

<p>Following its debut on Steam, GTA 5 Enhanced has welcomed a healthy number of players. At the time of writing, there are still 108,568 of us heisting cars and getting up to who knows what over on Valve's platform.</p>
<p>Despite these numbers, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5s-enhanced-pc-launch-is-off-to-a-good-start-on-steam-but-user-reviews-are-mixed">GTA5 Enhanced user reviews are still sitting with a "mixed" average on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>DC Comics and Sega have released a first look at their Justice League and Sonic the Hedgehog comic book series, including Sonic dressed as The Flash and Shadow as Batman.</p>
<p>The crossover was first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-announces-sonic-and-dc-comic-collaboration-at-sonic-central-stream">announced at the Sonic Central event</a> last September, following a tease on Batman Day earlier the same week.</p>
<p>That first announcement revealed which characters we'd see pairing up, but now we've got a first look at official comic panels of both teams joining forces to save their worlds from a major threat.</p>

            <p>While Nintendo itself is still keeping any firm <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> details under wraps until its dedicated showcase next month, analysts believe the company is on course to deliver the biggest launch in game industry history.</p>
<p>According to several <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/nintendo-switch-2-set-for-gaming-s-biggest-ever-launch-even-at-400-plus">Bloomberg</a> analysts, it is expected that the Switch 2 will be more expensive than its predecessor, with the upcoming console potentially retailing for $400 or more - around £310 here in the UK.</p>
<p>"The original Switch's Nvidia chip is estimated to cost $80 per unit, while the Switch 2's chip is likely to be in the $130-$150 range," Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda said. "I wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo goes ahead with $499."</p>

<figcaption>9 Nintendo Switch 2 Games It NEEDS to Have. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLwu_b2NGpk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While Yasuda expects a slightly higher price point than others, fellow industry analysts including Serkan Toto, Yijia Zhai of UBS and Robin Zhu of Sanford C Bernstein believe Nintendo's upcoming console will see an increase of around $100 or more over the original Switch's $299 price point. External factors will also be a consideration on the console's debut, such as the US tariffs.</p>
<p>But, even with this expected higher price tag, the analysts all agree that the Switch 2 will have an auspicious debut.</p>
<p>"They will sell boatloads of Switch 2 in the first months in particular, almost regardless of the price," Toto said. "We can expect a great software line-up in year one, from new Mario Kart and 3D Mario after eight years to Pokémon Legends: Z-A and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>. There will also be third-party support from day one, most probably including blockbusters like Call of Duty."</p>
<p>Zhu currently expects Nintendo to release its Switch 2 console this June, adding the company has a first-day inventory of 6m to 8m units, which would make it the biggest console launch ever. As Bloomberg notes, the Switch sold 2.7m units during its first month on the market, while Sony's two most recent PlayStation launches each sold 4.5m units in their respective first quarters.</p>
<p>Macquarie Capital analyst Hiroshi Yamashina, meanwhile, forecasts sales of 20m units during the console's first year on the market.</p>

<p>The ability to trade Pokémon has been a key feature of the series since its beginnings, and in January it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-brand-trading-system-a-joke-and-downright-greedy">finally added to the digital card collecting game</a>. However, due to new currency and restrictions, fans heavily criticised the trading feature calling it an "insult".</p>
<p>A few days later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-admits-restrictive-trading-system-stops-players-enjoying-the-feature-as-intended">The Pokémon Company acknowledged the backlash</a>, admitting trading restrictions were "preventing players from being able to casually enjoy" the game.</p>

<p>Now, massive changes are coming to the trade feature, including the complete removal of trade tokens. Instead, trading will use Shinedust, an existing currency found simply by opening booster packs.</p>
<p>However, the changes will be implemented by the end of autumn 2025, so exact dates are as yet unknown.</p>
<p>As per the announcement, the following changes will be made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trade tokens will be completely removed and players will no longer need to exchange cards to obtain the currency required for trading.</li>
<li>Instead, trading cards of three-diamond, four-diamond, and one-star rarity will now require shinedust.</li>
<li>When you open a booster pack, shinedust will be automatically earned if you obtain a card that is already registered in your Card Dex. Currently, shinedust is also required to obtain flair, so we are looking into increasing the amount offered since it will also be needed for trading. Altogether, this change should allow you to trade more cards than you could before this update.</li>
<li>Trade tokens you currently own can be converted to shinedust when the item is removed from the game.</li>
<li>There are no changes in how one-diamond and two-diamond rarity cards are traded.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, a new feature will be included to allow players to share the cards they're interested in trading in advance.</p>
<p>"We hope that these changes will make trading cards more accessible and allow more players to enjoy making trades," the announcement reads.</p>
<p>"In addition to the changes above, we are also looking into how to accommodate cards that are currently unavailable for trades, such as promo cards and two-star rarity cards. Keep an eye out for more information about this topic in the future."</p> <div>
