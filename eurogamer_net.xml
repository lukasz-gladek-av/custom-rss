            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-leak-looks-to-show-free-battle-pass-rewards<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Leaked <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> images have surfaced that appear to show a selection of free battle pass rewards for Ubisoft's upcoming blockbuster. 
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed has never offered a battle pass before, and Ubisoft is yet to announce any details officially on how this will work. 
</p>
<p>
Still, datamined content appears to suggest players will be able to complete daily missions from within the game's new Animus Hub to progress a battle pass with 20 free tiers and receive cosmetic items. Ubisoft now appears to be scrubbing images from social media, including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1grbg48/information_and_assets_of_the_upcoming_animus_hub/">reddit</a>.

<p>
Cosmetic items include the kind of optional visual items Assassin's Creed has regularly offered for free and for sale in the past, including character costumes, weapon skins and new looks for your mount. 
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed has long hosted daily and weekly missions, too. As with most Ubisoft games, these timed challenges and rewards are found within the publisher's Ubisoft Connect app.
</p>
<p>
Shadows looks set to streamline all of this within its Animus Hub, the new and still rather nebulous home of the series' modern day story that will also act as connective tissue between future Assassin's Creed games. 
</p>
<p>Leaked artwork looks to show Shadows' co-protagonist Yasuke standing within the Animus Hub, suggesting players will be able to use character avatars to navigate it.</p>
<p>
Eurogamer discussed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-explains-what-assassins-creed-infinity-actually-is">Animus Hub project, also known in development as Assassin's Creed Infinity</a>, back in 2022 with franchise boss Marc-Alexis Coté. "It's going to be the single entry point for our fans into the Assassin's Creed franchise into the future," he said at the time. 
</p><p>At a BAFTA event attended by Eurogamer in London earlier this month, Coté went into more detail on how the series will handle its modern day narrative in future, after admitting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-reflects-on-series-struggle-to-tell-consistent-modern-day-story-after-desmond">it had been a "struggle" to remain consistent since the departure of the series' initial protagonist Desmond</a>. </p>
<p>"Our goal is to put history back at the centre of the players' experience," Coté said. "The modern day narrative will serve to enhance, rather than overshadow, the historical journey. By drawing meaningful contrast between past and present, we aim to restore the balance that was once the hallmark of the franchise.</p>
<p>"The modern day storyline will explore deeper themes of memory, identity and autonomy, how the past shapes who we are, and how controlling this past can impact our future. These themes will allow us to reflect on contemporary issues: freedom versus control, the power of knowledge and the tension between individuality and conformity, all through the lens of history.</p>
<p>"The groundwork for this new direction will take shape with Assassin's Creed Shadows, which will lay the foundation for this narrative evolution that will grow in the years to come."</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developer Respawn is reportedly considering a monthly subscription service.</p>
<p>Whilst not formally announced, a recent survey sent out to Apex Legends fans asked if they would be interested in a "monthly subscription" to unlock in-game rewards for the free-to-play battle royale.</p>

            <p>
The boss of GTA Trilogy developer Grove Street Games has spoken out on social media to blast the removal of "primary developers from credits" following the game's major update this week for PC and consoles.
</p>
<p>
Tuesday's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-years-later-gta-trilogy-finally-gets-pc-and-console-fixes-from-improved-mobile-port">GTA Trilogy patch finally brought over fixes</a> from the games' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-tested-on-iphone">better-received mobile version</a> (worked on by another studio, Video Games Deluxe) such as a Classic Lighting mode which restores the look of the games' original versions, plus improvements to character models and other visual tweaks. 
</p>
<p>
The update also aligned the GTA Trilogy's opening splash screen to that of the mobile version, with Rockstar simply mentioned as GTA's developer. 
</p>
<p>
It's this change which Grove Street Games' Thomas Williamson appears to be reacting to now on social media.
</p>
<p>
"Speaking entire hypothetically," Williamson <a href="https://twitter.com/TSWilliamson/status/1857124999045222581">wrote</a> on X, "it's a dick move to remove primary developers from credits in an update, especially when an update includes hundreds of fixes that were provided by those developers that stayed out of players' hands for years."
</p>
<p>
As pointed out by fans of the GTA Trilogy, however, the games' credits have not changed and Grove Street Games and its staff are still listed as before.

<p>
Ensuring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-localisation-workers-regularly-left-out-of-game-credits">staff who work on games receive proper accreditation has long been a thorny issue</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/100-staff-cut-from-la-noire-credits">Rockstar itself in the past heavily criticised for leaving staff members out</a> of credits. Here, however, Williamson's comments - hypothetical as they are - appear to be based on misleading media reports that suggested Grove Street Games was no longer credited at all. 
</p>
<p>
Williamson previously made headlines when GTA Trilogy first arrived, riddled with bugs, performance issues and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dataminers-discover-hot-coffee-code-in-gta-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition">code for the illicit Hot Coffee sex mini-game</a>, to comment on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-inundated-with-refund-requests-as-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-backlash-intensifies">enormous wave of backlash</a> against the game.
</p>
<p>
"It's so fun to see players out there really enjoying what we've put together for them," Williamson <a href="https://x.com/TSWilliamson/status/1458796005185531906">wrote</a> at the time, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-apologises-for-gta-trilogy-definitive-editions-unexpected-issues-re-lists-classic-versions-for-pc">Rockstar itself apologised</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pc-owners-of-the-gta-trilogy-remaster-can-claim-an-extra-game-for-free">offered a free game to PC owners</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-says-it-pulled-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-from-sale-on-pc-to-remove-files-unintentionally-included">pulled GTA Trilogy offline for days</a>. "I'm honestly enjoying this unparalleled level of scrutiny on our studio. Today we are celebrating our monumental project launch, while we work on updates. :-)"

    </div><div>



            <p>It's official - Ubisoft's beleaguered Splinter Cell movie has been cancelled.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/splinter-cell-tom-hardy-movie-exclusive">The Direct</a>, the movie - which was announced over a decade ago and was set to star Tom Hardy - has been canned because the production team "just couldn't get it right".</p>

<p>"That movie would have been awesome... Just couldn't get it right, script-wise, budget-wise," said producer Basil Iwanyk.</p>
<p>"But it was going to be great. We had a million different versions of it, but it was going to be hardcore and awesome. That's one of the ones that got away, which is really sad."</p>
<p>Whilst undoubedly a blow to Ubisoft and Sam Fisher fans everywhere, not all is lost, as Ubisoft still has several TV and movie adaptations on the way.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-is-reportedly-working-on-an-animated-splinter-cell-series">long-awaited animated adaptation</a> of Ubisoft's Splinter Cell, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-splinter-cell-deathwatch-animated-series-is-coming-soon">Splinter Cell: Deathwatch, is also still to come</a>, too. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> dropped the official announcement in September, and whilst the teaser only clocked in at around a minute long, it gave us a first taste of what to expect when the show finally debuts on the streaming platform.</p>

            <p>No, it's not just you - it looks like the latest <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> update has nerfed assault rifles.</p>
<p>As spotted by our friends at Digital Foundry, "assault rifles effective ranges have been accidentally nerfed, causing much lower damage at most ranges".</p>
<p>That's not all, either. It seems the Ghost perk - which hides you from UAV and scout pulse - cannot be equipped at all anymore (although it can be duplicated from a class that already has it equipped).</p>

<p>The issue with assault rifles is that the damage you mete out is extremely low as the effective range has seemingly dropped from 40+m to 5.7m and 10.9m - which means you're essentially tickling enemy players to death.</p>

            <p>
UK indie-focused game expo WASD has now been officially cancelled, as its organiser enters liquidation. 
</p>
<p>
The news is, sadly, no surprise to the industry or to fans, who had noticed the brand's website go offline earlier this year.
</p>
<p>
"Increasing costs and less demand for stand space means running events is just not viable for us anymore," WASD co-founder David Lilley told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yxvxzp909o">BBC News</a> today. "[I want] to take this oppurtunity to thank everyone who has supported us along the way."
</p>
<p>
WASD began life in 2022 as the spiritual successor to EGX Rezzed. It was run by largely the same team behind the scenes - now separate from current EGX owner Reedpop - while the main EGX event continued. (Eurogamer was previously also owned by Reedpop, until its sale this year.)</p><p>
The past few years have been particularly difficult for gaming events, with longer-term issues such as fewer games and the rise of online betas and early access mixing with wider issues such as the video game industry's downturn following a boom period during Covid lockdowns.
</p>
<p>
The past 18 months have been marked by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-not-the-result-of-corporate-greed-and-those-affected-should-drive-an-uber-says-ex-sony-president">countless video games industry layoffs</a>, as corporations seek healthier margins by cutting wage bills.
</p>
<p>
This year's EGX, the UK's only remaining major video games event, notably ran as a mash-up with fellow Reedpop-owned expo MCM Comic-Con, meanwhile.
</p>
<p>There's hope for the video games industry in 2025, with a bumper release schedule that includes the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>, but all of this feels like it has come too late for some. We're sorry to see you go, WASD.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
