Soon, the fairies will be upon us thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-is-off-with-the-fairies-in-new-enchanted-by-nature-expansion">imminent Enchanted by Nature expansion</a>. But before all that, EA has laid the foundations for its impending pixie dust explosion with a free content update - introducing the likes of glass walls and rooftop plants - that's available to download and muck around with right now.
</p>
<p>
Glass walls - which should delight the exhibitionist Sims in your life - can be located under Misc &gt; Wall Patterns in Build Mode, and do pretty much exactly what you'd assume, offering your Sims all the outdoors they could possibly hope for without them ever needing to go outside. Alternatively, they could be turned into (lethally?) inconspicuous partitions, or paired with glass roofs for that authentic greenhouse look. And those aforementioned rooftop plants? Well, you can now stick a select assortment of plants on top of your house. The end.
</p>
<p>
Away from these new decor bits, EA's latest update also brings Sim inventory improvements and a notebook refresh. Players now have new ways to sort their inventory, for instance, with the default "new" view placing freshly acquired stuff at the top, but your stash can also be filtered by price, name, crafting quality, and rarity. Spoiled foods, meanwhile, get an unmissable red background indicator and are grouped into a new Spoiled stack.

<p>
As for the notebook - which includes a new interface designed to make it easier to keep tabs on your household Collections - it now sports a refreshed layout, category page enhancements, new discovery badges, and more. "Whether you're jotting down notes for your Sim or exploring unique categories," EA writes, "the notebook is now more intuitive and engaging."
</p>
<p>
All that arrives alongside an extensive list of fixes and improvements across The Sims 4 base game and its expansions. With the update applied, for instance, Sims should no longer need to grapple with the inconvenience of having rain and snow do their thing indoors, and children should stop going stretchy when attempting to play the violin. There's plenty more where those came from, though, as <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/update-7-1-2025">detailed in EA's announcement post</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Sims 4's latest update is available now on all platforms and arrives ahead of the game's next major paid expansion, Enchanted by Nature. This launches next Thursday, 10th July, and introduces emotion-hungry fairies (in both kindly and chaotic forms) as a new supernatural Sim option. That's alongside the new coastal world of Innisgreen, where brave Sims can reside if they don't mind luck heavily impacting the course of their lives. Chuck in new adventures, skills, traits, and a new mechanic based around emotional balance, and it's quite a busy one.

            <p>The Last of Us creator Neil Druckmann is stepping away from his creative involvement in HBO's TV adaptation, calling this a "difficult decision".</p>
<p>In a statement shared on <a href="https://x.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1940465773639880781">social media</a>, Druckmann said now season two of The Last of Us had wrapped, he would be moving his "complete focus" back to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>. This includes writing and directing the studio's all new game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-neil-druckmann-says">as well as Naughty Dog's future projects</a>.</p>

<p>"Co-creating the show has been a career highlight," Druckmann said. "It's been an honour to work alongside Craig Mazin to executive produce, direct and write on the last two seasons."</p>
<p>Druckmann added he was "deeply thankful for the thoughtful approach and dedication the talented cast and crew took to adapting" the first The Last of Us game, as well as the ongoing work adapting The Last of Us Part 2 for TV.</p>
<p>The statement noted now was the right time for the Naughty Dog head to step back from the show, before meaningful work on season three begins.</p>

<p>The Last of Us season two aired earlier this year, picking up five years after the events of the season one finale, with Ellie and Joel - played by Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal - now living in Jackson. New cast members this season included Kaitlyn Dever as Abby, Isabela Merced as Dina, Young Mazino as Jesse and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-who-catherine-ohara-will-play-in-the-last-of-us-marking-a-significant-change-from-the-games">Catherine O'Hara as a new character for the show, Gail</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to its season two premiere, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-show-renewed-for-season-three-and-the-second-hasnt-even-aired-yet">The Last of Us was renewed for a third season</a>. At this time, showrunner Craig Mazin said: "We approached season two with the goal of creating something we could be proud of. The end results have exceeded even our most ambitious goals, thanks to our continued collaboration with HBO and the impeccable work of our unparalleled cast and crew."</p>
<p>The showrunner additionally confirmed The Last of Us TV team is working on a four season plan, stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-confirms-four-season-plan-says-no-way-to-wrap-things-up-in-three">there's "no way" the show's narrative can be wrapped up in only three seasons</a>.</p>

<p>As for Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, earlier this year the star of Naughty Dog's next game said she'd received preparation for the role - and specifically the online reaction to it - from Druckmann himself, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-online-backlash-prompted-naughty-dogs-next-star-to-get-bootcamp-ing-from-neil-druckmann">following the online abuse previously kicked up around The Last of Us Part 2</a>.</p>
<p>Back in March, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-hate-directed-at-the-last-of-us-part-2-naughty-dog-boss-says-next-game-about-the-entirely-uncontroversial-topics-of-faith-and-religion">Druckmann explained how Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet features a fictitious religion</a> which "becomes pretty prominent" in the game's alternate history.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation]]></content:encoded>
