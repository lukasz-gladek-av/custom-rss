            <p>Almost six years on from its debut, Xbox CEO of Gaming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has confirmed that Rare's mysterious fantasy deer adventure Everwild is still in development.</p>
<p>Despite being first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rare-announces-everwild-its-next-big-new-ip">revealed in late 2019</a> with a gorgeous teaser, and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-new-everwild-trailer">shown again in summer 2020</a> with a slightly-more revealing trailer, we've heard very little about the game.</p>

<p>Talking to the XboxEra podcast, however, Spencer had good news for those who feared the game may have been quietly cancelled, revealing the team was making "progress".</p>
<p>"I was recently out at Rare. It's nice to see the team with Everwild and the progress that they're making," Spencer said, when asked reflect on what first-party games still in development he was most looking forward to (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/phil-spencer-provides-rare-update-on-missing-in-action-xbox-exclusive-everwild/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>"It has been [a while]. And we've been able to give those teams time in what they're doing which is good and still have a portfolio like we have.</p>
<p>"It's like a dream that Matt [Booty] and I have had for a long time, so it's finally good to be there. We can give those teams time."</p>
<p>Earlier today we reported that in the same podcast, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-says-hes-stopped-trying-to-move-all-players-over-to-xbox">Spencer said he's "not trying to move [PS5 and PC players] all over to Xbox anymore"</a>, acknowledging that players are "all so invested in where our games are", all he wants to do now is "allow more people to play" Xbox games on other systems.</p>
<p>Spencer acknowledged that whilst selling games on competitor devices means Xbox only recoups 70 percent of the sale, that 70 percent still helps Xbox "build great portfolios".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>10:10 Games has initiated redundancies following the "complete commercial and critical failure" of Funko Fusion.</p>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/1010-games-employees-offered-no-severance-laid-off-while-on-holiday-and-more/">Insider Gaming</a>, where sources shared their experiences under the promise of anonymity, the lukewarm reception to Funko Fusion meant the UK studio struggled to secure funding for addition projects, and some colleagues were informed that there "isn’t enough work to give the whole team".</p>

<p>Sources intimate no meaningful severance support has been made available, with only "the bare minimum" entitlement offered, as well as payment of unused holiday. However, this, some speculate, is why colleagues were pressured into using up all their leave ahead of the announcement.</p>
<p>Because of this, some colleagues were notified that their jobs were at risk whilst on leave. In some instances, these staff felt obliged to attend meetings about their future at the studio whilst on holiday, even if they were away in different timezones.</p>
<p>"Management seemed very keen to wrap up the process quickly, and despite saying that they were fully open to suggestions and feedback, none of it has been taken on board," said one source.</p>
<p>Whilst unconfirmed, it's thought around 20 people have been impacted by the cuts, bringing the estimated<a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025"> number of developers who have lost their jobs across the games industry</a> to around 900 in 2025 alone.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"There are people - whether it's their libraries are on PlayStation or Nintendo, whether it's that they like the controller better, they just like the games that are there - and I don't want to then look at that and say 'well, there's no way that we should be able to build a business there, [or] find fans of our franchises there'.</p>
<p>"I'm not trying to move them all over to Xbox anymore. We're all so invested in where our games are, let's just allow more people to play. And yes, the 70 percent that we make on games on other platforms is helpful to us being able to build great portfolios, like we showed at Developer Direct, and I hope this will continue to show through the rest of the year."</p>
<p>That said, Spencer was pragmatic enough to admit that position may change, not least because yes, he would very much prefer to be making "all of the money for all the games that [Xbox] ship[s] right now".</p>
<p>That doesn't mean Xbox is about to give up its hardware endeavours, however.</p>
<p>"Obviously we make more on our own platform, it's one of the reasons that investing in our own platform is important," he added.</p>
<p>Spencer's comments follow a recent interview in which he was asked if like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-says-brands-identity-is-evolving-in-response-to-fan-concerns-over-multiplatform-future">continue to have an "exclusivity window" on Xbox systems</a>. He replied with a strikingly simple: "No."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Fairgame$ - the heist shooter from Jade Raymond's new studio, Haven - has allegedly been delayed.</p>
<p>Whilst we don't know much about the live-service game other than it was expected later this year and is in development for PC and PlayStation 5, Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb revealed during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72WmrtMEfm8">Game Mess Decides</a> podcast that the release had slipped to 2026.</p>

<p>Grubb didn't offer any explanations as to why the project may have fallen behind schedule, but said it was unlikely to make an appearance "this year".</p>
<p>"No Fairgame$ this year," Grubb said, "Fairgame$, as far as I’m aware, has been pushed to 2026."</p>
<p>Back in February 2022, Sony stated it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">aimed to launch over 10 new live service games</a> over the coming years. A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-exec-jim-ryan-believes-live-service-games-will-dominate-over-subscriptions">then-Sony exec Jim Ryan said he believed live service games were a key part of gaming's future</a>, confident in PlayStation's live service push.</p>
<p>However, since then, the company has been pulling back on this vision, with several proposed projects cancelled, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">including two just last month</a>, thought to be one from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> developer Bend and one from Bluepoint.</p>
<p>Despite being in development for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-was-in-development-for-roughly-eight-years-firewalk-dev-confirms">for eight years</a>, Sony's 5v5 sci-fi shooter Concord was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">taken offline just two weeks after its PC and PS5 debut</a> last year, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-sales-fail-to-lift-off-on-steam-where-just-660-people-played-at-launch">lackluster launch and weak sales</a>.</p>
<p>Numerous other live service games have also been cancelled by Sony, including London Studio's co-op game, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">the studio also shut down last year</a>. In 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">Naughty Dog cancelled its standalone multiplayer game set in the world of The Last of Us</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-studio-firesprite-has-been-shedding-talent-amidst-accusations-of-toxic-culture-staff-say">live service Twisted Metal project at Firespite was similarly cancelled</a> along with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/footage-of-insomniacs-seemingly-canceled-live-service-spider-man-the-great-web-appears-online">co-operative live service Spider-Man game from developer Insomniac</a> entitled Spider-Man: The Great Web.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Sony for comment and will update as and when we hear back.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
