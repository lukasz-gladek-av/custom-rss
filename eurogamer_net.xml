            <p>Cult hit Euro Truck Simulator 2 is seemingly coming to PS5 and Xbox consoles. The news comes via PSN and Xbox store listings for the game, which is yet to be officially announced for the two consoles.</p>
<p>No release date is on the store listings, but we can probably expect that news soon, presumably tied to an announcement over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> this week. SCS SOFTWARE had a big hit with Euro Truck Simulator 2 on PC, which as of 2024 had sold<a href="https://www.scssoft.com/press/"> in excess of 15 million copies</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/euro-truck-simulator-2/9nlvc6stps52">Euro Truck Simulator 2 on Xbox</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10009049/">Euro Truck Simulator 2 on PS5</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><em>Travel across Europe as king of the road, a trucker who delivers important cargo across impressive distances!

        <p>You only have two weeks to play a superb co-op RPG and some less superb kids games.</p>

            <p>Every month Xbox gives and and it takes. While we get new games added to Xbox Game Pass throughout each month, in the middle and the end of the month we also see a bunch of games leave the service.</p>
<p>At the end of August the following games will leave Game Pass according to the recently updated Xbox App:</p>
<ul>
<li>Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition</li>
<li>Sea of Stars</li>
<li>Paw Patrol Mighty Pups Save Adventure Bay</li>
<li>This War of Mine: Final Cut</li>
<li>Ben 10: Power Trip</li>
</ul>
<p>Of those games, there are a couple of standouts that you should try to play before they leave Game Pass.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-stars">Sea of Stars</a> is a three-player co-op turn-based RPG that Eurogamer awarded 4 stars in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-stars-review">Sea of Stars review</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/this-war-of-mine">This War of Mine</a>: Final Cut is the game 11 bit made before going on to create <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> and The Alters.</p>
<blockquote><p>In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-3-review-bigger-better-and-even-more-polarising-than-ever-before">Borderlands 3</a> Ultimate Edition has its fans (not everyone enjoyed what Gearbox did with the third game in the series), and you might want to give it a whirl ahead of Borderlands 4 releasing in September.</p>
