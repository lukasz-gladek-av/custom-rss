Nintendo has pushed back at suggestions <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-switch-2-actually-cheaper-than-the-original-console-cost-in-the-uk-and-whats-the-situation-with-switch-2-pricing-globally">Switch 2's price</a> - which has already left some fans reeling - was influenced by early US trade tariffs. But it admits the latest round of tariffs introduced by US president Trump last week are "something we're going to have to address".
</p>
<p>
When Nintendo unveiled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> last week, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-treehouse-live-viewers-have-very-clear-message-for-nintendo">response to the console's price was swift and unhappy</a>, particularly in the US, where it's set to retail for $450 USD. At the time, many speculated the comparatively hefty price tag - it's the most expensive Nintendo console to date - might have been reached in response to early tariffs imposed by the US.
</p>
<p>
However, when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/643277/nintendo-switch-2-price-tariffs-doug-bowser-interview">The Verge</a> asked <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> boss Doug Bowser how the company had settled on Switch 2's price, he pointed to the console's new and redesigned features, ranging from its bigger LCD screen to reworked Joy-Con controllers. "We want to make sure that this is a device that is approachable, that consumers will see as part of their overall entertainment experiences and will understand that it has longevity to it," Bowser explained. "And all of those factors really go into the consideration of the price."

<p>
"Put [the 2nd April tariff announcement] aside," Bowser added. "Any previous tariffs were not factored into the price itself." He noted the company's move "to diversify the places where we're manufacturing our hardware and our accessories" - namely shifting away from China to Vietnam and Cambodia - had enabled it to get ahead of "the early stages of tariffs". However, he admitted the Trump administration's latest round of tariffs - which include 46 percent levies on Vietnam and 49 percent on Cambodia - are more problematic.
</p>
<p>
"It creates a challenge," he <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nintendo-is-actively-assessing-what-trade-war-means-for-switch-2/">told Wired</a>. "It's something we're going to have to address." Bowser also reiterated Nintendo is "actively assessing" the situation and the impact it's likely to have. That mirrors Nintendo's statement last week, when the company took the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">unprecedented decision to indefinitely delay US preorders for Switch</a>, just hours after announcing they'd begin on 9th April. At the time, it said preorders would be delayed "in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions", but noted the console would still launch on 5th June. Whether it might now release at a higher price in the US remains to be seen.
</p>
<p>
"The reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Japan have come in higher than expected," industry analyst Daniel Ahmad recently noted of the situation, "and Nintendo will feel the impact of this if the tariffs go into full effect." Nintendo isn't the only games company likely to be affected by Trump's tariffs, however. Last week, the The Entertainment Software Association (ESA), which represents all major gaming companies in the US, said the tariffs - which have already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-tariffs-cause-nintendo-and-sony-stock-to-plunge">caused stock in Nintendo and Sony to plunge</a> - will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-tariffs-will-have-a-real-and-detrimental-impact-on-games-industry-says-us-trade-group">"have a real and detrimental impact" on the games industry</a>. "Any one product that a consumer would buy is likely to be subject to many of the tariffs announced," it explained, "all compounded on top of one another."
</p>
<p>
While it's yet to be determined how tariffs will ultimately impact Switch 2's US release, preorders will go ahead elsewhere in the world as planned. Many UK retailers have seemingly already exhausted their initial stock, but Nintendo's own preorders go live in the UK on 8th April - but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-pre-orders-will-prioritise-players-with-the-most-switch-playtime">invites are being determined based on a strict and rather convoluted set of rules</a>.

Last week's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> reveal might have had its exciting bits but it also brought its share of controversy too. There was the cost of the console itself, the cost of its games, or the perhaps surprising decision to charge owners for Switch 2's Welcome Tour tutorial game instead of including it for free - a decision <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a>'s Bill Trinen has now addressed, saying the newly confirmed $10 USD price reflects the "amount of care and work" put into it.
</p>
<p>
Welcome Tour was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">unveiled during last week's Switch 2 reveal</a>, and is described as an "interactive exhibit" offering "lots of insights about the console" through "tech demos, minigames and other interactions". As presented during Nintendo's showcase, however, it looked very much a tutorial, walking players through the fundamental features of their new console purchase - so it came as something as a surprise when Nintendo revealed it wasn't a free pack-in (unlike, say, PS5's similar Astro's Playroom) but a paid digital purchase.
</p>
<p>
Now, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-tutorial-game-welcome-tour-costs-10-nintendo-explains-why-its-not-a-free-console-pack-in">speaking to IGN</a>, Nintendo of America's vice president of product and player experience, Bill Trinen, has confirmed exactly how much Welcome Tour will cost, saying its newly announced $9.99 USD price tag "is not an exorbitant" one. As to why Nintendo has opted to charge Switch 2 owners extra to learn how to use their £396 console, Trinen described Welcome Tour as an "interesting product" that's more than a "quick intro" to Switch 2.

"It's a pretty robust piece of software. There's a lot of great detail in there," he explained. "I think there are people who are particularly interested in the tech and the specs of the system and things like that, for them I think it's going to be a great product. It's really for people that want more information about the system rather than necessarily a quick intro to everything it does. And for that reason, and just the amount of care and work that the team put into it, I think it was decided that, 'Yeah, this feels like $9.99 is not an exorbitant price. It feels like a good value for what you're getting out of the product.'"
</p>
<p>
Value has been on everyone's mind following Nintendo's Switch 2 reveal, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-treehouse-live-viewers-have-very-clear-message-for-nintendo">console's £396/$450 price tag having already seen pushback from fans</a>. There've been similar cost concerns around the $80 USD price of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> - which Nintendo of American boss Doug Bowser has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">since insisted reflects the "breadth and depth of the gameplay"</a> - even the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-will-have-paid-upgrades-for-certain-switch-games-bringing-enhanced-frame-rates-and-more">price of its paid Switch 2 Edition upgrades</a>. That doesn't appear to have dissuaded punters from pre-ordering the console, however, with Switch 2 already sold out at many retailers. Nintendo's official pre-order schemed launches this Thursday, 10th April, for most of the world - apart from in the US, where <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">pre-orders have been delayed indefinitely</a> due to last week's Trump tariffs.
</p>
<p>
As for Switch 2 itself, Eurogamer's Tom Phillips <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-reveals-a-proper-generational-upgrade-though-its-biggest-new-idea-remains-unproven">went hands-on last week</a>, calling it a "proper generational upgrade", and describing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">Mario Kart World as its "killer app"</a>.
