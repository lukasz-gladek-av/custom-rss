            <p>Splitgate 2 developer 1047 Games has laid off a "small group of valued staff".</p>
<p>In a statement posted to <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/06/21/1047-games-developers-of-splitgate-2-layoff-a-small-group-of-valued-staff/">LinkedIn</a>, the studio said that while it continues to "perfect" Splitgate 2, it was "redirecting resources to build the best game for our players". It did not clarify just how many developers were impacted, but co-founders Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian will reportedly not be drawing salaries as the team "locks in to deliver the next phase of the project".</p>

<p>"Today we parted ways with a small group of valued 1047 Games team members. We're still perfecting the Splitgate 2 gameplay experience in response to community feedback, and we are redirecting resources to build the best game for our players," the statement said (thanks, <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/06/21/1047-games-developers-of-splitgate-2-layoff-a-small-group-of-valued-staff/">XboxEra</a>).</p>
<p>"We are sad to see our teammates go, and we are actively working to help them secure new opportunities. Further, our co-founders Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian have opted not to take salaries as we lock in to deliver the next phase of the project. Thank you to those who've built alongside us â€” we are sad to say goodbye and would not be here without you.</p>
<p>"To everyone who's playing Splitgate 2, we're continuing to work hard to deliver more things we know you'll love. We are committed to building this game for the long haul."</p>
<p>It's been a tumultuous time for 1047. Last week, Proulx apologised for causing "division in the community" following his controversial Summer Game Fest appearance, in which he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-director-apologises-for-causing-division-following-controversial-summer-game-fest-appearance">wore a MAGA-style "Make FPS Great Again" hat while onstage</a> just days after the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-slashes-145-cosmetic-bundle-price-following-fan-backlash">apologised for a $145 cosmetic</a>, slashing the cost to $40 and refunding the difference for those that had already purchased it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-developer-1047-games-lays-off-small-group-of-valued-staff]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It's already been a lengthy journey for developer Toby Fox's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/undertale">Undertale</a> follow-up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a>. The first of its seven planned chapters originally launched in 2018, and there are still three more to go - but we now know fans won't have too long to wait until the saga continues. According to the most recently released chapter's closing credits, part five will arrive next year.
</p>
<p>
Deltarune, which charts the adventures of human teenager Kris and their lizard friend Suzie in the mystery Dark World, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-creator-says-the-rest-of-deltarune-has-not-been-made-yet">debuted as a free download in 2018</a>, and a second instalment <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-chapter-2-arrives-this-week-on-pc">showed up in September 2021</a>. It's taken nearly four years for Fox and his team to get Chapters 3 + 4 wrapped up since then (both finally made their long-awaited debut <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-available-on-switch-1-and-2-through-cross-buy-when-it-launches-with-new-nintendo-console">alongside Switch 2's launch</a> earlier this month), but part five, thankfully, won't require so much patience from fans.
</p>
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapter-5-will-release-in-2026">IGN</a>, the closing credits of Deltarune's recently released fourth chapter conclude with the words, "To be continued in Chapter 5, 2026." That's still a fair way out, then, but at least we now know it won't be another four-year wait for more.

<p>
This isn't quite what Fox originally had in mind, of course; back in 2021 he said the goal was for Deltarune's third, fourth, and fifth chapters to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-creator-working-on-deltarune-chapters-3-to-5">all launch at the same time</a>, but he eventually conceded five was still some way off, and that he wouldn't deprive fans of their Deltarune fix purely to adhere to a simultaneous launch. "I don't think anybody really wants to wait that long to release anything," Fox explained at the time. "Especially me."
</p>
<p>
But while Chapter five is, comparatively speaking, right around the corner (assuming it's a corner at the end of a hallway that takes at least six months to walk down), we've had no indication of how long Deltarune's final two chapters might take to release. For all we know, the world will be orbiting a dying sun by the time Fox is ready to wrap things up in part seven, but at least Deltarune's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-is-a-game-about-playing-and-its-bloody-brilliant">already a good time</a>, even if it <em>is</em> some way from tying up all its loose ends.
