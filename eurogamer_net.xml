            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s promised duo mode is finally on the way, and will be added to the game next week.</p>
<p>From 30th July, a two-player mode will be available in patch 1.02, alongside some UI improvements and more Relics filtering options.</p>
<p>The mode was announced in a new trailer, which you can see below.</p>

<p>Despite being primarily a three-player co-operative game, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> spin-off has been criticised by players - in part because the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/should-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-solo">included solo play was too tough</a>, and in part because a two-player option wasn't included.</p>
<p>Previous patches have re-balanced the solo mode, while a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">two-player mode was promised at the start of June</a>. Now it's finally on the way.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-has-sold-over-5-million-copies-while-shadow-the-the-erdtree-makes-it-past-10-million-at-last">FromSoftware announced Elden Ring Nightreign has sold over 5m copies</a> since its release at the end of May.</p>
<p>Further, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree has sold 10m copies, meaning around a third of players have dived into the expansion.</p>
<p>FromSoftware has continued to update Nightreign with the rotating Everdark Sovereigns. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-round-of-everdark-sovereigns-will-arrive-at-the-end-of-the-month-but-still-no-sign-of-duo-mode">next batch of these extra challenging Nightlords will arrive on 31st July</a> - good luck fighting them in pairs!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-duo-mode-is-finally-on-the-way-with-release-date-confirmed]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-the-beast-delayed-for-further-polish.1253265/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>With just a month to go before the game's planned release, the Dying Light: The Beast team has announced a delay.</p>
<p>"It has always been our goal to make Dying Light: The Beast the best Dying Light game we've ever released," <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-moves">Techland wrote in an update</a>, stating that to "honour" this promise it would be delaying the release until 19th September. This will allow the team to add some extra polish before the zombie shooter gets released into the wild.</p>
<p>"We've been carefully listening to what you've been saying - whether through playtests, the recent preview coverage and in comments," the Dying Light: The Beast developer continued. "With just four additional weeks, we can address final details that make all the difference between good and great."</p>
<p>This extra time will see Techland making some adjustments to cutscene and player animations, as well as finetuning the balance of gameplay elements. It also aims to make the game's UI clearer.</p>
<p>"We know this might be disappointing to some fans, and we understand," Techaland said "Dying Light: The Beast is the culmination of everything we've learned in more than a decade of the series, and this experience has shown us how important the first impression is."</p>
<p>We got our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-is-a-new-18-hour-standalone-game-that-began-life-as-dlc">first look at Dying Light: The Beast during Gamescom last year</a>, when Techland revealed this release initially started out as DLC. "But after two years of work, its size and scope has changed so much that it evolved into a standalone, self-contained experience," the studio wrote at the time. "To show appreciation for the community who patiently waited for the DLC, Techland will be offering Dying Light: The Beast at no extra cost to all owners of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dying-light-2-stay-human">Dying Light 2 Stay Human</a> Ultimate Edition, delivering a full standalone adventure instead of just a DLC."</p>
<p>Then, last month, the studio announced an August release date (which has obviously now changed). At this time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-is-coming-out-on-25-august-revealed-at-summer-game-fest">Techland also released a new trailer</a>, featuring new gameplay, along with a variety of chases and parkour - a key feature in Dying Light games.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-studio-techland-cancels-two-in-development-games-clarifies-no-staff-reductions">it was reported Techland had cancelled two in-development games</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-delayed-for-further-polish]]></content:encoded>

            <p>He plays Mister Fantastic in The Fantastic Four: First Steps, but can Pedro Pascal actually <em>play </em>Mister Fantastic? Well, when it comes to Marvel Rivals, no not really.</p>
<p>The cast of Fantastic Four: First Steps recently got to take their Marvel Rival's counterparts out for a spin. Joining Pascal was Vanessa Kirby (Sue Storm/Invisible Woman), Ebon Moss-Bachrach (Ben Grimm/The Thing) and Joseph Quinn (Human Torch), who all played NetEase's shooter with YouTuber LoserFruit.</p>
<p>It is fair to say though, that none of the actors were especially skilled when it came to negotiating the controls, with Pascal looking very much out of his depth (at one point he asks if there are "console classes" people could take part in).</p>

<p>But, one moment from this entire Marvel Rival's experience that has particularly captured attention, though, is the cast's reaction to Invisible Woman's Malice skin, which leaves very little to the imagination. "Thank you," Kirby immediately reacts with a snap of the fingers. "This is my favourite bit of her as well." She then makes allusions to a yet-to-be-greenlit sequel.</p>
<p>Her three companions, though, well they all looked rather surprised by the scantily clad image presented to them on the screen, which sees Sue dressed in what looks like quite a skimpy bikini bottom complete with a spikely-adorned top half. 

Pascal soon regained some composure, and simply said: "Costume designer, take note."

</p><p>This clip was shared by the Marvel Rivals social media account, and the cast's reaction has since gone somewhat viral. So, what do you think about Pascal and co's gaming endeavours?</p> <div>

<p>Back in February, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">Marvel Rivals had amassed over 40 million players since its launch</a>. Despite this success, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">laid off an unspecified number of the Marvel Rivals development team</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>Following this, the Marvel Rivals publisher said the layoffs were a "difficult decision" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-publisher-netease-responds-to-shocking-layoffs-claims-they-were-to-optimise-development-efficiency">made to "optimise development efficiency" for the game</a>.</p>

            <p>Cailee Spaeny is reportedly in talks to star in the forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> film adaptation.</p>
<p>The casting scoop comes from <a href="https://www.theinsneider.com/p/cailee-spaeny-elden-ring-movie-cast-alex-garland-a24-booster-gold-writer-dc-studios-hbo-max">Jeff Sneider</a>, who reported Spaeny will reunite with director Alex Garland after starring in his 2024 film, Civil War.</p>
<p>Spaeny also starred in Alien: Romulus last year, in the lead role of Rain Carradine. Her voice and likeness as Rain were also used in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> as a purchasable skin for Ellen Ripley. Prior to that, in 2023 she played the lead role in Priscilla, Sofia Coppola's biopic on Priscilla Presley.</p>

<p>So who might Spaeny be playing in the Elden Ring film adaptation?</p>
<p>We don't know yet what the plot will focus on and which characters will be included. A safe bet would be Melina, who acts as the Tarnished's maiden along their journey.</p>
<p>Other options include Ranni the Witch, Malenia, or perhaps even a female Tarnished.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-live-action-film-officially-in-development">Elden Ring live-action film was announced back in May</a>, with Garland as writer and director. Garland is also known for Ex Machina and Warfare.</p>
<p>Heartstopper star Kit Connor is also said to star in the film, after featuring in Warfare.</p>
<p>Film production company A24 and game publisher Bandai Namco are both behind the project, though it's unclear if FromSoftware or the game's creator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a> are also involved.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-has-sold-over-5-million-copies-while-shadow-the-the-erdtree-makes-it-past-10-million-at-last">Elden Ring team announced its co-op spin-off Nightreign had passed 5m copies sold</a>, while DLC <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> has now soared past 10m downloads.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/alien-romulus-star-reportedly-in-talks-for-elden-ring-film-role]]></content:encoded>
