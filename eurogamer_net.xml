            <p>Ubisoft has revised its <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/uk/units-discount">loyalty program</a>, allowing players to "exchange units on a wider selection of products".</p>
<p>In an email sent out to players subscribed to the loyalty scheme and seen by Eurogamer, Ubisoft announced that effective immediately, the units collected by players "will now also apply to pre-order and new release purchases made on the Ubisoft store", with 100 units equating to a 20 percent discount.</p>

<p>As well as 20 percent discount on games and DLC for every 100 units - you get one unit for every $/Â£1 spent - you can also get "exclusive" in-game content and rewards, like legendary weapons, character skins, emotes, and consumables.</p>
<p>If you're interested in signing up, don't forget that new Ubisoft accounts start with 100 units, which is enough for a 20% discount on your first Ubisoft Store purchase.</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-discussing-buyout-options-with-tencent">Ubisoft is continuing its talks with Chinese giant Tencent</a> over a possible buyout deal that would take the Assassin's Creed maker private.</p>
<p>The move - first mooted last month - would see Ubisoft take back control of its company from shareholders, and yesterday, Reuters reported that Ubisoft is seeking a deal which would see its French founders, the Guillemot family, retain control. However, the same report states that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> - Ubisoft's second-largest shareholder with ownership of nearly 10 percent of the company - is keen for a greater role and input on future board decisions.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Former Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra has slammed Marvel Rivals, intimating its an <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> clone.</p>
<p>In a now-deleted tweet posted yesterday, Ybarra called NetEase Games' free-to-play team-based PVP shooter "Overwatch Marvel Rivals", adding that much like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencents-horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-also-coming-to-ps5-of-all-platforms">Light of Motiram</a> is "a clear copy of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>", Marvel Rivals clearly took inspiration from Blizzard's own team-based PVP shooter, Overwatch.</p>

<p>"Looks like Overwatch Marvel Rivals ships tomorrow," Ybarra wrote in the now-deleted tweet. "Much like Light of Motiram (a clear copy of [Horizon Zero Dawn]) out of China.</p>
<p>"I mean, even the character name - Windowmaker in [Overwatch] vs. Black Widow in Marvel Rivals lol - NetEase/Tencent - all the same."</p> <div>

<p>Before Ybarra deleted the post, however, a community note appended to the tweet said: "Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, is a popular Marvel hero who made her comic debut in 1964, more than 50 years before Overwatch and Widowmaker were created."</p><p>Marvel Rivals finally released in full yesterday on 6th December 2024. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/free-to-play-hero-shooter-marvel-rivals-off-to-heroic-start-on-steam">Getting off to a heroic start on Steam</a>, it managed to already reach a peak concurrent player count of 444,286 over on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/">Valve's platform</a>, with this number likely rising further again over the weekend.</p>
<p>The game itself is described as a "thrilling, fast-paced, cooperative gameplay experience", and one which on its announcement head of Marvel Games Jay Ong called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-is-a-free-to-play-pvp-shooter-where-heroes-and-villains-fight-together-and-against-each-other">one of the team's "most ambitious game development projects"</a>, and one the developer has "poured [its] heart and soul into".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Good news, PokÃ©mon fans - PokÃ©mon TV is back.</p>
<p>PokÃ©mon TV, the app and website that let you watch episodes from the long-running PokÃ©mon anime for free, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tv-app-axed-leaving-episodes-scattered-between-paid-streaming-services">was removed from app stores earlier this year</a>, but now it's returned, albeit in a new home on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OfficialPoke%CC%81monTV">YouTube</a> and with a truncated library.</p>

<p>"Welcome to the official PokÃ©mon TV YouTube channel, where you can explore the world of PokÃ©mon with Ash &amp; Pikachu!" announces the channel description. "Experience some of the most iconic moments from their adventure with our full episodes, live streams, compilations, and so much more!"</p>
<p>Right now only nine episodes from the first season are available, but the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRcHmntfmJ8CnSmj4C284-a1euH518aQa">playlist itself</a> seemingly contains another 16 unpublished videos, so it looks like more episodes are on the way.</p>
<p>The app's removal in March was especially upsetting given after that point, PokÃ©fans were unable to follow the saga of Ash Ketchum - and beyond - without needing to subscribe to a streaming service.</p>
<p>Now, however, it looks as though PokÃ©mon has found a new home where fans can once again follow Ash for free.</p>
<p>In related PokÃ©mon news, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-reportedly-surpassed-200m-in-first-month">PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game Pocket is thought to have raked in over $200m during its first month of launch</a>.</p>
<p>The mobile card game managed to reach $208m in gross revenue on 29th November. That's roughly Â£164m for those of us here in the UK, with that figure being across both the App Store and Google Play. The report also said <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">PokÃ©mon TCG Pocket</a>'s average daily player spending was $6.5m during its first month.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
