            <p>When the second season of The Last of Us airs this April, viewers will be introduced to the character of Abby.</p>
<p>Those who know the games will be aware of the conversation around this character, with some already expressing concern about the toxicity actress Kaitlyn Dever will likely receive through proxy of playing Abby. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/abby-actress-kaitlyn-dever-protected-by-extra-security-while-filming-the-last-of-us-season-two">Dever required extra security on set because of the role</a>.</p>
<p>But, while Dever has admitted it's "hard not to see those things on the internet", she has worked to "do this character justice" in The Last of Us' second season.</p>

<p>When asked by <a href="https://screenrant.com/last-us-season-2-abby-backlash-kaitlyn-dever-response/">ScreenRant</a> if she pays attention to how people anticipate a character such as The Last of Us Part 2's Abby, Dever replied:</p>
<p>"Well, it's hard not to see those things on the internet. It's hard not to stop myself from looking at it every once in a while, especially going into this, for sure. And I want to do this character justice and make the fans proud by bringing her to life in this kind of way."</p>
<p>"But my main focus was just the collaboration between Neil [Druckmann] and Craig [Mazin], and making sure I was really getting to the core of who she is and what drives her and her emotional state; her anger and her frustration and her grief and all of that.</p>
<p>"I wanted to make sure that that was what I was focusing most of my energy on."</p>

            <p>In just 48 hours, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> has sold an impressive 1m units.</p>
<p>Developer Hazelight celebrated today's milestone on social media.</p>
<p>"The love you all show for our game is overwhelming," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hazelightgames.bsky.social/post/3ljztto3sws2v">it wrote on Bluesky</a>. "Everyone here at Hazelight are beyond happy - and we can't stop enjoying your amazing reactions!"</p>

<p>Again, these are all sales. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-isnt-included-in-eas-play-subscription-at-launch">Split Fiction isn't currently included in the EA Play subscription</a>, nor is it on Game Pass or PS Plus. It's also worth noting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fictions-free-copy-offer-includes-crossplay-on-all-platforms-a-first-for-it-takes-two-developer">Split Fiction includes crossplay for the first time across all platforms</a> via the Friend's Pass function.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Split Fiction has had a great debut. Along with scores of praise across the industry, Hazellight's latest co-op caper currently boasts a peak concurrent player number of 259,003 on Steam.</p>
<p>To compare, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a>'s all time concurrent player peak is 71,039, which it reached three months ago as anticipation for Split Fiction grew. In October last year, Hazelight announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marital-platformer-it-takes-two-sales-pass-20m">It Takes Two had sold over 20m copies</a> since its own debut in 2021. That number will no doubt be even higher now. </p>
<p>A film adaptation of It Takes Two was also said to be in the works, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-josef-fares-doesnt-know-whats-happening-with-the-it-takes-two-film-adaptation">even Hazelight founder Josef Fares isn't sure what's happening with that right now</a>. </p>

<p>But, I digress! Back to the here and now. We awarded Split Fiction five stars on its release last week.</p>
<p>"Fantastic from start to finish, Split Fiction is one of the most inventive and joyful co-op games to date, and a testament to the power of human imagination," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">Eurogamer's Split Fiction review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Here's everything included in today's free content update for Control Ultimate Edition, as laid out by Remedy.</p>
<p><strong>OUTFITS</strong></p>

<li>Extradimensional Suit (formerly obtainable in the AWE DLC by finishing SHÜM)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MISSIONS</strong></p>
<p>All players will receive the mission Dr. Yoshimi Tokui's Guided Imagery Experience, featuring voiceover by Hideo Kojima. The mission is playable when you pick up the Dr Tokui Tapes collectible in the Extrasensory Lab of the Research Sector. (This mission was previously exclusive to the PlayStation 4 Digital Deluxe version of Control.)</p>
<p><strong>GRAPHICS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added HDR support</li>
<li>Added new Ultra ray tracing preset, which gets you more rays per pixel and higher temporal stability</li>
<li>Added ultrawide monitor support for up to 48:9 monitors</li>
<li>Added an FOV scaling setting for the gameplay camera</li>
<li>Updated SDR to 10bit (from 8bit), which reduces visible color banding</li>
<li>Improved graphics adapter detection at startup, with automatic selection between DX11 and DX12</li>
<li>Implemented screen aspect ratio fixes for ultrawide monitors</li>
<li>Your current monitor resolution can now reliably be selected from the screen resolution and rendering resolution menus</li>
<li>Added rendering resolution support beyond 4K</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>DLSS SUPPORT</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>Updated DLSS to DLSS 3.7, with higher temporal stability</li>
<li>Film grain added back to DLSS SR</li>
<li>Fixed shadow resolution when DLSS is enabled</li>
<li>Added resolution dependent mip map bias for DLSS. This enhances texture quality, for example when applying the DLSS Performance setting.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GENERAL</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated the audio on cinematics and end credits to remove unintended channel mixing. You will no longer hear anything that isn't intended to be heard. (It wasn't the Hiss, it was us. Sorry.)</li>
<li>Several bug and crash fixes</li>
</ul>

<p>As for what's next for Remedy and its Control series, the world is set to expand this year with the developer's multiplayer release, FBC: Firebreak.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-control-developer-remedy-reveals-first-ever-multiplayer-game">FBC: Firebreak is scheduled to release later this year</a>, across PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, Xbox Series X S and PlayStation 5. It will also be available across PC Game Pass and Game Pass Ultimate, as well as day one onto the PlayStation Plus Game Catalogue, which is available for all Extra and Premium members.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-2-tease-lies-in-alan-wake-2s-lake-house-dlc-fans-say">Alan Wake 2's Lake House expansion last year provided what looks to be an intriguing tease for where Control 2's story is headed</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
