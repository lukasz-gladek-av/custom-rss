            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is living up to its name, with some truly wild player numbers following its debut.</p>
<p>The next installment in Capcom's Monster Hunter series went live earlier today (28th February) and quickly surpassed Monster Hunter World's all-time player peak on Steam.</p>

<p>At the time of writing and according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2246340/charts/">SteamDB</a>, there are 933,446 Monster Hunter Wilds players on Valve's platform. It currently has an all time player peak of 987,482, although it seems likely it will smash past this number over the weekend. This makes Wilds one of the most-played games on Steam, surpassing peak player numbers for the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and even <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>.</p>
<p>To compare further, Monster Hunter World has an all-time player peak of 334,684, meaning Wilds has almost tripled the former's peak player numbers in less than a day. Are you one of them?</p>

<p>Just yesterday, Capcom gave us all a little teaser for what lies in store for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-first-content-update-brings-a-new-level-of-challenge-in-april">Monster Hunter Wilds' first post-launch content update</a>, which is now confirmed to be launching some time in "early April". This update will include a "new level of challenge" for players.</p>
<p>But, as for what players can expect in the here and now, well it sounds like quite a rather good ol' time. In fact, our Matt recently awarded the game four out of five stars, calling Wilds the "most exhilarating and refined Monster Hunter" to date.</p>
<p>"Wilds remains an exhilarating piece of work - so refined, so alive, so giddily, chaotically joyful when it all comes together that it feels like the ultimate culmination of everything the series has been working toward over the last two decades," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Eurogamer's Monster Hunter Wilds review</a>.</p>
<p>If you are planning on making your way into the wilds of Wilds this weekend, but need a little point in the right direction, be sure to check out our guides coverage. Here's one on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-to-save-autosave-monster-hunter-wilds">how to save in Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and another on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-to-upgrade-weapons-monster-hunter-wilds">how to upgrade weapons in Monster Hunter Wilds</a> to get you started.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
