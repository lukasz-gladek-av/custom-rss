            <p>
Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time has had an unexpectedly strong start for a sequel to a fairly obscure 13-year Nintendo DS game. And developer Level 5 has now thanked fans for their enthusiasm, pledging to release free DLC in response to "popular demand".
</p>
<p>
The Girl Who Steals Time, for context, is a sequel to Level 5's Fantasy Life - a sort of job-focussed mash-mash of life sim and RPG - which enjoyed modest critical and commercial success when it launched for Nintendo DS back in 2012. Eurogamer's celebrated its "abundance of features" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fantasy-life-review">our 6/10 review</a> at the time, but noted the result was often "less than the sum of its parts".
</p>
<p>
But in this post-Stardew Valley world - where you can't watch an indie showcase without seeing a dozen new village sims jostling for attention - the newly released Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals seems to resonated with audiences. It's garnered a positive early critical reception and even surpassed 45K concurrents on its first day on Steam (that's more than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> managed) - and Level 5 is now celebrating its launch with news of more to come.

"In response to the positive reception from players around the world," it <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/topics/250523_01/">wrote in a message on its website</a> (via Google Translate), "we have decided to release free DLC that will 'update the world'... so that players can continue to enjoy the game for a long time to come."
</p>
<p>
Level 5 hasn't shared much in the way of specifics, but there's talk of new recipes and "high-rarity weapons" that can be acquired though dungeons and "other methods". The studio says it's working to release the DLC "as soon as possible", and will share more details at a later date. And it sounds like there's more on the way; "We plan to continue updating the game," it adds, "so that you can enjoy the world of Fantasy Life i for longer and more comfortably." 
</p>
<p>
Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is available now on Steam, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and Switch, with a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> version coming later this year.
