            <p>
A sequel to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> could be on the cards if the forthcoming remake sells well, its director has teased.
</p>
<p>
The PS1 tactical RPG was first released in 1997, and while it established the world of Ivalice that reappeared in subsequent games, it never received a direct sequel. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> also released the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-tactics-advance">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a> games on GBA and DS, though the second of these was back in 2007.
</p>
<p>
"If The Ivalice Chronicles can do well, that's good for the fans, they can enjoy it. But, at the same time, it shows the business viability of the strategy RPG genre," Kazutoyo Maehiro, director of the remake told <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-maehiro-minagaintewa-interview-sequel-advance">Inverse</a>. "So that could potentially open the door for doing something with Final Fantasy Tactics Advance or A2, or maybe even sequels and new titles as well. I think I speak for everyone who's worked on the original Final Fantasy Tactics, and is working on The Ivalice Chronicles as well - we'd really like to see that happen."

<p>
Final Fantasy Tactics is one of the most beloved entries in the series, praised for its mature, political storytelling. Fans have long-wanted a new Tactics game, with this remake being rumoured for years.
</p>
<p>
Maehiro also commented on the popularity of the genre overall, alluding to other recent turn-based games.
</p>
<p>
"Of course, with the different hardware advances that have come, we see a lot more action games," he said. "But I think, at the same time, that doesn't really mean turn-based or strategy games went away. They've advanced with the hardware advances. I know we have titles that might start with P or have 33 in them, and fans really enjoy these games.
</p>
<p>
"But strategy RPGs are opportunities where people need to be able to think and strategise to excel at these games. And people do enjoy them overall - so these games have a place."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson recently went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-difficulty-tweaks-new-features-preserving-a-seminal-magic">hands-on with Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a>, and discussed with the developers the need for a remake.
</p>
<p>
"Obviously, this game came out 28 years ago," said co-director Ayako Yokoyama. "But the story is amazing, and I think that's something we want people to experience. At the same time it is a strategy RPG, and maybe for more casual players that's a little bit of a hurdle. It can even be hard for people who aren't used to that type of game, but do like story-based RPGs."
</p>
<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles releases on 30th September across Xbox, PlayStation, Switch consoles, and PC (Steam).</p>

            <p><a href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> studio MachineGames may right now have its focus on the whip-wielding professor, but it hasn't forgotten its Wolfenstein heritage. In fact, in the words of studio head Jerk Gustafsson, the team would like to work on a New Colossus sequel.</p>
<p>As part of a recent 'The Making of Wolfenstein' documentary by Noclip, Gustafsson said MachineGames had always pictured a trilogy of Wolfenstein games to wrap up the story of BJ, or to give him his proper title - Terror-Billy, the scourge of the Nazi empire.</p>

<p>"That journey for BJ, even during those first weeks at id, when we mapped out New Order, we still had the plan for at least [BJ], what would happen in the second one and what would happen in the third one," the developer said (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/after-indiana-jones-it-sounds-like-machinegames-is-ready-to-make-another-wolfenstein-game-we-have-always-seen-this-as-a-trilogy/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>"I think that's important to say, because - at least I hope - we're not done with Wolfenstein yet.</p>
<p>"We have a story to tell."</p>
<p>Is this something you would hope to see realised? You can check out the full Noclip video about the making of Wolfenstein below.</p>

            <p>Bethesda has hidden a secret message in a social media post ostensibly marking <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>'s second anniversary.</p>
<p>It's only 12 seconds long, and starts pretty much as you'd expect, but halfway through the <a href="https://x.com/StarfieldGame/status/1963980745728229522">video teaser</a>, the music and visuals are interrupted, the black/blue palette is replaced by yellow and brown, and we see snippets of black text and a secret message.</p>

<p>Thanks to some keen-eyed Starfield fans, somebody's already pieced together the clues and shared that message with us: "Terran Armada".</p>
<p>While we don't yet know what Terran Armada is, let alone when it'll release, fans are positing it's possibly the name of the next DLC or expansion, and are already sharing on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1n99blb/dlc2_is_titled_terran_armada/">Starfield subreddit</a> what's top of their wishlist.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="740"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1n99blb/dlc2_is_titled_terran_armada/">DLC2 is titled "Terran Armada".</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sklain/">u/Sklain</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/">Starfield</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>"Yeah, this is interesting because 'Terran' when used in the correct context can only mean 'of Terra' or 'from earth'," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1n99blb/comment/nckva3j/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">suggested</a> one player. "Looks like our planet might be more than it seems in Starfeild. With the rumors of a Starborn DLC or update I wonder if a bunch of Starborn resettled the earth in secret or something?"</p>
<p>"I'm just happy to have something to speculate and theorize on again since that has been one of the most fun parts of gaming releases since [I] was a kid," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1n99blb/comment/ncl7fiz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> someone else.</p>
<p>Hopefully, Bethesda won't leave us hanging for long and will confirm what's coming sooner rather than later – we'll keep you posted.</p>
<p>Last month, Bethesda teased an upcoming update for Starfield would improve space travel following a datamine that discovered hints of an overhauled "cruise mode". After a hasty patch removed hints of the cruise mode from the files, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-teases-starfield-space-travel-update-after-datamined-leak">Bethesda has since come forward with its hands up and admitted that yes, cruise mode is real</a> and is on the way somewhat soon.</p>

<p>"I'm seeing a lot of comments asking about Kingdom Hearts 4," Nomura said, as translated by <a href="https://x.com/aitaikimochi/status/1963954361362419884">Aitaikimochi</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/kingdom-hearts-4-final-fantasy-7-ever-crisis-tetsuya-nomura-update/">TheGamer</a>). "We are making great strides and going according to schedule. So please wait for more information on that!"</p>
<p>Admittedly, that doesn't give us much to go on, but it should be a relief to fans to know everything is "going according to schedule". And as for Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3?</p>
<p>"[Motomu] Toriyama supposedly said we will have news around the time of the second anniversary of FF7EC," he added. "We are making great progress on the game! And I can't say anything else. I'm not gonna be like, 'Well, actually…' If I did, people would be really surprised if it's during this FF7EC livestream.</p><p>"But we are indeed making a lot of progress with the game. We already have decided when we will make the announcement as well, and we will stick to that time schedule. So don't worry, but please wait for it."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> finally released fresh screenshots of Kingdom Hearts 4 back in May, giving us our first look at the game in three years. Before then, the last time the game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-4-is-officially-on-the-way">shown was back in 2022 for the series' 20th anniversary</a>, in which we were treated to Sora's return and the expansive metropolis of Quadratum.</p>
<p>The day before those new screenshots, Square Enix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-cancelled-but-kingdom-hearts-4-still-on-the-way">cancelled mobile game Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link</a>.</p>

            <p>Epic Games has sped up repercussions for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> players who used V-Bucks and refunded them through an exploit on Xbox, essentially getting the in-game currency for free.</p>
<p>As we moved into the weekend, the studio <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1964118061763432684">said</a> it had now "fixed a delay" and would be claiming back any items that were bought through currency that had been refunded on Xbox or previously gifted from fraudulent accounts.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the system it uses to revoke items on Xbox between December 2024 and July 2025 "malfunctioned", the company <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1964011363363107319">warned</a> some players "may now see a message that their payment was reversed or refunded and see recent items have been removed, even from transactions from several months ago".</p>

<p>It comes after some Xbox players abused an exploit through which they could buy V-Bucks through Microsoft, apply them to their accounts, and then refund them.</p>
<p>After clarifying this "does not affect regular purchases on Xbox or any other platform that weren't refunded", the Fortnite Status X/Twitter account added:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Update on Xbox refund issue:</p><p>Ordinarily, when a player receives a refund of a real-money Fortnite purchase, the purchased items are removed from their account.

<p>"Ordinarily, when a player receives a refund of a real-money Fortnite purchase, the purchased items are removed from their account," Epic explained. "When V-Bucks are purchased, spent, and refunded, causing the player’s V-Bucks balance to go negative, items most recently purchased and gifted with the refunded V-Bucks are removed from the player’s account and the gift recipient's account.</p><p>"Unfortunately, the system we built for this malfunctioned on Xbox between December 2024 and July 2025. During this time, players were receiving refunds, but the refunded V-Bucks and items purchased with refunded V-Bucks remained in the player’s account and gift recipient accounts."</p>
<p>While Epic accepts that over this period most players "continued using purchasing and refunding in good faith as usual", some "exploited the situation to make large numbers of purchases, often with many accounts. Some even set up shops to accept payments from players and gifted them items purchased with refunded V-Bucks".</p>
<p>It's taken so long to sort the issue, however, that when Epic began processing back-dated refund requests on Xbox on 4th September and confusing players, it's now "making a correction to distinguish between accounts that made ordinary refund requests, and accounts exploiting the refund system".</p>
<p>"We're restoring the items that were removed earlier this week for players who made less than 7 refunds since Dec 2024. It was our fault that we didn't update the V-Bucks balance in their account immediately as we should have. This will take a few days," Epic conceded.</p><p>"The removed items will stay removed for anyone who received 7 or more refunds, and for items received through gifting from players who made 7 or more refunds during this time. This is the ordinary approach to refunds from our terms of service, and these item purchases were taking advantage of an exploit with the V-Bucks refund system."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-return-to-ios-in-the-uk-uncertain-as-epic-accuses-uk-regulator-of-deprioritising-store-competition">Epic Games recently claimed the return of Fortnite to iOS in the UK is "uncertain"</a> as it's been unable to bring the Epic Games Store to iOS this year, "if ever", after the CMA – the UK's competition regulator –  has "deprioritised store competition entirely", following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">lengthy legal battle between Epic and Apple</a>.</p>
