            <p>Sony has issued a number of DMCA notices against a fan project working to bring Concord back to life.</p>
<p>Concord was infamously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">pulled from sale just two weeks after its PS5 and PC release</a>, amid suggestions it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-has-sold-just-25000-copies-estimate-industry-analysts">sold less than 25,000 copies</a>. At the time, Sony said the game would remain offline indefinitely so Firewalk could "determine the best path ahead" and "explore options, including those that will better reach our players." Later that same month, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-director-reportedly-steps-down-as-studio-awaits-sony-decision-on-games-future">Concord game director Ryan Ellis stepped down</a>, and by the end of October 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">Firewalk Studios, the Sony-owned developer behind the ill-fated shooter, was also shut down</a>.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today, and a team of volunteer developers have been working for months to get the game up and running again, getting the main menu, character select, and matchmaking working on private servers. "The project is still WIP," one volunteer developer wrote on the <a href="https://discord.gg/q9Q2N52agh">Concord Delta Discord</a>, but confirmed "it's playable, but buggy."</p>

<p>"Hey. After a long time of reverse engineering [and] server development, we just managed to play a match of Concord!" the team announced on Discord.</p>
<p>"The project is still WIP, it's playable, but buggy. Once our servers are fully set up, we'll begin doing some private playtesting, if anyone here wants to join those playtests, let me know (include what region/time zone you are in for convenience)." The announcement ended thanking a couple of volunteer developers for "helping [...] reverse engineer the game".</p>
<p>Crucially, the team only hosted players who already owned the game files themselves through a legitimate purchase, and slapped down anyone trying to share "copyrighted files".</p>
<p>"I know this sucks for people who got forcefully refunded, but lawyers are most likely already watching everything we do and I want to ensure this project stays as legal as we realistically can do," the team wrote. "We will be removing any posts containing links to copyrighted files."</p><p>Despite the team's caution, however, Sony has targeted the project, filing copyright infringement claims against videos showing the project in action on YouTube and social media. And while it's unclear if Sony has filed against the team itself, it seems they've been cowed into submission for now, with one of the devs writing on Discord: "Due to worrying legal action we’ve decided to pause invites for the time being," (thanks, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-cracks-down-concord-custom-servers-dmca-takedowns/">The Game Post)</a>.</p>
<p>The UK's House of Commons recently debated the need for improved video game consumer protections as well as video game preservation. In this debate, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concords-sudden-shutdown-is-such-a-big-deal-its-been-brought-up-during-uk-government-debates-on-video-game-consumer-laws">Concord's sudden shutdown was used as an example</a>, and the requirement for strong consumer protections in such a case.</p>
<p>One MP stated: "A recent example is Concord, a game released for PlayStation 5 and Windows in August 2024. Following a disappointing launch, Sony Interactive Entertainment made a commercial decision to shut it down. To their credit, they did refund all purchases, but this isn't always the case."</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has told Anno 117: Pax Romana fans that it will be replacing an AI-generated loading screen image, insisting it had "slipped through" and had only meant to be used as a placeholder.</p>
<p>The Steam page for Anno 117: Pax Romana carries an "AI Generated Content Disclosure" - the first for an Ubisoft game - but that hasn't stopped fans complaining about the image, or insisting that they expect better from a premium game from a developer like Ubisoft.</p>

<p>The image, which can be viewed in full <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fthe-ai-background-art-is-pretty-low-quality-unfortunately-v0-yi4z7xs7o11g1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D3399%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D2d42be908c532ce0df76c17431201e223ab81955">here</a>, shows a number of tell-tale signs that it's been generated rather than drawn, including disfigured or out-of-scale facial features, missing limbs, and strange set-dressing. A touched-up version is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fthe-ai-background-art-is-pretty-low-quality-unfortunately-v0-jjptto1zr11g1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D2683%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dc930b5ce57dcbe6d89cd4b02d4dc69af9a83d85e">considerably less jarring,</a> but some fans still take issue with the fact that it was based on a prompt rather than an original piece of art.</p>
<p>"If they are going to go with cheap tools in their game, I will wait till the game is cheap," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/comments/1ow3v75/comment/nonhwqr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> one unhappy fan.</p>
<p>Another, leaving a negative review on Steam, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ItsAnny/recommended/3274580/">wrote</a>: "I don't want to live in a future where every big studio that very well could afford paying artists instead chooses to steal from artists by using AI generated images. AI tools are bad for the environment, bad for the job market, on top of that the images look awful, genuinely an eyesore in a[n] otherwise beautiful game."</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="240"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/comments/1ow3v75/the_ai_background_art_is_pretty_low_quality/">The AI background art is pretty low quality unfortunately</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MedicaeVal/">u/MedicaeVal</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/">anno</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

<p>Responding to <a href="https://kotaku.com/anno-117-pax-romana-ai-loading-screen-patch-ubisoft-2000644399">Kotaku</a>, Ubisoft said: "This image was a placeholder asset that unintentionally slipped through our review process. The final image is attached here and will replace the current version of this artwork with the upcoming 1.3 patch. With Anno 117: Pax Romana being our most ambitious Anno yet, we’ve assembled the largest team of artists ever for the franchise and to help meet the project’s unique scope, they use AI tools for iterations, prototyping, and exploration. Every element players will experience in the final game reflects the team’s craft, artistry, and creative vision."</p>
<p>And it's not just images that seem to have been generated by AI, either. According to some players, the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/comments/1onip56/german_text_localization_is_still_ai_generated_in/">text localisation is also allegedly "still AI-generated"</a>, too.</p>
<p>u/Taubenangriff posted a number of examples they believe were translated by machine, writing "nobody who has ever played an Anno before was let near translation work, and it is still AI generated slop to a large part. They got six million euros cultural (!) sponsorship from the German state, but the result is outright disrespectful to the German language".</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/comments/1onip56/german_text_localization_is_still_ai_generated_in/">German text localization is still AI generated in the release version</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/taubenangriff/">u/taubenangriff</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/">anno</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>These issues persist despite the same user highlighting issues with the German localisation <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/comments/1n6nuen/text_localization_seems_to_be_ai_generated/">two months ago</a>.</p>
<p>Ubisoft unveiled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anno-117-pax-romana-is-taking-the-economic-city-builder-to-ancient-rome-next-year">Anno 117: Pax Romana back in June 2024</a>. A new entry in Ubisoft Blue Byte's long-running economic city builder series, it whisks PC and console players back to ancient Rome and the Roman Empire.</p>
