            <p>
A maker of gaming hardware accessories has removed a trailer that showed the blurry outline of what was clearly intended to be Nintendo's under-wraps <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
Accessories manufacturer Satisfye is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">next company to begin selling peripherals for Switch 2</a> - even though Nintendo is yet to formally announce the Switch successor or detail how it'll look. 
</p>
<p>
Product <a href="https://www.satisfye.com/products/zengrip-2-bundle">pages</a> for the ZenGrip 2, a Switch 2 console grip, and a carry case for Nintendo's next console are still live. (Neither specifically use the name "Switch" anywhere, though state they are "Made for Next Gen Console" with the image of a current-gen Switch.)
</p>
<p>
However, a trailer for the products which featured hardware docked into the Switch 2 grip has now been removed - although not before the internet took notice. 
</p>
<p>
It's worth noting that the ZenGrip 2's product page states that it is an "Expected Design" and that the accessory "will be tuned to final specifications". That said, now only three months (at most) away from Switch 2 finally being shown, the device's form factor is fairly well known.
</p>
<p>
While some console companies do share product specifications with third-parties ahead of launch to speed up peripheral production, it's likely we've already seen a relatively-final version of Switch 2 via previous leaks.

<p>
Purported images of the Switch 2 shell have been floating around online for several months, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">Digital Foundry dubbed as "almost certainly real"</a>. These show a console almost identical in form factor to the current Switch, albeit with a larger screen size, a second small button on the right Joy-Con,  and what look to be magnet attachments on each Joy-Con's side.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-designs-posted-by-3d-model-enthusiast-setting-internets-tongues-wagging">3D-printed plans for Switch 2 based on leaks</a> also exist, which fans have been 3D printing versions of for months just for kicks.
</p>
<p>
Has ZenGrip 2 got insider knowledge? Is it simply trying to get ahead of the competition with a neat stunt to gain attention? Or why not both?
</p>
<p>
Nintendo is yet to announce any details of its next console, other than to confirm it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-fiscal-year">will announce Switch 2 properly before 31st March 2025</a>, the end of its current financial year.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> is "not rewarding enough", developer Grinding Gear Games has admitted, amid a plan to "urgently" update the game.</p>
<p>An extensive post on the game's community forum details a number of changes based on feedback from the game's launch weekend last week. Some changes have already been implemented, while others will be deployed in a future patch.</p>
<p>"There are lots more things coming," reads the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3611705">post</a>. "The list in this post are some of the things we felt needed to be more urgently addressed."</p>

<p>A major sticking point is that the game is "not rewarding enough", with a plan to alter items, rare monsters, currency, and map mods.</p>
<p>"This is an area that we have to be very careful when adjusting because it's very hard to reduce drops if we increase them by too much," said the developer.</p>
<p>The rewards given for defeating rare monsters have been boosted, which should improve the endgame. Specifically, the rarity bonus per rare mod has been doubled, the quantity bonus per rare mod has increased by 10 percent, and there's an increased chance of rare monsters inherently having more modifiers.</p>
<p>"These changes will cause rare monster rewards to naturally scale up as you get to higher levels because the number of mods a monster can have increases throughout the campaign and into endgame," the post reads.</p>
<p>Further, the drop rates of various currencies have been raised, while the rewards for the added difficulty of map mods have been "significantly increased".</p>
<p>Other changes to Path of Exile 2 include: an improvement to dodging to prevent players becoming trapped as often; new checkpoints have been added to prevent retreading old ground; the 'Move Only' command no longer namelocks to prevent characters attacking in the wrong direction; and rare monsters will appear on the minimap more easily to boost endgame progression.</p>
<p>The full list of changes can be viewed on the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3611705">Path of Exile 2 forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/super-mario-movie-actor-who-leaked-role-in-first-film-hasnt-heard-anything-about-returning-for-sequel.1056606/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-movie-actor-who-leaked-role-in-first-film-hasnt-heard-anything-about-returning-for-sequel<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
An actor who leaked his obscure role in Nintendo's then-top-secret Super Mario Bros. Movie has said he's yet to hear whether he's coming back for the sequel. 
</p>
<p>
Actor and comedian Sebastian Maniscalco played Mario's foreman boss Spike in the Super Mario Bros. Movie - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-bros-animated-movie-actor-lets-slip-his-obscure-role">a fact he let slip more than a year before the film was released</a>, before Nintendo had shown anything of the project publicly.
</p>
<p>
The random announcement by Maniscalco - and the deep cut nature of the character's inclusion (Spike appeared in NES game Wrecking Crew back in 1985, and little else since) made headlines. Perhaps Nintendo is keen to keep things more tight-lipped this time around?
</p>
<p>
Indeed, Maniscalco says he doesn't rate his chances for a return in the Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel - though not because of his previous statements. Instead, he says, it's because there's yet to be a stuffed toy of him.
</p><p>
"We went to Universal Studios and they had a Super Mario store with all the merchandise," Maniscalco recently told <a href="https://screenrant.com/super-mario-bros-movie-2-foreman-spike-return-sebastian-maniscalco-response/">ScreenRant</a>. "I was with my kids, I go, 'Guys, come on. I'm going to show you daddy's character in a stuffed animal.' No Spike, no nothing. It stopped at me. It was every other character, and then me, I have no animal, no stuffy, no nothing. 
</p>
<p>
"So, the fact that I didn't have a stuffed animal is not giving me a lot of confidence that I'm coming back for the sequel," he continued. "I haven't heard anything, so your guess is as good as mine."
</p>
<p>
Spike could easily be featured in a sequel should Nintendo want to. After all, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-bros-movie-post-credit-scene-hints-at-potential-sequel-chris-pratt-says">post-credits teaser was set back in Mario and Luigi's native Brooklyn</a>, where Spike lived. 
</p>
<p>
But, as yet, Nintendo is still to say exactly what its plans for the next Mario movie are. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">Due to launch in April 2026</a>, rumours abound that the sequel will focus on Donkey Kong this time around - although, as Eurogamer previously rounded up, there are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-where-the-mario-movie-series-may-go-next">plenty of dangling plot threads from the Super Mario Bros. Movie which could point to sequels</a>.
