There's some bad-ish news if you've been eagerly awaiting developer Nightdive's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/system-shock-2">System Shock 2</a> remaster on consoles. The studio has been forced to delay the remaster's PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Switch release, but - good-ish news time - only by a couple of weeks as it seeks to remedy undisclosed "issues".
</p>
<p>
Nightdive announced it would be remastering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> developer Irrational Games' critically acclaimed - and hugely influential - 1999 FPS/RPG sci-fi horror hybrid <a href="https://x.com/NightdiveStudio/status/1160740078685057025">back in 2019</a>, but it wasn't until earlier this year that the project got a new name (it's now officially known as the System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster) and a 26th June release date for all platforms.
</p>
<p>
However, the studio has now announced a short delay for the console versions in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nightdivestudios.bsky.social/post/3lsclg2v6o22p">statement on social media</a>, saying it has "encountered issues that have prevented us from launching System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster on consoles... on 26th June as originally intended." Nightdive adds that it's "currently working to address these issues as quickly as possible", but that the console release is now "targeting the first two weeks of July."

<p>
As for the PC version, that's managed to retain its 26th June release date and will launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/866570/System_Shock_2_25th_Anniversary_Remaster/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/system_shockr_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">GOG</a>, the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/agecheck/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster">Humble Store</a>, and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-cb94d9">Epic</a> on 26th June as originally announced. "We'll update everyone as soon as we have a set launch date for consoles," Nightdive's statement concludes.
</p>
<p>
Nightdive's System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster, which follows on from 2023's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/system-shock-review-shodan-steals-the-show-in-this-faithful-remake">extremely well-received System Shock 1 remake</a>, promises enhancements to characters, weapon models, textures, cinematics, and animations. That's alongside quality of life improvements, optimised controller support, updated co-op multiplayer, and achievements. PC players can also expect mod support, up to 144fps, and ultra-widescreen compatibility.
</p>
<p>
At its heart, though, it's still the same acclaimed System Shock 2 released in the hazy days of 1999, taking players onboard the FTL ship Von Braun in the year 2114 for another battle of wits with rogue AI SHODAN. "Hybrid mutants and deadly robots roam the halls while the cries from the remaining crew reverberate through the cold hull of the ship," Nightdive explains. "SHODAN... has taken over, and it's up to you to stop her."
</p>
<p>
As Eurogamer contributor Rick Lane <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/system-shock-2-still-stands-as-irrationals-finest-work">wrote of System Shock 2 back in 2015</a> (beware spoilers!), "It's the finest work that both Looking Glass and Irrational ever produced... and if that doesn't give you a shout of being the best game in existence, I'm not sure what does."

            <p>
It's been an eventful news day for fans of adorably sinister horror series <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a>. Not only has the upcoming third instalment received a 10th October release date on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and  - as newly confirmed - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, publisher Bandai Namco has announced an Enhanced Edition of the original game, <em>and</em> a brand-new VR instalment.
</p>
<p>
Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition, which seems as good a place as any to start, promises a bit of a glow-up for developer Tarsier Studios' acclaimed 2017 original. This time around, players can experience raincoat-wearing protagonist Six's strange, dark escape from the mysterious, floating Maw at 4K resolution and 60fps. There's also talk of "RTX reflections, water effects, more particles, and volumetric lighting", plus a choice between Quality and Performance modes, depending on whether you prefer to prioritise visuals or framerate.
</p>
<p>
Bandai Namco has given Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition an official launch date of 10th October, but it's available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC right now for anyone that pre-orders developer Supermassive Games' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares 3</a>. Switch 2 is also getting the Enhanced Edition, but not until October.

<p>
As for that VR version, it's title Little Nightmares: Altered Echoes and... that's pretty much all we know so far. Bandai Namco is yet to confirm a developer, even the platforms it's targeting, but we do get a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CvZB0nFaoE">45-second announcement trailer</a> to tide us over. "Every step echoes closer," the publisher teases, "does this tune sound familiar, little ones?" Also promising is the newly teased Little Nightmares stop-motion project, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Bandai%20Namco">looks eerily beautiful in its brisk reveal trailer</a>, although there's no hint as to when or even <em>where</em> this might eventually show up. Is it related to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nightmare-before-christmas-director-bringing-little-nightmares-to-tv">Little Nightmares TV show announced back in 2017</a>? Time will tell.
</p>
<p>
So to recap: Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition is out now for those that pre-order Little Nightmares 3, otherwise both games launch on 10th October. Little Nightmares: Altered Echoes, meanwhile, exists, and there's not much else to say. As to what original Little Nightmares developer Tarsier Studios is up to now, having walked away from the series after part 2, that'll be Reanimal. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-nightmares-studios-reanimal-is-more-kids-in-dark-places-but-now-with-co-op">another kids-in-dark-places horror adventure</a> (but with added co-op) that's coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC later this year.
