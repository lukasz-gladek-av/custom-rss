            <p>Praise Cheesus! We are all absolutely wild for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' cheese naan.</p>
<p>Early in Monstrer Hunter Wilds, players will get the opportunity to partake in an in-game feast which features a delicious-looking cheese naan dish. In fact, I am salivating just thinking about it, brie-lieve me. The dish in question is a generous slab of naan-like bread covered in hot, oozy cheese and yes I may have to now take a break to go and recreate it in my own kitchen.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am clearly not the only one to be won over by how gouda this dish looks. This scene has seemingly caused sales of actual cheese naan to be feta than ever.</p>

<p>A quick search of Monster Hunter Wilds Cheese Naan on social media will bring up a number of users either sharing footage from the game itself, images of their own real-world cheese naan dishes, and yes - a Tokyo restaurant saying the game really  has caused its sales to surge.</p>
<p>For context, here's a look at Monster Hunter Wilds' in-game cheese naan scene.</p>

<p>And here's Tokyo-based Nepalese restaurant Salam Namaste, which thanked Monster Hunter Wilds for boosting its cheese naan sales over the weekend.</p>
<p>"Cheese naan is too popular," the <a href="https://x.com/salamnamaste01/status/1896188428393537908">restaurant wrote on social media</a>. "I had a lot of cheese with me, but it was running out, so I had no choice but to go to Inageya to get some. Thank you, Monster Hunter" (computer translated). Yes, that looked Cheddar Gorge-ous. </p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/image-(555).png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<p>The game's cheese naan is certainly proving popular. One player stated they will probably manage to get "100+ hours in Monster Hunter Wilds" before they actually make it beyond the cheese naan scene. "Just rewinding the scene over and over while drool covers the controller," <a href="https://x.com/JoshBeardVO/status/1895631808018202946">they wrote</a>.</p>
<p>Plenty of players have now ventured into the wilds of the takeaway and restaurant world to savour cheese naan for themselves. "I have fulfilled the desire," <a href="https://x.com/doka_pan/status/1896415906508816803">one X user wrote</a> with an accompanying image of naan and curry goodness (see below).</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Xianirth/status/1891447855786705299">Another added</a>: "Because of this particular cutscene in Monster Hunter Wilds, me and the princess got ourselves Cheese Naan at our local restaurant."</p>

<p>"That's hilarious - Monster Hunter Wilds really said, 'Let's make cheese naan the MVP of 2025! 'It's wild to think a game's gooey cheese pull could spark a culinary craze like this," <a href="https://x.com/Jake29972746993/status/1896379721820037450">another social media user wrote</a> in response to the cheesy goodness the Monster Hunter Wilds team has blessed us with. </p>
<p>"Maybe Capcom should send that Nepali restaurant a thank-you note or at least a cheese care package to keep up with the hungry hunters!"</p>
<p>If you want to make your own Monster Hunter Wilds-inspired cheese naan, I had a quick google and have <a href="https://foodess.com/cheese-naan/">saved this recipe to try out later</a>. Hopefully my efforts will be met with similar praise from my family and friends. They will tell me it is grate, or something along those lines, I am sure...</p>
<p>Anyway in the meantime, here's our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/best-meals-monster-hunter-wilds">guide to the best meals in Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p> <div>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds has proved extremely popular for Capcom, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">crossing over the one million player mark on Steam on its debut</a>.</p>
<p>It hasn't all been sunshine, cheese and roses for the game, however. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-responds-after-monster-hunter-wilds-steam-success-is-marred-by-performance-complaints">User reviews for Monster Hunter Wilds remain "Mixed" on Steam</a>, with the PC performance being an ongoing issue. In the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">words of Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia</a>, "lower-end graphics cards with lower VRAM allocations should avoid Monster Hunter Wilds until these issues are rectified".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sonic Unleashed is finally available on PC thanks to a fan-made port with modern quality of life features.</p>
<p>Unleashed is the Sonic game with the rubbish werehog bits, but its actual Sonic levels are brilliant - their mix of sidescrolling and 3D styles formed the basis of games in the series ever since - and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-generations">Sonic Generations</a> in particular.</p>
<p>The game was originally released for PS3 and Xbox 360 (as well as PS2 and Wii), and now the 360 version has been unofficially ported to PC as Unleashed Recompiled.</p>

<p>New features include an uncapped framerate, comprehensive visual options to customise, ultrawide support, built-in achievements, and controller icons for whichever controller you use.</p>
<p>In short, this is now the best way to play Sonic Unleashed, although you'll need a legitimate copy of the Xbox 360 game to get it running. You can <a href="https://github.com/hedge-dev/UnleashedRecomp?tab=readme-ov-file">download Unleashed Recompiled on github</a>.</p>
<p>Almost all the modern Sonic games are available on Steam at present, including Sonic x Shadow Generations, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-frontiers">Sonic Frontiers</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-superstars">Sonic Superstars</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-colours-ultimate">Sonic Colors: Ultimate</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-adventure">Sonic Adventure</a> 1 and 2, the Sonic racing games, and even Sonic Lost World.</p>
<p>Sonic Unleashed, then, is a curious omission from Sega. Should this fan-made port be a success, perhaps an official version could be released in future.</p>
<p>Sega's last release was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>, which does include an Unleashed-themed level as part of the original Sonic Generations. The new Shadow levels are fantastic.</p>
<p>It's unknown what's next for the series, though Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka said Sonic Frontiers' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-frontiers-is-cornerstone-of-future-sonic-games-says-sonic-team-head">open zone style is now the "cornerstone of future Sonic games"</a>.</p>
<p>In film land, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-movie-gets-a-release-date-but-its-still-a-few-years-away">Sonic the Hedgehog 4 has already been greenlit</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Capcom has explained how to get around a perceived endgame softlock in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>
<p>The main mission 5-1: Omens asks players to "Investigate the regions and raise your HR", but some players have already reached the Hunter Rank cap and have been unable to progress.</p>
<p>It turns out, though, the description just isn't very clear. The mission doesn't require players to raise their Hunter Rank but instead earn enough Hunter Rank Points to proceed.</p>

<p>To get by, then, players must simply complete enough Optional Quests or Side Missions to earn enough Hunter Rank Points.</p>

<p>Capcom's latest game in the series is seeing meteoric success, not only peaking on Steam at 1.3 million concurrent players, but propelling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-propels-steam-to-highest-ever-player-count">Steam to its highest ever concurrent player numbers</a>.</p>

<p>At least Capcom is speedily investigating and fixing any smaller issues that arise.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
