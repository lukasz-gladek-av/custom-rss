            <p>The Silent Hill fandom is seemingly split once again, this time over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>'s "soulslike" combat.</p>
<p>As more and more teasers and footage pop up online in the run-up to 25th September's launch day, fans are getting stuck into all the new gameplay. But while we already <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/silent-hill-f-launches-september-25-ps5-gameplay-revealed/">knew</a> the combat would have a "heavier focus on melee and be more action-oriented compared to last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>", fans are concerned about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mggyrw/silent_hill_f_looks_great_but_the_enemy_combat/">how enemies react</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mg6fn0/the_small_hypocrisy_im_seeing_for_silent_hill_f/">degradable weapons</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mf7e5l/why_are_they_making_silent_hill_a_soulslike/">"soulslike" boss encounters</a>.</p>
<p>"The game is looking incredible overall in terms of detail and quality. The amount of work the devs have put in is really impressive. That said, I’m a bit worried about how the combat is shaping up, specifically, how enemies react (or don’t react) when taking hits," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mggyrw/silent_hill_f_looks_great_but_the_enemy_combat/">said one player</a>.</p>

<p>"Why, I can't guy[s] please don't tell me it's true," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mf7e5l/why_are_they_making_silent_hill_a_soulslike/">lamented one fan</a>. "I love this series and I'm really hyped for the game, but please game devs, don't take this route, don't sacrifice what this series is know [sic] for to trend chase. Don't alienate your audience. I'm honestly scared if this is the direction there [sic] taking this series."</p>
<p>"The combat certainly concerns me. Even if it ends up being amazing, I feel apprehensive about a Silent Hill game having combat that evokes the counter timings of Sekiro," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mf9o9e/comment/n6fl6ds/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">added</a> someone else. "Hopefully they pull a Bloober and prove me wrong. At the very least, I hope it’s a good horror game even if it ends up failing as a Silent Hill game."</p>
<p>To be fair, this isn't the first time the series has dabbled with degradable weapons – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-4-the-room">Silent Hill 4: The Room</a> and Silent Hill Origins did, too, although how successful that was lies in the eye of the player, I guess. The problem for some, however, is how those degradable weapons could inhibit exploration.</p>
<p>"I'd like to scour the in-game world and pick up all the details/memos, but if I'm burning through my decent weapons at every stop to do so, I'm eventually gonna stop exploring to conserve resources," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mf2maj/comment/n6ffoo9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">suggested one fan</a>.</p>
<p>As for the other complaints? Well, there were plenty of those for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> in the run-up to release, and that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">turned out to be one of my favourite games in years</a> (and what I think is the only 5/5 I've awarded in all the years I've reviewed here). So the good news is, regardless of how the previews are making fans feel, September will be here before we know it.</p>
<p>Silent Hill f was unveiled as part of Konami's four-game series revival back in 2022, but it took until the middle of March 2025 to get an update. Now that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Bloober Team's superb Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> is behind us, the publisher is turning its attention to its mysterious follow-up, a new mainline instalment set in 1960s Japan.</p>
<p>It's being developed by Neobards Entertainment (which has previously served as a support studio for Capcom's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>), with creature and character design by Kera, and a script by When They Cry writer Ryukishi07.</p>
<p>As Matt recently summarised for us, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/konamis-japan-set-silent-hill-f-resurfaces-with-eerie-new-trailer-and-fresh-details">Silent Hill f's events are unfolding in the rural town of Ebisugaoka</a> - based on Kanayama, Gero, in the Gifu Prefecture - where our protagonist Shimizu Hinako, an "ordinary teenager", finds her home shrouded in fog and changed in "horrific" ways. As Silent Hill f play out, she'll explore a town she no longer recognises, solving puzzles, fighting strange enemies, and eventually having to make a "beautiful yet terrifying" decision that lies at the heart of the game.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/fandom-split-on-silent-hill-fs-soulslike-combat]]></content:encoded>

            <p>While new viral hit Peak can often feel as challenging as it is fun to play, rumour has it that in the next day or so, the procedurally-generated map won't be tricky as much as it'll be unbeatable. Whoops.</p>
<p>Addressing players on social media yesterday, developer Aggro Crab confessed that a modder on Discord had discovered an upcoming map will position a campfire – which players need to light in order to proceed to the next biome – on top of an "unreachable" tree.</p>

<p>"A modder in Discord has informed me that in two days there will be a map where the campfire spawns in an unreachable tree," the developer confessed. "Chat, do I go to the office on Saturday to fix this." The message was appended with a slew of crying emojis.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>A modder in discord has informed me that in two days there will be a map where the campfire spawns in an unreachable tree 😭</p><p>chat do i go to the office on saturday to fix this 😭😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/dEqrpKgKWK">pic.twitter.com/dEqrpKgKWK</a></p></div>— AGGRO CRAB 💥 (@AggroCrabGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1951527671722357152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Though Aggro Crab didn't specify what mod gave the player an early head's up, it's likely they're talking about the seed mod that lets people select a seed in config (in this case, it's <a href="https://x.com/digi_the_robot/status/1951899207390126389">reportedly</a> level_8).</p>
<p>The message spawned hundreds of replies, ranging from "<a href="https://x.com/Ringer_53/status/1951527964778074393">Nah, we'll live. Ruining your weekend over it is not worth it</a>", to "<a href="https://x.com/ZeroNyxia/status/1951585271243292743">new difficulty unlocked</a>", to "<a href="https://x.com/blockxs/status/1951531975489073554">skip the office, embrace chaos</a>", which I think I may adopt as my new mantra for life.</p>
<p>"Just add a sign that says good luck lol," <a href="https://x.com/LucarnAnderson/status/1951633892513083696">wrote</a> someone else.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the decision was made to leave it be.</p>
<p>"I think with those you can make it [with a chain launcher or anti rope], so maybe fk it we ball," the developer eventually <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1951533385375162582">declared</a>.</p>
<p>Peak – which follows a string of other multi-million sellers for publisher Landfall, including Content Warning and Totally Accurate Battlegrounds – is available now on Steam. Eurogamer contributing editor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession">Christian Donlan called Peak his "new gaming obsession" earlier this year</a>, writing: "Great climbing, great fun, a very pure take on design. And maybe stay away from the mushrooms. Some of them, anyway."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/brace-yourself-peak-fans-aggro-crab-reckons-you-can-get-to-an-unreachable-campfire-thats-coming-up-soon]]></content:encoded>
