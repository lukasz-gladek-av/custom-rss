            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a> has begun its global rollout of facial age verification onto the popular gaming platform starting today, in an attempt to improve child safety following a deluge of criticism. This comes after a partial rollout of the technology back in December.</p>
<p><a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2026/01/roblox-age-checks-required-to-chat">In a blog post on the official Roblox website</a>, chief safety officer Matt Kaufman and VP of user discovery Rajiv Bhatia explained how these new age checks will work. Over the next week, users will find this new security measure added to Roblox as a barrier between them and the gaming platform's chat feature.</p>
<p>The blog post states: "As the first large online gaming platform to require facial age checks for users of all ages to access chat, this implementation is our next step toward what we believe will be the gold standard for communication safety. It enables age-based chat, which promotes a positive, age-appropriate experience for all users globally, and limits communication between adults and children younger than 16."</p>

<p>The post also features statistics <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-continues-efforts-for-child-safety-by-expanding-age-estimation-to-all-users-by-end-of-the-year">from its earlier partial rollout</a>. It claims that following the facial age verification implementation in Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands more than 50 percent of daily active users had completed the process.</p>
<p>For Roblox users younger than nine-years-old, parental permission will be required to use the chat functionality. Those aged 13 or older will be able to chat with those from a wider age group ranging from nine to seventeen thanks to what Roblox is calling their "Trusted Connections Feature". This age group will not be able to speak to those above or below that range, and similar restrictions are present for different detected age groups. Those over the age of 13 can instead verify their age using ID.</p><p>Roblox claims that user privacy is paramount, and that images taken to verify the age of users are deleted immediately after the security check is completed. <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/37725513985812-Unlocking-Trusted-Connections-Expressive-Chat-Features-Party-Voice-chat-without-filters">On a Roblox help page dedicated to this Trusted Connections feature</a>, it states that occasionally users may have to redo this age verification process. In the event that the age verification software places a user into an age bracket that's incorrect, an appeal process is available where real-world ID or parental controls can manually circumvent the user's assigned age.</p>
<p>These age verification checks come following a period of intense scrutiny aimed at Roblox in regard to what many believe to be subpar efforts in child safety. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/louisiana-sues-roblox-for-allegedly-choosing-profits-over-child-safety-claiming-its-basically-open-season-for-sex-predators-on-this-app">The platform was sued by the state of Louisiana</a> last year over child safety, with Roblox's CEO previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/parents-worried-about-childrens-safety-shouldnt-let-them-play-roblox-company-boss-says">stating that parents not comfortable with their children playing the game shouldn't let them Roblox</a>. Months later, he would return to the forefront of this debate in a trainwreck interview, in which he stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-boss-says-problem-of-predators-is-an-opportunity-for-the-platform-in-disastrous-interview-following-latest-child-safety-measures">the game's predator problem was an "opportunity" for the platform</a>.</p>
<p>While undoubtedly a step in the right direction, this type of facial recognition technology has been circumvented by younger users in recent months. When the UK rolled out its online safety bill requiring larger websites to verify the ages of users, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/brits-can-get-around-discords-age-verification-thanks-to-death-strandings-photo-mode-bypassing-the-measure-introduced-with-the-uks-online-safety-act-we-tried-it-and-it-works-thanks-kojima/">many used Norman Reedus in Death Stranding 2 to trick the facial recognition software</a>. Whether or not this is a great stride towards a safer Roblox for kids remains to be seen.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian has changed its stance on generative AI following backlash faced at the end of last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/">In a Reddit Ask Me Anything</a> hosted by the studio this afternoon, founder Swen Vincke said, "to ensure there is no room for doubt, we've decided to refrain from using gen-AI tools during concept art development". "That way there can be no discussion about the origin of the art."</p>
<p>It was the use of gen-AI in relation to concept art that people had been especially concerned about. Vincke, in an interview in December, which coincided with the studio's Divinity game reveal, seemed to suggest Larian was using gen-AI to develop concept art. Controversy erupted, prompting Vincke to clarify that information had been "lost in translation", and that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-in-translation-larian-boss-swen-vincke-generative-ai-backlash-divinity-ama">the studio was only using gen-AI to explore references for concept art</a>, not generate the images themselves.</p>
<p>Evidently, in the few weeks since, a decision has been made to remove all sources of ambiguity entirely. As if to reinforce this, Vincke's Reddit post led with: "there is not going to be any gen-AI art in Divinity". But the ambiguity hasn't been entirely dispersed.</p><p>Vincke said Larian is still exploring gen-AI use in other applications at the studio. "We continuously try to improve the speed with which we can try things out," he wrote. "The more iterations we can do, the better in general the gameplay is. We think gen-AI can help with this and so we're trying things out across departments. Our hope is that it can aid us to refine ideas faster, leading to a more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game.</p>
<p>"The important bit to note," he added, "is that we will not generate 'creative assets' that end up in a game without being 100 percent sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data. If we use a gen-AI model to create in-game assets, then it'll be trained on data we own."</p>
<p>Larian lead writer Adam Smith joined the thread to clarify that the 'no gen-AI' approach to art would also be true for writing in Divinity. "The stance applies to writing as well," he wrote. "We don't have any text generation touching our dialogues, journal entries or other writing in Divinity."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/divinity-will-be-a-turn-based-rpg-and-see-larian-unleashed-declares-ceo-swen-vincke-replacing-the-dd-system-with-one-made-for-a-video-game">Divinity was announced at The Game Awards 2025</a> with a dark and gory cinematic trailer showing a festival - centred around burning someone at the stake - going horribly, irrevocably wrong. It shares the same series name as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divinity-original-sin">Divinity: Original Sin</a> 1 and 2, of course, but it's a completely new, detached game, and Larian is cooking up a new turn-based RPG system for it.</p>
