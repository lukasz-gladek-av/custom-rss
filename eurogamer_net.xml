            <p>Word on the internet is that Nintendo will be holding another reveals-based livestream next week, and it'll be a Partner Showcase no less.</p>
<p>According to various sources, <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2016969052132962528">including NatetheHate and GameXplain</a>, the showcase will be focused on third party studios publishing on Nintendo systems, with NatetheHate going one step further stating it'll be hosted on the 5th February.</p>
<p>While these are folks who have a history of calling these sorts of events right in the past, they are still rumours and should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Still, it's been some time since we had a Nintendo Partner Direct. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">Back in July of last year</a>, games like Monster Hunter Stories, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler-2">Octopath Traveler 2</a>, and more were shown off in quite the jam-packed occasion. Leading into 2026, there are plenty of games lined-up for release that we've not actually seen much of yet, including 007: First Light, and The Duskbloods. That last one being especially silent as of late.</p><p>Looking at the reactions to these rumours, there's excitement yet, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qqj4qr/natethehate_next_weeks_nintendo_direct_is_a/">but also hunger for a Nintendo Direct focused on first-party releases</a>. It's clear to see why, with a new Fire Emblem on the way as well as a new Mario Tennis, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> is looking strong on that front too.</p>
<p>What do you reckon? Will we see a Partner Direct next week? If so, what do you want to see in it?</p>

            <p>A report from GDC has shed a rather sobering light on the state of things, revealing that one third of surveyed US workers within the industry were laid off in the last two years.</p>
<p>According to GDC's <a href="https://reg.gdconf.com/2026-SOTI">2026 State of the Game Industry Report</a> - which included data provided by over 2300 respondents including developers, producers, marketers, executives and investors - 33 percent of respondents in the US had been laid off over the past 24 months.</p>
<p>Looking further afield to include other countries as well, 28 percent of those surveyed from within the industry reported they had been laid off in the same period, which is over a quarter of all respondents.</p>

<p>17 percent of those surveyed, meanwhile, stated they had been laid off in the past 12 months. "The total number of layoffs could be higher, though, as some may have experienced more than one layoff in the past two years," the report notes.</p><p>Almost half of the respondents - 48 percent - said they were still looking for employment after being laid off. Of those who were laid off one to two years ago, 36 percent said they still haven't found other games industry employment.</p>
<p>"Over 450 respondents reported experiencing an acquisition, closure, or merger in the past year. About 31 percent of those people also reported being laid off, though it's unclear how many were a direct result of said company changes," the report reads. "AAA and older indie respondents were more likely to report their companies were acquired, and newer indie studios were more likely to close."</p>
<p>In terms of professions within the industry, game designers reported the highest percentage of layoffs over the last 12 months, with 20 percent of those surveyed affected. This percentage includes those in narrative design.</p>
<p>At the other end of the scale, those working in business operations and services reported the lowest percentage of layoffs, with eight percent affected.</p>
<p>As to the reason why these layoffs happened, 43 percent cited company restructuring, while 32 percent said it was due to a project getting cancelled. Budget cuts and market conditions were also cited by 38 percent of respondents.</p>
<p>"Leadership failed to see that the Covid-era boom was not permanent, [and the] company went on an acquisition spree before being acquired," one respondent told GDC. "Now, money is a lot tighter because the goldfish with the money want returns yesterday so they can funnel it into the current fad (genAI)."</p><p>Another respondent, who was laid off less than 12 months ago, said: "Executives who have never actually worked as a dev are pulling up the boards on their ships, throwing people overboard, and expecting these scuttled ghost ships to keep making them infinite money."</p>
<p>Some respondents added their employers were working to retain their staff, "in spite of ongoing challenges".</p>

<p>Layoffs and closures remain an ongoing issue in 2026. Earlier this month, Ubisoft shocked everyone when it announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">"major organisational, operational and portfolio reset"</a>, which saw the company delay seven unspecified projects, close two studios and cancel multiple games.</p>
<p>For more on this topic, back in 2024, Chris Dring wrote an in-depth feature about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">everything going on with layoffs in the video games industry</a>.</p>

            <p>The team over at Wildlight has released an update for its live-service hero shooter, Highguard.</p>
<p>This update adds a number of "highly" requested features from its community, including a new crouch toggle option, field of view sliders on console and - importantly - improved stability. According to the studio, crashes have been reduced by 90 percent thanks to this update.</p>

<p>You can check out the full patch notes for Highguard below:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Settings Improvements</strong></p>
<p><em>Note: in an effort to release these changes to our players as quickly as possible, a number of menu options are not yet localised in languages other than English. Properly localised settings will be prepared for a future patch.</em></p>
<p><strong>Game Input Settings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added the ability to set Crouch to Hold or Toggle for all platforms.</li>
<li>Added the ability to set Aim Down Sights to Hold or Toggle for PC only (for now).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Toggling into ADS then tapping Sprint (shift on PC, left stick on controller) will swap your scope. This is disorienting on controller. PC players are recommended to rebind scope swap if using Toggle ADS. We will continue to look into adding this for console players who can’t rebind buttons yet, but we will need more time.</em></p>
<p><strong>Video Settings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Console users can now adjust FoV to 110.</li>
<li>Low scalability settings for shadows and reflections are tuned for even more performance at the cost of some image quality.</li>
<li>Low shadow setting now also disables volumetric fog.</li>
<li>Added a new "View Distance Quality" setting that controls skeletal mesh LODs, which can be another useful control to tune GPU and CPU usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Players now have the ability to toggle the following features on or off, irrespective of other quality options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anisotropic Materials</li>
<li>Chromatic Aberration</li>
<li>Bloom</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Motion Blur and Depth of Field need more testing to disable safely. Look for these options very soon.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>DLSS users now have the ability to select a DLSS preset.<em> More presets and better descriptions are coming in the next patch.</em></li>
<li>Players can now select Off to disable Global Illumination entirely.</li>
<li>Resolved an engine bug which could inadvertently throttled laptop users to 60 FPS regardless of frame rate settings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crash and Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p>This patch resolves crashes that could occur in the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leaving a match on PS5 with an unexpected input state.</li>
<li>Loading into matches on machines with slower storage devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of other bugs related to online user presence and matchmaking were also resolved.</p>
<ul>
<li>Friends now appear online correctly after accepting requests, and Xbox presence updates properly. Major crash fixes have reduced crashes by 90 percent, significantly improving stability.</li>
<li>Friend status is fixed - players now appear online correctly and Xbox presence updates reliably. Our top crash issues are gone resulting in a 90 percent crash reduction.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>And that's your lot for now.</p>

<p>Highguard was announced last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">closing out Geoff Keighley's trailer-filled The Game Awards extravaganza</a> (which did also feature some awards). Coming from several former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">Highguard quickly had a large influx of players on its release earlier this week</a>, however there were a few complaints as well, with many disappointed with areas such as map size and the 3v3 game format.</p>
<p>Since this slightly rocky debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developers-defend-as-complaints-pile-up">other developers across the industry have voiced their support for Highguard</a>, with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded studio 1047 Games stating: "No game is perfect on day one."</p>

            <p>Despite Amazon's live-action God of War series following the plot of Santa Monica's 2018 Norse epic, the cast so far has a very Ragnarök (and roll) feel to it.</p>

<p>Last night, it was announced that Severance actor Ólafur Darri Ólafsson will portray the Norse God of Thunder, Thor. "A mountain of a man who has weathered many a battle in his time, but whose actions in a war fought long ago now haunt his waking hours," reads Thor's character description.</p>
<p>As in 2022's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>, Amazon's live-action Thor is "now but a shadow of his former self", and has turned to alcohol in an attempt to drown out his demons. "Keeping his wife and children at arm's length has only deepened his isolation, but the power (and danger) of the God of Thunder is still there just beneath the surface," the <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/olafur-darri-olafsson-cast-thor-god-of-war-1236702443/">description ends</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to Thor, Homeland and Princess Bride actor Mandy Patinkin has been announced as the show's "most powerful Aesir god", Odin. "Odin, the All-Father, is not physically imposing or particularly god-like: but looks can be deceiving," reads his <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/mandy-patinkin-god-of-war-odin-1236644947/">God of War character description</a>, adding that Odin is a "patriarch who leads with an iron fist, and an unrivaled seeker of knowledge".</p><p>Odin - who is the father of Thor - is "paranoid, manipulative, and dangerous", and will serve as "a formidable antagonist" to God of War's lead, Kratos. The Aesir god will do "anything to try and prevent Ragnarök, the Norse end of days".</p>

<p>Ólafsson and Patinkin join an already impressive cast, which includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-series-has-found-its-kratos-and-its-ragnaroks-thor">Ryan Hurst as Kratos</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-casts-thors-wife-sif">Teresa Palmer as Phoebe/Sif</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ey-up-this-lad-from-emmerdale-is-playing-norse-god-heimdall-in-amazons-god-of-war-show-thats-norse-not-up-north">Max Parker as Heimdall</a>. Meanwhile, behind the camera, Amazon's God of War adaptation includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer">former Battlestar Galactica executive producer Ronald D. Moore</a>, who will serve as showrunner on the upcoming series, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/emmy-winning-shogun-director-joins-amazons-live-action-god-of-war-series">Emmy winning Shōgun director Frederick E.O. Toye</a>.</p><p>"God of War follows father and son Kratos and Atreus as they embark on a journey to spread the ashes of their wife and mother, Faye. Through their adventures, Kratos tries to teach his son to be a better god, while Atreus tries to teach his father how to be a better human," reads the show's official logline. I wonder when we will hear who will play Atreus…?</p>
<p>We still don't have a release window for the first season, however a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written">second season of God of War has already been greenlit at Amazon</a>.</p>
