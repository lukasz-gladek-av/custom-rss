            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> is boldly going where no nine-year-old exploratory space sim has gone before: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>. Developer Hello Games has announced a free launch-day update that'll bring significant upgrades compared to the original Switch release, including enhanced visuals, multiplayer, and more. That's in addition to a major update for all platforms arriving today.
</p>
<p>
Starting with Switch 2, Hello Games says this new version of No Man's Sky is a "huge leap" over the original Switch release, featuring "massively" increased density and detail, plus higher resolutions and improved frame rates (the <a href="https://youtu.be/cgYYQwHuh-Y">studio's announcement video</a> suggests 40fps at 1080p while playing portable, and 30fps at 1440p in docked mode).
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 also gets multiplayer and settlements - two features missing on Switch 1 - as well as cross-save and cross-play, so it's possible to jump seamlessly between devices. No Man's Sky's Switch 2 upgrade is free to existing users and launches alongside the console on 5th June.

<p>
It'll also include <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/beacon-update">No Man's Sky's new Beacon update</a>, which arrives today, 4th June, on all other platforms. This provides a significant overhaul of the space sim's existing settlement system, which essentially enables players to become the mayor of their own Mos Eisleys.
</p>
<p>There are new robotic settlements, for instance, and it's now possible to own multiple settlements instead of just one. There's also suggestion of more granular customisation and management, with talk of new upgradeable buildings types and settlement features, ranging from custom starship merchants to fishing ponds. That's alongside citizens with their own stories and abilities, and the option to enlist wingmen to protect your settlements from pirates. All of which sounds wonderful, but if the update wipes out the sprawling, settlement-adjacent cliffside base I've spent the last two years building, I will 100 percent cry.
</p>
<p>
So to recap, No Man's Sky's Beacon update is out today on PC, PCVR, Steam Deck, PlayStation 4, PS5, PSVR, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch 1, with a Switch 2 update due tomorrow, 5th June. And as Hello Games is fond of teasing, "more will follow". But what of the developer's next game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-studio-unveils-procedural-fantasy-planet-adventure-light-no-fire">planetary sim Light No Fire?</a> It's been a while since we've had an update on that, so fingers crossed for a bit of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Game Fest</a> news.

            <p>Gather your ghost hunting crew, but this time rather than grabbing your torches and crucifixes, reach out for some popcorn instead - a film adaptation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> is on its way.</p>
<p>The upcoming film based on the psychological horror co-op game will be a collaboration between developer Kinetic Games, as well as Blumhouse and Atomic Monster, which will be producing.</p>
<p>Blumhouse is known for its horror films, with the likes of M3gan and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> to its name. Atomic Monster, meanwhile, is the production company behind Annabelle, The Nun and The Conjuring universe (which is the "most successful horror franchise" of all time).</p>

<p>"We're thrilled to officially announce that a Phasmophobia film adaption is in development - it's a big moment for the whole Kinetic team, and the start of something really exciting," said Kinetic Games director Daniel Knight.</p>
<p>"We never could've imagined the incredible heights this game would reach when it launched five years ago, and we're so thankful to our amazing community for the lasting impact Phasmophobia has had in the gaming space and beyond. Working with Blumhouse and Atomic Monster marks an incredible new chapter for the game, and we can't wait to share more as the project develops."</p>
<p>Phasmophobia joins the swathes of games receiving film versions in recent years. Until Dawn was adapted for the big screen in April, but featured <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-film-wont-feature-the-same-characters-or-even-the-same-story-as-the-game-its-based-on">both a new cast of characters and a new story</a>.</p>
<p>As for Phasmophobia, it has surpassed 23m in global sales since its early access debut. Its next content drop - known as Chronicle - will be released on 24th June. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-junes-update-reworks-the-journal-media-and-brings-a-total-overhaul-of-evidence-collection">This will be Phasmophobia's "biggest update yet"</a>, the team said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blumhouse-games-hires-horror-game-specialist-louise-blain">journalist and radio host Louise Blain joined Blumhouse Games as its creative lead</a>, as the company brings its horror expertise to gaming.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> won't include a 200cc mode for faster racing, but producer Kosuke Yabuki hasn't ruled it out for a post-launch addition. </p>
<p>Mario Kart World is the next entry in Nintendo's long standing series, however unlike the games that have gone before, this time the team is mixing things up with the introduction of a roamable interconnected, well, world.</p>
<p>But, while the upcoming release will feature some newness on its debut, that 200cc is one feature from previous series entry <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8">Mario Kart 8</a> that will not arrive on launch.</p>

<p>This mode is often seen as a higher difficulty level for players as it can result in more frantic races due to the increased speed and power of karts. It's a lot of fun, especially after the comparatively tame 50, 100 and 150cc modes.</p>
<p>But, even though 200cc won't be available on launch, fret not. The 200cc mode was introduced to World's predecessor as part of an update following the game's initial launch, and the same may well happen again here.</p>
<p>"Some players are really happy with the addition of high difficulty modes like this," Mario Kart World's producer told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/mario-kart-world-switch-2-nintendo-kosuke-yabuki-1235350685/">Rolling Stone</a>, before coyly adding:</p>
<p>"However, does that mean we're going to consider adding engine sizes that are larger than 150cc to Mario Kart World? I'm afraid I can't say just yet."</p>
<p>Is this something you hope to see added to Mario Kart World further down the road?</p>

            <p>Nintendo is currently in full swing gearing up for the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, and part of that has seen the company update a number of its original Switch games for the newer model. While many of these updates are along the lines of 'added support', Nintendo has gone a bit further with Legend of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> - there's finally a more streamlined way to find favourite Echoes no matter which console you play on.</p>
<p>Echoes, for those unfamiliar with the game already, are essential items (or creatures) Zelda can copy and paste into the world, and use to her advantage. For example, once Zelda learns a bed Echo, she can use imitations of this object to create a bridge. An <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/best-echoes-to-get-early-zelda-of-wisdom">Echo of the classic Legend of Zelda enemy the Peahat</a>, meanwhile, can be deployed during any confrontation and steadily use its spikes to jab your foes into oblivion. However, they could sometimes take a while to find during gameplay, given in total there are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-echoes-locations-abilities-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-listed">127 Echoes to eventually choose from</a> all in one long list to scroll through. </p>
<p>Thankfully, Nintendo has heard our outcries (I am sure I am not the only one who has cried out...) about this. Now, those playing Echoes of Wisdom will find a new feature which displays "only favourited echoes in the list of echoes after 30 or more echoes have been learned". Huzzah! My word, I would have really loved this when I played the game on its release last year.</p>
