            <p>Ubisoft has not one, but two Far Cry games currently in development.</p>
<p>That's coming from Ubisoft co-founder and CEO Yves Guillemot, who was interviewed by <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/">Variety</a> about various goings on at the company, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">such as its recent 'restructuring'</a> which will see the publisher split its efforts across five "creative houses", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-announce-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios-to-lead-development-for-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-franchises">including the already launched subsidiary with Tencent known as Vantage Studios</a>.</p>

<p>Here, the publication asked Guillemot if this new company model will see development on its biggest franchises such as Far Cry and Assassin's Creed speed up, to which the exec replied:</p>
<p>"We have a solid pipeline underway across Vantage Studios. Under the Assassin's Creed brand, several titles are in development, spanning both single-player and multiplayer experiences, with the ambition to further grow a community that exceeded 30 million players last year.</p>
<p>"On Far Cry, anticipation is high, and we currently have two very promising projects in development."</p>
<p>It was previously reported that Ubisoft had two new Far Cry releases on the way, but this is now official confirmation that this indeed the case. As for those previous reports, it has been said that one release - codenamed Project Blackbird - will be the next mainline Far Cry entry. This chap will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-7-will-reportedly-see-players-attempting-to-rescue-their-kidnapped-family-against-the-clock">allegedly feature a "non-linear" story based around the kidnapping of the protagonist's family</a>, that plays out over - and seemingly must be completed within - 72 in-game hours, equating to 24 hours in real-time.</p><p>The second game previously reported to be in the works is a standalone Far Cry multiplayer game, known as Project Maverick. In 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-7-and-far-cry-multiplayer-reportedly-in-development-at-ubisoft">sources claimed Maverick would be an extraction-based shooter pitched as being based in "the Alaskan wilderness"</a>. At this time, it was said Maverick would allegedly include "mechanics such as permadeath, a backpack system, contracts, and more". The "and more" here could likely refer to lootable chests and extraction zones.</p>

<p>As for Assassin's Creed, we already know about some of its upcoming games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-project-hexe">such as Project Hexe</a> and of course <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-finally-acknowledges-assassins-creed-black-flag-rumours-with-a-gta-meme">its Black Flag remake</a>. However, a report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-and-assassins-creed/">Insider Gaming</a> has said that as part of Ubisoft's recent restructuring, two upcoming Assassin's Creed titles were cancelled, including one said to be called Assassin's Creed Singularity.</p>
<p>According to the publication's sources, Singularity was intended to be a virtual trading card game with Web3 and blockchain integration, and it would have been released across PC and mobile platforms. While I do have my - ahem - thoughts about what Ubisoft has done to its studios and games over the past few months, this is one game I don't feel especially sad to see gone.</p>

<p>Elsewhere at the company, as well as these two Far Cry games, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-anthology-series-in-the-works-with-always-sunny-in-philadelphias-rob-mac">anthology series is also in the works with Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Rob Mac (née McElhenney) and Alien Earth creator Noah Hawley</a>. In addition to a producer role, Mac - who also played Ian Grimm on comedy series Mythic Quest - will star in the Far Cry series, but as who remains for now unknown.</p>
<p>As for Ubisoft more generally, earlier today it was announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-laying-off-40-devs-at-studio-working-on-splinter-cell-remake-but-confirms-the-game-is-still-in-production">company was laying off 40 developers at the studio working on its Splinter Cell remake</a>, but the game itself remains in production.</p>

            <p>We are just a matter of days away from the release of Resident Evil Requiem, but already leaks are running rampant, causing Capcom to ask its community to 'please, cut it out!'.</p>
<p>As our Connor reported yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-out-resident-evil-requiems-ending-is-being-spoiled-online-as-capcom-fights-to-clean-up-leaks">physical copies of Resident Evil Requiem were obtained ahead of schedule by some members of the public earlier this week</a>. And thanks to this, gameplay and story leaks started making the rounds on the likes of reddit. Sigh.</p>

<p>Capcom did its best to curtail the problem by removing unauthorised videos and whatnot, but it did feel a bit like that man sticking a bit of sellotape over a massive leaking vat of liquid. So, now, the studio is appealing to any potential leaker's better nature, with a firm but fair 'stop it'.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/2024835538251923590/photo/1">social media post</a> shared this afternoon, Capcom wrote: "Please don't post or share pre-release leaks and spoilers for Resident Evil Requiem. We really want everyone to enjoy the game's story and experience as much as possible."</p>
<p>It added its legal department "will continue to issue takedowns and deletion notices for leaks in order to preserve your day-one experience". It then said very reasonably that we don't exactly have much longer to wait until we can all experience what horrors are in store first hand.</p>
<p>"We look forward to seeing all your reactions after release!" Capcom closed.</p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem is due to launch across PS5, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in one week's time, on 27th February.</p>
<p>Our Alex is one of the many here at Eurogamer very keen to play the latest series entry, but unlike the rest of us, he has been able to go hands-on with it already  (what, no I am not jealous <em>at all</em>…). "I left it far more excited for RE9 than I went in," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-final-preview">Eurogamer's Resident Evil Requiem preview earlier this year</a>.</p><p>"I think that mad lot might just do it again. And certainly, with its varying modes of play and dizzying pendulum tempo, it feels like a fitting tribute to thirty years of Resident Evil's brand of survival horror. I am properly desperate to get my hands on the final thing."</p>
