            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> Festival, the concert-themed rhythm-action portion of Epic Games' free-to-play jack-of-all-trades juggernaut, is getting local co-op support next month - conjuring nostalgic memories of countless evenings spent twanging away in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rock-band">Rock Band</a> with pals.
</p>
<p>
Not coincidentally, of course, Fortnite Festival is the work of Rock Band developer Harmonix (which Epic Games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-acquires-rock-band-developer-harmonix">acquired back in 2021</a>) and is extremely reminiscent of the studio's beloved earlier titles, right down to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rock-band-developer-harmonixs-new-fortnite-music-mode-will-support-instrument-controllers">support for guitar-shaped plastic peripherals</a>.
</p>
<p>
And Epic has now revealed that, from Tuesday 14th January, Fortnite Festival will get a little closer to capturing the social spirit of those heady Rock Band days, by letting multiple players jam away in the comfort of the same room - but only on Xbox and PlayStation. The company hasn't shared much in the way of specifics just yet, but judging by the <a href="https://x.com/FNFestival/status/1877762481533165921">excessively elaborate, Snoop Dogg-starring trailer</a> it's released to announce the new feature, it'll support local co-op for up to four players, as well as the simultaneous use of two plastic guitars.

This marks the first major new feature for Fortnite Festival this year, and follows Epic's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-commits-to-rock-band-like-festival-musical-mode-support-through-2025-and-beyond">confirmation last December</a> that it would continue to support its rhythm game through "2025 and beyond". It made those assurances after revealing it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-waves-chequered-flag-on-rocket-racing-mode-themed-updates">no longer be releasing themed updates for Fortnite's Rocket Racing</a>, which has struggled to maintain player numbers since being introduced alongside Fornite Festival and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a> in 2023.
</p><p>
The arrival of Fortnite Festival's local co-op support on 14th January coincides with the end of the mode's current Snoop Dogg-themed season and the start of the next, which will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-hatsune-miku-crossover-coming-leaks-suggest">likely see Vocaloid popstar Hatsune Miku step in as the latest featured artist</a>.
