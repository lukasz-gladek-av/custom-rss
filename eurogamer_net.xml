            <p>
Nintendo will likely be the "primary partner for third-party game publishers" on console in five years, an analyst firm has forecast, by which time <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> will have hit 100m units sold.
</p>
<p>
A fresh report on the coming year in video games - and beyond - from veteran firm DFC Intelligence states that Nintendo is likely to beat its own forecast for Switch 2 sales this year, albeit slightly. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo has said it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-predicts-switch-2-will-outsell-its-predecessor-at-launch-despite-demand-exceeding-expectations">expects to shift 15m Switch 2 consoles before 31st March 2026</a>, though DFC forecasts Nintendo will in reality likely sell 16m - enough to say it has beat expectations. With supply chain improvements, sales could be even higher still - as many as 20m, DFC believes.
</p>
<p>
"Reflecting its historically conservative approach to new product forecasting, Nintendo is estimating sales of 15m Switch 2 units through the end of its fiscal year in March 2026," DFC wrote in its report, shared with Eurogamer. 
</p>
<p>
"When the original Switch launched in March 2017, Nintendo initially projected 10m units for the fiscal year but ultimately sold 15m units in that period. Based on that track record, the fact that Nintendo is forecasting a 15m unit number gives us confidence that they will be able to ramp up supply and navigate tariff challenges."
</p>
<p>
With the delay of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> to 2026, the launch of Switch 2 will be this year's biggest driver of video game spending - particularly so in Japan, DFC expects, where Nintendo has a competitively-priced local model for that market. 
</p>
<p>
Looking to the future, DFC says Switch 2 will hit 100m sales by 2029 and be the leading console system at that time. 
</p>
<p>
Both Sony and Microsoft have expressed interest in launching their own handheld devices, and both companies are also widely expected to be prepping their own next home consoles to arrive from 2027 onwards. But Nintendo launching Switch 2 now means it will have several years of headstart on PS6 and the next Xbox.
</p>
<p>
"DFC forecasts that by the end of 2029 the Switch 2 will have sold over 100m units making it the leading console system by a wide margin," the firm wrote. "The next few years could see Nintendo for the first time becoming the primary partner for third-party game publishers."
</p>
<p>
For context, Switch is currently on 152m sales after eight years. PlayStation 5 is on 74.9m after four and a half years. Xbox Series X/S is believed to be at around 30m units after the same time period, though Microsoft does not release official hardware figures.
</p>
<p>
Only seven console platforms have passed 100m over the years, with more than half from Nintendo: Game Boy/Color, Nintendo DS, Wii, Switch, PS1, PS2 and PS4. 
</p>
<p>
PS2 remains the best-selling console of all time at around 160m units sold - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-expects-switch-1-to-become-its-best-selling-hardware-ever-this-year-but-fall-just-short-of-ps2-record">though Switch 1 is giving it a run for its money, and now sits less than 8m consoles away</a>.

            <p>
The internet is currently driving to Canada via Google Maps, and I'm along for the ride. 
</p>
<p>
This is <a href="https://neal.fun/internet-roadtrip/">Internet Roadtrip, the next browser-based creation from Infinite Craft developer Neal Agarwal</a>, which launched last week and has since picked up momentum.
</p>
<p>
1610 so-called "drivers" are currently online, traversing the highways of New England via images from Google Streetview that update every 10 seconds. Just as with internet phenomenon <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> Plays Pokémon, viewers can collectively vote to determine which direction the car heads next.
</p>
<p>
Internet Roadtrip launched with its car initially placed upon the streets of Boston - there's a handy map to show the virtual vehicle's full journey to date - but after a brief foray to the city's southern suburbs it has been driven north ever since. 
</p>
<p>
Eight days later and Internet Roadtrip is now enjoying a slow drive north through the picturesque state of Maine, and there's currently discussion in its chat feed about stopping off at the tourist hotspot of Bar Harbor (which, to be fair, is lovely this time of year).
</p>
<p>
In a brilliant turn of events, Internet Roadtrip's journey through Maine has caught the attention of a local student-run radio station (WBOR), which spent some time curating songs to be picked up on the in-game FM radio.
</p>

</span></p><p>
Just as with Twitch Plays Pokémon, there's a fun community building in the chat - and a general consensus that the vehicle is headed north of the US border to Canada. Will it get there? And where will it go next? I'll be keeping an eye.
</p>
<p>For now, viewers are having fun remarking on some of the grandiose place names Maine features for some of its tiny rural towns. Travelling from state capital Augusta up to the border you can pass through Calais, Cambridge, China, Denmark, Lebanon, Madrid, Mexico and Moscow. As I write this, Internet Roadtrip is currently in South China, Maine.</p>
<p>
"What a pleasure to be able to peer into others' imaginations like this," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinite-craft-is-a-powerful-glimpse-into-other-minds">Christian Donlan wrote of Agarwhal's brilliant creation Infinite Craft</a> upon its launch last year. "It really does feel like a chance to see how your friends' brains truly work."

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s seven-year development journey might officially be at an end thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-last-ever-major-update-gets-a-long-awaited-release-date">April's final major update</a>, but Larian is still loitering around to hammer out the last few wrinkles. That brings us to its newly released Hotfix #31, which, among other things, excises some bits of "defunct dialogue" from an abandoned Minthara storyline inadvertently restored in Patch 8.
</p>
<p>
Baldur's Gate 3 fans have, of course, had fun eking out scraps of unused content over the years, curious to know what else Larian might have at one time planned. And studio boss Swen Vincke has even joined in on occasion, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-would-have-originally-let-you-recruit-a-major-villain">revealing cut locations and plans to allow players to recruit a prominent villain</a>. In 2023, for instance, the community <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z8WXh0qr7c">uncovered unused voice lines</a> referencing Minthara having a child (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/baldurs-gate-3s-latest-hotfix-quietly-removes-artifacts-of-a-cut-storyline-never-meant-to-be-heard/">PC Gamer</a>), which brings us full circle back today.
</p>
<p>
Footage <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BG3/comments/1k3jlf6/minthara_does_have_a_daughter_new_patch_8/">captured by fans prior to Hotfix #31</a> reveals some related dialogue - specifically a line about Minthara finding a "home for myself and my child" during her Speak with Dead scene - managed to sneak back into Baldur's Gate 3 as part of Patch 8's release. But as Larian states in its <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1086940">latest patch notes</a>, these potentially baffling bits of "defunct dialogue" are now no more.

<p>
Beyond that particular curiosity, Baldur's Gate 3's Hotfix #31 is, as expected, entirely focused on bug fixes, tidying up some annoyances relating to crashes and performance, subclasses, gameplay and scripting, photo mode, plus tool tips and UI.
</p>
<p>
As for what Larian is doing next now Baldur's Gate 3 is mostly all wrapped up, we still don't know. Vincke recently revealed the studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-boss-says-studio-didnt-do-dlc-because-it-was-the-boring-option">currently "deep in the trenches" of a "crazy ambitious" project</a> described as its "next big thing" - one of two projects it's currently working on. That doesn't mean we won't see more <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a>, however. Larian <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">definitely won't be involved</a>, but earlier this year Dungeons and Dragons owner Hasbro <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-wants-baldurs-gate-4-but-isnt-in-a-hurry">confirmed it's "very interested" in a new series instalment</a>, even if it's not in a hurry.

<p>Persona 5: The Phantom X is the next game in the Persona series, which has now collectively sold 22m copies. It's been co-developed by Chinese studio Perfect World, Atlus and Sega.</p>
<p>The spin-off was first revealed back in 2023 and has already had an open beta in China. It was unclear, until this week, whether a global release was on the cards. It's now received various improvements "to meet the needs of RPG fans in Japan, turning it into a game with a lot of polish to it", as stated during the livestream.</p>
<p>The team also wanted to ensure it met western standards before announcing a release. As it was first developed in Chinese, it needed to be localised into Japanese before moving to the English language version. And as the game is a live-service, it will require simultaneous updates across the globe.</p>
<p>Indeed, the livestream began with a typically stylish anime sequence, as has become standard for the series.</p>
<p>The release date was then revealed in a new trailer, combining cinematics with gameplay. You can expect the usual mix of social interactions, city and dungeon exploration, and turn-based combat, to give an authentic Persona experience.</p>
<p>Typically Persona games take place over a school year, but with this live-service version players will experience the world in real time. It features a new protagonist (codenamed Wonder) and his owl companion who becomes a Phantom Thief by night as he's plagued by mysterious visions from the Metaverse and must restore the stolen desires of the population.</p>
<p>The livestream also introduced other characters: popular fellow student Motoha Arai, awkward student Shun Kano, and the intellectual student Riko Tanemura.</p>
<p>The game will include Phantom Idols who act like Confidants alongside the protagonist in the Metaverse and are created in the Velvet Room. The stream showed a handful of these Idols, who were all new characters from P5X and each have their own backstory.</p>
<p>It follows two previous spin-off games from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5">Persona 5</a>: hack and slash sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-strikers">Persona 5 Strikers</a> and strategy game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-tactica">Persona 5 Tactica</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
