            <p>
It's already been a lengthy journey for developer Toby Fox's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/undertale">Undertale</a> follow-up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a>. The first of its seven planned chapters originally launched in 2018, and there are still three more to go - but we now know fans won't have too long to wait until the saga continues. According to the most recently released chapter's closing credits, part five will arrive next year.
</p>
<p>
Deltarune, which charts the adventures of human teenager Kris and their lizard friend Suzie in the mystery Dark World, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-creator-says-the-rest-of-deltarune-has-not-been-made-yet">debuted as a free download in 2018</a>, and a second instalment <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-chapter-2-arrives-this-week-on-pc">showed up in September 2021</a>. It's taken nearly four years for Fox and his team to get Chapters 3 + 4 wrapped up since then (both finally made their long-awaited debut <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-available-on-switch-1-and-2-through-cross-buy-when-it-launches-with-new-nintendo-console">alongside Switch 2's launch</a> earlier this month), but part five, thankfully, won't require so much patience from fans.
</p>
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapter-5-will-release-in-2026">IGN</a>, the closing credits of Deltarune's recently released fourth chapter conclude with the words, "To be continued in Chapter 5, 2026." That's still a fair way out, then, but at least we now know it won't be another four-year wait for more.

This isn't quite what Fox originally had in mind, of course; back in 2021 he said the goal was for Deltarune's third, fourth, and fifth chapters to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-creator-working-on-deltarune-chapters-3-to-5">all launch at the same time</a>, but he eventually conceded five was still some way off, and that he wouldn't deprive fans of their Deltarune fix purely to adhere to a simultaneous launch. "I don't think anybody really wants to wait that long to release anything," Fox explained at the time. "Especially me."
</p>
<p>
But while Chapter five is, comparatively speaking, right around the corner (assuming it's a corner at the end of a hallway that takes at least six months to walk down), we've had no indication of how long Deltarune's final two chapters might take to release. For all we know, the world will be orbiting a dying sun by the time Fox is ready to wrap things up in part seven, but at least Deltarune's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-is-a-game-about-playing-and-its-bloody-brilliant">already a good time</a>, even if it <em>is</em> some way from tying up all its loose ends.
