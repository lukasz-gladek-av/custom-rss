            <p>
Six weeks after Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-pulls-11-xbox-game-pass-trial-ahead-of-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release">yanked its Â£1/$1 Game Pass trial</a> in the run-up to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>'s release, the deal has now been reinstated as part of the company's Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotions - but only for PC.
</p>
<p>
As was the case prior to the offer's removal, that Â£1/$1 <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/xbox-game-pass">provides 14 days</a> to explore PC Game Pass' catalogue (sadly, Microsoft isn't reverting to the month-long variant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-11-xbox-game-pass-offer-cut-from-a-month-to-14-days">last seen in August 2023</a>). After that, trial members will be automatically signed up to a recurring monthly subscription unless they disable auto-renewal ahead of time.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft's next big first-party release, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-developers-super-thrilled-its-headed-to-playstation">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, arrives on 9th December, meaning it'll be available to play as part of PC Game Pass' newly revived trial. Console players, however, will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">need to pay full whack for Xbox Games Pass Ultimate</a> if they want to play via subscription on launch day.

<p>
The PC Game Pass trial is one of a number of discounts Microsoft has announced as part of its Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotion. It's also knocking <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/d/xbox-series-s/942j774tp9jn?icid=Cat-Xbox-CC1-XSS512GB-White-P93113-Holiday25-BF25&amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Â£50 off the 512GB Xbox Series S</a> and Xbox Series S Family &amp; Friends bundle, and there's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/d/xbox-series-x-certified-refurbished/8zj26xj5cr3q?icid=Cat-Xbox-CC3-XSXBSKU-P92988-Holiday25-BF25&amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Â£40 off refurbished consoles</a> too.
</p><p>
Additionally, there's 20 percent of a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/collections/xboxcontrollers?icid=Cat-Xbox-CC2-XWLC-P93114-Holiday25-BF25">selection of Xbox controllers</a> - including the Sky Cipher and Ghost Cipher variants - plus <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/d/xbox-series-x-console-wraps/8x08lwws1qh7">50 percent off the Xbox Series X Mineral Camo wrap</a> if you happen to live in a coral reef and are looking to try and disguise your machine.
</p>
<p>
Finally, those searching for something to play on their gently discounted new consoles can get "up to" 55 percent off a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/deals/games/xbox?icid=Cat-Xbox-CC6-XboxDigitalGames-DGS-Holiday25-BF25">variety of digital games on the Microsoft Store</a>. Mostly, these are older, lesser-known indies, but you'll find a couple of Like a Dragon titles in their too.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft notes its hardware offers will come to an end on 2nd December, but it sounds like the PC Game Pass trial will be sticking around for longer.

            <p>Yet another <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> Ultimate Raid world first challenge has been scuppered by cheaters, who were busted due to a single pixel.</p>
<p>Ultimate Raids are the toughest missions in the MMORPG, with many groups competing to be the first to complete them in an unofficial, community-led challenge. The recent patch 7.1 added another Ultimate Raid, Futures Rewritten, which became the third in a row to be impacted by scandalous cheaters.</p>
<p>The winning team was<a href="https://x.com/FrostyMog/status/1862341016126124204"> GRIND</a>, as shared by MogTalk creator and World Race tracker Frosty, at least initially. It soon transpired the team had been using a cheat hack, which was spotted due to a single pixel.</p>

<p>The incriminating pixel, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-14-world-first-raiders-busted-immediately-for-cheating-thanks-to-a-single-pixel-in-a-screenshot-making-it-the-3rd-scuffed-ultimate-race-in-a-row/">PC Gamer</a> explained, is indicative of the Pixel Perfect Plus plugin, which shows a character's exact hitbox. That's particularly useful when dodging AoE attacks in an Ultimate Raid, where the sheer number of attacks across battle arenas increases the difficulty dramatically.</p>
<p>Of course, third-party plugins are not allowed in Final Fantasy 14. As a result, Frosty has disqualified GRIND from the race.</p>

<p>Instead, <a href="https://x.com/FrostyMog/status/1862403138772189577">Kindred</a> has been awarded the world first clear of Future Rewritten. Frosty does note, however, that conversations must be had around the community-led challenge. Not all challengers stream their attempts (they wouldn't want others to copy), but that certainly makes it harder to police cheaters.</p><p>What's remarkable is that this is the third Ultimate Raid challenge in a row to be impacted by cheaters. Last year's world first clear of The Omega Protocol was revoked once it transpired the raid group was using third-party mods; the year before's Dragonsong's Reprise was a similar story.</p>
<p>After both of those challenges, director and producer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> shared his disappointment at the use of third-party mods.</p>
<p>"It is extremely disappointing for me personally to see this commotion surrounding third-party tools once again in the wake of what happened with Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)," he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-extremely-disappointed-in-final-fantasy-14-mod-use">wrote last year</a>. "As the individual who is entrusted with full supervision over Final Fantasy 14, it is my responsibility to enact countermeasures and police the use of these tools, as well as educate people to not use these types of third-party tools - this is especially unfortunate when I, as a gamer, am cheering on everyone who is learning this content by trial and error and putting in the effort to clear."</p>
<p>No such statement has yet been made following this year's controversy.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-cracks-down-on-final-fantasy-14-mods-as-director-promises-to-enhance-hud">Yoshida said the Final Fantasy 14 team</a> would "review the most prominent tools, and in order to discourage their use, endeavour to enhance the functionality of the HUD". And yet two years on, the use of these tools prevails.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>BBC investigation shows just two of Play Store's 45 highest-grossing games adhered to ASA standards.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The most popular mobile games "are being advertised without disclosing they contain loot boxes".</p>
<p>That's according to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c748ww9y9nno">BBC</a>, which said an investigation into the top 45 highest-grossing games on the Google Play store discovered just two games correctly advertised that they contained randomised in-game purchases.</p>

<p>Of the 45 investigated, 26 games were labelled in the online store as including loot boxes, 22 of which "were being actively advertised at the same time". Only two of those 22 games properly disclosed loot boxes in their advertising, with the Play Store's highest-grossing game, Monopoly Go, "among those not to mention random in-game purchases in its adverts".</p><p>"In the absence of robust regulation in gaming, it is essential for games to provide clear and transparent information about their features, allowing both parents and gamers to make informed decisions," said Dr Jane Rigbye, chief executive of Young Gamers and Gamblers Education Trust, adding the findings were "deeply concerning".</p>
<p>In a separate statement, the ASA told the BBC: "This is an ongoing area of our work, and we're closely monitoring the sector to discover the scale of compliance and act accordingly."</p>
<p>This time last year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-games-industry-to-restrict-access-to-loot-boxes-for-children">UK games industry agreed to restrict access to in-game loot boxes for children</a> via a set of industry guidelines.</p>
<p>The industry's trade association UKIE worked with the UK government to draft 11 Industry Principles as part of "improved protections for children, young people and adults following concerns raised about loot boxes". The Principles include the need to flag the existence of loot boxes in a game prior to purchase, a clear list of the probabilities for loot box contents, and the need for an easy refund policy.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
