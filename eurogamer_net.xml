In case you hadn't noticed, what with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a>'s launch and the annual Summer Geoffs causing all sorts of distractions, June is well and truly upon us. And Sony is marking the occasion - much as it does every month - with a fresh batch of additions to its PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium catalogue, which this time include Control spin-off FBC: Firebreak, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>, and more.
</p>
<p>
Sony's latest catalogue refresh takes place next Tuesday, 17th June, bringing a total of eight new games for PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers, alongside one further addition exclusive to the latter tier. You'll find the full list of June's titles below:
</p>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra:</h3>
<ul>
<li>FBC: Firebreak (PS5)</li>
<li>Battlefield 2042 (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted 2 (PS5)</li>
<li>theHunter: Call of the Wild (PS4)</li>
<li>We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Eiyuden Chronicles: Hundred Heroes (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Train Sim World 5 (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Endless Dungeon (PS4, PS5)</li>
</ul>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Premium:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Deus Ex: The Conspiracy (PS4, PS5)</li>
</ul>
<p>
So there're some decent arrivals, then, with highlights including Alan Wake developer Remedy Entertainment's promising co-op Control spin-off FBC: Firebreak, and the ever-delightful We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie. RPG fans, meanwhile, might get a kick out of Suikoden spiritual successor Eiyuden Chronicles: Hundred Heroes, and Amplitude's tower defence roguelike Endless Dungeon is also a good old time.
</p>
<p>
As for those forking out for Sony's top-tier membership, June's retro addition comes in the form of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a>: The Conspiracy - the PlayStation 2 adaptation of developer Ion Storm's cyberpunk immersive sim classic Deux Ex, which first hit the console back in 2002.
</p>
<p>
And that's your lot! All the above don't arrive until next Tuesday, 17th June, meaning you've still got some time to focus on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-your-ps-plus-catalogue-additions-for-may">last month's PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra additions</a> before your attention is yanked elsewhere.
