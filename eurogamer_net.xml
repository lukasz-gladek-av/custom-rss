            <p>
There's plenty of debate online around the difficulty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, but while most of us are struggling, speedrunners have already beaten the game in under 90 minutes mere days after release.
</p>
<p>
The record is moving fast, literally! Yesterday, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YaRbJ-y0tI">YouTuber Onaku</a> managed a Silksong any% speedrun in 1:46:47, but hours later <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If8bCzk3MCw">YouTuber BlueSR</a> managed a run in 1:26:20. What's more, the speedrunner will be aiming for an even quicker World Record time today.
</p>
<p>
I've linked to the runs of both speedrunners above, but of course these will be full of spoilers for anyone still back in the early game. Or perhaps you're keen to check out some expert strategies.

<p>
The <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/silksong">official speedrunning leaderboard</a> won't open until 1st October, at which point we'll have a firm idea of the World Record time and the official rules. Until then, speedrunners will be rapidly sharing their times on social media.
</p>
<p>
Judging by the game's achievements, it's possible to achieve 100 percent game completion in under 30 hours, but there's also an achievement for completing the game in under five hours (aptly named "Speedrunner"). So even if a run of just over an hour isn't achievable for you, those looking to gain all achievements will still need to complete an exceptionally fast run.
</p>
<p>
For comparison, the current <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/hollowknight">World Record for the original Hollow Knight</a> sits at just over 30 minutes!

            <p>It's not a good time for Bungie. This year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> expansion, The Edge of Fate, is widely regarded as one of the worst expansions the game has ever seen - a big feat to achieve when you're 11 years old. As intriguing as some of the new story developments in the expanding world of Destiny are, little could soften the impact of some atrocious decision-making from the sandbox and gear teams within the studio: the grind in Destiny has rarely been worse, and fans' patience for the MMOFPS is becoming increasingly thin.</p>
<p>Even the blowout reveal of what should have been a slam dunk for Bungie - a Star Wars collab <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2s-getting-two-paid-expansions-this-year-and-one-of-them-is-star-wars-themed">that was initially announced back in May</a> - has been met with apathy and disinterest. Renegades (to give the event its proper name) will be the first ever crossover-themed campaign in Destiny's complicated history, and operates in a muddy middle ground between full crossover and vague skin-based collab.</p>
<p>"Renegades merges Destiny's distinctive storytelling and gameplay with themes and elements drawn from the iconic sci-fi franchise," Bungie enthuses in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/09/destiny-2-renegades-star-wars-inspired-expansion-detailed-launches-december-2/">its own press release</a>. In the expansion, we "will defy the Vanguard" to pursue Drifter across Sol, navigating a world of shadows and syndicates in the new social hub, Tharsis Outpost, as we work across story missions to build a crew and resist a rising faction tied to the Nine.</p>

<p>As you can see from the video above, Renegades positions an activity called the Lawless Frontier front and center: per Bungie, it's "a chaotic, cooperative new game mode, where players take on a variety of high-risk jobs and contracts to earn reputation, unlock all-new Renegade abilities that change the tide of battle, and wield weapons that include the iconic Praxic Blade and an energy-based arsenal from the new Blaster archetype." A new dungeon is also promised to land after the expansion's launch on 2nd December.</p><p>But, frankly, who cares? This should have been a home run for Bungie - a big crossover like this is often catnip for MMO ride-or-dies - but the general consensus amongst the community at the moment is one of exhausted apathy. After the presentation that debuted information on both Renegades and the other incoming expansion, Ash &amp; Iron, the top post on Destiny's dedicated Subreddit reads: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1ncz9u7/i_think_tonight_this_is_a_breakpoint_for_many/">I think tonight this is a breakpoint for many people and Bungie as a whole</a>. Another bemoans "<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1ncz4yg/almost_everything_in_this_major_update_is/">Almost everything in this "Major Update" is reskinned/reissued, except [the paid shop]</a>", and every single top post in <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1nclax3/destiny_2_renegades_and_ash_iron_developer/">the dedicated megathread</a> about Renegades is critical of Bungie.</p>
<p>Now, I've been a member of /r/DestinyTheGame for about 12 years, and even since the early days (alpha and beta for D1!), the sub has had toxicity issues. Go figure. But this is something else: I don't think I've ever seen the community so fed up and bored with basically everything that is suggested.</p>
<p>The problem is three-fold: as well as Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-ceo-pete-parsons-steps-down-following-years-of-criticism-layoffs-and-that-infamous-classic-car-collection">losing key staff</a> that have overseen the Destiny vision since inception, the remaining designers have also implemented sandbox aspects players actively hate - namely, The Portal, a high-grind, low-reward anomaly of game design that actively punishes you for wanting choice in the things you do and the gear you equip. Decisions like these seem to manifest because of a studio culture<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-management-vehemently-shut-down-destiny-2-subscription-idea-as-reports-of-toxicity-continue"> that "stem from a lack of player empathy, disconnected leadership, and a corporate-first culture,"</a> per one recent report.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>At this point, it feels like Bungie's back is against a wall: player numbers are dropping, player satisfaction is low, and even massive crossover events like Star Wars are failing to stem the haemorrhaging. As a big new update lands, concurrent player counts on Steam are even struggling to reach 50k - a historic low for the game. Will this trend reverse by December, when the Star Wars update actually launches? We'll have to wait and see but right now, it doesn't seem likely.</p>

            <p>Dead Island 3 might not be officially announced, but current series developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/dambusterstudios">Dambuster Studios</a> has given a very serious hint, nod, and wink towards it being in development.</p>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/934700/announcements/detail/505086494235427243">Steam</a>, the developer gave a small, but rather obvious hint and what is coming next in the zombie-slaying series.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Dambuster Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<blockquote><p>It's been 14 years since Dead Island first splattered onto the scene, stranding players in the blood-soaked paradise of Banoi.</p>
<p>Since then, the zompocalypse has crawled from tropical shores to the sun-drenched chaos of HELL-A in Dead Island 2, where over 20 million Slayers have left nothing but carnage behind.</p>
<p>This isn’t the final cut though. Dambuster Studios are already carving out what comes next.</p>
<p>For now, the details stay under wraps, the outbreak is far from over…</p></blockquote>
<p>That's it as far as new information. From the teaser image, which appears to show <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a>'s Jacob trying to hitch a ride out of LA, we're definitely looking at the next game moving to a new location.</p>
<p>While there's a possibility this tease is for a stand-alone expansion of sorts, similar to Dead Island follow-up, Riptide, it's been two and a half years since Dead Island 2 released and a full titled sequel feels most likely.</p>
