            <p>Key members of The Elder Scrolls 6 team have shared an update on the highly-anticipated game's status, and the good news is development is "progressing really well".</p>
<p>According to Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a>, the "majority" of the studio is now working on The Elder Scrolls 6, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-announces-the-elder-scrolls-6">first announced all the way back in 2018</a>, though he noted the team "always overlap" when it comes to game development (as well as Elder Scrolls 6, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard-but-development-is-his-everyday-thing">the studio is also working on its Fallout series</a>).</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>"We're very used to overlapping development," Howard told <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development">Game Informer</a>, saying the studio has "long pre-productions on things so that we feel good about them". Howard added "it's a process", and one that everyone involved wishes went faster than it does. "But it's a process that we want to get right," the Bethesda exec said.</p>
<p>Bethesda's studio director Angela Browder added thanks to the "leaps and bounds" made in the industry and hardware since Skyrim, the "possibilities" for The Elder Scrolls 6 "are crazy".</p>
<p>"I will be honest, for me, sometimes I see things that are happening, and I go, 'Angela from Skyrim days could never have envisioned seeing this like this now', and that is a cool thing to be a part of," Browder said. "And it's a thing that I hope that when the day comes that our fans play it, that they - especially those of them who've been lifers with our brands - can really see how far it's all come."</p><p>Browder noted if you <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">compare the original Oblivion with this year's remaster</a>, "you can see how far" technology has really come. "So, to me, The Elder Scrolls 6 is this endless set of possibilities that is really, really exciting as a developer, but really, really exciting as someone who really likes to think about how far everything has come in our industry," the studio director said, before adding:</p>
<p>"It's gonna be dope. It's dope!"</p>
<p>During the same interview, design director Emil Pagliarulo said the "pressure" that the Elder Scrolls players put on Bethesda "we don't put on ourselves", though the developer understands why some get frustrated waiting for a game to come out.</p>
<p>"Games take a long time, and games get pushed all the time; GTA just got pushed again, which was the smartest thing they could do, because a game the size of these games, they take not just a long time to make, but a long time to spit and polish and iron out the bugs," Pagliarulo said. "And so, what do fans really want? Do they want a game that comes out before it should and doesn't meet their expectations? Or do they want the turkey that is in the oven for long enough to be delicious when it finally comes out of the oven, you know?"</p><p>So, to make sure The Elder Scrolls 6 comes out of the oven as a delicious turkey, Bethesda is going to take its time. How much time? Well, "as long as it needs to be to be great," Pagliarulo closed.</p>

<p>Back in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-wishes-hed-been-a-bit-more-casual-with-his-elder-scrolls-6-announcement">Howard admitted he wished he had been a little more casual with the game's announcement</a>. Additionally, in October 2023, Skyrim's lead designer Bruce Nesmith said Bethesda announced Elder Scrolls 6 when it did in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-6-revealed-so-early-due-to-pitchforks-and-torches">bid to appease any angry mobs which had their "pitchforks and torches" out</a>, desperate to know more.</p>
<p>More recently, though, many Elder Scrolls 6 fans thought they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/did-bethesda-just-drop-an-elder-scrolls-6-2027-release-date-tease-fans-think-so">found a clue pointing to a 2027 release date in a recent trailer for the Switch 2 edition of Skyrim</a>.</p>

            <p>The Last of Us co-director Bruce Straley has described generative AI as "a snake eating its own tail", discussing how easily use of the tech can be misinterpreted.</p>
<p>Straley left <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> back in 2017 and has now formed his own independent studio, Wildflower Interactive. In an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/bruce-straley-generative-ai-interview/">Polygon</a> about the studio's debut, Coven of the Chicken Foot, Straley revealed his staunch dislike of generative AI.</p>
<p>"It's a snake eating its own tail," he said. "It can't grow and think for itself, it just consumes, and it tries to mimic what it's consumed. That's the best it can do right now."</p>

<p>Generative AI has not been used in development of Coven of the Chicken Foot, Straley confirmed. However, he noted how the term AI has been used in gaming for decades, but has since become confused and conflated with the current use of generative AI.</p><p>"It's difficult to even pitch the concept of this creature, because in my world, NPCs are AI," Straley said. "AI programmers are a type of personnel you have on staff in the programming department. Now you can't say that because if somebody does have an opinion about AI, I can't now call this creature the most advanced AI companion. People are going to think we did machine learning, and LLMs, and all that. No, we did none of that. This is hard work, and a lot of problem solving, and a lot of creative thinking. Which I think makes it more charming.</p>
<p>"I like art that has chips and flaws. It's like pottery. It has imperfections because it didn't come out of the kiln right. That's the cool stuff about art."</p>
<p>Straley did admit generative AI could potentially be useful in certain instances, but he's not interested in using it.</p>
<p>"I feel like without a human being the creation, I personally have zero investment in wanting to watch a TV show made by a robot," he said. "I have zero interest in looking at art that is generated by a computer. I don't think prompting is art."</p><p>Straley's comments are timely, following those of Larian CEO Swen Vincke. In an interview with Bloomberg, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-is-using-generative-ai-confirms-ceo-but-divinity-wont-contain-anything-ai-generated">Vincke admitted to Larian using generative AI</a> as part of development. When this received backlash online, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/holy-fck-guys-were-not-pushing-hard-for-or-replacing-concept-artists-with-ai-larian-ceo-responds-to-genai-backlash">Vincke clarified that concept artists would not be replaced by AI</a>. Instead the studio uses "AI tools to explore references" and developers can "experiment with these tools to make their lives easier" if they wish to.</p>
<p>The backlash Larian received to Vincke's initial comment is testament to the strong immediate opinions the use of AI can generate.</p>
<p>Coven of the Chicken Foot was revealed at this year's The Game Awards showcase - we've got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">rundown of everything announced</a>.</p>

            <p>A second season of Dispatch is being discussed "as seriously as anything" at AdHoc Studio, and the team will sit down any day now and make a decision about it.</p>
<p>"People are mad that we haven't told them what we're doing," studio co-founder and Dispatch game director Nick Herman told me in an interview. "It's the new problem, right? It's like, are you doing it? Are you not doing it? We're days away from really sitting down and having the time - because we've had to support the game - where we're going to really sit down and lay those plans out."</p>
<p>I spoke to Herman and Pierre Shorette, the lead writer and another studio co-founder, as part of a longer interview live on Eurogamer now. But though Herman said the studio is yet to make a decision on Season 2, the ways they referenced a follow-up made it sound like a much surer thing.</p>
<p>When they talked about a cut Kpop idol-inspired character called Winter, for instance, and a love triangle he was involved in, Shorette joked that he could reinstate this for Season 2. "We should do that for Season 2," he said, before quickly adding: "<em>If </em>there is a Season 2!"</p><p>It was when I questioned them directly about a second series and how seriously the studio is talking about it, that Shorette said, "As seriously as anything." But though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-proves-episodic-gaming-is-back-with-a-capital-b-following-latest-player-milestone#:~:text=The%20episodic%20superhero%20workplace%20comedy,number%20also%20equates%20to%20sales.">Dispatch has been an obvious success, racing to 2m sales</a> and capturing a large and passionate fanbase, there are concerns internally about following it up.</p>
<blockquote><em>"You have your whole life to write your first album and then eight months to write your second"</em></blockquote>
<p>As Shorette explained: "The thing is, the tough thing is, it's like in music: you have your whole life to write your first album and then eight months to write your second. And there's a little bit of that feeling. We had <em>so</em> long with this - seven years is a lot of time. If anything, it would have been embarrassing if it was bad. I mean, you took fucking long enough! We're taking <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> amounts of time on this shit, you know - it better be good. I know we're not going to have that amount of time for Season 2 because we want to meet the demand."</p>
<p>Then Herman added: "There were <em>zero </em>expectations for Season 1 - external expectations. People just had to show up and enjoy it and not have a bunch of theories and stuff in their head. Season 2, if we do it, we know that's going to be an extra challenge."</p>
<p>"A lot of pressure," Shorette said. "It'll be about what it's not as much as what it is."</p>
<p>It might be a surprise to hear Dispatch was in development for several years but its journey was a twisting, turning one. From being a live-action television series to being dropped by a publisher half-way through, the game has had to survive some bumps. You can read all about it - and about that cut Kpop character and more - in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-of-dispatch-how-adhoc-rode-rejection-to-huge-success">a Making Of-style Dispatch interview</a> live on Eurogamer now.</p>

            <p>Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> has announced Fallout Season 3 is currently being written, just a day after season two premiered. What's more, collaborations between Fallout video games and this next entry in the popular TV show are being planned.</p>
<p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/fallout-season-3-scripts-fallout-76-game-tie-in-1236610167/">In an interview with Variety</a>, Howard revealed the current status of Fallout's next season, as well as how it will cross over with the games.</p>
<p>Howard explained: "For us on the game and TV show side, we're writing Season 3 now [...] We're having those conversations now of, what are we doing in Season 3 for the TV show and what elements can we bring into our games at that time when it comes out that don't feel forced or fake."</p>

<p>The Fallout series and games have already explored this sort of multi-media promotion, courtesy of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-76s-new-update-features-walton-goggins-as-the-ghoul-from-amazons-tv-series">Fallout 76's recent Burning Springs update</a>. Released earlier this month, Burning Springs starred Walton Goggins as The Ghoul, and featured several new bounty hunter missions for players to complete. It's free too, a nice touch to be sure.</p><p>The Fallout show has also acted as an opportunity to shoehorn Game Pass into the situation, as Amazon, Bethesda, and Samsung have partnered up to offer both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> and season one to Samsung TV owners for free via Game Pass. Head of Samsung Gaming Kevin Beatty told Variety he thought they were "extremely fortunate" to offer season one, and that he hopes they'll be able to stream season 2 in the future.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Todd Howard confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallouts-todd-howard-has-no-interest-in-becoming-bethesdas-version-of-marvel-cameo-king-stan-lee">he had no interest in taking up a Stan Lee style cameo in the Fallout show</a>, and didn't rule out the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation">possibility of an Elder Scrolls TV show in the future</a>. He was, however, tight-lipped about a Wolfenstein show.</p>

            <p>Swen Vincke, the CEO of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and Divinity developer Larain, has responded to the intense backlash the studio has received since its use of generative AI was confirmed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-is-using-generative-ai-confirms-ceo-but-divinity-wont-contain-anything-ai-generated"> the Larian CEO stated the studio is using generative AI to explore ideas, expand on internal presentations, develop concept art, and write placeholder text</a>, with Vinke saying "everyone at the company is more or less OK" with the way the technology is being implemented. He added the studio's upcoming and newly-announced release Divinity won't contain anything which has been AI-generated.</p>
<p>Soon after Vincke's statements went live, however, he was met with backlash from fans <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/anoxicart.bsky.social/post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g">as well as former Larian developers</a>, which prompted the studio head to respond with his <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001011042642505833"> own post</a>, stating: "Holy fuck guys we're not 'pushing hard' for or replacing concept artists with AI."  </p>

<p>The Baldur's Gate 3 head added Larian has "a team of 72 artists of which 23 are concept artists and we are hiring more", with the artwork they create being original and something Vincke is "very proud" of.</p>
<p>Continuing further, Vincke said he was "asked explicitly about concept art and our use of Gen AI" during the interview with Bloomberg. "I answered that we use it to explore things. I didn't say we use it to develop concept art. The artists do that. And they are indeed world class artists," he said.</p><p>Vincke stated the studio uses "AI tools to explore references", in the same way it uses the likes of Google and art books. "At the very early ideation stages we use it as a rough outline for composition which we replace with original concept art," he said. "There is no comparison."</p>
<p>Larian hires its team of creatives for "their talent", Vincke closed, and "not for their ability to do what a machine suggests". He again reiterated the team can still "experiment with these tools to make their lives easier".</p>

<p>In a further statement shared with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai">IGN</a>, Vincke again clarified that Larian is not looking to replace any of its developers with generative AI. It will also not be releasing a game which includes content made by the technology.</p>
<p>You can read Vincke's statement in full below:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We've been continuously increasing our pool of concept artists , writers and story-tellers, are actively putting together writer rooms, casting and recording performances from actors and hiring translators.</p>
<p>"Since concept art is being called out explicitly - we have 23 concept artists and have job openings for more. These artists are creating concept art day in day out for ideation and production use.</p>
<p>"Everything we do is incremental and aimed at having people spend more time creating. Any ML tool used well is additive to a creative team or individual's workflow, not a replacement for their skill or craft.</p>
<p>"We are researching and understanding the cutting edge of ML as a toolset for creatives to use and see how it can make their day-to-day lives easier, which will let us make better games. We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI.</p>
<p>"While I understand it's a subject that invokes a lot of emotion, it's something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone's working day better, not worse."</p></blockquote>

<p>While <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/braak.bsky.social/post/3ma53v5blo222">many remain unconvinced of Vincke's response</a>, others have pointed out Larian is far from the only beloved studio to admit to using AI. The "Expedition 33 team freely admitted using AI and just won the most awards ever in The Game Awards history," <a href="https://x.com/GenePark/status/2001061930547503396">Washington Post reporter Gene Park noted on social media</a>.</p><p>AI, of course, remains a key area of discussion across the industry, and reports of AI use are continuing to make headlines. Earlier this month, publisher Running with Scissors cancelled upcoming game Postal: Bullet Paradise - a co-op "bullet-heaven" first-person shooter from developer Goonswarm Games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/has-caused-extreme-damage-to-our-brand-and-our-company-reputation-running-with-scissors-cancels-postal-bullet-paradise-over-ai-generated-assets-two-days-after-reveal">after feedback to the reveal two days ago said much of the game appeared to have been made using generative AI</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, meanwhile, Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney said "AI will be involved in nearly all future production", so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">having Steam games disclose whether they were built with AI makes about as much sense as telling us what kind of shampoo the developers use</a>. More recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-and-elder-scrolls-boss-todd-howard-defends-ai-in-game-development-but-aims-to-protect-artistry-and-human-intention-in-his-games">Bethesda's Todd Howard shared his own thoughts on the use of AI in video games</a>, calling it a "tool" but one that can't replace human intention.</p>
<p>As for Larian, it is working on Divinity, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-announces-new-game-takes-ownership-of-desert-statue">announced at The Game Awards with a rather gruesome and unsettling trailer</a>. Vinke has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/divinity-will-be-a-turn-based-rpg-and-see-larian-unleashed-declares-ceo-swen-vincke-replacing-the-dd-system-with-one-made-for-a-video-game">since said Larian's upcoming game is the studio "unleashed"</a>, while confirming it will be a turn-based RPG.</p>
