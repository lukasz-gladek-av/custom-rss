            <p><strong>UPDATE 4.45pm UK:</strong> Well, that didn't take long. Kotaku report Ethan Gach has reported that Epic Games has issued a swift update after players quickly got Darth Vader to start swearing.
</p>
<p>"We pushed a hot fix within 30 minutes of this happening in-game," Epic said, "so this shouldn't happen again."

<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY 4.15pm UK:</strong>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> now lets you chat with Darth Vader, who wields the fully operational AI-generated power of the late James Earl Jones. 
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time Fortnite has featured the digital recreation of a now-deceased individual. Last year, it held a pop concert fronted by Juice Wrld, the young rapper and Fortnite fan who sadly died of an overdose in 2019.
</p>
<p>
But this is the first time Fortnite has let you voice chat with a character - any character, living or dead - and have them respond to you via generative AI.  Here's a look at how it works:

</p></div>
<p>And of course, people are already doing terrible things with it, such as getting Vader to say swears. Here's Epic Games' closely allied streamer LoserFruit, who has a skin in the game, encouraging Vader's potty mouth:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Streamer LoserFruit got AI James Earl Jones Darth Vader to say fuck in Fortnite. </p><p>The entertainment factor of the AI experiment so far seems limited to trying to break it. <a href="https://t.co/JuCCZZa4K7">pic.twitter.com/JuCCZZa4K7</a></p></div>â€” AmericanTruckSongs9 (@ethangach) <a href="https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1923391676812300777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

This frankly bizarre addition comes amidst Fortnite's ongoing Star Wars season, and after seminal Darth Vader voice actor James Earl Jones signed over the rights of his voice to Disney to enable the iconic villain's voice to continue. 
</p>
<p>
In the world of TV, this has already been used to generate Vader's voice for the Disney+ show Obi-Wan Kenobi. Now, Fortnite has partnered with Google's Gemini AI bot and ElevenLabs' Flash audio model to provide the late actor's vocals for players in real-time.
</p>
<p>"James Earl felt that the voice of Darth Vader was inseparable from the story of Star Wars, and he always wanted fans of all ages to continue to experience it," reads a statement issued today from the family of James Earl Jones. "We hope that this collaboration with Fortnite will allow both longtime fans of Darth Vader and newer generations to share in the enjoyment of this iconic character."</p>
<p>
Players aged under 13 will receive a prompt asking for parental permission to chat with Darth Vader, an <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/disney?lang=en-US">Epic Games FAQ page</a> states. You can also report Darth Vader, if he says something you don't like.
</p>
<p>
"When you talk with Darth Vader, we securely send voice audio to Gemini to generate Darth Vader's response," Epic Games wrote. "Your voice audio and transcriptions of it are not stored. If you report something Darth Vader says, we will only receive Darth Vader's responses."
</p>
<p>
For now, Darth Vader only understands and responds in English, the FAQ continues. *insert Wookie noise here*
</p>
<p>
The development comes after significant pushback by established (human, living) voice actors over the encroachment of AI in video games. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why">Eurogamer chatted with Commander Shepard voice actor Jennifer Hale</a> to find out the latest developments in the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike, with AI a key issue.
</p>
<p>
Earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-blocks-fortnites-return-to-iphone-in-us">Epic Games announced that Fortnite would be going offline on iPhone for the forseeable future</a> after Apple had "blocked" its return via the App Store in the US.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> is reportedly heading to Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, for a potential release later this year.</p>
<p>Sources close to Rockstar relayed the news to <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/exclusive-red-dead-redemption-2-for-nintendo-switch-2-may-arrive-this-year-1544753/">Gamereactor</a>, who corroborated with other sources.</p>
<p>It comes as Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has shared the company's "great optimism" for Nintendo's new console during its latest financial briefing.</p>

<p>Take-Two has four games headed to Switch 2: Borderlands 4, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> 7, and the 2K Sports games NBA 2K and WWE 2K.</p>
<p>Zelnick claimed this is a "bigger array of releases than we've ever offered before with a new Nintendo platform."</p>
<p>He continued: "Historically being a third-party in the Nintendo business has been a bit challenging. I think Nintendo's been very forthcoming in addressing that, and we're stepping up too because we have great optimism for the platform."</p>
<p>Zelnick then commented on other potential games heading to Switch 2. "In terms of what we would bring to any platform, we address it on a case-by-case basis," he said. "We obviously want to be where the consumers are. But we would not necessarily bring every title to every platform. There are also great catalogue opportunities as well."</p>
<p>Could Red Dead Redemption 2 be one of those catalogue opportunities?</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-4-for-ps5-xbox-series-xs-reportedly-in-development-could-release-this-year">rumours emerged of a GTA 4 port for modern consoles</a>, with reliable insider Tez2 stating "by now it should've gone up a year in development". Perhaps that will include Switch 2.</p>
<p>Zelnick has also commented on the recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">delay of GTA 6</a> into next year, stating the decision was made to ensure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delay-so-rockstar-could-achieve-its-creative-vision-with-no-limitations-says-take-two-boss">Rockstar "achieves its creative vision with no limitations"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
