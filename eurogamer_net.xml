            <p>Eagle-eyed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> players have spotted a new feature on the weapon selection menu.</p>
<p>Right at the top there now <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1kyfyzm/really_i_have_to_see_this_shit_now_even_in_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">sits advertisements promoting premium weapons and skins</a>, so players get exposed to ads for microtransactions in-game.</p>
<p>As some players point out, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1kylh9d/comment/muyu6jx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">it's not an advert in the classic sense</a>, and no one's trying to flog you a cheeseburger or a pair of jeans every time you swap a weapon. Nonetheless, it's a new and insidious addition that we haven't seen in Call of Duty games before.</p>

<p>"One of the unwelcome changes I’ve noticed with Season 4 is that they’ve now inserted a new ad spot at the top of the list of your weapon specifics builds," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1kylh9d/season_4_brings_new_ad_spot_in_game_for_weapons/">wrote</a> one player. "So now every time you toggle between weapon builds you get to stare at ads for $20-$30 skins. I’m sure the Activision developer who suggested this terrible feature is very proud of themselves.</p>
<p>"This change is especially unneeded because you could already toggle from Builds to Shop on any given weapon and apparently not being thrown directly in our faces didn’t make them enough money. Many of us payed [sic] $60-$100 for a feature game and don’t want to be bombarded with additional ads."</p>

<p>Earlier this year, in a  update shared on social media, developer Treyarch said it recognised cheaters "are frustrating and severely impact the experience for our community" but insisted it was addressing the issue, and will continue to do so "throughout 2025". At the same time, it confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-bans-another-136000-cheaters">136,000 ranked play accounts were banned for cheating across both Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Elden Ring Nightreign already has a duos mode mod.</p>
<p>Luke Yui - yes, the same Luke Yui behind the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s Seamless Co-op and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-sekiro-mod-lets-you-play-co-op-and-pvp-with-your-friends">Sekiro's co-op mod</a> - had a mod up and running within hours of Nightreign's launch to support pairs of players that would rather play as a duo instead of Nightreign's requirement to pop you into a three-player fireteam.</p>

<p>"There will be more to come, but whilst the current game lacks 2-player modes, this mod will be available in this state," Yui wrote on his <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/3">Nexus Mod page</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-already-has-a-two-player-co-op-mod-on-pc/1100-6531963/">Gamespot</a>). "This mod will be expanded on in the future.</p>
<p>"There's no way to get banned using this mod unless you modify it with the intent of connecting to vanilla players," Yui added, noting that compatibility hadn't been tested against other mods.</p>
<p>As Ed wrote in his review, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/should-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-solo">he wouldn't recommend Nightreign as a solo game</a> at this point as it's "clearly not the intended way to play". However, it seems FromSoftware is aiming to respond to the current backlash to make solo play more feasible, with the studio previously stated it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-could-receive-two-player-mode-post-launch">considering a two-player option post-launch</a>, acknowledging it was "something that was overlooked during development".</p>
<p>"FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off is an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour," Ed wrote in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.</p>
<p>If you've jumped into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> this weekend and have struggled to find a Player 2 - and/or a Player 3 - you're not alone. In a brief statement posted to official Elden Ring social media accounts over the weekend, FromSoftware is recommending players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoft-acknowledges-issues-with-elden-ring-nightreign-matchmaking">"restart the matchmaking process" if they're struggling to find a co-op partner</a>. It later also suggested players check their NAT type.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>People Can Fly has cancelled two projects and "scaled down" its teams.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7334906069715972096/">statement</a> posted to LinkedIn this afternoon, CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski said it had been a "difficult decision" but attributed the suspension of Project Gemini and Bifrost to the publisher "not present[ing] us with a draft of the subsequent content rider to the Publishing Agreement", and the Group's cash flow, "which showed a lack of prospects", respectively.</p>
<p>"Today we made a very difficult decision to suspend the development of project Gemini and project Bifrost - the relevant current reports have been released to the market," Wojciechowski wrote.</p>
<p>"The suspension of the Gemini project is a consequence of the fact that the Publisher has not presented us with a draft of the subsequent content rider to the Publishing Agreement covering the terms and conditions of further milestone on project Gemini and the lack of communication from the Publisher as to its willingness to continue or terminate the Gemini project.</p>
<p>"Project Bifrost was suspended due to the above and the analysis of the Group's cash flow, which showed a lack of prospects for securing organisational resources and funds necessary to continue the production and release of this project.</p>
<p>"As a result, we have to significantly regroup as a studio and scale down our teams, which hurts the most," Wojciechowski added. "We wish to express our deepest regret and sadness over how these events have unfolded and our sincere gratitude for everyone's contribution up to this point."</p>
<p>Wojciechowski did not specify which publisher he thought had failed to "communicate", but the studio has worked with several publishing partners, most recently <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, Krafton, and Sony.<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-e-day-dev-the-coalition-drafts-in-people-can-fly-as-partner-studio"> It's also working on Gears of War: E-Day</a>. </p>
<p>In December, People Can Fly the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outriders">Outriders</a> developer announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outriders-developer-people-can-fly-reportedly-lays-off-over-30-employees">second round of layoffs in less than a year</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outriders-studio-people-can-fly-cuts-more-than-120-jobs-in-second-round-of-layoffs-this-year">this time affecting "more than 120" people</a>. The move accompanies the cancellation or downsizing of several projects, with the studio blaming "external market pressures".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has double-doubled down on comments about the cost of Borderlands 4, by inviting "cost sensitive" fans to download <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tiny-tinas-wonderlands">Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</a> from the Epic Games Store for "FREE".</p>
<p>These latest comments come after Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford made headlines when he told a X/Twitter commenter that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/80-for-borderlands-4-too-costly-randy-pitchford-says-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen">"real fans" would find a way to get their hands on a copy of the game, even if it came with a $80 price tag.</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-randy-pitchford-seeks-to-justify-80-real-fans-comment">He later tried to justify it</a>, all the while saying pricing was "not [his] call".</p>
<p>In this latest social media post, Pitchford wrote the word "free" four times, each time in blockcaps.</p>

<p>"For our real fans who may be cost sensitive, the very awesome and incredibly fun smash hit videogame Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands is FREE this week on the Epic Games Store," Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1928506669996134705">wrote</a>. "Please enjoy this FREE gift by grabbing your FREE copy here, FREE."</p>
<p>Aforementioned real fans were quick to respond to this comment, too.</p>
<p>"You don't get to just walk back being incredibly tone-deaf to the world around you. We are out here struggling, Randy," <a href="https://x.com/Bungied2theTree/status/1928507212567097682">said</a> one player, while another <a href="https://x.com/TastyThumbs/status/1928512933576781858">wrote</a>: "Dude you need to shut up already. No reason games should be $80 especially if its anything like 3 or that shit ass excuse of a movie."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid the industry is moving in that direction and it’s just reality that we'll have to accept," Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1928518680968634658">insisted</a>. "The price for Borderlands 4 is going to get announced by the publisher soon. My wish, having worked my ass off on the game, is for as many people as possible to get to play it."</p>
<p>When <a href="https://x.com/Lt_Frost935/status/1928508928851325080">another</a> commented: "So Randy, you think making backhanded comments towards your consumers about them being 'cost sensitive' is the plan? Wtf happened to you," he <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1928517946726396351">responded</a>: "Backhanded? There are literally people who want to play great video games, have a game-ready PC, but may not be able to spend enough to buy a new AAA game for awhile and this week there’s a free offer for one of the best shooter looters to come out over the last five years…"</p>
<p>"Saying 'cost sensitive' as the CEO of a company (In lieu of criticism of an $80 price tag for BL4) when a lot of your fan base is struggling to even pay for the roof over their heads and food on their tables is a crazy sentence to utter," said another <a href="https://x.com/Frost2dd/status/1928514727023411472">player</a>.</p>
<p>Just a week before the "real fans" kerfuffle, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/play-borderlands-4-first-and-understand-the-choices-weve-made-randy-pitchford-tells-fans-querying-minimap-removal">Pitchford implored we "play the game first and understand the choices [the development team has] made"</a> before passing judgement on changes Gearbox has made to the shooter's head's up display, including the removal of the mini-map.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4, as we learned a couple of weeks ago, is now arriving earlier than expected on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-forward-perhaps-because-2k-knows-exactly-when-gta-6-is-coming-out">12th September</a>, and developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-some-new-borderlands-4-gameplay-to-go-with-that-revised-release-date">Gearbox recently shared more of its latest looter shooter in a new PlayStation showcase</a>. It showed off a couple of new Vault Hunters, some of its new weapons, new traversal mechanics, its new planet, and more all to whip-up enthusiasm for what creative director Graeme Timmins called "hands-down our best Borderlands ever".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Kinetic Games has confirmed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>'s next content drop, Chronicle, will release on 24th June, and it'll be its "biggest update yet".</p>
<p>As well as introducing a "total overhaul" of how evidence is collected, the team said Chronicle will expand investigations with three new evidence types, a completely redesigned Journal, reworked levelling and progression, a refreshed Main Menu UI, and "many eerie surprises still lurking in the dark".</p>

<p>But at the "heart" of the Chronicle update is the debut of the all-new Sound evidence. An entirely new haunting paranormal proof type can be captured through the new Sound Recorder, bringing "a new dimension to gameplay, revealing subtle clues that might otherwise be drowned out by terrified screams". Available in the customary three upgrade tiers, players will be able to record audio from ghost events, Spirit Box responses, and Paranormal Sounds like those detected by the Parabolic Microphone.</p>
<p>It's this new evidence type that's necessitated a Journal upgrade, too. The Photo tab will be rebranded as "Media", and keep all your photos, videos, and new sound recordings in one place. Importantly, you'll have to fill your journal with all these unique media types, including "EMF spikes to ghostly interactions and fleeting glimpses of otherworldly forms", to complete a "perfect" investigation.</p>

<p>"Chronicle will also introduce a revamped media quality system," Kinetic teased. "The first evidence capture of any media type will be marked as 'Unique', granting extra cash and XP rewards at the end of each contract. Any subsequent captures of the same evidence type will be classed as 'Duplicates', offering smaller rewards. The new system will also add tier bonuses based on the equipment used and adds all media captures into the Reward Multiplier, making every shot, sound, and sight count even more toward player’s final payouts."</p>
<p>Don't forget that this year, Phasmophobia will also rework Grafton Farmhouse, following Bleasdale Farmhouse's recent overhaul. Before then, though, we'll also get to see the new levelling and progression system and Main Menu UI when Chronicle arrives at the end of June.</p>
