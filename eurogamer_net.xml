            <p>Young Alfie Williams reckons <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> should introduce his character from 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple into the multiplayer slasher-fest.</p>
<p>Williams was chatting with IGN's lovely social producer Mat Jones about the 28 Years Later sequel, when conversation turned to video games and Dead by Daylight. Now, when I say young Alfie Williams, I really do mean young. Williams is, at the time of writing, only 15.</p>

<p>However, the actor - who plays Spike in both 28 Years Later and the newly-released sequel The Bone Temple - says that the previous inclusion of Stranger Things' characters by in Dead by Daylight proves that minors can be part of the bloody fray, so, really, why shouldn't the team include him?</p>
<p>"I know they bring Stranger Things in, so they can have minors in the game," Williams reasoned. He added he believes Dr. Ian Kelson, played by Ralph Fiennes in both films, would probably be quite a good fit for a Dead by Daylight survivor.</p>
<p>You can check out the full exchange with Williams and Mat below.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>28 Years Later: The Bone Temple star Alfie Williams wants to get a collab with Dead by Daylight:</p><p>"I know they're bringing Stranger Things in, so they CAN have minors in the game." <a href="https://t.co/DCdKMGWujc">pic.twitter.com/DCdKMGWujc</a></p></div>— IGN (@IGN) <a href="https://twitter.com/IGN/status/2012351328685556026?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

<p>As well as Stranger Things, other Dead by Daylight collaborations have included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-details-its-walking-dead-collaboration-as-public-test-build-go-live">The Walking Dead</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-celebrates-ninth-anniversary-with-five-nights-at-freddys-and-the-witcher-collaborations">Five Nights at Freddy's, The Witcher</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nicolas-cage-is-now-available-in-dead-by-daylight">Nicolas Cage</a> (who was able to fake his own death).</p>
<p>Given all that, a 28 Years Later collaboration is hardly out of the question, though I do think I would feel a little uneasy hunting down a child. What do you think of Williams' idea to feature Spike in Dead by Daylight?</p>

            <p>Rockstar has helped a terminally ill fan play <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> ahead of its November release date.</p>
<p>In a heartfelt plea on LinkedIn, developer at Ubisoft Toronto, Anthony Armstrong, reached out to colleagues and peers at Rockstar about a month ago to ask if they could help a member of their family who had been given "the worst possible news", and could may well lose their battle with cancer before the highly-anticipated sequel release.</p>

<p>"To any of my connections at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> and Rockstar Toronto, or anyone else that may be able to help. A member of my family who has been battling cancer for years just recently got the worst possible news, he was given 6-12 months to live," Armstrong wrote in a now-deleted post (thanks, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-terminally-ill-fan-wish-play-gta-6-early/">Insider Gaming</a>).</p><p>"The reason I'm reaching out is that they are a huge GTA fan and, with this latest updates [sic], he may not be around long enough to actually get to see GTA6 launch, best case scenario he will be leaving us the same month it does. He currently lives only a stones throw from the Oakville studio, so its my hope that one of you may be able to set up an exclusive playtest, so he can have a chance to experience the game, before passing.</p>
<p>"I absolutely understand the need for secrecy at this point of development, so at the very least an NDA is probably needed. If anyone could send me a private m[e]ssage about this or provide any contact who could point us in the right direction, please do."</p> <div>

<p>Fast forward a few weeks, and Armstong was able to provide an update: "The CEO of Take-Two reached out and we are just waiting to hear from the Rockstar team to discuss this further. Thank you to everyone who has shown support, reshared, and reached out to your contacts for us."</p>
<p>The final update said: "We spoke to them today and got great news. That's all I can really say, but thank you all from the bottom of my heart".</p>
<p>Last November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> published its latest financial report, revealing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">GTA 6 had been delayed from 26th May, 2026 to 19th November, 2026</a>. According to Take-Two, this delay is designed to give "some additional time to finish the game with the high level of polish players expect and deserve. Rockstar has our full support, of course, and we are confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience".</p>
