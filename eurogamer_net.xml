            <p>EA and Battlefield Studios have announced that an extraordinarily low number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> games were ruined by cheaters in a recent blog post.</p>
<p>The post, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1994436727516107251">shared on the Battlefield Comms Twitter account</a>, broke down the performance of EA's Javelin kernel-level anti-cheat. Roughly 98 percent of online matches in the first week post-launch were cheater free in Battlefield 6.</p>
<p>Part of the anti-cheat's success has been attributed to the "invaluable" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-battlefields-biggest-open-beta-ever-says-ea">Battlefield 6 open beta</a>. EA states that over 1.2m cheat attempts were blocked. In addition, users' adoption of Secure Boot leaped from 62.5 percent to 92.5 percent, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bios-shock-getting-past-battlefield-6s-anti-cheat-error-was-the-faffiest-thing-a-pc-game-has-ever-required-of-me">a feature that proved frustrating for many</a> but nonetheless is core to Battlefield 6's anti-cheat system.</p>

</figure>
<p>EA stated the anti-cheat efforts continue, with the total block figure now up to 2.39m (each block meaning an individual attempt to use cheating software). Sadly, there are still 1.5 percent of impacted players unable to activate Secure Boot on their PCs, meaning they can't actually launch and play Battlefield 6 even after troubleshooting efforts.</p>
<p>Finally, EA is aware of 190 cheat-related programs, hardware, vendors, and resellers. The post states: "183 of them (96.3 percent) have announced feature failures, detection notices, downtime, and/or taken their cheats offline entirely."</p>
<p>The post concluded by laying out a variety of steps the EA team will take to improve the anti-cheat moving forward, the war between cheaters and anti-cheat software being an endless struggle. Still, as it stands today, these are impressive statistics that show Battlefield 6 should be a largely fair and enjoyable game to play online. Here's hoping EA can keep this momentum through to the foreseeable future.</p><p>

Battlefield 6 remains very popular, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-dominates-steam-charts-ahead-of-worldwide-release-as-analyst-estimates-over-100m-in-pre-launch-sales">even as the staggering launch drifts into the past</a>. If you've not tried it out yet, why not read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">Eurogamer's Battlefield 6</a> review to get an idea of what EA's latest AAA shooter is like.

            <p>Over the weekend, The Game Awards organiser <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> set social media tongues wagging with three words: regal.inspiring.thickness.</p>
<p>No, despite what I first thought, these are not the three words he used to describe himself on his Tinder profile. Rather, they link to a location via a What3Words address. And, that location leads to a spot near Joshua Tree, California.</p>

<p>As you can see in the image I took this morning from the What3Words app, regal.inspiring.thickness is a rather barren looking area in California.</p>
<p>Well, at least, it may have once been, but others have since ventured forth to the spot, and discovered a large and rather imposing statue now standing proudly in a field in the Mojave Desert, on the corner of 29 Palms Highway and Yucca Mesa Road.</p>
<figure>

<p>The statue itself shows a group of demonic creatures all surrounding a hellish-looking portal type design. This portal area lights up at night, as you can see via the second image below, with a fiery and quite ominous glow.</p>
<p>Many have surmised that this is all part of a tease for The Game Awards 2025, which is set to kick off later this month, on 11th December. But, what is it teasing exactly? The current most popular theory out there is an expansion or something similar for Blizzard's Diablo series. The statue's hellish iconography certainly would fit the bill.</p>

<p>Others have speculated the statue could be related to God of War, with earlier rumours suggesting the series would be heading to Egypt. Housemarque's next game Saros has also been mentioned in various replies and social media posts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, many wishful thinkers have suggested it could be a statue leading up to a big Elder Scrolls 6 reveal, or perhaps a new Doom installment. I have also seen others mention Half Life 3.</p>

<p>Whatever it may all end up being, there is not too much longer to find out. The Game Awards 2025 will take place on Thursday, 11th December, at 7:30pm EST. That's very early in the morning on the 12th, if you are in the UK. Leading the nominations at this year's event is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">which is up for 12 awards</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-control-trademark-sparks-speculation-remedy-will-be-making-a-the-game-awards-announcement">trademark for something known as Control: Resonant was registered in Europe</a>, leading many to speculate developer Remedy has something up its sleeve for The Game Awards.</p>
