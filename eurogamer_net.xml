            <p>The creative director of Insomniac's upcoming Wolverine game has moved across to Xbox, and joined the team working on the Perfect Dark reboot.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wolverine-perfect-dark-brian-horton-playstation-xbox">Game File</a>, Brian Horton hasn't been part of the PlayStation Marvel project since the summer. Horton was announced to be serving as Wolverine's creative director back in 2021.</p>
<p>The game will now be led by Marcus Smith, who has taken on the role of creative director in Horton's stead. Mike Daly is Wolverine's game director, while the game's previously announced game director Camerson Christain will remain with Insomniac, but will serve in a different role. Smith and Daly previously worked together on Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, as creative director and game director.</p>

<p>According to sources close to the matter, the recent changes on the Wolverine development team are "the result of creative decisions around the game".</p>
<p>Following his departure from Playstation, Horton has now moved to Xbox, where he has joined the Perfect Dark reboot team as creative director. Horton will be "bringing his wealth of experience to the upcoming reboot of the classic secret agent series," an Xbox representative said.</p><p>We finally got a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/at-long-last-the-perfect-dark-reboot-gets-a-first-gameplay-trailer">gameplay for the Perfect Dark reboot back in June</a> during an Xbox showcase, four years after the game's initial announcement. The reboot is being co-developed by Microsoft's The Initiative and Embracer-owned Crystal Dynamics (where Horton once worked on Tomb Raider). In May, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-perfect-dark-reboot-reportedly-in-a-very-rough-state-and-a-big-protracted-mess">described as still being in a "very rough state"</a>.</p>
<p>There's still no release window for the Perfect Dark reboot yet but it'll be a day one Game Pass title when it arrives.</p>
<p>As for Wolverine, it was first announced in several years ago, but little official has been heard about the project since. </p><p>In 2023, Insomniac was subject to a cyber attack, following which people were playing - and uploading footage - of an<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/people-are-posting-footage-of-marvels-wolverine-from-stolen-early-version"> incomplete early development build of the game</a>, found within the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-investigating-insomniac-hack-which-reportedly-leaked-wolverine-files-and-employees-personal-data">files stolen from the developer by ransomware hackers</a>. Insomniac issued a statement following this incident stating: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-developer-issues-statement-addressing-hack">Like Logan... Insomniac is resilient</a>."</p>

            <p>
Microsoft boss Satya Nadella has called last week's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> launch the "biggest Call of Duty release ever", saying its arrival set a record for "Game Pass subscriber adds on launch day."
</p>
<p>
News of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's success came amid Microsoft's Q1 FY2025 financial earnings report, which once again saw the company recording notable gains in gaming revenue, up 43 percent year-over-year. That's alongside a 61 percent year-on-year increase for Xbox content and services revenue, although growth was primarily a result of Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">$69bn Activision Blizzard acquisition</a>. In contrast, the company's Xbox hardware revenue has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-console-sales-decline-continues">continued to fall</a>, this time by 29 percent year-on-year.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> acquisition also helped provide more good news for investors, thanks to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's recent arrival. While opening weekend numbers saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-uk-physical-sales-drop-in-shift-to-game-pass">physical sales of Black Ops 6 fall by 10 percent in the UK</a> compared to Modern Warfare 3, likely due to its day one appearance on Game Pass, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella trumpeted the launch in an earnings call today, calling Black Ops 6 the "biggest Call of Duty release ever".

<p>
While Nadella didn't share specific figures to illustrate his claims, he noted Black Ops 6's launch had set a "record for day one players as well as Game Pass subscriber adds on launch day." That Game Pass metric was previously rolled out last year when Nadella announced Bethesda's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> had "set a record for the most Game Pass subscriptions added on a single day ever", indicating higher numbers for Black Ops 6. However, it remains to be seen if those numbers prove sufficient for Microsoft, given Black Ops 6's Game Pass launch marks a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/analysts-reckon-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-could-bring-up-to-4m-new-game-pass-subscribers">critical test</a> for its subscription service strategy following its Activision Blizzard acquisition.
</p><p>
Nadella also revealed Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's opening weekend had attracted the highest number of PC players in the franchise's history, while unit sales on PlayStation and Steam were said to be up 60 percent year-over-year. Black Ops 6 developer Treyarch repeated many of Nadella's record-setting claims in a <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1851753565900927282">message shared on social media</a>, adding that Black Ops 6 had also seen the highest number of total players, hours played, and total matches played during a three-day opening weekend in Call of Duty's history.
</p>
<p>
But how has it gone down with the critics? Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell shared his thoughts on Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's "nonsensical, but surprisingly intimate" campaign earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review">calling it</a> a "return to form for the series, mixing the usual, slightly unsavoury real-world set dressing with cracking action, horror twists and tongue-in-cheek charm." We'll be reaching a verdict on Black Ops 6's multiplayer component at a later date.

            <p>
Nightingale developer Inflexion Games has announced the closure of its UK office and the "restructuring" of its Canadian studio, saying its Victorian fantasy survival game's early access launch "hasn't been successful enough to continue [at our] previous size".
</p>
<p>
Nightingale released into Steam early access back in February, hitting a peak of 47,569 concurrent players. But as those numbers rapidly dwindled and reviews remained middling, Inflexion boss Aaryn Flynn <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nightingale-developer-admits-its-not-happy-with-games-current-state-after-disappointing-launch">admitted</a> things were "not quite where we want them to be". Six months later, Flynn shared a similar sentiment despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nightingale-introduces-highly-requested-offline-mode-in-new-early-access-update">efforts to improve the situation</a>, telling players, "We are not satisfied with where the game is at, we're not satisfied with the overall sentiment, we're not satisfied with our player numbers".
</p>
<p>
And, unfortunately, Inflexion is now beginning to feel the impact of Nightingale's early access struggles more acutely. Following last week's <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/inflexion-games-uk-division-is-reportedly-closing-down">reports</a> Inflexion was poised to close its UK arm, the studio has confirmed the news in a <a href="https://x.com/PlayNightingale/status/1851671600078143563">message shared on social media</a>.

<p>
"The past few weeks here at Inflexion have been incredibly challenging, and no words can adequately express the sadness we feel," Flynn wrote in the statement. "Like many other studios over the past few years, we have been hit by the stark realities of the industry, and after exploring every possible option, we've had to make the difficult decision to let go of some of our remarkable and talented team members." Flynn did not specify the extent of the layoffs, but <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dozens-of-staff-laid-off-at-inflexion-as-part-of-restructuring">GamesIndustry.biz sources</a> claim "at least 22 people" will be impacted by the reductions "based on internal communications they've had access to."
</p><p>
"Although we're proud of what we've accomplished with Nightingale to date - as well as the enthusiasm and support from our community," Flynn continued, "the Early Access release hasn't been commercially successful enough to continue development at our studio's previous size. As a result, we're undergoing a restructuring process in Canada, and we will also be closing our UK office. Our priority is to support each member of the team affected by the reductions as they search for new opportunities. We thank them for their invaluable contributions to Nightingale - it would not have been possible without their immense talent and passion for adventuring in the Faewilds".
</p>
<p>
"While this is a difficult moment for the entire team, we will continue to work tirelessly, alongside our players, as we move forward as a studio", Flynn concluded, adding he would be "available to answer questions from the community" and providing more details on future Nightingale updates soon. "I hope our players will join me in expressing heartfelt thanks to our departing team members for everything they've contributed to."
</p>
<p>
Today's news continues a devastating 2024 for the games industry, with around 13,000 industry employees believed to have lost their jobs since the start of the year - and that's in addition to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">10,500 workers laid off in 2023</a>. So why are these layoffs occurring? GamesIndustry.biz's Chris Dring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">shared his thoughts</a> earlier this year.
