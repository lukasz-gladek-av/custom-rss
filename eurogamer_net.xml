            <p>
Capcom just dropped a clever Resident Evil 9 teaser right in front of our noses - or so fans believe.
</p>
<p>
Tilt your head and you can see the Roman numerals for the number nine - IX - appear in a video published today from Capcom that celebrates the success of its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a>.
</p>
<p>
As the video wraps up, we see a fresh paint on a sign added to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>'s iconic village scene, with writing that thanks fans for playing. But squint and the sign's shape is also a nod to what's next, fans think. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-casually-announces-next-resident-evil-game-from-resident-evil-7-director">Capcom already casually confirmed Resident Evil 9 was in development last summer</a> - with Resident Evil 7 director Koshi Nakanishi back at the helm.

<p>
But details of Resident Evil 9 are otherwise scarce - we don't even know if Resident Evil 9, or IX, will be its title, though today's apparent teaser seems to suggest this may be the case. 
</p>
<p>
One report from veteran Resident Evil leaker Dusk Golem <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-will-be-open-world-leaker-suggests">suggested the next Resi game would feature more of an open-world</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We're making a new Resident Evil," Nakanishi said last year. "It was really difficult to figure out what to do after Resident Evil 7, but I found it, and to be honest, it feels substantial. I can't share any details just yet, but I hope youâ€™re excited for the day I can."
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, if you tilt your head the other way, Capcom is already teasing Resident Evil 11. But that seems a little soon.

<p>An infographic accompanying the news specifically said this figure related to <em>sales</em> of the game, so it would appear this does not include those playing via Xbox's Game Pass subscription service.</p>
<p>This ultimately means more than half a million of us are currently dipping our toe into Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. And, rightly so, with Sandfall Interactive's debut title receiving scores of praise across the industry.</p>
<p>Our Ed enjoyed Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and complimented the game's artwork and combat in particular.</p>
<p>"Outside the core plot, there's a wonderful silliness - and self-deprecation - to Clair Obscur that, together with its outstanding art direction and unique battle mechanics, ensure the game is distinct," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Eurogamer's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a>. "It's an ambitious yet impressive debut from the studio that, despite a somewhat fanciful narrative, is a pensive examination of grief and the power of art."</p>
