If you're a fan of locomotives and fiendish deck-building strategy roguelikes, you've probably long been in the grip of developer Shiny Shoe's massively acclaimed Monster Train. So you'll likely <em>also</em> be thrilled to hear its previously announced sequel finally has a release date - and is coming to PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch on 21st May.
</p>
<p>
Shiny Shoe's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-train-brings-a-new-idea-to-a-genre-i-love">original Monster Train released back in 2020</a>, plopping players onto an infernal locomotive destined for the heart of a frozen Hell. Here, they were tasked with fending off Heaven's forces - and, crucially, protecting the train's burning pyre - through strategic bouts of real-time card battles playing out across multiple floors of the train. And good stuff it was too, still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1102190/Monster_Train/">boasting an 'Overwhelmingly Positive' Steam rating</a> four years after its release.
</p>
<p>
Which brings us to Monster Train 2. This time around, Heaven and Hell's denizens have formed a makeshift alliance to bring down the powerful Titans - in an adventure taking players through Heaven, Hell, and the mysterious Abyss. To aid in their quest, Monster Train 2 introduces five new clans, new units, new upgrade cards, and dangerous new enemies. That's alongside the new Room and Equipment card types - the former providing special boosts to the train itself, and the latter providing bonuses to units when applied.

<p>
On top of that, there's the new Covenant Outpost, which players can visit between runs. Here, they'll experience character interactions as the story plays out, and gain access to different features. There are unlockable Pyre Hearts, for instance, each said to add unique functionality to gameplay, alongside train customisation and an improved Logbook.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Monster Train 2's story is complemented by Dimensional Challenges - promising handcrafted challenges, new Mutators, and cosmetic rewards - as well as Daily Challenges, an Endless mode, plus the Celestial Alcoves where players can experience a "wide variety of random events... and maybe even a few surprises" from beyond the Monster Train universe.
</p>
<p>
Monster Train 2 launches for Steam, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch on 21st May. And if you're curious to see what's new, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742830/Monster_Train_2/">demo's available now on Steam</a>.

            <p>A new playable character in FromSoftware's forthcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has been revealed.</p>
<p>In the network test, only four Nightfarers were available to players, but the latest pre-order push shows Ironeye for the first time.</p>
<p>Ironeye looks to be a ranger, or sniper, class who shoots enemies with a bow. Particularly cool is the ability to shoot arrows while in the air after leaping off walls with the game's new parkour system.</p>

<p>While Ironeye's core abilities are unknown, the video reveal does include the character charging a shot that fires through a number of enemies at once followed by a wave of energy.</p>
<p>It looks like Ironeye can free aim with the bow, as well as backstab enemies by firing arrows at close range from behind.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign will have eight Nightfarers in total, representing different player classes. The network test had the all-rounder Wylder, the tanky Guardian, the magic-wielding Recluse, and the rogue-like Duchess.</p>

<p>Ironeye should compliment the group nicely with ranged attacks, though builds can certainly change depending on the randomised weapons found throughout each run.</p>
<p>It's unknown who the remaining three Nightfarers will be, though perhaps a Faith character of some sort is a fair bet. I'd love to see a Wretch too.</p>
<p>The network test for Nightreign took place last month and allowed players to try out the three-player co-op game's roguelike three-day cycle.</p> <div>

<p>Last week, publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-players-were-really-struggling-to-complete-the-network-test">Bandai Namco released some statistics that showed players appeared to be struggling</a> to beat the big boss Nightlord: Gladius, Beast of Night, was defeated only 58,615 times.</p>
<p>Ahead of the network test, I was able to go hands-on with the game and came away very impressed by its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">new twists on familiar Elden Ring gameplay</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
