            <p>
Epic Games will continue to support <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> Festival, the game's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rock-band">Rock Band</a>-style mode developed by Harmonix, for the forseeable future. 
</p>
<p>
The confirmation comes today, as Festival celebrates its first anniversary this weekend with access to play all of the mode's 285 tracks for a limited time. 
</p>
<p>
Last year, Epic Games expanded Fortnite beyond its shooter origins with the arrival of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a>, which has performed particularly well, plus Fortnite Festival and Rocket Racing - the arcade racer mode made by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rocket-league">Rocket League</a> studio Psyonix. 
</p>
<p>
In October, Epic Games quietly announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-waves-chequered-flag-on-rocket-racing-mode-themed-updates">Rocket Racing would no longer receive regular themed content updates</a>, and the mode currently does not offer any further cosmetic rewards to unlock.
</p>
<p>
All of Fortnite's player experiences show public play counts, and from them it's easy to see the game's main modes - Battle Royale and Zero Build - with hundreds of thousands of concurrent players. Lego Fortnite typically ranges in the tens of thousands. Fortnite Festival usually sits around 15,000 players. Rocket Racing sits in the single digit thousands.
</p>
<p>
Festival also has a clear monetisation route, with a seasonal pass that features a particular music star, plus the option to purchase music tracks to keep and play whether a song is in the mode's current rotation or not. 
</p>
<p>
The mode kicked off by spotlighting The Weeknd, before subsequent seasons were headlined by genuine music giants like Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish, Metallica and Snoop Dogg. 
</p>
<p>
"While that's officially a wrap on the first year of Fortnite Festival, the Festival roadies and stage crew are already hard at work to make 2025 and beyond even bigger," Epic Games wrote today. "That said, 2024 isn’t over just yet, and we have some surprises to help see the year out in style!" 
</p>
<p>
The Weeknd, Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish and Colombian singer Karol G are getting reskinned "platinum" versions of their original skins, plus there are XP quests for playing their music in the coming days.
</p>
<p>It's a very busy time for Fortnite, which recently launched its permanent Fortnite OG offering. This week sees the arrival of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-fortnite-brick-life-is-a-major-new-social-game-mode-that-sounds-a-bit-like-the-sims">social sim Lego mode Lego Fortnite Brick Life</a> plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-goes-first-person-for-new-5v5-mode-ballistic">the Valorant-inspired Fortnite Ballistic</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Humble Bundle has launched a <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/beamdog-owlcat-rpg-masters-encore">new charity bundle</a> focused on classic CRPGs, including the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> and its sequel.</p>
<p>Also included is Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader, which was released last year and received a DLC back in September. It was developed by Pathfinder studio Owlcat.</p>
<p>Indeed, Owlcat and Beamdog are responsible for all 12 games in the bundle, which also includes Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous and Pathfinder: Kingmaker (and their season passes), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/neverwinter-nights">Neverwinter Nights</a>, and Icewind Dale.</p>

<p>The bundle is available for £23.87 or more - or less if Rogue Trader is removed. As with all Humble bundles, it's raising money for charity, here the Girls Make Games Scholarship Fund. And as ever, for full transparency, Humble Bundle is owned by Ziff Davis, which is also the parent company of Eurogamer.</p>
<p>The bundle also includes an 85 percent discount for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mythforces-wonderful-cartoon-co-op-nostalgia-is-held-back-by-skeletal-action">Mythforce</a>, Beamdog's roguelike adventure inspired by Saturday morning cartoons.</p>
<p>You'll need to be quick though: the offer ends tomorrow, 11th December.</p>
<p>The Girls Make Games Scholarship Fund "provides need-based financial scholarships as well as mentorship to girls and young women interested in pursuing video game development summer camps, workshops and undergraduate degree programmes".</p>
<p>"Rogue Trader nails the 40k setting and provides an appropriately massive narrative filled with meaty tactical combat, though some bugs and poor performance hold it back," reads our Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warahmmer-50k-rogue-trader-review">Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader review</a> from earlier this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
