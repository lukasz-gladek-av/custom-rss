            <p>There are still secrets in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> fans are yet to discover, but its director won't give any hints.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer about the game's forthcoming update and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/incredibly-moved-and-grateful-clair-obscur-expedition-33s-director-talks-success-art-house-aspirations-and-the-scope-of-future-projects">the future of the Clair Obscur franchise</a>, director Guillaume Broche discussed inspiration taken from the Final Fantasy games. While there's a reference to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-viii">Final Fantasy 8</a> specifically in the Gestral Village - with characters swapping "Double Dyad cards" in a nod to that game's Triple Triad card game - overall Broche simply took inspiration from the general vibe of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s iconic series.</p>
<p>But are there other secrets yet to be uncovered? "There are, but I don't want to say them because they won't be secrets anymore," Broche told Eurogamer. "Maybe they have been found, but I haven't seen anything about it. There are still a few things, yeah."</p>

<p>Fans have scoured Expedition 33 for hints and references, but it seems some of these weren't intentional.</p>
<p>"The funny thing is [fans] found secrets that were absolutely not secrets originally," said Broche. "And we are just like, ok cool. I guess that's a secret!"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-fresh-take-on-rpg-traditions-could-revitalise-the-genre">Ahead of the game's release</a>, Broche told Eurogamer he was keen for players to experiment with the game's battle system to create "broken builds" and - as a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sekiro-tips-and-tricks-6009">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a> speedrunner himself - he was looking forward to seeing no-hit runs of Expedition 33.</p>
<p>So did the community live up to his expectations?</p>
<p>"They are up to my expectations, which were very high," said Broche. "They destroyed the game very fast. My personal speedrun record was broken in one week, maybe even less."</p>
<p>The team did release an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/quick-clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-will-soon-nerf-the-games-best-move">update to fix one particular ability</a> that proved a little too powerful. But other than that, Broche is "very happy that people found crazy builds that even [he] didn't really think about. It's exactly what we made the system for."</p><p>What he perhaps didn't expect was for the community to discover his workings out. Fans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-french-inspired-setting-was-originally-steampunk-london">uncovered a trailer for an early version of the game posted on reddit</a> by Broche in a bid to find voice actors, which showed it in a very early state.</p>
<p>"It was like everybody entered my room and saw my underwear," Broche joked. "I completely forgot that it was still accessible."</p>
<p>"It's funny," he continued, "because I think that not often enough do we see real behind-the-scenes footage of games in general, like the very first prototypes that very often look terrible."</p>
<p>Sandfall CTO and lead programmer Tom Guillermin added the discovery helped to "demystify" the early stage of a project. "I think it's not that bad in the end that people found out," he said. "It's actually the same project in Unreal that we just upgraded iteratively and in the end that's the game people get to play. I think demystifying that great games are not great from the beginning, it's maybe good for the industry and also for the hobbyist as well."</p>
<p>Sandfall Interactive is set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-will-receive-new-update-with-a-bit-of-whee-and-a-bit-of-whoo-as-studio-celebrates-new-sales-milestone">release an update to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 soon</a>, adding new quality of life options and new story scenes offering "a bit of whee and a bit of whoo".</p>

            <p>MMORPG Blue Protocol: Star Resonance was finally released in the west yesterday, and is already off to a strong start on Steam.</p>
<p>It's already peaked at almost 95k concurrent players, meaning it has more players at the time of writing than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, Marvel Rivals, and EA Sports FC 26.</p>
<p>The anime MMO from Bandai Namco was previously released in Japan and was set to receive a western release by Amazon Games. However, in August 2024 the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namco-and-amazon-games-published-mmorpg-blue-protocol-has-worldwide-release-cancelled">Japanese servers were shut down and the western release cancelled</a>.</p>

<p>Since then, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namcos-cancelled-mmorpg-blue-protocol-is-coming-back-as-star-resonance">Tencent-funded developer Bokura picked up the project</a>, added Star Resonance to the name, and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namcos-cancelled-mmorpg-blue-protocol-will-release-outside-of-japan-this-year">now released it as a free-to-play game</a> across PC (Steam, Epic Games Store) and mobile (iOS, Google) in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Oceania.</p>
<p>But after all that, was it worth the wait?</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681810/Blue_Protocol_Star_Resonance/#app_reviews_hash">Steam reviews</a> from players so far would suggest not. Blue Protocol currently has a Mixed rating, with criticisms of its lack of content, generic gameplay, and gacha mechanics.</p>
<p>"Just once I would love to get an anime MMO without 1000 currencies, gacha, 5000 'presents' with no real value and overloaded UI," wrote one Steam user. Wrote another: "This absolute slop represents the culmination of the cancer that has killed the MMO genre."</p>
<p>Other players, meanwhile, are more positive, claiming it has "great art and visuals" and that for a free-to-play game it's worth a go.</p>
<p>At the time of its Japanese cancellation, the developers stated the "difficult decision" to end service was made as "it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you".</p>
<p>I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blue-protocol-is-amazons-next-punt-on-east-meets-west">hands-on with Blue Protocol</a> ahead of its release way back in 2023, and while it was enjoyable I questioned if it could do enough to differentiate itself from its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hoyoverse">HoYoVerse</a> competition. Once the game was released in Japan, it didn't receive a particularly positive reception, which ultimately led to its cancellation.</p>
<p>Blue Protocol's Star Resonance revival will certainly give it a second lease of life, but whether it was worth it remains questionable.</p>

            <p>Forthcoming extraction shooter Arc Raiders will make progression wipes voluntary, through its newly revealed Expedition Project.</p>
<p>Progression wipes essentially reset a player's progress in a game and are a blunt method of putting all players on an even field. These are used in plenty of shooters, particularly at the start of a new season, but can be controversial. While Escape from Tarkov has had regular wipes, for instance, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> developer Bungie <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1975305060574732357">recently u-turned</a> on a decision to reset power in its forthcoming Renegades expansion due to player backlash.</p>
<p>Arc Raiders will include voluntary progression wipes, <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/">Embark Studios has now explained</a>, but the developer has its own method of implementing them.</p>

<p>"Just to make it clear, we absolutely see the benefits a global wipe provides," the studio wrote in a blog post. "Veteran players can experience the game fresh, the economy is reset to the baseline, and all players have about the same level of capabilities. At least for a little while.</p>
<p>"However, one thing a mandatory wipe does not do is respect the investment of those players who do not have as much time to play overall."</p>
<p>The system in Arc Raiders is called the Expedition Project. The explanation is a little complicated, at least until we go hands-on and try it ourselves, but the full game will introduce the Expedition Project at level 20.</p>
<p>This ongoing project (or mission, really) operates on a repeating cycle of roughly eight weeks, with players gradually contributing towards its progression. Once complete, a progression reset will be available. If progress is not complete, players will be able to carry it over to the next finalisation window.</p>
<p>A progression reset will wipe character levels, skills, inventory, crafting capabilities, and everything else associated with progress. Cosmetics (both earned and purchased), awards, achievements and the like will remain.</p>
<p>To incentivise completing the Expedition Project, players will be rewarded with permanent account unlocks, unique cosmetic rewards, and buffs for the following Expedition cycle.</p>
<p>"One point to drive home is that we are being very careful about the nature of these benefits," the blog post reads. "Completing a reset should never give a player a power or combat advantage over anyone who has not completed a reset.</p>
<p>"Initially, these benefits will centre around cosmetics and bragging rights, quality-of-life, and smoothing out some aspects of progression for those who have gone through a reset."</p>
<p>Essentially, this system gives players the power to reset their game in their own time, prolonging the game's longevity through repetition with less pressure on endgame activities.</p>
<p>"It's not a silver bullet," the studio admitted, "and won't achieve the clean break that a mandatory global reset does, but it does aim to be more equitable to all players. Wherever possible, we want to value your time spent in the game as much as you do.</p>
<p>"Of course, this is a complex topic, so we'll be keeping an eye on the discussion around this message and follow up as necessary."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/play-online-shooter-arc-raiders-free-next-month-in-final-test-weekend-before-release">Arc Raiders will have a free public network test later this month</a>, to test out the game ahead of its full release on 30th October.</p>
<p>It's releasing, therefore, between <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> as something of an underdog of the three. Still, you <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-censor-arc-raiders">can't type "Arc Raiders" into the Call of Duty chat</a> as it's been censored.</p>
