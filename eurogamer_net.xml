After years of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">leaks</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">Bethesda's Oblivion remaster is finally here</a> and it's already going down a storm - if its place at the top of Steam's best-sellers list is any indication. However, Bethesda has now shared one bit of potentially disappointing news, confirming there'll be no official mod support for its fancy new Oblivion.
</p>
<p>
Bethesda has, of course, long been a strong proponent of the modding scene - part of the reason many of its games have remained so popular years after their launch - going as far as to release official modding tools, AKA Creation Kits, for the likes of Skyrim, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>. That won't be the case for Bethesda's newly shadow-dropped Oblivion remaster, however, with the developer <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/69672">confirming the news in an FAQ on its website</a>, simply writing, "Mods are not supported for The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered."
</p>
<p>
That's potentially disappointing for Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 players, especially given the increasing number of Bethesda titles able to access curated mods on consoles in recent years, but what this means for PC players - if anything - is a little unclear. Modders are currently poking around the Oblivion remake's innards to see what's what under its fancy Unreal Engine 5 hat, with one redditor having <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/1k5c32e/oblivion_remake_is_infact_just_as_moddable_as_the/">already discovered the remaster's files can be opened in the original The Elder Scrolls Construction Set</a>. The lack of official modding tools might slow things down a bit, then, but maybe not for long.

<p>
But mods or no mods, interest in Bethesda's Oblivion remaster is clearly high. It had <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts">reached the top of Steam's best-sellers list</a> within an hour of release (it's currently enjoying a Very Positive rating on Valve's platform, with seemingly minimal complaints so far) and that's with its Â£50 price tag. It's also available as part of a Game Pass subscription on Xbox and PC.</p>
<p>
One group that won't be forking out for the remaster, however, is the team behind the Skyblivion fan modding project, which has spent the last few years <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skyblivion-fan-project-lead-reacts-to-oblivion-remake-news-with-all-love-and-no-hate">remaking Oblivion in the Skyrim engine</a>. It recently confirmed Bethesda's official remaster "changes nothing" as far as its own release plans go - and it took to social media earlier today, revealing Bethesda <a href="https://x.com/TESRSkyblivion/status/1914751791381495955">had just given game keys to the entire modding team</a>.
