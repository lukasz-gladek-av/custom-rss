            <p>Today's the day. After months and years of speculation about what Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> will be, today, it releases in the wild. You'll be able to get your mitts on it and tell us what you think. Are you as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-a-couple-of-hours-mario-kart-worlds-open-world-left-me-slightly-underwhelmed-but-is-there-more-to-it">excited by Mario Kart World</a> as the, um, world seems to be? What do you make of the Switch 2 upgrades for games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/welcome-tour-is-the-switch-2s-welcome-surprise-and-might-even-be-worth-your-8-quid">Is Welcome Tour really worth the £8 Nintendo is asking for</a>? And Will the Switch 2 launch go as smoothly and successfully as Nintendo hopes?</p>
<p>We'll be covering all aspects of the Switch 2 launch and gathering everything together here so you can see at a glance what's been going on. We'll be keeping an eye on any launch issues there may be, any launch stock there may be, and how the world is reacting to playing Nintendo's new machine. And that includes you - we want to hear what you think in the comments below.</p>
<p>If you are receiving a Switch 2 today, here are a few articles you might find helpful:</p>

<li>Here's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-launch-games-everything-you-can-play-on-day-one">a list of all the games you can play on Switch 2 at launch</a></li>

</ul>
<p>There's lots still to come, such as our review thoughts about Switch 2 and Digital Foundry's take on the hardware, so pull up a virtual chair as we welcome Switch 2 to the world.</p><div data-live="true">

      <p>Nintendo has hidden the SD card slot again</p>
    <p>If you know where the SD card slot on the Switch 2 is, this might seem obvious, but trust me when I say we have plenty of data to show that a lot of people couldn't find it on the OG Switch. So, if you are struggling to locate the slot on the Switch 2, it's under the kickstand. More info is in our handy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/where-is-the-switch-2-sd-slot">guide on how to locate the Switch 2 SD card slot</a>.</p>

    <blockquote><cite>H1ppyDave says:</cite> Screen protector - use a credit card with a piece of cardboard folded over it. For that bubble I’d personally Lift it carefully back up (Inuse a guitar plectrum but anything thin made of plastic should do) and let it resettle.</blockquote>
<p>OMG, H1ppyDave, you're a star. I had been pressing it with just a cloth and had no luck. Used your suggestion and now I'm bubble-free! May your Switch 2 launch day be wonderful!</p>

    <p>I am sitting at my desk, twitching like an anxious meerkat because I really, <em>really</em> want my Switch 2 to arrive. One small sound from outside, and I look up and out of the window, hoping it is that glorious DPD van pulling up outside my front door. So far, though, it hasn't been. Boo :( </p>
<p>I live in the wilds of Scotland, and Matt has joked the delivery driver is probably still trying to work out how to get to my house. I really hope they figure it out soon...</p>

    <p>Anyone good with screen protector woes? I applied a tempered glass protector, and it seemed to go perfectly, but then this spot never filled in properly. Is this a "get a new protector" situation? Anyone managed to fix this before? You are my only hope Eurogamer readers.</p>
