            <p>Ubisoft has confirmed Beyond Good and Evil 2 - which it first announced almost two decades ago - remains a priority for the studio, and "fits with [its] strategy of focusing on Open World Adventures".</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Ubisoft left many in shock when it announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">"major organisational, operational and portfolio reset"</a>, which saw the company delay seven unspecified projects, close two studios and cancel multiple games.</p>

<p>One game to survive, though, was Beyond Good and Evil 2, which was first announced in its original form back in 2008, and last seen (at least publicly) during E3 2017 with an open-world slant. In a statement shared with Eurogamer, a Ubisoft spokesperson has said:</p>
<p>"Beyond Good and Evil 2 remains part of our portfolio and our roadmap and fits with our strategy of focusing on Open World Adventures."</p>
<p>The studio's spokesperson added that within thiz market, "the fantasy genre is underserved". Therefore, Ubisoft has a "unique proposition" with its  Beyond Good and Evil sequel.</p>

</figure>
<p>It has not been an easy path for Beyond Good and Evil 2, though there has been some movement in recent years. In 2024, the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-still-in-development-now-with-new-creative-director">got a new creative director</a>, with original creator Michel Ancel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2s-troubled-development-due-to-passionate-managers-not-getting-along-says-creator-michel-ancel">saying the troubled development came down to "passionate managers" not getting along</a>.</p><p>Last year, meanwhile, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unbelievably-17-years-after-its-original-announcement-ubisoft-appears-to-still-be-hiring-for-beyond-good-and-evil-2">job listing looking for a technical sound designer specifically for Beyond Good and Evil 2 was shared by Ubisoft</a>. At this time, we also got an updated description of what Beyond Good and Evil 2 will actually be:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Beyond Good and Evil 2 is an action-adventure open world game set in a captivating space opera universe and the direct prequel to the 2003 cult classic. Based on a breakthrough technology driven by the proprietary Voyager engine, Beyond Good and Evil 2 aims to offer a seamless experience of exploration and space piracy across a solar system full of exotic locations, colorful characters and mysteries to uncover, solo or with friends. So, if you are ready for an adventure like no other, come join forces with us to build System 3!"</p></blockquote>

<p>As for elsewhere at Ubisoft, this week's cancellations included the studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">was only a few months from its planned release</a>. </p>
<p>While the team behind the remake has since called Sands of Time's cancellation "deeply disappointing" for fans and the development team, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sands-of-times-shock-cancellation-does-not-mean-we-are-stepping-away-from-the-franchise-says-remake-team">does not mean Ubisoft is "stepping away" from the Prince of Persia franchise for good</a>.</p>

            <p>Digital online PC game store GOG has acknowledged that it "damaged the trust our users have in us" when it abruptly removed the <a href="https://shop.redcandlegames.com/app/devotion">acclaimed horror game Devotion</a> from sale just over five years ago.</p>
<p>Managing director Maciej Gołębiewski reflected on the decision after facing scrutiny for a comment he made - "We as a company are always ready to take a stand on the right values" - in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-says-selling-horses-when-steam-wouldnt-was-matter-of-freedom">an interview on Eurogamer</a> last week. That remark was made in relation to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-review">Horses, the provocative indie horror game</a> that GOG would sell when other storefronts Steam and Epic would not. But the comments contradicted the stance GOG took with Devotion in late 2020.</p>
<p>To recap: Devotion is a short, smart, 1980s-set Taiwanese-made horror game - "a genre landmark", we said in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devotion-review">our Devotion review</a> - initially released in early 2019 but pulled from sale after an outcry over the inclusion of unflattering references to China's president Xi Jinping. This had dramatic consequences in China - developer Red Candle's Weibo social media account was closed - and the game was yanked from sale on Steam.</p>

<p>Red Candle insisted the offending asset was only ever a placeholder. It apologised at length for it, and removed it, so things seemed to settle enough for a prospective re-release. This is where GOG comes in. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-under-fire-for-dramatic-u-turn-on-devotion-gog-release">GOG announced it would sell the game but then on the same day reversed the decision</a>, <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1339227388438306817?s=20">stating</a>: "After receiving many messages from gamers, we have decided not to list the game in our store." Was it standing for the right values then?</p><p>Maciej Gołębiewski today said: "That situation remains difficult to reflect on. At the time, we made that decision in the context of very real business constraints, a limited understanding of the complex geopolitical factors at play, and a lack of good options that would both protect GOG and partners and allow the game to be released responsibly. In hindsight, we acknowledge that this decision - and the way we communicated it - understandably damaged the trust our users have in us.</p>
<blockquote><em>"When I say that we're ready to take a stand on the right values, I don't mean that we won't make mistakes"</em></blockquote>
<p>"But it's also important for us to be transparent," he added. "Keeping a global digital storefront operating means navigating legal, operational, and commercial realities that don't always allow for ideal outcomes. In 2020, we chose a path we believed was best for GOG, even though it came at a cost to our credibility."</p>
<p>The situation with Horses he said was different. That game was played by multiple GOG employees who agreed that it didn't pose any "legal, political, or operational risk to our business or partners". "There was no other concern driving this decision," Gołębiewski remarked, "just a straightforward evaluation of the game itself."</p><p>"When I say that we're ready to take a stand on the right values," he continued, "I don't mean that we won't make mistakes, or that every decision will be easy, or that we'll never face trade-offs. I do mean that with every given opportunity, we're striving to be clearer, more consistent, and more willing to stand behind our choices (including explaining them openly when they're being questioned)."</p>

<p>Gołębiewski's willingness to discuss the matter I believe shows a renewed push by GOG to be seen as open and approachable following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-and-cd-projekt-founder-micha-kicinski-acquires-100-ownership-of-gog">its recent independence</a> - when it separated from the mothership CD Projekt, which it had always been a part of. GOG was under CD Projekt ownership when the Devotion situation occurred, so did that heap additional pressure on? CDP is a publicly traded company answerable to investors and had far bigger concerns to deal with at the time, such as righting the rocky launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>As a private company now, GOG is answerable only to new owner Michal Kiciński, who, coincidentally, was one of the original founders of CD Projekt <em>and</em> one of the people who launched GOG - Kiciński remains a major shareholder at CD Projekt but he hasn't actively worked there since 2012. Under his ownership, GOG is now autonomous and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-eyes-indie-game-publishing-something-it-couldnt-do-under-cd-projekt-red">he's apparently not afraid of taking a risk</a>. Nothing major is set to change, but the company is looking into the possibility of branching into indie game publishing. A new era has begun.</p>

            <p>Sophie Turner is set to star as Lara Croft in the upcoming live-action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> from Amazon, and it sounds like beyond just costume aesthetics, the globe-trotting heroine will also be leaning into the character's more confident 90s personality as well.</p>
<p>In conversation with the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2026-01-21/sophie-turner-steal">Los Angeles Times</a>, Turner said Amazon's Tomb Raider adaptation will not simply portray Lara as a "sex bombshell".</p>

<p>Rather, the show is about Lara "and her story and what drives her". It is not about how "hot she is in the games and the movies", Turner said, though she did acknowledge this is something "so many people also love about" the character as well.</p>
<p>"But I really want to show the other side," the Game of Thrones alum continued, calling Amazon's version of Lara Croft "so unashamedly capable".</p>
<p>"She is not a woman who hides her strengths at all," Turner closed. All I can say to that is, excellent!</p>
<p>Filming for the series - which along with Turner also stars <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-traitors-celia-imrie-and-more-announced-for-amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Celia Imrie, Jason Isaacs, Sigourney Weaver and Martin Bobb-Semple</a> - began earlier this week. Weaver previously stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-scripts-are-incredible-and-very-funny-sigourney-weaver-confirms-she-will-play-wallace-in-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Tomb Raider scripts are "incredible, and very funny, very charming, very witty"</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Phoebe Waller-Bridge - who along with Fleabag is also known for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Killing Eve and Crashing - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">will serve as the Tomb Raider series' creator</a>, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner. Jonathan Van Tulleken will be director and executive producer, along with Chad Hodge as co-showrunner and executive producer.</p><p>For more, I recently shared my thoughts on why <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-2026-lara-croft-seems-to-be-returning-to-what-made-90s-tomb-raider-great-and-as-a-lifelong-fan-i-couldnt-be-more-excited">I believe 2026 is going to be a very good year for fellow Tomb Raider fans like myself</a>. Yep, I got a whole Lara love for Tomb Raider, and I don't care who knows it. </p>

            <p>The CWA-backed United Video Games union has written to the US Federal Trade Commission in opposition to the proposed acquisition of EA by private investors, including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and various investment firms.</p>
<p>The letter, published on Action Network, lays out the case against the acquisition, stating that EA is not "a struggling company", and any jobs lost as a result of the sale would be: " a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors pockets -- not to strengthen the company."</p>
<p>They conclude the letter with a call for members of the US public to sign an accompanying petition, and to a request to members of the Federal Trade Commission who could potentially halt the deal, writing: "We are calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinize this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, and preserves creative freedom."</p>

<p>Last December,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-shareholders-approve-saudi-arabian-buyout-leaving-only-the-us-government-able-to-block-the-deal"> EA shareholders approved the proposed deal for private investors to buy the company</a>. This left only US institutions like the Federal Trade Commission able to slow the deal down or block it. If approved, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-almost-entirely-owned-by-saudi-arabia-sale">EA will be almost entirely owned by the government wealth fund of Saudi Arabia</a>, a country that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-takeover-the-saudi-arabian-public-investment-fund-and-vanity-mega-projects-human-rights-watch-assesses-the-impact-of-gamings-latest-controversy">has been criticised due to its history of human rights violations</a>.</p><p>How likely is it that the US would block such a deal? Well, while some members of the government have criticised the deal, the Financial Times reported it will likely face little pushback <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-private-acquisition-deal-expected-to-go-smoothly-says-report-as-what-regulator-is-going-to-say-no-to-the-presidents-son-in-law">due to the involvement of the current president's Son-in-Law Jared Kushner</a>.</p>
<p>The record-breaking deal <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">will cost its new owners a staggering $55bn</a>, and as such embracing AI will be the road to making that money back according to senior EA leadership.</p>
