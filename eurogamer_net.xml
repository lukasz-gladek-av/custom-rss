            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/castle-crashers">Castle Crashers</a>' has revealed more details of its first DLC for 13 years, and while we don't yet have a firm release date, we do have a window: summer (Q3) 2025.</p>
<p>Last summer - 12 years after it first arrived on Steam, and 16 years after it debuted on Xbox Live Arcade - Castle Crashers announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/castle-crashers-is-getting-new-dlc-16-years-after-it-first-released">getting new DLC on Steam</a> (and only Steam - sorry, Xbox players).</p>
<p>Premium DLC Painter Boss Paradise not only includes new player and weapon artwork for all official characters and new character Paint Junior, but it also adds Steam workshop functionality, so players can create and share their own skins "with the world".</p>

<p>"After 16 years, when it came time to give Castle Crashers some more love, I started by drawing brand new knights," explained Dan Paladin, co-founder and art director at The Behemoth.</p>
<p>"I was able to do this fairly quickly and thought, 'Why shouldn't everyone have the ability to do this?', so - BOOM - the Painter Boss gave us all a perfect opportunity to make a natural shift to creating. People have wanted new characters so often - this allows the whole community to finally share more than we could ever give them!"</p>
<p>Although Castle Crashers debuted on Xbox and is still available on Sony consoles and Nintendo Switch, the $4 DLC (regional pricing is still to be confirmed) is only coming to Steam. You can wishlist it now.</p>
<p>"Much like The Behemoth's last Live Arcade effort, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alien-hominid">Alien Hominid</a> HD, this is a resolutely old-fashioned side-scroller," Dan Whitehead wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/castle-crashers-review">Eurogamer's Castle Crashers review</a>, waaaaay back in 2008.</p>
<p>"Where it differs is in a much less brutal learning curve, a vastly increased amount of peripheral stuff to play with and a generally more rounded gaming experience."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The first network test for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has suffered server issues and is unplayable.</p>
<p>The online co-op spin-off has a number of three hour long sessions over the course of the weekend, with the first meant to be from 11am - 2pm UK time today. However, server issues have meant players haven't been able to get past the initial menu.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/fromsoftware_sp/status/1890375131463082321">FromSoftware Player Support</a> has shared a number of messages, noting the server is "congested" before it restarted the server to solve the issue.</p>

<p>It's unclear how long it will take for servers to be reset, or if the remaining sessions will also be affected. After all, this is a network test - and the servers have clearly been tested.</p>
<p>I've contacted Bandai Namco for further details.</p>
<p>Myself, Eurogamer's Ian Higton and IGN's Jesse Gomez were planning to stream the game but have cancelled due to the server issues.</p>
<p>Players have been sharing their experience on social media and calling for FromSoftware to extend the sessions.</p>
<p>This was my view for over an hour of trying:</p>

<p>The test will continue over the weekend for those who registered, we have all the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-beta-test-dates-times-register">details of Nightreign session times</a>.</p>

<p>"As it stands, though, Nightreign provides a delectable hit of Elden Ring in a repeatable microcosm," I wrote. "It's got the difficulty, the levelling, the boss battles, and the sense of discovery, but all at high speed for a new type of challenge, while its grim enemy selection is like a best-of Souls mixtape I'm itching to replay."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> studio Obsidian Entertainment has plans to make it to 100 years in the business, and will achieve this by staying "lean and invested".</p>
<p>Speaking during this week's <a href="https://www.dicesummit.org/">DICE Summit</a>, Obsidian VP of operations Marcus Morgan and VP of development Justin Britch said they expect the studio to make it to its 100th birthday, which will be in another 78 years time.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/obsidian-plans-to-make-rpgs-for-100-years-by-not-trying-to-grow-aggressively-expand-our-team-size-or-make-super-profitable-games/">PC Gamer</a>, the team hopes to reach this milestone by keeping the company lean and holding onto the talent it has. It will also set realistic goals when it comes to sales expectations, the execs said, and won't go all-in on delivering huge profits. "Are we serious? â€¦ Yes," Morgan said.</p>

</figure>
<p>This strategy has meant Obsidian has refrained from opening multiple international offices, instead partnering with studios already in existence. This has reduced the risk of Obsidian getting too big and weakening the overall culture at the studio.</p>
<p>Additionally, Obsidian works on the assumption that any game it releases will simply be a "mild success", and this determines how much the studio will invest in a project before it gets given the greenlight.</p>
<p>Obsidian also plans to build institutional knowledge by aiming for "the lowest turnover rate in the industry". Meanwhile, the studio will continue to release the types of games it has become known for "not rushed, but often".</p>
<p>Obsidian's most recent game - Avowed - is available next week, on 18th February. We recently awarded the magical RPG four out of five stars.</p>
<p>"What Avowed lacks in gloss it makes up for with charm, depth and a playful heart. It's one of this year's most pleasant surprises," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Eurogamer's Avowed review</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in DICE news, during the event <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-backtracks-on-diablo-4-annual-expansions-next-due-in-2026">Blizzard announced Diablo 4's next expansion won't arrive until 2026</a>, marking a change in its annual plans.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Each year, we plan out a bunch of themed sale events (Fests) that center around a rotating category of games, and we know that announcing those dates ahead of time is helpful to developers planning their overall participation for the year," Valve explained.</p>
<p>"This is especially true given that we sprinkle them throughout a year already marked with each of our four seasonal sales and three Next Fests!</p>
<p>"We announced the schedule for the first half of 2025 last summer, and are now sharing the themed Fests and their dates planned for the second half."</p>
<p>Here's the full list:</p>

<p>Developers are invited to register their games for the events, as well as the digital store's legendary seasonable sales, which take place four times a year.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-bans-all-steam-games-that-force-players-to-watch-advertisements">Valve re-emphasised its rules around advertising, explicitly prohibiting games that force players to watch in-game ads</a>.</p>
<p>The rules confirmed that whilst cross-promotion and product placement are permitted, games that force players to watch or engage with advertising in order to play are not. Nor should developers use advertising as a "way to provide value to players, such as giving players a reward for watching or engaging with advertising in their game".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We first got word of Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time during a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-1">Nintendo Direct in February 2023</a>. At the time of its announcement, the game was set to release in 2023, but it later saw its launch nudged back.</p>
<p>We got a subsequent look at Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time in February last year, along with a peek <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">at the various jobs players</a> will be able to undertake in this time travelling adventure.</p>
<p>Away from Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/professor-laytons-new-adventure-turns-him-into-lukes-protege">Level-5 also has a new Professor Layton game in the pipeline</a>. It's known as New World of Steam and will place the Professor as something of a newcomer himself, in a story which moves the series' action to America.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
