            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> continues to make a noise in China, this time through a nationwide McDonald's collaboration designed to coincide with this year's Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>On the elaborate and specially designed menu are, according to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DO6aKmMEojo/?img_index=2">China Insider</a> and <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com.cn/news/20250919-Wukong">the McDonald's China website</a>, a huge black double beef "mooncake" (the Mid-Autumn Festival is also sometimes called the Mooncake Festival), a crispy chicken burger "mooncake", shrimp nuggets, which sound weird, curly fries and themed McFlurries. There's even a weird black-cased dessert thing, with a gooey yellow and white filling. Apparently this is a sesame lava pie, whatever that is, but to me it looks like a crusted, elongated Cadbury's Creme Egg. </p>

<p>But better yet! There will also be coinciding merch pop-ups in the biggest Chinese cities where people can buy exclusive Black Myth: Wukong x McDonald's merch. The most elaborate of these pieces is a dressing gown (it might be a wearable fleece thing - it's a bit unclear) which is black with ornate Wukong-related design-work and comes with a matching headband, which, admittedly, I rather like. There's a horrid white dressing gown with McDonald's logos and burgers on, too.</p>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>The collaboration starts today in China, so hurry on over, and runs in thousands of restaurants until 21st October. And I know what you're thinking: lucky bastards - why do they get black burgers and dressing gowns and not us, in the West? Well we can't have it because we didn't give Black Myth: Wukong Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2024, that's why. Don't, Bertie, don't.</p><p>Maybe a better question is why, a year after release, Black Myth: Wukong is still being celebrated in China. Well don't forget there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-black-myth-game-announced-by-game-science-following-wukong-success">a follow-up game called Black Myth: Zhong Koi</a> in development, which like Wukong, takes another iconic figure from Chinese folklore - the evil spirit-killing deity Zhong Koi - and spins a game around him.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair has revealed a new farming spin-off game, titled (of course) Palfarm.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, the game will see players teaming up with their Pals to sew seeds, mine for ore, and befriend townsfolk. And it looks like there's a spot of romance too.</p>
<p>There's also combat, as evil Pals can raid your farm - defeat them to obtain further resources. "After all, combat is a form of harvesting in its own way," reads the Steam page. Gruesome.</p>

<p>It's mostly a spin on the popular gameplay seen in the likes of Stardew Valley, which has proven exceptionally popular over the past decade.</p>
<p>Yet this reveal comes just shortly after Nintendo's latest Direct where it revealed its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ever-wanted-to-play-a-pokemon-animal-crossing-meets-minecraft-pokemon-pokopia-might-be-just-that-game">new Pokémon life sim game Pokopia</a> in which players join 'mon to farm crops and gradually build an attractive little environment.</p>
<p>Both games are part of a long-established genre, but the timing doesn't help to shake the feeling Pocketpair is once again following in the footsteps of Nintendo.</p>
<p>Palfarm is yet to receive a release date, but is available to wishlist now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4031890/Palworld_Palfarm/">Steam</a>. It's unclear if it will also be released on console.</p>
<p>Nintendo's lawsuit against Pocketpair for copyright infringement remains ongoing, as Nintendo was recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-nintendos-potentially-industry-changing-new-monster-battling-patent-enforceable-we-asked-some-lawyers">granted a new patent around summoning monsters</a>. It's also argued that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-argues-mods-dont-count-as-proper-games-as-pokemon-v-palworld-lawsuit-continues">mods don't count as proper games</a>, countering Pocketpair's defence.</p>
<p>Pocketpair, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pocketpair-to-fix-jank-in-hugely-successful-pokemon-alike-palworld-as-it-pushes-past-nintendos-controversial-lawsuit-towards-full-10-release-in-2026">continuing development of Palworld towards a 1.0 release</a> next year, fixing "jank" it wishes to properly address to set the full release up for success.</p>

            <p>Tonight, as part of the Kojima Productions 10th Anniversary livestream, called Beyond the Strand, we got a new update on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> franchise. The stream promised to be "a celebratory event" that will include "special guest appearances as well as offer a glimpse into future projects," and it certainly lived up to that promise.</p>
<p>The stream began with a quick recap of Kojima Industries' history so far, from inception through to the announcement and launch of Death Stranding, Death Stranding 2, and the reveals of both OD (2023) and Physint (2024). Towards the end of the project, Guillermo del Toro, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>, George Miller and Mamoru Oshii took to the stage to talk about the future of entertainment, gaming, and art. Notably, all of the speakers talk about going 'off-screen' with storytelling.</p>
<p>Then John Hanke, founder of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokemon Go</a> developer Niantic and now boss of Niantic Spatial (an 'AI-led geospatial business platform'), joined Kojima on-stage to present a section devoted to how Kojima plans to 'move beyond the screen,' where the Japanese developer envisions "going to the top of a mountain, and even finding entertainment there".</p>
<p>There's no real hint as to what this project will be beyond a fluffy teaser trailer that seems to be Pokemon Go-meets-Death Stranding. "Kojima Productions and Niantic Spatial Team Up to Redefine Immersive Entertainment" reads a blurb on the trailer, as people wonder around interacting with virtual bonsai trees, golden aura, and other weird environmental aspects. It all looks like stuff from the chiral network in the Death Stranding games, so I imagine our job - as porters via our phones or smart glasses, per the trailer - will be to connect things up.</p>
<p>You can see the latest trailer for Death Stranding x Niantic as part of the livestream below.</p>

<p>This seems like very early concept-level blue sky thinking. It's worth noting that Niantic Spatial isn't quite Pokemon Go developer Niantic: the company was split into a games and geospatial division earlier this year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-will-be-sold-to-monopoly-go-maker-scopely-niantic-confirms">the gaming development arm going over to Monopoly Go maker Scopely in a deal worth $3.5bn.</a>
</p><p>Niantic Spatial focuses on a refreshed version of Niantic's original core interest - creating a digital map of the planet, now using geospatial AI. The newly-rebranded company has secured $250m of capital investment ($50m from Scopely and $200m from Niantic's own balance sheet), and this is the first game-related project we've seen from the company.</p>
<p>"We're in the midst of seismic changes in technology, with AI evolving rapidly," Niantic founder John Hanke wrote when talking about the goal of the Spatial platform. "Existing maps were built for people to read and navigate but now there is a need for a new kind of map that makes the world intelligible for machines, for everything from smart glasses to humanoid robots, so they can understand and navigate the physical world.
</p>
<p>It seems Kojima wants to leverage this tech, and paste a Death Stranding experience on the top of this evolving tech that is as-yet-untested in a gaming environment.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> received a warm reception when it launched earlier this year, with Eurogamer calling it a "busier, louder, and more emotionally resplendent take on this singular hiking sim" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">our four star review</a>.
</p>
<p>We're also expecting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-animated-movie-with-original-story-on-the-way-with-raised-by-wolves-writer-attached">a Death Stranding animated movie</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-casually-reveals-a-death-stranding-anime-is-in-the-works">an entirely different Death Stranding anime</a> with an original story, too.
</p>
<p>"I love the world of Death Stranding, it's so creatively freeing, so beautifully dark and yet hopeful; I'm so excited and honoured that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>, whose work I've long admired, has invited me to dwell within his creation, to birth new stories into this fertile, mind-bending universe," says Raised by Wolves creator Aaron Guzikowski, who is penning the script for the animated feature.</p><p>It's clear the series has some life in it yet, and even with games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/od">OD</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/physint">Physint</a> on the way from Kojima Studios, the storied developer is a long way from giving up on this particular baby, just yet.
