<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled">Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled</a> - the spruce-up of the racer once referred to as "objectively loads better" than Mario Kart by Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell, causing eyebrows to catapult clean off people's faces - is making its way to Game Pass this Wednesday, 4th December.
</p>
<p>
Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled is, of course, developer Beenox's effervescent remaster of 1999 PlayStation cult classic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crash-team-racing">Crash Team Racing</a>, which - alongside a significant audio-visual makeover - introduced elements from 2003's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crash-nitro-kart">Crash Nitro Kart</a> and 2005's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crash-tag-team-racing">Crash Tag Team Racing</a>. "[It's] is a gold-standard remaster," Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-review-generous-remaster-of-a-cult-classic">his review</a> back in 2019, "capturing the loveably janky, off-brand spirit of classic CTR - and then some." 
</p>
<p>
"It's just plain, dumb fun, a game completely unashamed of itself even now," he continued. "I think that's probably why, even beyond the enormously generous treatment it's had from Beenox... CTR is still one of the best kart racers ever made." He then slapped it with a Eurogamer Essential, whereupon heads across the world began to explode, Scanners-style.

Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled is the first game to be confirmed for Microsoft's December Game Pass line-up (you'll find <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-november-line-up-announced">November's over here</a>). It's also the latest in a slow trickle of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> titles to have hit the subscription service - following on from the likes of Spyro Reignited Trilogy, Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, Diablo 4, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - since Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">$69bn acquisition of the publisher</a> last year.
</p>
<p>
And if you're not already a Game Pass subscriber, you might be interested to hear Microsoft recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-is-reinstating-its-11-game-pass-trial-but-only-for-pc">reinstated its previous Â£1/$1 14-day trial offer</a> - but only for PC.

            <p>
There's another Call of Duty collaboration on the way. Following crossovers from the likes of Tomb Raider, Crash Bandicoot, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>, and The Boys, Activision has revealed it's teaming up with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> to shove the streaming service's hugely popular Squid Game TV series into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone early next year.
</p>
<p>
Squid Game, which follows a group of players attempting to survive a series of deadly children's games in order to win a BIG CASH PRIZE, took the world by storm when it first aired on Netflix back in 2021. It's been a long time coming, but the show is finally set to return for a second series on 26th December, and Netflix's promotional efforts are now in full swing.
</p>
<p>
And so enter Call of Duty. Activision unveiled its impending Squid Game crossover via a thirty second teaser trailer, in which a dashingly behatted Operator discovers a mysterious envelope emblazoned with symbols one 'X' away from a PlayStation copyright claim. It all ends with the Call of Duty logo emerging in a sequence reminiscent of Squid Game's opening titles, after which we're informed the collaboration is set to begin in January 2025.

<p>
Beyond that, specifics are limited to the point of non-existent. We do know the crossover is coming to both Black Ops 6 and Warzone early next year, but whether it'll offer anything more substantial than romper-suit-style premium cosmetics remains to be seen.
</p><p>
Call of Duty's Squid Game collaboration won't be the first digital take on the hit Korean television show to barrel out in conjunction with Netflix's season two promotions, however. The streaming service's own internally developed Squid Game Unleashed - a multiplayer "party royale" for iOS and Android devices - launches for subscribers on 17th December. It's just one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-has-over-80-games-currently-in-development-and-plans-to-launch-one-each-month">more than 80 titles currently in development</a> as part of Netflix's continuing push into the world of gaming, although one of its most intriguing projects - a new AAA game led by Halo creative head Joseph Staten - has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-closes-aaa-internal-studio-led-by-halo-creative-head-joseph-staten">now been cancelled</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for Call of Duty, it seems to be having a strong 2024. Microsoft recently announced Black Ops 6 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-records-for-game-pass-subscriber-adds-on-launch-day-says-microsoft">managed to set a record</a> for most "Game Pass subscribers adds on launch day" - a record previously held by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> following its launch last year.
