            <p>Call of Duty <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> is currently sitting on a "mixed" Steam user score as players on PC report performance issues and crashes.</p>
<p>Threads on the game's Steam <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1938090/discussions/">discussion</a> pages and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/top/">subreddit</a> show players are trying all kinds of things to ameliorate the issue, from uninstalling other applications, removing auto-start apps, and disabling the anti-cheats of other games.</p>
<p>"Even <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1938090/discussions/0/4693406471885458077/">deleting all folders</a> off [the] pc and re-downloading everything" hasn't worked.</p>

<p>"Every time I click start campaign my game crashes to desktop. No problem's playing multiplayer though," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1938090/discussions/0/4693406471885457921/">commented</a> one player.</p>
<p>"My campaign starts. I can play for a few minutes and THAN [sic] crash to desktop without any error messages, driver all new!" said one respondent.</p>
<p>"I bought it yesterday and haven't been able to play one single game," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1938090/discussions/0/4693406471885476188/">added</a> another unhappy player. "It always closes when I try to start the game. I reinstalled it and still, I cant even load into the menu. What in the actual ****."</p>
<p>Responses include "same, hecking stupid", "still the same for me", and "it's gotta be a[n] Activision issue I hope they fix it fast itâ€™s unfair".</p>
<p>"Same here - rubbish. Why do nobody test their games anymore before releasing them," opined one particularly unhappy commenter.</p>
<p>Another simply <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Shulby/recommended/2933620/">wrote</a>: "Call of Crashes 6".</p>
<p>As yet, there's been no formal word on Call of Duty's social media channels acknowledging the issues, but of 2200+ Steam reviews posted so far, almost half have been negative, and most negative reviews seem to reference performance issues. Others are chiefly unhappy with the Call of Duty launcher.</p>
<p>Did you see <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-arachnophobia-mode-is-arguably-more-terrifying-than-actual-giant-spiders">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's new arachnophobia mode</a>? Activision's solution somehow makes everything even more horrifying, by robbing its zombie spiders of legs and turning them into something arguably worse.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
