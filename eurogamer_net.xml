            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> has seemingly underperformed, according to a recent <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5wMXD5U7aP5imdxB186rmg/d3ffd32ed3c2821d7e89d3c48d0ade35/Ubisoft_FY26_Q1_Sales_EN_vf.pdf">Ubisoft quarterly financial report</a>. This is blamed on a "pricing exploit" allowing players to inflate in-game wallets with more currency than they should have had.</p>
<p>Overall, the company has earned 2.2 percent less than it did this time last year. This drop was blamed on issues tied to Rainbow Six Siege X's launch, "unfavourable exchange rates", and the aforementioned pricing exploit.</p>
<p>Players were able to use pre-paid currency cards to buy more in-game currency than intended, allowing them to buy more items in-game than Ubisoft intended. This exploit has now been fixed. </p>

<p>Ubisoft president Yves Guillemot stated: "Rainbow Six Siege X received highly positive player feedback thanks to its renewed gameplay and enhanced features that drove significant player engagement growth."</p>
<p>Guillemot continued: "However, player spending in Rainbow Six Siege faced temporary but significant disruptions due to technical pricing issues, which have now been identified and addressed. Despite this one-off setback, the growth potential of the game is strong with solid traction on activity and in-game spending."</p>
<p>In contrast, Guillemot stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has performed exceptionally well, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-ubisoft-hints">pushing past five million players since its release</a>. The Ubisoft president also noted Rainbow Six, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-6">Far Cry</a>, and Assassin's Creed will be handled by the new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-new-business-for-assassins-creed-and-other-big-ips-with-116bn-tencent-investment">Ubisoft-Tencent subsidiary company</a>, and this new creative house was moving towards "a more agile and focused organisation while ensuring necessary long-term stability and creative vision" with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/charlie-guillemot-follows-father-as-co-ceo-of-ubisofts-new-tencent-funded-subsidiary-nepotism-claims-addressed">the announcement of its new co-CEO Charlie Guillemot</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/rainbow-six-siege-underperforms-following-pricing-exploit-according-to-ubisoft]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Developer Sloclap has released its first major patch for Rematch (a bit of unexpected poetry, there).</p>
<p>While this patch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-crossplay-top-priority-future-updates">doesn't add the likes of crossplay</a>, though "good progress" is being made, it does address a swathe of other fixes and improvements for Rematch, which the team has been working on since the last hotfix.</p>
<p>One major change coming with this patch is gamepad remapping, with the developer admitting while this first version is "quite basic", soon it will offer a more advanced version for players to tinker with.</p>

<p>Rematch's first major patch also includes fixes to the camera during goal replays, with Sloclap saying the jitter has been removed. Animations, meanwhile, have received a bit of polish, while the studio has also fixed an issue where goalkeepers were not reacting to opponents' collisions. The team has additionally made "multiple" environment and lighting improvements and fixes.</p>
<p>On the Menus and Interface side of things, Sloclap has added a Colourblind Mode. When this is activated, it will change the colour selection for teams according to deuteranopia, protanopia or tritanopia (the three main types of colour blindness). For now, this mode appears to be the start of a work in progress, with the developer saying the "feature will be pushed further" in a future patch, to apply the filter to the entire screen.</p>
<p>There are still some known issues with Rematch, which Sloclap has acknowledged. These include the ball on occasion emitting "loud wind sounds" until it gets kicked, which honestly sounds to me more like a feature than a bug.</p>
<p>The next patch is expected in the next two to three weeks, Sloclap has said. In the meantime, you can find <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/patch-1-1-200-100">further information on Rematch's first major patch here</a>.</p>

            <p>
Bethesda veteran Julian LeFay, sometimes referred to as the 'father of Elder Scrolls' thanks to his pioneering work on the legendary fantasy RPG series, has died aged 59.
</p>
<p>
The news follows developer OnceLost Games' announcement last week that LeFay, who had previously been diagnosed with cancer, would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-veteran-julian-lefay-father-of-the-elder-scrolls-departs-game-development-due-to-cancer">stepping back from game development</a> to spend his "remaining time with his family and loved ones".
</p>
<p>
LeFay joined Bethesda shortly after its founding in 1987, and oversaw the likes of The Elder Scrolls: Arena and its 1996 sequel Daggerfall in his role as chief engineer. He departed the company in 1998, briefly returning for The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind, then pursued various other ventures before setting up OnceLost Games with fellow Elder Scrolls veterans Ted Peterson and Vijay Lakshman in 2019. Since then, the studio has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-wayward-realms-is-a-grand-rpg-by-former-elder-scrolls-devs">working on The Wayward Realms</a>, an open-world RPG announced in 2021.
</p>
<p>
LeFay's departure from The Wayward Realms project was announced last week in a video addressed to fans, where it was revealed he'd been "fighting a battle with cancer for the last several years" and didn't "have very much time left". Now, OnceLost has confirmed LeFay's death in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oncelostgames.bsky.social/post/3lum4pyp3cs2e">message shared on social media</a>.
</p>
<p>
"It is with profound sadness and heavy hearts that we inform our community of the passing of Julian LeFay, our beloved technical director and co-founder of OnceLost Games," the studio wrote. "Julian LeFay was not just a colleague, he was a visionary who fundamentally shaped the gaming industry as we know it today," it continued, highlighting his work on numerous classic games. "His pioneering work established the foundation for open-world RPGs and influenced countless developers and games that followed."
</p>
<p>
"At OnceLost Games, Julian was one of the masterminds behind The Wayward Realms, bringing decades of expertise and an unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of what RPGs could achieve. His technical brilliance, creative vision, and dedication to player agency have been the driving forces behind our ambitious project.
</p>
<p>
"Throughout his courageous battle with cancer, Julian never wavered in his passion for The Wayward Realms. Even during his illness, he continued to share his vision with our team, mentor our developers, and ensure that every aspect of the game reflected his commitment to creating something truly extraordinary. His strength, determination, and unwavering focus inspires us all."
</p>
<p>
Acknowledging the questions fans and Kickstarter backers might now have regarding the future of The Wayward Realms, OnceLost wrote that despite the "immeasurable loss for our team, our community, and our industry", LeFay's "technical frameworks, design philosophises, and direction have all been carefully documented and shared with our team", and that it was "more committed than ever to bringing The Wayward Realms to life exactly as Julian intended it".
</p>
<p>
"Julian's influence extends far beyond our studio," OnceLost concluded. "He touched the lives of millions of players worldwide and inspired countless developers to push creative boundaries. Julian's legacy will live on in every realm, every quest, and every moment of wonder that players will experience in The Wayward Realms."
