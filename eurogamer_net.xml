As Cities: Skyline 2 continues its attempts to recover from last year's disastrous launch, Paradox Interactive has announced and released a fresh batch of paid DLC for the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a>, some 18 months after delivering what was supposed to be its final major update.
</p>
<p>
Paradox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-reveals-details-of-final-cities-skylines-dlc">concluded Cities: Skylines 1's release roadmap</a> in May last year with the launch of its final mini-expansion, Hotels &amp; Retreats. At the time, it said developer Colossal Order would continue general support through to the end of 2023 as it shifted its focus to Cities: Skylines 2.
</p>
<p>
But Cities: Skylines 2's launch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">went poorly</a>, resulting in multiple delays to Paradox's post-launch DLC plans while Colossal Order continued to improve the base game. An early attempt to foist DLC on the Cities: Skylines 2 player base was so badly received, Paradox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">vowed to postpone</a> all future paid DLC "indefinitely". Then, in September, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-dlc-gets-further-delays-as-developer-priorities-assets-editor-for-mods">announced further DLC delays</a> so Colossal Order could complete work on a "crucial" assets editor.

<p>
And now, amid a string of other major misfires for Paradox, the publisher has decided to return to a well most assumed had finally run dry. 18 months after wrapping up support for Cities: Skylines 1, it's launched three new paid DLC packs for the game, all themed around mountain peaks and alpine terrain. There's the Mountain Village Pack and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEzJ2wmUPYQ">Map Pack 3</a>, both part of Cities: Skylines' Content Creator range, plus the Radio Station Alpine Tunes music pack.
</p><p>
"This content has been in the works for some time as we know many of you still love building and expanding your cities in the original Cities: Skylines," Paradox wrote in its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/255710/view/4505380959139397651?l=english">DLC announcement</a>. "No resources were diverted from Cities: Skylines 2 for this," it continued, noting the new DLC has been created in partnership with developer Tantalus. "Our friends at Colossal Order remain fully focused on developing and improving Cities: Skylines 2."
</p>
<p>
All three new Cities: Skylines 1 DLC releases are available now on PC, and arrive ahead of <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/modding/cities-skylines-ii-region-packs">eight free community created region packs</a> inspired by the architecture of iconic cities around the world that'll launch for Cities: Skylines 2 starting next week.
</p>
<p>
All this comes at a challenging time for Paradox, which has faced a string of high-profile set-backs over the last few years. Alongside Cities: Skylines 2's disastrous launch, Prison Architect 2 has now been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-2-indefinitely-delayed-by-paradox">delayed indefinitely</a> after Paradox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-developer-double-eleven-parts-way-with-paradox-after-nine-years-on-series">split with developer Double Eleven</a> earlier this year, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> (which was almost cancelled before The Chinese Room <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-chinese-room-is-developing-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">took over its troubled development</a>) recently saw its release pushed back from "late 2024" into 2025. That's on top of Paradox's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sims-like-rival-life-by-you-has-been-cancelled-after-indefinite-delay">decision to cancel promising life sim Life By You</a> in June, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-declares-pulp-strategy-the-lamplighters-league-a-22m-flop">commercial failure</a> of last year's The Lamplighters' League, which resulted in Paradox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-and-harebrained-schemes-parting-ways-following-the-lamplighters-league-flop">parting ways with developer Harebrained Schemes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer about the company's troubles earlier this year, Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-ceo-admits-it-made-the-wrong-calls-in-several-projects-following-cancellation-of-life-by-you">admitted</a>, "It is clear that we have made the wrong calls in several projects, especially outside of our core, and this must change."
