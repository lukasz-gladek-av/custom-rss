            <p>
The studio behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unknown-9-awakening-is-an-ambitious-new-transmedia-bid">bold Assassin's Creed-meets-Tomb Raider transmedia attempt Unknown 9</a> has signalled an end to the franchise, following the poor performance of last year's initial video game.
</p>
<p>
Unknown 9: Awakening, a generic globe-trotting adventure starring The Witcher TV series' Anya Chalotra, "didn't come near the company's expectations," the boss of developer Reflector Entertainment Herve Hoerdt said in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reflector-entertainment_activity-7287227402995269633-s4i-/">statement</a> today, "and didn't warrant any further exploration in this universe". Ouch.
</p>
<p>
One of the Reflector's two future projects - presumably another Unknown 9 game which had been in the "conceptualisation phase" - has now been cancelled, Hoerdt added. This therefore means the studio was "terminating this development line".

<p>
"This decision correlates directly with the failure of the studio's ambitious and courageous first project, a new IP with a rich transmedia universe," Hoerdt continued. 
</p>
<p>
Reflector had ambitious plans for Unknown 9 as an ongoing series, supported by podcasts, comics, novels, and several web series. While many of these have now been released, some ahead of Awakening itself, following a lengthy delay to the video game, none appear to have made any real impression.
</p>
<p>
Reflector will now go through a second round of redundancies, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unknown-9-awakening-developers-report-layoffs">previous job losses reported back in November 2024</a>, as the company shrinks to a "single project approach the studio will adopt for the imminent future". 
</p>
<p>
This project is an "existing Bandai Namco IP" and is "shaping up well", Hoerdt concluded.
