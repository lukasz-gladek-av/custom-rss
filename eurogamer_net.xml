            <p>Nexon is ending support for its third-person looter shooter The First Descendant on PS4 and Xbox One.</p>
<p>The free-to-play sci-fi-flavoured release came out last year across Xbox, PlayStation and PC. It got off to a decent enough start, and in the first week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-free-to-play-sci-fi-shooter-the-first-descendant-clocks-up-10m-players-in-just-one-week">welcomed 10 million players into the fray</a>. Things have petered off since then, with <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2074920/charts/">SteamDB</a> data showing an average of 8,227 concurrent players on Valve's platform in February. Its peak concurrent player average was 123,352 in July last year, but this dropped to an average of 54,662 concurrents by August.</p>

<p>Nexon is going to keep supporting The First Descendant, however it has now announced it will be ending support for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One players from 19th June, which is just shy of its first anniversary. The game will also be delisted from the platforms (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-first-descendant-ending-support-for-last-gen-consoles/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>According to Nexon, it has decided to stop supporting the last generation of consoles in a bid to keep "increasing player satisfaction". The developer said it had "increased the scale" of The First Descendant, and this meant the team was facing difficulties "maintaining the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One builds".</p>
<p>Those who are playing The First Descendant on either a PS4 or Xbox One will still be able to transfer their progress to other platforms via The First Descendant's cross-save functionality.</p>

</span></p><p>On its release last year, Nexon found itself having to respond to claims the iconography of The First Descendant was strikingly similar to icons found in another sci-fi release, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-sci-fi-shooter-the-final-descendants-icons-are-strikingly-similar-to-those-used-in-destiny-2">players identified a surprising number of similarities</a> between the icons and weapons used in the free-to-play sci-fi shooter and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-first-descendant-developer-responds-to-claims-its-icons-are-too-similar-to-those-in-destiny-2">designs in questions were subsequently removed from the game</a> "with deep affection and respect" for other "looter shooters".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/samsung-shows-off-foldable-handheld-thats-basically-a-switch-you-can-bend-in-half<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Technology giant Samsung has shown off a working concept for a foldable gaming handheld - and it's essentially a Nintendo Switch that you can bend in half. 
</p>
<p>
Ever tried to snap your Switch in rage? Well, now you can do that with the Samsung Flex Gaming concept and (hopefully) not break the device in the process.
</p>
<p>
While just a concept, Samsung had workable units on show at the MWC mobile technology event in Barcelona this week, with foldable OLED screens up and running. Just ignore the big crease down the middle.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Samsung Display concept is basically a foldable Nintendo Switch!" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pfgIVX0ZBk4?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
Perhaps just as notable, the Samsung Flex Gaming concept also includes two giant holes in each of its not-Joy-Con. These are designed to allow the control stick in each side of the handheld to fit snugly inside the other half.
</p>
<p>
Cleverly, the face button and D-Pad have been built into the edges of each hole - again replicating the placement of these buttons on Nintendo Switch.
</p>
<p>
The device even has different colours for each half, as the original Switch had for its model with Blue/Red Joy-Con. Samsung's choices are lime green and yellow though - not as attractive, though very Norwich City FC.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo is expected to not offer an OLED screen in its upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> (or allow you to bend it in half). The Mario maker is set to unveil more details of its next handheld in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">special Nintendo Direct presentation scheduled for 2nd April</a>.

            <p>
Xbox owners enrolled into the Xbox Insider program are reporting that their consoles are being reset back to factory settings by a new update.
</p>
<p>
The Xbox Insider program allows users to receive new system features early, and is split into various 'tiers' for how new and/or buggy they want these features to be when they receive them. 
</p>
<p>
Users in the earliest Alpha and Alpha Skip-Ahead tiers say the latest console update is removing their Xbox profiles, console settings and Quick Resume data (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xboxs-latest-system-update-for-xbox-insiders-is-removing-their-user-profiles/">VGC</a>) - and has now been made a mandatory download, so cannot be skipped.
</p>
<p>
The Xbox Insider program has been running for 15 years, but an issue this big is extremely rare. The scheme's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/">dedicated reddit is awash with complaints</a>, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/comments/1j4n9bj/serious_preview_update_bug_factory_reset/">one user calling it</a> the "biggest bug I've ever seen release in all my years of being in the preview program".
</p>
<p>"This one actually factory reset my Series X," another user wrote. "It must've updated today and now my console is requiring me to set it up as brand new."
</p>
<p>"Light a candle for the guy here with a broken HDMI port and relies on remote play," wrote another. "Update messed everything up and now I cannot remote to my Series X, can't even see what is going on."</p>
<p>
While users can re-sign into their profiles and manually change back their settings, anyone impacted will lose time (and need to remember their passwords, including to any media apps).
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Microsoft for comment.

            <p>You can now lease a PS5, along with the likes of a PS VR2 set and Sony's handheld remote player PlayStation Portal, here in the UK.</p>
<p>This leasing service debuted in Japan, and quickly became a hit. As Ed reported this morning, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-popularity-means-japans-ps5-rental-service-is-fully-booked">GEO's PS5 rental service in Japan is fully booked across its 400 stores nationwide</a>. It's been a monster (hunter) success, you could say.</p>
<p>And now, it is our turn. Sony's <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/leasing">PS Direct UK website</a> lets you rent a digital-only PS5 for £11/month, or a PS5 with a disc drive for £12/month. Stump up £19/month and you can rent a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>. If you want a PS VR2, it's £18.50/month - or £20/month if you want access to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-call-mountain">Horizon: Call of the Mountain</a> too. PlayStation Portal is £6.50/month.</p>

</figure>
<p>Those interested in going down the lease route can choose a 12, 24, or 36-month term contract, although there is also a rolling monthly option if that's more your thing. As for the products available through the service, you will be able to rent the following PlayStation items:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5 Pro Console</li>
<li>PlayStation 5 Digital Edition Console (model group - slim)</li>
<li>PlayStation 5 Console (model group - slim)</li>
<li>PlayStation 5 Digital Edition Console - Two DualSense Wireless Controllers Bundle (model group - slim)</li>

<li>PlayStation VR2</li>
<li>DualSense Edge Wireless Controller</li>
</ul>
<p>In a <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/support/leasing">FAQ section on the website</a>, Sony states all lease agreements are made exclusively with Raylo. "All transactions, communications, and support services related to your device lease will be provided directly by Raylo," the page reads. "If you've signed up to a lease through PlayStation leasing and you have any issues with your device or your lease, you should contact Raylo for support in the first instance."</p>
<p>It also states Raylo offers a fair wear and tear policy on the leased hardware.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Raylo offer a fair wear and tear policy," Sony states. "It's ok to return your device with obvious signs of use such as a couple of deep scratches, small dents, discolouration or changes in the paintwork."</p>
<p>So, are you tempted?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> developer Niantic has now announced official details for this summer's Go Fest event series, which will include the global release of a Pokémon previously locked behind paid City Safari meetups.
</p>
<p>
As detailed previously, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fest-2025-to-be-held-in-paris">Go Fest 2025 will hold in-person events in Paris, Jersey City and Osaka</a> through late May and June. These will lead to the game's global Go Fest, which is now confirmed to take place on 28th and 29th June.
</p>
<p>
Today, Niantic confirmed Go Fest this year will see the release of Crowned Sword Zacian and Crowned Shield Zamazenta, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-gos-next-mythical-pokemon-teased-in-go-fest-logo">which players had deduced from this year's leaked Go Fest logo</a>. In a surprise, the event's main Mythical creature will be Volcanion, however - not Megearna as previously suspected. 
</p>
<p>
And in another surprise, it's been confirmed that Pokémon Go Fest Global will include the wider release of Skiddo, the cute goat creature you'd previously need to travel to City Safari event to capture. 
</p>
<p>
Through 2023 and 2024, Skiddo was only available if you visited Seoul, Barcelona, Mexico City, Tainan, Jakarta, Hong Kong and Sao Paulo at specific times. 
</p>
<p>
2025's City Safari events - so far confirmed for Milan, Singapore and Mumbai - now feature donkey Pokémon Mudbray as their new exclusive, signalling a wider release for Skiddo was on the cards.
</p>
<p>
This year may well include other changes to Pokémon Go, depending on the outcome of the game's reported sale. Last month, it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fans-launch-campaign-to-protect-games-future-as-concerns-mount-over-sale">Niantic was planning to sell Pokémon Go to Monopoly Go maker Scopely</a> - a move which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-developer-close-to-selling-games-for-35bn-to-saudi-owned-monopoly-go-maker-report">stoked concern amongst players due to Scopely's aggressive monetisation strategy</a> seen after it has taken over other mobile games.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> maker Epic Games is suing a player accused of stealing and selling countless user accounts, and profiting further by flogging details of his tactics to other wannabe thieves.
</p>
<p>
Epic is seeking unspecified damages from Illinois Fortnite fan Isaac "i5aac" Strock for fraud, copyright infringement and unjust enrichment.
</p>
<p>
Strock is named in a <a href="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/2025-02-27-epic-v--strock-complaint-5a69b553b2a2.pdf">legal filing dated 27th February</a>, which <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-anti-cheat-update-february-27-2025">Epic Games has also publicised via a recent blog post</a> - its latest move to name and shame those who target Fortnite with unscrupulous practices.
</p>
<p>
"Strock is in the business of stealing access to other players' Epic Games accounts," Epic Games wrote in its court filing. 
</p>
<p>
"He uses illicit means to discover the players' usernames and passwords and in some cases even the login credentials for the players' email address associated with the players' Epic Games account. He then sells access to these accounts to the highest bidders."
</p>
<p>
Epic Games estimates Strock has sold "hundreds" of player accounts and says he has boasted online about reaping "thousands of dollars in profits".
</p>
<p>
Strock is said to have even offered a guide on how to cheat Epic Games' player support and steal more accounts - again, for a price. 
</p>
<p>
Epic Games detected Strock on multiple occasions trying to bamboozle its player support with requests to change log-in details and gain access to accounts with valuable cosmetics or that had already been pre-loaded with Fortnite in-game currency.
</p>
<p>
Strock also used email and password combinations acquired in data breaches via the dark web to further add to his stolen account haul, the legal filing states.
</p>
<p>
The online trade in Fortnite accounts is lucrative, and accounts with rare skins are highly prized. Epic Games notes that some individual accounts sell for over $1000 each.
</p>
<p>
"Strock's actions harm Epic and the Fortnite community," the company concluded. "Epic has spent substantial resources investigating and working to prevent Strock's conduct. Strock's conduct also directly harms Fortnite players who no longer have access to the accounts they spent time and money on.
</p>
<p>
"Epic is entitled to all remedies available at law or equity, including injunctive relief, compensatory damages and/or other equitable or monetary remedies."
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-sues-fortnite-cheater-takes-back-winnings-and-forces-them-to-post-humiliating-public-apology-video-as-a-stark-warning-to-others">Epic Games announced its victory against a Fortnite competitive cheater who had tried to sneak their way into the game's biggest tournament</a>. Epic took back the player's winnings, forced them to post humiliating public apology video and then donated the prize money to charity.
