            <p>Witchbrook, the cosy life-sim set in a wizard school from Chucklefish, has finally received a release window eight years after its initial reveal.</p>
<p>Though Project Spellbound, as it was known, was first teased back in 2016, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-publisher-reveals-new-details-on-magic-school-rpg">Witchbrook proper was announced in 2017</a>. It immediately drew comparison with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, previously published by Chucklefish, and in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-inspired-magic-school-sim-witchbrook-gets-a-gorgeous-new-look">2020 switched to an isometric view</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/chucklefishs-witchbrook-is-still-alive-pretty-new-screenshots-show">look at fresh screenshots in 2022</a>, little has been shown of the game. Until today! During the Nintendo Direct, we finally got a release window of winter 2025 across PC, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox - including a day one Game Pass release.</p>

<p>Witchbrook has players enrol in the titular magical college, able to explore the seaside city of Mossport, the surrounding woodlands, and the college grounds themselves. In fact, four players can explore together in online co-op multiplayer.</p>
<p>Players will be able to learn new magical abilities to support themselves, local businesses and the community, make friends and romance other characters, renovate a cute woodland cottage and its garden, and spend time between classes by foraging, selling crafts, and entering seasonal events.</p>
<p>"Witchbrook is the most exciting project I've ever worked on, and it's been a long time coming, but I'm very eager to get the game in the hands of the players soon," said Chucklefish CTO Rodrigo Braz Monteiro.</p>
<p>"I don't think that the level of simulation and fidelity we've aimed for in this game is expected of any games short of AAA, and to see it realised in a pixel art indie game has been very satisfying to us. For now, we're only sharing a small glimpse into a vast game, and I can't wait for the community to see what's coming over the next few months."</p>
<p>"Witchbrook is our love letter to thoughtful living, the quiet magic of slow moments, and the connections we share with each other and the world around us," added art director Steph Caskenette. "Whether players are exploring solo or sharing in the adventure, we hope Witchbrook becomes a space to relax and make lasting memories."</p>
<p>Witchbrook was shown at today's Nintendo Direct, alongside a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-will-give-samus-psychic-powers">first look at Metroid Prime 4: Beyond gameplay</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-has-a-battle-royale-mode-that-finally-explains-what-its-name-means">new look at Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, and a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-still-a-switch-game-coming-out-in-2026">Tomodachi Life game due in 2026</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Ever wondered why Pokémon Legends: Z-A is called that? There are a few notable coincidences already - Zygarde is likely to be the key mascot of this entry, with the previous game's being Arceus; and the mysterious character AZ, pronounced as "A, Z" returns here in a seemingly promintent role also - but now we have another explanation, via a new, seemingly quite important feature announced today, as part of the game's surprise appearance in the Nintendo Direct.
</p>
<p>
The new feature is called the Z-A Royale, a trainer-on-trainer tournament that takes place in Lumiose City after night falls. Here, the city's wild areas, previously outlined in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>'s first full trailer, will turn into Battle Zones, where you can find opposing trainers waiting for you. It's mentioned that only "fierce" and "highly skilled trainers" are invited to participate, though that's swiftly followed by footage of you kicking things off with a Lv. 13 Totodile.
</p>
<p>
Earn enough Ticket Points, meanwhile, from defeating opponents and picking up 'bonus cards' by fulfilling certain challenges specified by the cards, and you'll earn a Challenger's Ticket, a requirement for undertaking a 'promotion match' where you can go up a rank. You'll start at Rank Z and, you guessed it, eventually climb to rank A - hence, Z-A. Curiously, it's mentioned that "trainers who reach the top are said to have a wish granted", which is likely a hint at the feature's role in the main story. Maybe you need a particular wish granted to defeat this entry's big bad?
</p>
<p>
In the trailer we also saw a little bit more of the new, hybrid battle system, that juggles real-time dodging with the order-based attacks of Legends: Arceus, and there are a few nice little twists in there for the eagle-eyed Pokémon fans. 
</p>
<p>
For one, now you can surprise other trainers, rather than the other way round - successfully sneak up and startle them before they make eye contact with you and you can use a surprise attack. This will always result in a critical hit, we're told, dealing hefty extra damage, in a similar method to the mechanic first introduced in Legends: Arceus that previously let you get an entire extra attack in on your opponent. 
</p>
<p>
We also got a first glimpse at how Mega Evolution will work in practice - an Alakazam was shown mega evolving into Mega Alakazam, when four bars had been filled in a glowing gauge in the bottom right. How you fill those up isn't clear just yet, though at one point the player-character's Lucario uses an attack and the gauge increases slightly, so it may be down to using attacks - or certain attacks - to charge it up.
</p>
<p>
Curiously, there's also a little figure of a person running over on the left of the in-battle screen, with the dash button icon next to it. At first glance, it looks like this might mean you can actually run away from trainer battles for the first time in the series' history, though we wouldn't be surprised if this was a feature only limited to these special night-time tournament bouts. In wild battles, by contrast, as we also saw in this new trailer, it's notable that you can just physically run away, rather than having to select it as an option.
</p>
<p>
Last but not least, this trailer also confirmed a few more Pokémon that'll be available in the games, most notably the full trio of elemental monkey Pokémon and their evolutions - Pansage and Simisage; Pansear and Simisear; and Panpour and Simipour - that were previously only available back in the X and Y and Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire days of generation six.
</p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-wont-arrive-until-late-2025">more on Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which won't release until "late 2025"</a>, it's worth looking through our roundup of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-shown-at-this-years-pokemon-presents">everything revealed in the big Pokémon Presents</a> earlier this year. You can also look forward to some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-pokemon-announced-coming-2026">long-wished-for Pokémon Lego sets some time in 2026</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
