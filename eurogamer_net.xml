Nintendo expects to sell another 4.5m units of its aging original Switch this year, despite the impending launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>. 
</p>
<p>
While the older console's momentum continues to slow, this forecast would see Switch - now at 152.12m sold - reach 156.62m, overtaking Nintendo DS as the company's best-selling hardware of all time.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo DS tapped out at 154.02m units sold across its long life, more than the Wii (101m) and even the combined totals of Game Boy and Game Boy Color (118m). But there's still one further hurdle to pass.

<p>
Sony has historically never released an exact figure for lifetime PS2 sales, though has quoted an estimate of 160m sold. Can Nintendo get to that figure with Switch 1? After this financial year, ending 31st March 2026, it's predicting it will be just 3.38m away. 
</p>
<p>
In the grand scheme of things, this does not seem too big a gap to close. But it remains to be seen how the launch of Switch 2 will further impact sales of Switch 1, and whether Nintendo can keep its older console selling. 
</p>
<p>
As for Switch 2, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-predicts-switch-2-will-outsell-its-predecessor-at-launch-despite-demand-exceeding-expectations">Nintendo says it expects Switch 2 will outsell its predecessor</a> through its first year on sale and shift 15m units - though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-admits-switch-2-demand-far-exceeds-expectations-in-japan-as-company-president-offers-stark-warning-over-stock">demand is expected to exceed expectations</a>, aside from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-tariffs-will-have-a-real-and-detrimental-impact-on-games-industry-says-us-trade-group">ever-changing impact of US tariffs</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair has released a statement regarding changes to its monster catching survival game which were made due to its ongoing Pokémon lawsuit.</p>
<p>Nintendo announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">suing Pocketpair for infringement of "multiple" patents</a> towards the end of last year. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says">later confirmed</a> the lawsuit was targeting three patents in particular. Then, as part of a winter update, Pocketpair subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">removed the ability to summon creatures by throwing Pokéball-style Pal Spheres</a>.</p>

<figcaption>Here's our Zoe with some thoughts on Palworld.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZl10Mlc7I" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1920360001794945232">social media platform X earlier today</a>, Pocketpair expressed its disappointment that such actions were required back then, before stating it was now having to make "yet another compromise" due to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This 'compromise' arrives with Patch v0.5.5. "From this patch onward, gliding will be performed using a glider rather than with Pals," the Palworld team wrote. "Pals in the player's team will still provide passive buffs to gliding, but players will now need to have a glider in their inventory in order to glide."</p>
<p>The developer said it understood this would be "disappointing for many", just as it is for the Palworld team. However, it said the changes are "necessary in order to prevent further disruptions" to the game's development, and it remains "committed... to delivering exciting new content" for players.</p>
<p>Pocketpair said it disputes the claims made against it, and still "[asserts] the invalidity of the patents in question".</p>

<p>Ever since Palworld was first revealed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-fans-hit-back-at-palworlds-lazy-pal-designs">comparisons were made between Pocketpair's own monster-catching title and Pokémon</a>. In fact, Palworld was dubbed 'Pokémon with guns' ahead of its early access release last year, and soon after its debut <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemons-former-chief-legal-officer-surprised-palworld-managed-to-get-this-far">The Pokémon Company's former chief legal officer Don McGowan said he was "surprised" the game had "got this far"</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, Pocketpair responded to Nintendo's legal action by asserting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-lawyers-state-existence-of-titanfall-2-ark-and-even-the-legend-of-zelda-invalidates-nintendos-patents">the patents The Pokémon Company believes Pocketpair has contravened are invalid due to other games that came before it</a>, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a>, Tomb Raider, and even Nintendo's own Legend of Zelda series.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Rockstar may have nudged the release date of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> back into 2026, but that doesn't mean interest has faded in any way, shape or form.</p>
<p>The second trailer for Grand Theft Auto 6 blasted its way past 475m views across platforms in just 24 hours. This makes the trailer the biggest video launch of all time, Rockstar told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-views-record-1236210396/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p>
<p>To put that figure into more perspective, the publication notes the trailer for Deadpool and Wolverine was viewed 365m times in its first 24 hours, while The Fantastic Four: First Steps debuted to more than 200m.</p>

<p>The first GTA 6 trailer was released all the way back in December 2023, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-proves-its-dominance-as-trailer-breaks-youtube-records">clocked up 93m views in the first 24 hours</a>, which is significantly less than the second trailer. The first trailer was exclusive to YouTube, however, and at the time of writing the second trailer only has 84m views on the platform. I say 'only' like it is nothing, but let's be honest, this is still hardly an insignificant number by any stretch.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, and as has been the case with many songs, Hot Together by The Pointer Sisters has additionally seen a boost since it was featured in the latest GTA 6 trailer. Spotify said streams of the song had risen by 182,000 percent since its release.</p>
<p>"Grand Theft Auto cuts through popular culture like almost nothing else," Sulinna Ong, Spotify's global head of editorial, said in a statement. "Music has been synonymous with the series since the very beginning, so it’s great to see fans both new and established connecting with an iconic track in this way."</p>
<p>Following the second trailer's debut, Rockstar updated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-cast-and-locations-revealed-troublesome-rappers-vice-city-and-beyond">GTA 6's website with details on the upcoming game's cast and locations</a>. Then yesterday, the developer confirmed the latest GTA 6 trailer was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-says-gta-6s-latest-trailer-was-gameplay-and-cutscenes-captured-entirely-in-game-on-ps5">a mix of "gameplay and cutscenes" captured "entirely in-game" on a PlayStation 5</a>.</p>
<p>GTA 6 is set to arrive on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th May</a> 2026.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The console will launch next month and, by March 2026, Nintendo has predicted 15m console sales and 45m sales of software, according to its latest financial report.</p>
<p>The original Switch console sold 14.87m units in its first year on sale (Q4 FY17 - Q3 FY18), meaning Nintendo is predicting its new console will sell quicker.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-hopes-to-beat-switch-sell-20m-switch-2-consoles-in-first-year-analysts-say">Analysts had predicted Switch 2 sales of over 20m</a>, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-admits-switch-2-demand-far-exceeds-expectations-in-japan-as-company-president-offers-stark-warning-over-stock">Nintendo recently admitted demand "far exceeds expectations"</a> and warned of stock shortages. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-tariffs-will-have-a-real-and-detrimental-impact-on-games-industry-says-us-trade-group">Trump's tariffs in the US</a> will also impact sales.</p>
<p>As for the original Switch console, hardware sales are down 31.2 percent year-on-year, while software sales are down 22.2 percent year-on-year. This is expected as the console nears the end of its life cycle and its follow-up has been announced.</p>
<p>Total lifetime sales for the Switch 1 are now at 152.12m units, just behind the DS at 154.02 units. The number of annual Switch 1 users has dipped slightly from 129 million to 128 million, but remains high.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> has sold particularly well, reaching 7.48m units. This makes it the fastest-selling game in the series on Switch, although <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party">Super Mario Party</a> hit lifetime sales of 20.1m. Still, Jamboree will see a second life with its Switch 2 upgrade.</p>
<p>Sales of other new games in the last fiscal year include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> (3.7m), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/paper-mario">Paper Mario</a> The Thousand Year Door (1.9m), Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership (1.6m), Luigi's Mansion 2 (1.6m), and Donkey Kong Country Returns (1m).</p>
<p>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, meanwhile, has sold a further 6.2m copies this financial year. Its lifetime sales are now 68.2m copies, ahead of Switch 2's flagship launch game Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>Interestingly, digital sales increased by 3.3 percent year-on-year, with 62.9 percent of software sales being digital in the last quarter. Sales of Nintendo games have traditionally been physical, but this slowly appears to be changing - perhaps more with Switch 2 considering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-most-switch-2-third-party-physical-releases-dont-have-the-game-on-the-card">most third-party physical releases don't have the game on the card</a>.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> already has a concept in mind for Death Stranding 3, but doesn't plan to make it himself.</p>
<p>Death Stranding was Kojima's first game from his new studio Kojima Productions, and will be followed up next month by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>.</p>
<p>It's unclear whether Kojima intends for Death Stranding to be a long-running franchise, but there's a new narrative device in the sequel that would allow, plot-wise, for future installments - <strong>some spoilers for Death Stranding 2 follow</strong>.</p>

<p>In a Q&amp;A during a preview for Death Stranding 2, Kojima discussed why he chose Australia as the setting for the sequel instead of America, and how this could be expanded further in future games.</p>
<p>"America already has the UCA [United Cities of America], so for the sequel, I debated whether to use the same sort of setting or not," Kojima said. "The first idea I had was that you would have to go around disconnecting everything you connected, because you learn that connecting was a big mistake. But that didn't feel right, as it would just be reusing the same environment."</p>
<p>"I wanted an area that was sprawled from east to west like America and also somewhere that faced the ocean to the north and south. In that case, Eurasia or Africa felt like too big of a continent, but in terms of size and scale, I felt that Australia was a good fit."</p>
<p>Kojima then "squeezed out" an idea of the Plate Gate, which in-game acts as a portal to another continent and allows protagonist Sam Porter-Bridges to travel to new environments.</p>
<p>"If I use this Plate Gate concept, I could make endless sequels!" said Kojima. "I, of course, don't have any plans to do that, but I already have a concept for another sequel. I am not going to make it myself, but if I passed it on to someone else, they could probably make it."</p>
<p>For more on the sequel, check out my extensive preview of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach detailing more on the game's premise, its expanded gameplay, and strong influence of Metal Gear Solid.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be released on 26th June exclusively on PlayStation 5, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-out-in-june-fake-snake-revealed">revealed at Kojima's SXSW panel in March</a> along with a ten minute trailer revealing Luca Marinelli's fake Snake character.</p>

A year and a half after Microsoft's purchase of Activision Blizzard for $69bn, the US Federal Trade Commission's continuing attempts to block the deal might finally have come to an end following the 9th Circuit Court's decision to deny its appeal of a 2023 lower court ruling.
</p>
<p>
The FTC has been battling Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard since it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-near-deal-to-buy-call-of-duty-maker-activision-blizzard-report">proposed in 2022</a>, arguing - in an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ftc-suing-to-block-microsofts-69bn-activision-blizzard-acquisition">antitrust lawsuit filed in December that year</a> - the deal would "harm competition in multiple dynamic and fast-growing gaming markets." After a substantial amount of legal back and forth throughout 2023, the US courts (alongside regulatory bodies around the world) cleared the way for Microsoft's deal to proceed, and proceed it did.
</p>
<p>
However, despite the fact <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">Microsoft's acquisition was completed in October 2023</a>, the FTC has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ftc-resumes-case-against-microsofts-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard">continued to petition the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals</a>, asking it to overturn a lower court's July 2023 decision <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ftcs-final-attempt-to-block-microsofts-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard-has-failed">not to issue a preliminary injunction halting Microsoft's deal</a>. However, as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/microsoft-wins-ftc-appeal-challenging-69-bln-activision-blizzard-deal-2025-05-07/">reported by Reuters</a>, the 9th Circuit Court has now upheld the earlier ruling, saying the lower court "applied the correct legal standards" and that the FTC failed to provide sufficient evidence Microsoft's deal would lessen competition.
</p>
<p>
In order to pursue its case further, the FTC would need to convince the US Supreme Court to overturn the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling, or it could resume its own internal administrative action that was put on hold in 2023 pending the 9th Circuit's decision. But with a new US administration in power and a new Trump-appointed chairman helming the FTC, the agency's focus may now be elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
As for Microsoft, it has been reaping the benefits of its $69bn acquisition since the deal was finalised in 2023; the company's Q1 2025 financial report showed a substantial 61 percent year-on-year increase in Xbox content and services revenue, largely thanks to Activision Blizzard.
