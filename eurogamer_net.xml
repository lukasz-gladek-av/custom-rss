            <p>
The voice artist behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a>'s Yennefer of Vengerberg has told Eurogamer that she doesn't know yet if her character will return in CD Projekt's in-development <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>.
</p>
<p>
Work on The Witcher 4 ramped up in earnest last November, following several years of pre-production. Now, over 400 staff at CD Projekt are assigned to the game - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-after-2026-so-could-it-be-a-next-generation-game">though it won't launch until at least 2027</a>.
</p>
<p>
Still, we already know the basics - that The Witcher 4 is a continuation of CD Projekt's existing trilogy, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ciri-as-witcher-4-protagonist-really-really-interesting-for-all-kinds-of-reasons-says-geralt-voice-actor">Ciri will now be its protagonist</a>, and that hero <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-of-town-that-was-definitely-doug-cockles-white-haired-monster-hunter-in-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer">Geralt has already been locked in as reappearing in some form, still voiced by Doug Cockle</a>.
</p>
<p>
But what about Yen? After Geralt and Ciri, sorceress Yennefer is arguably the next most important. Her relationship with Geralt is featured in numerous Witcher stories, and the character is also a prominent part of Netflix's The Witcher TV series.
</p>
<p>
"I don't know any of this," claimed The Witcher 3's Yennefer, Denise Gough, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI_ObQcMOwv/?igsh=MWlrMWt3anFqZ21xbg==">when asked by my colleague Mat Jones</a> what she knew of CD Projekt's progress on The Witcher 4.
</p>
<p>
Gough - now starring in the Star Wars series Andor as Dedra Meero - went on to suggest she hadn't known what to expect when recording for The Witcher 3 years ago.
</p>
<p>
"I didn't know what I was doing," Gough continued. "I'd never done a video game before. And then lots of, usually men, would come up to me in sound departments on film sets, would come up and go [whispers] 'are you Yennefer?' And I was like 'who's Yennefer?'"
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-talks-ciri-fan-reaction-playable-geralt-coyness-and-if-the-game-will-honour-your-previous-choices">Eurogamer recently sat down with The Witcher 4's game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber</a> to try and tease some information about when the game will be set, and how much Geralt might appear.
</p>
<p>"Currently, he's having the best time of his life," Kalemba joked, when we asked whether Geralt would be back in action and playable at any point. "[He's] playing with some wine, and dealing with vineyards. This is where we left him last time. But obviously we can promise that Geralt will appear, but we cannot tell you if it's going to be playable or not right now. But yeah, he will appear. He's going to be present in The Witcher 4."</p>
<p>As for Netflix's TV adaptation, we just got our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-peek-at-liam-hemsworths-geralt-on-set-in-the-witcher-season-5">first proper look at Liam Hemsworth in the role of Geralt</a> on set while filming its fifth season.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The A Minecraft Movie team is leaning in - or trying to counteract - the viral rowdy cinema  behaviour memes by introducing sing-along 'Block Party Edition' screenings.</p>
<p>These screenings will allow you to burst forth with your best Lava Chicken recital, while being backed up by a fellow chorus of Steves all there for the same thing. Or, you know, you can just yell out "Chicken Jockey" at the top of your lungs. The A Minecraft Movie lot wants you to "meme" along with the film.</p>
<p>In the words of Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures: "You know the moments. You know the lines. You love the songs! Now it’s time to get loose, laugh out loud and belt out those lyrics like a true diamond-tier fan."</p>

<p>If this sounds like your thing, you can book tickets for A Minecraft Movie: Block Party Edition now, with the screenings themselves happening on 2nd May. Not all cinemas are participating, though, so you will need to check your local listings.</p>
<p>If you aren't sure exactly what I am talking about when I write words like "Chicken Jockey" or "Lava Chicken", well then truth be told I am a little jealous. My children know all about these memes already, and will periodically just come out with them in the middle of supper/homework/the night and so on. They haven't even seen the film…</p>
<p>Anyway, Chicken Jockey refers to a moment in the film where Jason Momoa's Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison gets ready to fight a baby zombie riding on the back of a chicken. Jack Black's Steve then says "Chicken Jockey".</p>
<p>Now, that may not seem like much of A Moment to you or me, but a viral trend has seen some younger viewers of A Minecraft Movie going feral, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">screaming out loud mid-film while launching their popcorn into the air when those words are spoken</a>. In fact, things got so chaotic, cinemas and Jack Black himself popped up asking people to dial it back.</p>
<p>In a clip shared on social media earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-now-shows-warning-following-disruptive-chicken-jockey-trend">Black stood up in front of a cinema telling those present "absolutely no 'chicken jockey'"</a>.</p>
<p>"Lava Chicken", meanwhile, is a little ditty sung in the film by Black's Steve, about what happens when you add lava to a chicken in Minecraft (it cooks).</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Lava Chicken entered the UK's official music chart, becoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-now-shows-warning-following-disruptive-chicken-jockey-trend">the shortest ever entry in the official UK top 40</a>. The song itself is only 34 seconds long, and you can listen along below. </p>

            <p>
Developer Larian Studios has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-bids-final-farewell-for-real-this-time">officially bid a fond farewell to Baldur's Gate 3</a> following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-last-ever-major-update-gets-a-long-awaited-release-date">April's massive Update 8 patch</a>, and with the team now focusing on the future, company boss Swen Vincke has shared a little more on why it ultimately decided against releasing a paid DLC expansion for the acclaimed RPG, calling it the "boring" option.
</p>
<p>
Vincke <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-director-hasnt-completely-ruled-out-dlc">first addressed the idea of Baldur's Gate 3 DLC</a> all the way back in September 2023, around a month after the game had launched to a stellar critical and commercial reception. At the time, he said building on the base game would be "very hard" for the team, but "not undoable". But just five months later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">all fan hopes for DLC were dashed</a> when Vincke confirmed the studio was "gonna move on", meaning no DLC and no <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> 4. "We are not a company that's made to create DLCs, expansions," he explained. "We tried that actually, a few times. We failed every time - it's not our thing. Life is too short. Our ambitions are very large."
</p>
<p>
And now, in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy9P2HPF9ss">new interview with Game Spot</a>, Vincke has turned to the topic of DLC once more. When asked why Larian had ultimately opted against creating DLC for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> despite it being such a massive success, he replied, "It's boring, is really the honest answer. We tried to be in the DLC business, talked about that with BG3... there's just no passion... I mean happy player, happy business, but you also need a happy developer for a happy player. What we're doing now makes developers way more happy."

<p>
"We heard it's what we were supposed to do, right? You've got a huge game, a huge hit, and you've gotta make DLC this and DLC that and DLC there... and money's gonna pile up all high! And we just nodded and said, 'Yeah we'll make DLCs'. And then the moment that we had some time to think, we realised, 'What are you doing?'. Progressive insight is not a bad thing, so sometimes you go down the wrong path and then say, 'Oh fuck it', and just change course."
</p>
<p>
As for what Larian is doing now Baldur's Gate 3 is mostly all wrapped up (minus any lingering bug fixes), that remains a mystery. All Vincke would say during his Game Spot interview is that the studio is now "deep in the trenches" of its "next big thing" - a "crazy ambitious" project that's "shaping up quite well". And, of course, it's not the only thing Larian is working on, with Vincke having previously confirmed preparation for a second project is also underway. This, he admitted, is "not the easiest thing in the universe, because we make very complicated games, lots of permutations, lots of agency for players."
