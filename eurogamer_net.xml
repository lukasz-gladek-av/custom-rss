            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> developer Niantic has responded to confusion over unexplained progression limits for the game's first paid event battle pass, which went on sale yesterday.
</p>
<p>
The game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-tour-pass-how-to-get-points-ranks-milestones-rewards-deluxe-price-9505">Tour Pass is a core part of this weekend's upcoming Go Tour event</a>, and rewards an encounter with Mythical creature Victini plus oodles of in-game items and bonuses. It also includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-lucky-trinket-how-to-get-9505">the first Lucky Trinket item</a>, which instantly unlocks Lucky Friend status with a player of your choice.
</p>
<p>
There's a free version of the Tour Pass without Victini and the Lucky Trinket, or alternatively you can pay £14.99 for the Deluxe version with far more rewards at each rank. For those really looking to spend, you can instead pay £19.99 for the Deluxe pass with 10 tiers unlocked straight away.
</p>
<p>
Why would you want to pay to unlock tiers? Well, the Tour Pass has 100 levels of item and Pokémon encounter rewards, and then a further 400 levels of Stardust resource dollops - making for 500 levels total. And, currently, you are restricted to only unlocking five tiers per day. 
</p>
<p>
Pokémon Go does not currently state in-game that this restriction will be lifted when this weekend's game properly begins, and yet you can start inching through the battle pass now. 
</p>
<p>"I was excited to have something to grind for and actually go out and play," one fan wrote on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1ix96z1/update_on_tour_pass_from_niantic_support/">top Pokémon Go reddit TheSilphRoad</a>. "Then I reached my cap just playing around my office and I suddenly have no interest in going out to play."</p>
<p>"I feel robbed but I guess that's the norm," wrote another fan. "Went out and did all the raids and caught all the legendries from research only to get to the same level as I could have by just catching a few pokemon in the yard."</p>

<p>
On the one hand, allowing players to get to grips with the game's first battle pass ahead of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-tour-unova-event-times-schedule-rewards-free-activities-9505">Pokémon Go Tour this weekend</a> means fans can figure out how it all works in good time. On the other, not explaining the limits, not giving players the same experience they'll get at the weekend and selling an even more expensive version of the battle pass with extra progression built in without explaining that has left some fans complaining of a cash grab.
</p>
<p>
At the very least, it's a bizarre situation that could have been better explained - something Niantic itself has seemingly now realised, as it issued a <a href="https://x.com/NianticHelp/status/1894092647981072499">clarification notice via the game's Support social media account</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Trainers, we want to clarify the Tour Pass experience during the Road to Unova event. You can earn a capped amount of Pass Points per day from Monday to Friday to get a head start on your Tour Pass," Niantic wrote. 
</p>
<p>
"During Go Tour Global weekend, the Pass Point limits will be removed and you will have the opportunity to obtain an unlimited amount of points during the event."
</p>
<p>
The forthcoming event is one of Niantic's most heavily-monetised in-game weekends ever, with the following tickets available:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-masterwork-research-a-dazzling-aria-quest-steps-rewards-how-to-get-shiny-meloetta-9505">Masterwork quest for Shiny Meloetta</a> - £4.99</li>
<li>Tour Pass Deluxe - £14.99</li>
<li>Tour Pass Deluxe + 10 Levels - £19.99</li>
<li>Road to Unova: Raids Ticket - £4.99</li>
<li>Road to Unova: Hatch Ticket - £4.99</li>
</ul>

<p>
Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-developer-close-to-selling-games-for-35bn-to-saudi-owned-monopoly-go-maker-report">it was reported that Niantic was in negotiations with the Saudi-backed mobile giant Scopely</a>, developer of Monopoly Go and Marvel Strike Force, over a sale of the still hugely lucrative Pokémon Go. 
</p>
<p>
The news was met with shock by members of the Pokémon Go community, based on the aggressive monetisation added by Scopely to other games it has acquired. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fans-launch-campaign-to-protect-games-future-as-concerns-mount-over-sale">Fans have since begun contacting the overall owner of the Pokémon franchise to share their concerns</a>.

            <p>Activision has confirmed some in-game content in Call of Duty has been created using generative AI.</p>
<p>As spotted by Call of Duty account CharlieIntel, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1938090/Call_of_Duty/">Steam page</a> for the game's launcher (incorporating <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a>, Modern Warfare 3, and Warzone) has been updated with a new AI notice, as per the rules of Steam.</p>

<p>No further details are specified, but fans are already speculating where AI has been used.</p>
<p>"We could tell lmao this loading screen had six fingers," reads one reply, referring to the zombie artwork used last Christmas (above). <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-block-ops-6-players-accuse-activision-of-using-ai-slop">Players accused Activision at the time</a> of using "AI slop".</p>
<p>Other responses called out Activision for being lazy, or replied sarcastically: "Really? No way?!"</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Activision has now confirmed some in game content in Call of Duty is AI generated. </p><p>“Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in game assets,” Activision says as part of a required disclosure on Steam. <a href="https://t.co/YJ3Yebd2wc">pic.twitter.com/YJ3Yebd2wc</a></p></div>— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1894211182141091939?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 25, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Other artwork in the past has been called out by fans, including a <a href="https://x.com/notblametruth/status/1865233189091823987">six-fingered hand holding Gobblegum</a>, while <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-admits-its-using-generative-ai-to-help-develop-some-in-game-assets-and-suddenly-all-those-poorly-made-calling-cards-make-sense/">PC Gamer</a> has pointed out the seeming use of AI in 2D calling cards.</p>
<p>Since January 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-adds-in-game-reporting-of-illegal-content-in-ai-games">Valve has required developers to disclose on Steam when AI is used</a> in their games. Players are also able to flag when "illegal content" has been used.</p>
<p>AI is also used in Activision's Ricochet anti-cheat system, which uses machine learning to combat cheaters. But as <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/">Wired reported in 2024</a>, the rise in using generative AI for in-game assets has followed the loss of jobs across the games industry.</p>

            <p>Activision is continuing to tease the return of Tony Hawk and the Pro Skater series.</p>
<p>A new social media post from the official game account reads: "Loading... new parks. 3/4/25".</p>
<p>The date matches a countdown on the <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/">game's website</a>, but it's the "new parks" reference that has fans speculating. Does this mean a brand new game is on the way? Is it an expansion to the existing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</a> remake? Or is a remake combining <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</a> and 4 on the way? The latter would certainly match the date.</p>

<p>The social post also includes an image of Tony Hawk, and another with skaters Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Tony Hawk, Rodney Mullen, and Eric Koston.</p>
<p>Notably, all of these skaters appeared in both Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4.</p>

<p>The news follows other hints from Activision last week. Along with the website countdown, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-announcement-teased-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-latest-map">tease for a new Tony Hawk game was included in Call of Duty</a>.</p>
<p>Specifically, a remastered version of Black Ops 2's skatepark-themed multiplayer map, Grind, was added in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>'s Season 02 Reloaded update.</p>
<p>And along with the skatepark theme is a TV screen showing the date 03.04.25. This refers to the 4th March, in US date styling.</p>
<p>Before that, professional skateboarder <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mystery-tony-hawk-remaster-now-mentioned-by-pro-skater-involved-in-the-game-even-though-activision-hasnt-announced-it-yet">Tyshawn Jones let slip he's included in a forthcoming, unannounced Tony Hawk game</a>.</p>

<p>The project will be a "new game based on Konami's IP" - the specifics are unknown, but considering Bloober's horror pedigree and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-tops-one-million-copies-sold-in-less-than-a-week">Silent Hill 2 success</a>, a new game in that franchise seems like a safe bet.</p>

"By sharing knowledge and experience, we have been able to create high-quality production together. Of course, we can't reveal too many details at this time, but we are confident that fans will be just as excited about our collaboration as we are. We can't wait to share something truly special with players when the time is right."</p>

<p>Reads a press release on the news: "The trust built upon the success of Silent Hill 2 laid the foundation for signing another agreement for a new project. The deal aligns with Bloober Team's strategic plan to expand its internal development division within a first-party framework."</p>
<p>Konami's IP includes the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>, Castlevania, eFootball, Bomberman, and Suikoden, though Silent Hill does seem the most likely candidate for Bloober.</p>

<p>"We are super happy for the [Silent Hill] team, for the accomplishments, and I do believe that they paved the path for us," Cronos co-director Wojciech Piejko told Eurogamer. "They dramatically changed the reception of our company on the internet from 'Bloober should not touch Silent Hill' to 'new great game from Bloober!'</p>
<p>"I'm super thankful for them and I know it wasn't easy to survive all these critics on the internet. You always have to remember there are people behind every game. It doesn't make your work easier. So kudos for [the team], because they made the impossible possible with making Silent Hill."</p>
<p>Konami announced a number of Silent Hill games back in 2022, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-announced-from-resident-evil-reverse-developer">Silent Hill f</a> perhaps the most anticipated.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> publisher Ubisoft has responded to the leak of story details and gameplay footage from its upcoming samurai stabathon, a month ahead of the game's release date.
</p>
<p>
This past weekend, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/careful-of-spoilers-assassins-some-fans-are-playing-assassins-creed-shadows-early">photos posted online showed several fans now had access to early physical copies of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, while others claimed to have briefly been able to download a digital version of the game from the PlayStation Store.
</p>
<p>
Chunks of gameplay footage are now easily findable online, even as Ubisoft battles to remove the videos. Other fans have posted summaries of their time with the game so far, including story spoilers. And there's still weeks to go until Assassin's Creed Shadows' 20th March launch date.

</figure>
<p>
"We are aware players have accessed Assassin's Creed Shadows ahead of its official release," Ubisoft said in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1ixdc8d/a_message_from_the_assassins_creed_community_team/">message from the Assassin's Creed community team, posted to reddit</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"The development team is still working on patches to prepare the experience for launch and any footage shared online does not represent the final quality of the game."
</p>
<p>
Physical copies of the game were likely manufactured weeks if not months ago, while Ubisoft will continue to issue patches up to and beyond the game's street date in March. That said, fans report not seeing too many issues with the game so far.
</p>
<p>
"Leaks are unfortunate and can diminish the excitement for players," Ubisoft's statement continues. "We kindly ask you not to spoil the experience for others. Thank you to our community for already taking steps to protect everyone from spoilers.
</p>
<p>
"Stay in the shadows, avoid the spoilers, and keep an eye on our channel for more official surprises in the coming weeks!  20th March will be here soon!"
</p>
<p>
It's been a long wait for Assassin's Creed fans, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">repeated delays from the game's original launch date</a> late last year. Shadows is the first new Assassin's Creed game since 2023's Mirage, which was originally planned as an expansion for 2020's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>.
</p>
<p>
The game's launch comes amidst a pivotal few months for Ubisoft, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-acknowledges-buyout-reports-stating-it-regularly-reviews-options">the company looks poised to be sold or taken private</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-pre-orders-solid-in-line-with-series-second-biggest-launch">the threat of further layoffs loom</a>.

            <p>DC boss James Gunn has confirmed he's in talks with both Rocksteady and NetherRealm to develop new games in the DC Universe.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/james-gunns-new-plan-to-unify-dc-universe-includes-labelling-non-canon-games-as-dc-elseworlds">Gunn laid out his plans for the DC Universe back in 2023</a>, which would combine films, TV series and video games into a singular canon universe - much like Marvel has done.</p>
<p>Now, in a recent DC Studios event attended by <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/new-dc-games-netherrealm-rocksteady-batman-arkham-injustice-3/">ComicBook</a>, Gunn and his co-CEO Peter Safran confirmed they're in close talks with the two Warner Bros game studios.</p>

<p>"We work incredibly closely with JB Perrette who runs that division," said Safran. "It's really the first time it's ever been this way at Warner Bros. James and I sit with the guys that run the studios under JB whether it's NetherRealm or Rocksteady. We sit with them and we talk about characters and stories that we're interested in and that they're interested in."</p>
<p>Added Gunn: "We see designs for the projects in their very earliest stages. We talk about those, we talk about what the story might be and we'll say 'Well, maybe you want to go this way because we're planning on maybe doing something with <em>this </em>character'."</p>
<p>There are no details yet on what these games will be, or which characters they'll focus on, with Gunn stating it will be a "couple years" from now when we finally see for ourselves.</p>
<p>Later this year DC will release its new film incarnation of Superman, so could we finally see a decent game adaptation in the future to follow up? There will also be The Batman Part 2 in 2027, while in 2026 there are film plans for Supergirl and Clayface. Could these hint towards game plans?</p>
<p>NetherRealm most recently released <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a>, with the last in its DC fighting series <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/injustice-2">Injustice 2</a> released back in 2017. Rocksteady, meanwhile, released the ill-fated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> last year.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-has-a-new-single-player-batman-game-in-development-teases-new-report">Rocksteady is "looking to return to Batman for a single-player game"</a>, though it's "years away" from release.</p>
<p>Of course, there's also the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wonder-woman-games-reportedly-still-years-away-from-release-if-it-ever-launches-at-all">Wonder Woman game already in development from Monolith</a>, though it remains years away from release.</p>
<p>In further DC news, further crossovers with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is planned, as the company is discussing with Epic which characters to focus on. Again, the likes of Superman and Supergirl would make sense with the forthcoming films.</p>
<p>This wouldn't be the first time DC characters have appeared in Fortnite, as various heroes and villains have been available as skins in the past. However, this stopped once Warner Bros' crossover fighting game Multiversus launched.</p>
<p>It appears Warner Bros has U-turned on this decision following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-director-in-deep-mourning-following-last-weeks-shutdown-news">shutdown of Multiversus</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
