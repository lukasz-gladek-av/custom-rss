            <p>The games set to leave PlayStation Plus Extra in September have been revealed. The eight titles include some very good games, so you might want to make some time before 16th September to get them played.</p>
<p>As these games are part of the Game Catalogue and not the monthly games that you claim as part of PS Plus Essential, these games will no longer be playable from 16th September even if they are in your library.</p>
<p>Leaving PS Plus Extra on 16th September:</p>
<ul>
<li>UFC 5 (PS5)</li>
<li>The Plucky Squire (PS5)</li>
<li>Night in the Woods (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Road 96 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Pistol Whip (PSVR2)</li>
<li>Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir (PS4)</li>
<li>FIST: Forged In Shadow Torch (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Dragon's Crown Pro (PS4)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the bunch, I'd certainly recommend FIST: Forged In Shadow Torch, especially if you are partial to a Metroidvania. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pistol-whip">Pistol Whip</a> is superb if you have PS VR2, and the Plucky Squire is definitely worth a look even though it didn't quite live up to pre-launch expectations. Night in the Woods is also excellent.</p><p>In fact, why stop there... Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir and Dragon's Crown Pro are also very good games. So, really, what I'm saying is, don't rush to play UFC 5 (which is fine, but just more UFC) or Road 96 (didn't enjoy the writing on this, unfortunately), but all the others are worth your time.</p>

            <p>Gears of War creator Cliff 'CliffyB' Bleszinski is "thrilled" more people will be able to experience the original game when it arrives on PlayStation.</p>
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded is set to be released later this month, on 26th August, across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. It's a revamped edition of the original Gears of War, which first debuted on Xbox almost 20 years ago (yes, it has really been that long). </p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-coming-to-playstation">upcoming souped up version will come complete with faster frame rates and "deeper visual fidelity"</a>, and while he hasn't had a hand in it personally, Bleszinski is delighted that soon those on PlayStation will finally be able to experience the first Gears of War game for themselves.</p>

<p>"It doesn't feel strange," Bleszinski told Eurogamer when asked if it will be odd seeing the once Xbox exclusive popping up on Sony's newest consoles. "I'm thrilled that more people are going to get to experience a big part of my legacy that I worked so hard on."</p><p>The series creator added he is "asked nearly every day on social media" to return to Gears of War. "And I'm like 'uh, I've said it a thousand times I'm open to consult on any of it'," Bleszinski said, before closing:</p>

<p>"Crickets. On to the next!"</p>
<p>Along with his legacy in video games, Bleszinski is also a Broadway producer, restaurant owner and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-creator-cliffyb-says-series-needs-a-god-of-war-style-reboot">comic book creator</a>.</p>
<p>As for Gears of War, in addition to this month's Reloaded release there's also a new series entry in the works. It's known as Gears of War: E-Day, and will be a prequel title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marcus-fenix-returns-in-gears-of-war-prequel-e-day">set 14 years before the events of the original game</a>. Gears of War: E-Day is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bulletstorm-studio-confirms-project-maverick-is-a-gears-of-war-game">being co-developed with People Can Fly</a>.</p>
<p>Late last year, it was revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-is-so-back-as-original-voice-talents-are-confirmed-for-gears-of-war-e-day">John DiMiaggio and Carlos Ferro will be reprising their roles as Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago</a> in Gears of War: E-Day. "We are so back," a post announcing their inclusion teased.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> looks increasingly likely to be shown off in some form this evening at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> Opening Night Live. Show host and producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> tweeted a selfie while wearing a red nose, heavily pointing towards the game showing up at ONL tonight.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> clown image has become a popular meme around every possible Silksong re-reveal, fans posting it every time they get their hopes up only for them to be dashed at lack of new info.</p>


<p>We already know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-has-laid-out-its-gamescom-plans-and-they-include-a-playable-demo-of-hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong will be playable at Gamescom</a> on the show floor, so it's not a massive leap to expect to see it kick off the show at ONL. Whether or not we get a release date alongside new gameplay, well, that might be asking for a lot, but if the game is going to release in 2025 we'd expect to be getting that info in the near future.</p>
<p>Gamescom ONL kicks off properly at 7pm BST today, with a pre-show expected beforehand.</p>

            <p>PC gamers who are hoping Capcom updates <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> to improve performance will have to wait a little longer. A statement made on <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1957473035885121806">X.com</a> via the official Monster Hunter account has told players that improvements are coming, but not until this winter.</p>
<blockquote><p>To our hunters playing #MHWilds on PC, we're committed to listening to your feedback and improving both performance and stability of the game.</p>
<p>Although we will continue to implement gradual improvements in the weeks ahead, we are targeting Free Title Update 4 this winter to implement a multifaceted plan, including CPU and GPU related optimizations, followed by a second stage of mitigation measures afterwards.</p>
<p>We'll share more information on the specifics in the future.</p></blockquote>
<p>The news comes alongside the release of <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.021.02.00.html">Hotfix patch Ver.1.021.02.00</a>, which has dropped on PS5, Xbox, and PC.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hotfix patch Ver.1.021.02.00 details:</p>
<p>Bug Fixes and Balance Adjustments</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that reduced the invulnerability window upon successfully performing the long sword's Iai Spirit Slash against monster attacks that have long hit detection durations.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, when the Item Bar Display option is set to Type 1, if you select an item using the Item Bar while in Aim/Focus Mode and then release Aim/Focus Mode, the selected item would revert to an empty slot.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
