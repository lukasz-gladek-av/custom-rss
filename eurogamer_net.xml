            <p>
US president Donald Trump has effectively backtracked on the tariff exemptions announced last Friday which indicated that some electronics, like PCs, would escape the country's 145 percent levy on Chinese goods.
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media last night, Trump said that "NOBODY is getting 'off the hook'" and that "there was no Tariff 'exception' announced on Friday" (thanks, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62z54gwd22o">BBC News</a>). 
</p>
<p>
Chinese electrical goods would simply now be placed in "a different tariff bucket", Trump continued, concluding that National Security Tarriff Investigations would be reviewing "the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN".
</p>
<p>
US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick has told ABC News that a separate "semiconductor tariff" was now planned - exact details of which are yet to be determined. 
</p>
<p>"We need to have semiconductors, we need to have chips, and we need to have flat panels, we need to have these things made in America," Lutnick <a href="https://twitter.com/howardlutnick/status/1911439638062842356">said</a>. "We can't be reliant on Southeast Asia for all of the things that operate for us."</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jamieson-greer-trade-representative-trump-face-the-nation-transcript-04-13-2025/">CBS News</a>, US trade representative Jamieson Greer confirmed this semiconductor tariff meant Chinese electrical goods had therefore been given something that was "not really an exception. That's not even the right word for it."
</p>
<p>
"It's not that they won't be subject to tariffs geared at reshoring," Greer continued. "They'll just be under a different regime. It's shifting from one bucket of tariffs to a different bucket of potential tariffs."
</p>
<p>There's no detail yet on when this semiconductor tariff may be introduced, or by how much it will impact prices.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pcs-will-be-exempt-from-trumps-tariffs-but-consoles-will-not">the expectation was that PCs would escape Trump's tariffs, even if consoles such as Nintendo's incoming Switch 2 would not</a>. 
</p>
<p>Ahead of the US' so-called 'Liberation Day', <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-already-shipped-over-1m-vietnam-made-consoles-to-us-this-year-as-switch-2-launch-threatened-by-tariffs">Nintendo had already begun stockpiling Switch 2 consoles in the US, and directed the vast majority of its non-Chinese manufacturing output to the country</a>. Many <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> consoles set to be sold in the US will now have been made in Vietnam - a country which also initially had tariffs introduced, only for them to be paused.</p>
<p>This morning, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">Sony announced it had raised the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition price</a> in the UK and mainland Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and blamed the "tough decision" on "the backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> will let you clear bosses without actually defeating them.</p>
<p>That's according to game director <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>, speaking during a recent <a href="https://x.com/koji10_tbs">Koji Pro radio broadcast</a>, who said the upcoming sequel will have a feature that allows players to skip boss battles if they prove to be too difficult.</p>

<p>"For boss battles in DS2 (presumably in easy mode) there will be an extra option on the Game Over screen below the 'continue' option," <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1910720581085126707">Genki_JPN</a>, who translated, explained on social media.</p>
<p>According to Genki_JPN, if players choose to clear any of Death Stranding 2's bosses this way, they will still receive information about the foe, which will be presented "like a novel" via an image and text descriptions.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is set for release on 26th June, and includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-out-in-june-fake-snake-revealed">a new character that looks remarkably like Metal Gear Solid's Snake</a>. This was revealed during the game's SXSW 2025 showcase earlier in March.</p>
<p>Towards the end of last year, Kojima Productions shared several new snippets of footage for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-footage-sees-creepy-puppet-dollman-steal-the-show-in-unexpected-dance-number">including a look at the upcoming game's very realistic photo mode and Sam Bridges' stop motion puppet companion, Dollman</a>. As you would expect from a Kojima game, it all looks suitably bizarre.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in franchise news, earlier this month it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-movie-reportedly-being-helmed-by-a-quiet-place-day-one-director">Death Stranding's live-action movie adaptation had found its writer and director</a> in the form of A Quiet Place: Day One's Michael Sarnoski.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Director Eli Roth has shared his thoughts on what went wrong with last year's Borderlands adaptation, which was a critical and commercial flop.</p>
<p>Why did it fail? Well, Roth believes that the circumstances around the film, such as the Covid pandemic, certainly didn't do the team any favours.</p>

<p>In conversation with podcast <a href="https://puck.news/podcast_episode/director-eli-roth-will-kill-you-on-screen-for-1-million/">The Town</a> (via <a href="https://www.darkhorizons.com/eli-roth-reflects-on-borderlands-difficulties/">Dark Horizons</a>), Roth admitted that the first time he got to view the final film, he wasn't actually sure what he was going to see. This is because Roth had already started work on another film, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deadpool-film-director-takes-reigns-on-borderlands-reshoots">Deadpool film director Tim Miller had taken over Borderlands' reshoots</a>.</p>
<p>"[I] was doing Thanksgiving, and it's also the kind of thing we're like, wow, this is the first time I'm going to see a movie sort of being like, 'OK, I directed this, what happens?'. That was kind of an experience like, never had that before," Roth said.</p>
<p>"And I remember being... Am I at the point of my career where I'm going to sit down to watch my own movie that says I wrote and directed it, and I really genuinely don't know what's going to happen?"</p>
<p>The director still has plenty of respect for those that worked on the film, and said he would still work with Lionsgate again, but not "under those circumstances".</p>
<p>Roth continued:  "I think none of us, none of us anticipated how complicated things were gonna be with Covid. Not just in terms of what we're shooting, but then you have to do pick-up shots or reshoots and you have six people that are all on different sets and every one of those sets is getting shut down because the cities have opened up, and now there's a Covid outbreak and it was just like... we couldn't prep in a room together, I couldn't be with my stunt people, I couldn't do pre-vis, everyone's spread all over the place.</p>
<p>"You can't prep a movie on that scale over Zoom and I think we all thought we could pull it off and we got our asses handed to us a bit."</p>

<p>Last year's Cate Blanchett-fronted Borderlands adaptation was branded a "disaster" and "huge misfire" by viewers. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-borderlands-movie-impressions-brand-it-a-disaster-and-a-huge-misfire">one review called it a "lifeless, unfunny, and visually repulsive dud"</a>. The film generated just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-earned-4m-on-its-opening-day">$4m across 3125 locations on its opening day</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youll-be-able-to-watch-the-borderlands-film-at-home-very-soon-it-seems">quickly getting shifted onto streaming services</a>.</p>
<p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick had a more upbeat outlook on the Borderlands adaptation, however. Indeed, he said that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-film-benefited-game-sales-despite-being-disappointing-flop-take-two-boss-says">the "disappointing" movie hadn't hurt the Borderlands video game series, but rather it had given it a boost</a>.</p>
<p>The next entry in the Borderlands games franchise is due to<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-gets-new-trailer-and-a-release-date">release across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gearbox-is-bringing-borderlands-4-to-steam-as-pitchford-admits-hopes-for-epic-were-misplaced">Steam and the Epic Games Store at the same time</a>) on 23rd September.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> editions of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> will allow players to repair their equipment using the new accompanying app.</p>
<p>In both games, breakable equipment is a controversial inclusion. It forces players to experiment with new weapons, but losing a favourite mid-fight can be frustrating.</p>
<p>Now, though, there's a new way to repair your equipment. Nintendo is updating its app alongside the games, which we already know will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/achievements-can-be-earned-in-switch-2-editions-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom">include achievements, voiced navigation, and all-new memories</a>.

<p>Each day, players will be able to roll a roulette wheel for a daily bonus to be activated at any point in-game.</p>
<p>These bonuses (as spotted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-n0v0mpBVM&amp;t=594s">Zeltik</a>) include health restoration, energy cell recharges, various meals, and equipment repairs. The latter will allow players to use their chosen weapons a little longer.</p>
<p>Players may worry this will upset the balance of the game, but the bonus can only be used once each day. What's more, Zeltik noted the roulette wheel appears to be different each day, so repairs may not always be available.</p>
<p>It's a nice addition, though, to give players an extra option when their favourite sword is close to breaking point mid-battle against a Lynel.</p>
<p>While the Switch 2 editions provide a boost to the visual performance of both games, last week Nintendo confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-clarifies-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-switch-2-edition-doesnt-include-its-paid-dlc">Switch 2 edition of Breath of the Wild won't include its paid DLC</a>.

<p>Another<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-looks-to-be-streamlining-screenshot-and-video-sharing-so-its-less-of-a-faff"> improvement on the app will be streamlining screenshot and video capture</a> and sharing.</p>

            <p>
Sony has raised the price of PS5 once again, with increases in the UK, mainland Europe, Australia and New Zealand.
</p>
<p>
The PS5 Digital Edition will now cost £40 or €50 more, and will sell for £430/€500, up from £390/€450.
</p>
<p>
The price hike was announced in the early hours of this morning, via a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/13/ps5-price-to-rise-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/">blog post</a> in which Sony blamed the "tough decision" on "the backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates".
</p>
<p>
No price rises have been announced for the PS5's disc edition or the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> in the UK or mainland Europe.
</p>
<p>In Australia and New Zealand, the price of both the PS5 Digital Edition and PS5 with a disc drive will increase, to AU $750 or NZ $860, and AU $830 or $950 respectively.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-price-increase-announced-by-30-in-uk">Sony last raised the PS5's price here in Europe back in August 2022</a>, when it hiked the Digital Edition by £30 or €50, from £360/€400 to £390/€450.
</p>
<p>
This second round of price rises mean the PS5 Digital Edition is now, in pure monetary terms, £70 or €100 more expensive than when it originally went on sale. 
</p>
<p>
But as Sony taketh, so it giveth at least something back. If you did still want a Disc Drive add-on, this has been slightly cut in price - down to £70/€80. Maybe there's plenty of those still lying around the warehouse.
</p>
<p>At £430, the PS5 Digital Edition is the same price as Nintendo's forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">Switch 2 bundle with Mario Kart World</a>. Equally notable: Argos is still offering the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aD3L4e">PS5 Astro Bot bundle</a>, including a disc drive, at £430 as well.</p>
<p>Moreover, over at EE, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/avXDdP">PS5 Digital Edition with Astro Bot is still going for £329</a>, a full £100 less than the Sony’s looming price rise for the UK.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
