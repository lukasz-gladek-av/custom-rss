            <p>Stardew Valley creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has shared an update on his next game, Haunted Chocolatier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier was initially announced back in 2021</a>. In May of 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-creator-wont-rush-haunted-chocolatier-better-to-have-a-good-delayed-game-than-a-bad-game-on-time">Barone said he's "not too concerned with the pressure" of releasing Haunted Chocolatier</a>, stating "it's better to have a delayed game that's actually good than a bad game that's on time". </p>
<p>Then, last year, Barone assured his fans that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-promises-no-more-updates-until-haunted-chocolatier-releases">he is "committed to not working on Stardew Valley" until he's "done with Haunted Chocolatier"</a>. Since then, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/haunted-chocolatier-will-have-a-larger-world-than-stardew-valley-creator-confirms">Barone revealed that "the world of Haunted Chocolatier is larger than Stardew Valley"</a>, but otherwise word on the anticipated release has been somewhat slim.</p>

<p>That has changed now, though, thanks to a new <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2026/01/28/update-im-still-working-like-always/">Haunted Chocolatier blog post</a>. Here, the solo developer said he had "been very productive lately", and Haunted Chocolatier is indeed alive and well. While he did admit it is "taking a while" to get everything finished, he said there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>"I know, I know, I shouldn’t have announced the game so early. But I had my reasons," Barone wrote, before going to on "debunk a few myths and false assumptions" he had seen making the rounds.</p>
<p>First off, he assured everyone he will not be abandoning Haunted Chocolatier. He added even if he did decide to move on from his next game, he wouldn't be adding any unused content to Stardew Valley, as they "are separate games".</p><p>"It doesn't even make sense from a technical perspective, as Haunted Chocolatier is written from scratch, it's not the same 'engine' as Stardew Valley. You can’t just copy and paste Haunted Chocolatier into Stardew Valley," he explained. He furthered that when he is working on Stardew Valley, he is "not thinking" about Haunted Chocolatier, and "vice versa". This means he would "wouldn't 'test something out' in Stardew Valley" for Haunted Chocolatier. </p>
<p>Speaking of Stardew Valley, he is also working on a new update with "additional ideas for how to improve it", so there is something else to look forward to.</p>
<p>Finally, Barone addressed Haunted Chocolatier's release date. We still don't have one, alas, but Barone doesn't sound too concerned about that really. "The bottom line is, I don’t want to give a release date," he explained.</p>
<p>"The game will come out when it's done."</p>

<p>Back in January last year, Barone revealed that, as of December 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-continues-its-wholesome-farming-dominance-with-latest-sales-milestone">Stardew Valley had sold in excess of 41m copies across platforms</a>. Of those 41m, over half are on PC, with 26m copies sold. Meanwhile, the Nintendo Switch accounts for 7.9m Stardew Valley sales.</p>

<p>Season two of Fallout is starting to wrap up, with this series' penultimate episode airing yesterday. Again, we joined Lucy, Maximus, Hank, The Ghoul and more to find out what is going on with that powerful and coveted cold fusion tech (among other plot points, such as the bombshell Steph is not American, but Canadian - those vault dwellers were shook!).</p>
<p>But, back to cold fusion. During a flashback in episode seven, which is known as The Handoff, Cooper Howard is told he can meet with the President of the United States, and give the cold fusion technology to the most powerful man in the world. Howard trusts that the president will do the right thing, and so does indeed hand over the technology with not as much hesitation as I personally would have expected, but that is maybe a conversation for another day.</p><p>The reason we are here today is because of who played the US President in the Fallout TV show. And, it was none other than Clancy Brown, who voiced Rhombus, the head knight of the Lost Hills chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel in the original Fallout.</p>
<p>This is another nice little Easter egg from the Fallout TV show, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-twos-latest-episode-has-a-super-easter-egg-cameo-for-fans">which last week also featured a familiar face from the games</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-moves-forward-last-two-episodes">second season of Fallout will conclude next week</a>, on 3rd February. There are still plenty of loose ends to tidy up, though I don't suspect we will get satisfying answers to many of them, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-renews-fallout-for-third-season-six-months-before-second-arrives">what with series three on the cards</a> to mop up some unanswered questions.</p>
<p>The third season of Fallout is already being written, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">filming is expected to kick off this May</a>.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has finally, after months of speculation, acknowledged its rumoured Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remake. How has it done this, I hear you ask? Well, by sharing a meme from Grand Theft Auto, obviously.</p>

<p>The official Assassin's Creed social media account was responding to another post, which had shared images of a supposed Edward Kenway figurine releasing with Ubisoft's Black Flag Remake. "A guy on Vinted is selling a brand new Edward Kenway figurine and claims it’s releasing this year," this particular post read, with some accompanying images of the statue itself.</p>
<p>To this, Ubisoft replied with the classic meme from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a>, showing the game's protagonist CJ walking off while muttering in exasperation:</p>
<p>"Ah sh*t, here we go again."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>via X</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As for the statue, its base shows logos for Ubisoft and PureArts, with a copyright mark registered for 2026. And, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-statue-leaks">this reported Black Flag remake statue</a> is just one of the many pieces of evidence we have that Ubisoft is gearing up to rerelease its piratical Assassin's Creed adventure.</p><p>In addition to this merchandise, we also have the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-music-upload">rather suspicious reuploading of the Black Flag sea shanties on YouTube</a> (though, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-claims-assassins-creed-blag-flag-music-reuploads-were-due-to-technical-issues-and-nothing-more">developer did try and pass this off as "technical issues"</a>). Then, back in August of last year, voice actor Matt Ryan - who portrayed Edward Kenway in Assassin's Creed: Black Flag - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-threatened-with-legal-action-following-remake-slip-up">claimed legal action was brought against him by Ubisoft</a> after cheekily hinting at its existence at a convention. Oh, and we also have that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">PEGI listing for Black Flag Resynced which was spotted</a> in December.</p>
<p>At one point, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-could-set-sail-before-april">speculated Ubisoft would release its Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remake by this April</a>. However, earlier this month Ubisoft announced it had closed two studios and cancelled six projects - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sands-of-times-shock-cancellation-does-not-mean-we-are-stepping-away-from-the-franchise-says-remake-team">including its Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a> - as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">part of a major restructuring effort that will also see delays for seven games</a>.
