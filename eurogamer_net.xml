            <p>An upcoming and newly announced game in PlayStation's Horizon series is skipping PS5.</p>
<p>Last night, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> and Forbidden West developer Guerilla officially announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-mmo-reportedly-in-the-pipeline">series' long-rumored MMORPG</a>, known as Horizon Steel Frontiers. Steel Frontiers is coming from NCSoft, though Guerrilla has collaborated with the studio, and is a cross-platform release… for mobile and PC.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p><a href="https://hsf.plaync.com/en-us/conts/teaser#main">Steel Frontiers is described</a> as a "fierce survival adventure", in which players take on the role of machine hunters in a region known as Deathlands. The team promises "large-scale raids" and an "advanced combat system".</p>
<p>Along with the announcement, a trailer was shared for Horizon Steel Frontiers, which you can see further below in this article. However, while plenty have said the upcoming game looks actually pretty good, many have lamented that such a well known PlayStation series is getting a game that will not be released on PlayStation consoles.</p>
<p>"It's a huge miss that this is skipping consoles," reads one comment on the trailer's YouTube announcement. Another adds: "I hope this comes to console soon because if not that’s CRIMINAL!!!"</p>
<p>Comments on X are similar. "Guys we want this on PlayStation too" and "how about starting by releasing this on PS5 as well? It looks awesome and I'd love to play it... On PS5!" are two such replies to Guerrilla's post.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Guerrilla/status/1988826301608661461?s=20">follow up post on X</a>, Guerrilla said it had "loved" working with NCSoft on Horizon Steel Frontiers, and the team is "beyond excited to be able to hunt machines together in the world of Horizon". The developer added Guerrilla itself is "still busily working on more ways for you to do just that", teasing "more on that to come".</p><p>While the studio is yet to officially reveal a third mainline entry in the Horizon series, Guerrilla previously confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrilla-casually-confirms-horizon-forbidden-west-sequel">another game with Aloy at the forefront is in the pipeline</a>. In addition, a film adaptation based on the Horizon series is also in the works.</p>
<p>"Just imagine Aloy's beloved origin story set in a vibrant far future world filled with the giant machines brought to you for the first time on the big screen," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">PlayStation's Asad Qizilbash announced back in January of this year</a>.</p>
<p>For more on the Horizon series, earlier this year Aloy actress Ashly Burch spoke to Eurogamer about her thoughts on AI, and why <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-developer-replacing-all-actors-with-robots-not-going-to-happen-says-aloy-voice-actress">she believes Guerrilla replacing all actors with robots is "not going to happen"</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> has received a fresh update that adds a new Casual difficulty option for combat, among other changes to make it easier.</p>
<p>While Konami hasn't detailed the specifics of Casual difficulty, it is presumably easier than the existing Story option. It's selectable when starting a new game, or will be an option after reaching the Game Over screen multiple times.</p>
<p>Other tweaks to make the game easier include faster stamina replenishment, fewer enemies in some encounters, and less damage taken on Hard action difficulty.</p>
<p>The update further adds an option to skip certain sections on New Game+, which won't impact branching paths or endings. Considering some story details are saved for later playthroughs, this change will make experiencing the full game a lot easier - as Eurogamer's Matt Wales explained in his piece on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-is-the-first-game-in-four-decades-to-convince-me-new-game-plus-is-worth-my-time">Silent Hill f's New Game+</a>.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Thank you to all SILENT HILL f players for your patience. Today we've released a patch that adds a new casual difficulty and addresses feedback we've received, including reducing the amount of forced combat areas, speeding up NG+ runs, and bug fixes such as Sakuko's diary in NG+. <a href="https://t.co/kCiz4DoDft">https://t.co/kCiz4DoDft</a></p>— Al Yang (@QQBert) <a href="https://twitter.com/QQBert/status/1988831306864538009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>

<p>Though the game has been widely praised, Silent Hill f has been criticised for its combat encounters. In our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-review">Eurogamer review of Silent Hill f</a>, Vikki Blake described the combat as "clumsy", which makes it "extraordinarily difficult to do any real exploration of the world".</p>
<p>As such, this new Casual difficulty should appease those critics somewhat, and allow more players to experience the story.</p>
<p>Below are the full patch notes.</p>

            <p>Xbox boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has commented on Valve's freshly announced hardware, stating "gaming moves forward when players and developers have more ways to play and create, especially across open platforms".</p>
<p>Writing on social media, the exec praised "open platforms" for this forward momentum. "Expanding access across PC, console, and handheld devices reflects a future built on choice, core values that have guided Xbox's vision from the start," <a href="https://x.com/XboxP3/status/1988677531801944496">Spencer said</a>.</p>

<p>Rounding out his thoughts and congratulating Valve on its hardware announcements, Spencer closed: "As one of the largest publishers on Steam, we welcome new options for players to access games everywhere."</p>
<p>Elsewhere on social media, a fellow Xbox employee in the form of senior social media manager Josh Stein remarked that Valve's new hardware looked kind of like the "rumoured" Xbox Series S designs from back in 2019.</p>
<p>"All hail the cube," <a href="https://x.com/steinekin/status/1988671218099339775">Stein joked</a>.</p>

<p>While this may be quite a humorous coincidence, Valve has said the announcement of its Steam Machine stemmed from the company's own PC gaming experience. It is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-dont-work-back-from-whats-happening-in-other-spaces-valves-new-steam-hardware-stems-from-its-pc-gaming-experience-not-what-console-makers-playstation-and-xbox-are-doing">not coming from what fellow console makers such as Xbox were planning</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking to our Will Judd on the new hardware's announcement, Valve said: "We typically just work back from our own experience playing PC games and what we wish was possible to do and what we hear our users say as well."</p><p>Valve's new Steam hardware will be released next year, though release dates are currently unknown. If you're hoping to get your hands on it all, know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-it-be-easy-to-buy-a-steam-machine-valve-confirms-its-continually-improving-how-it-distributes-hardware-ahead-of-the-release-of-its-new-hardware-launches">Valve will continue to self-distribute hardware just as it did with the Steam Deck</a>.</p>
