            <p>
Nintendo will likely be the "primary partner for third-party game publishers" on console in five years, an analyst firm has forecast, by which time <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> will have hit 100m units sold.
</p>
<p>
A fresh report on the coming year in video games - and beyond - from veteran firm DFC Intelligence states that Nintendo is likely to beat its own forecast for Switch 2 sales this year, albeit slightly. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo has said it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-predicts-switch-2-will-outsell-its-predecessor-at-launch-despite-demand-exceeding-expectations">expects to shift 15m Switch 2 consoles before 31st March 2026</a>, though DFC forecasts Nintendo will in reality likely sell 16m - enough to say it has beat expectations. With supply chain improvements, sales could be even higher still - as many as 20m, DFC believes.
</p>
<p>
"Reflecting its historically conservative approach to new product forecasting, Nintendo is estimating sales of 15m Switch 2 units through the end of its fiscal year in March 2026," DFC wrote in its report, shared with Eurogamer. 
</p>
<p>
"When the original Switch launched in March 2017, Nintendo initially projected 10m units for the fiscal year but ultimately sold 15m units in that period. Based on that track record, the fact that Nintendo is forecasting a 15m unit number gives us confidence that they will be able to ramp up supply and navigate tariff challenges."
</p>
<p>
With the delay of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> to 2026, the launch of Switch 2 will be this year's biggest driver of video game spending - particularly so in Japan, DFC expects, where Nintendo has a competitively-priced local model for that market. 
</p>
<p>
Looking to the future, DFC says Switch 2 will hit 100m sales by 2029 and be the leading console system at that time. 
</p>
<p>
Both Sony and Microsoft have expressed interest in launching their own handheld devices, and both companies are also widely expected to be prepping their own next home consoles to arrive from 2027 onwards. But Nintendo launching Switch 2 now means it will have several years of headstart on PS6 and the next Xbox.
</p>
<p>
"DFC forecasts that by the end of 2029 the Switch 2 will have sold over 100m units making it the leading console system by a wide margin," the firm wrote. "The next few years could see Nintendo for the first time becoming the primary partner for third-party game publishers."
</p>
<p>
For context, Switch is currently on 152m sales after eight years. PlayStation 5 is on 74.9m after four and a half years. Xbox Series X/S is believed to be at around 30m units after the same time period, though Microsoft does not release official hardware figures.
</p>
<p>
Only seven console platforms have passed 100m over the years, with more than half from Nintendo: Game Boy/Color, Nintendo DS, Wii, Switch, PS1, PS2 and PS4. 
</p>
<p>
PS2 remains the best-selling console of all time at around 160m units sold - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-expects-switch-1-to-become-its-best-selling-hardware-ever-this-year-but-fall-just-short-of-ps2-record">though Switch 1 is giving it a run for its money, and now sits less than 8m consoles away</a>.

            <p>Bandai Namco's cancelled anime MMORPG Blue Protocol will release on PC and mobile this year outside of Japan, in Europe, North America and Latin America.</p>
<p>In August last year, the publisher stated it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namco-and-amazon-games-published-mmorpg-blue-protocol-has-worldwide-release-cancelled">shut down the Japanese servers for Blue Protocol</a> and cancelled its western release. Then, a few months later, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namcos-cancelled-mmorpg-blue-protocol-is-coming-back-as-star-resonance">Tencent-funded developer Bokura picked up the project</a>, carried over some of the original development team, and gave it a new name, Blue Protocol: Star Resonance.</p>
<p>Now the free-to-play game is confirmed for release outside of Japan for the first time and will be available on PC (Steam, Epic Games Store) and on mobile (iOS, Google).</p>

<p>The game will also support cross-platform play between the two platforms, with synchronised progression.</p>
<p>The MMORPG released in Japan in June 2023, with a proposed western release managed not by Bandai Namco but by Amazon Games. The game was intended to follow the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lost-ark">Lost Ark</a> and New World as Amazon Games' next big MMO.</p>
<p>However, the game received a mixed reaction from Japanese players. Its shutdown last year brought an end to hopes it would finally see a release outside of the country. A statement from the developers at the time said the "difficult decision" had been made to end service as "it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namco-reportedly-lost-over-100-staff-in-the-last-year">Bandai Namco reportedly lost over a hundred staff in the last year</a>, with the cancellation of Blue Protocol assumed to have caused job losses.</p>
<p>Now the game is making a return, promising a dynamic combat system, an anime-styled open world, deep character customisation, and plenty of options for socialising through trading, guilds, and community events.</p>
<p>I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blue-protocol-is-amazons-next-punt-on-east-meets-west">hands-on with Blue Protocol</a> in 2023 and although I enjoyed it, I had concerns on how it would stand out from other games in the genre. At least now we'll be able to see for ourselves here in the west.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
