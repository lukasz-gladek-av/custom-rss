If the thrill of bopping <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' base game menagerie is starting to fade, you'll no doubt be wanting to know what's next for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">Capcom's latest mega-hit</a>. And following a couple of previous teases, the publisher has now confirmed it'll be fully detailing Wilds' first major content update next Tuesday, 25th March.
</p>
<p>
Capcom's latest Monster Hunter Wilds Showcase - the first since last month's launch - begins at 2pm in the UK/7am PT <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/monsterhunter">over on Twitch</a>. It'll be hosted by producer Ryozo Tsujimoto and is set delve into Monster Hunter Wilds' first free Title Update (as Capcom likes to call these things), which is scheduled to arrive in "early April".
</p>
<p>
We do, of course, already have a fairly good idea of what Title Update 1 will bring thanks to Capcom's previous chatter. It's set to introduce everybody's favourite bubble dragon Mizutsune, for instance, as well as a "new place" for hunters to gather once they've completed the main story - so presumably the sort of centralised (and hopefully arm-wrestling enabled) social gathering hub we've seen in previous Monster Hunter games.

<p>
And finally in terms of earlier teases, Capcom's also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-first-content-update-brings-a-new-level-of-challenge-in-april">previously discussed a "new level of challenge"</a> for Wilds - one that'll manifest as a monster of "formidable strength" somewhere above the tougher Tempered variants currently found in-game. That's good news for everyone who (like me, in my <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">four star review</a>) felt Wilds' difficulty skewed a little low at launch.
</p>
<p>
Expect the remaining Title Update 1 blanks to be filled (and hopefully some news on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">much-needed performance improvements</a>) in Monster Hunter Wilds' showcase next week. To recap, things kick off next Tuesday, 25th March, at 2pm in the UK. And in the meantime, Capcom's got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-unveils-busy-in-game-event-schedule">full schedule of in-game events</a> to keep you occupied.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/out-of-the-blue-dragon-age-the-veilguard-just-got-a-new-weapon-set-on-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Surprise! <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> has just gained a few more weapons on PC, thanks to the arrival of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3281890/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard_Rooks_Weapons_Appearance_Offer/">Rook's Weapons Appearance Bundle</a>.
</p>
<p>
This unexpected Steam freebie is available for PC players at no extra cost, and has popped up now while the game is currently on offer at a steep discount to £25, reduced by 50 percent from its base price of £50.
</p>
<p>
The release of these new weapons comes despite the fact that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-veteran-writer-among-those-looking-for-work-after-post-dragon-age-the-veilguard-downsizing">BioWare has not only been downsized</a>, but had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-dragon-age-the-veilguard-just-received-its-final-major-update">previously signalled the end of its support for Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-ea-sports-fc-25-and-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-as-it-lowers-financial-forecast">publisher EA described it as having underperformed</a>.
</p>
<p>
Over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1jfx3qk/bioware_released_a_weapons_set_dlc_today/">reddit</a>, where the Rook's Weapons Appearance Bundle was first discovered (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-new-dlc-free-march-20/">TheGamer</a>), fans have speculated that these weapons were already included within the game's files for use in a future promotion - meaning no new work to make them has actually gone on.

Eurogamer has contacted EA for more detail on the Rook's Weapons Appearance Bundle - and asked whether these items will also eventually become unlocked for those who own the game on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
</p>
<p>Alongside Dragon Age: The Veilguard's current deep sale on Steam, the game also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-in-playstation-plus-next-month">popped up last month as part of Sony's PlayStation Plus subscription</a>.</p>
<p>EA recently raised eyebrows by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-suggests-dragon-age-the-veilguard-might-have-sold-better-if-it-was-live-service-so-what-does-this-mean-for-mass-effect-5">suggesting that the game might have sold better if it had kept its live-service elements</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/id-probably-like-quit-former-dragon-age-leads-react-to-eas-suggestion-the-veilguard-should-have-been-live-service">something previous Dragon Age developers have scoffed at</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
