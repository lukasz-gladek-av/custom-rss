            <p>A new live action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> trailer has been released which takes shots at Call of Duty's celebrity-focused marketing strategy, introducing a squad of household names including actor Zac Efron before quickly blowing them up.</p>
<p>This squad, which also features basketball player Jimmy Butler, country singer Morgan Wallen, and MMA fighter Paddy Pimblett walk across a ravaged bridge to Smashing Pumpkin's The World Is A Vampire. They all represent one of the classic Battlefield specialist classes, with weapons covered in colourful camos and charms.</p>
<p>After Zac Efron and his crew explode, they are replaced with a collection of standard looking modern military soldier types take their place and engage in typical video game live action trailer shenanigans. It's a two-birds with one stone affair where EA has clearly taken a little pot shot at its largest competitor, while also highlighting several key selling points for Battlefield 6 - those being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield">a lack of gaudy cosmetics</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-multiplayer-takes-a-bold-risky-new-direction">the death of a limiting specialist system</a>.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-battlefields-biggest-open-beta-ever-says-ea">proved exceptionally popular judging by its open beta tests</a>, and has established itself as a real competitor to Call of Duty this year. It's done so by tackling many problems FPS players have had with Call of Duty for several installments now - those being the prevalence of crossover and cameo skins, as well as a shift away from its modern military roots (at least as far as the multiplayer is concerned).</p><p>EA and Battlefield Studios <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-finally-got-our-first-look-at-battlefield-6s-campaign-and-it-looks-like-a-return-to-form-for-ea-and-dice">recently showed off the campaign in a recent Sony State of Play</a>, which is sticking true to the modern military presentation people seem to be craving, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-promises-to-be-most-mind-bending-black-ops-ever">whereas Black Ops 7 is diving into a more mind-bending space with its campaign</a>. It's a real clash for the hearts and minds of FPS lovers, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-the-best-battlefield-has-ever-done-one-million-in-steam-pre-orders">Battlefield 6 on track to do the best the series has ever done in the dustup</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">Earlier today, EA announced it is to be acquired by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund, investment firms Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners for $55bn</a>. Now a private company, the deal was financed with roughly $36bn from the trio and $20bn worth of debt. This deal marks the largest all-cash sponsor take-private investment in history according to EA's official press release on the matter.</p>

            <p>EA has officially been acquired by a group of investors including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund in a private transaction worth $55bn.</p>
<p>EA chairman and CEO Andrew Wilson will continue to lead the company - known for its sports games, BioWare's RPGs, The Sims, and forthcoming shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> - with the transaction expected to be completed in Q1 FY27.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/investors-including-saudi-s-pif-are-reportedly-in-advanced-talks-for-a-50bn-leveraged-buyout-of-ea">News of the acquisition came over the weekend</a>, before an official announcement today. The investor group comprises the PIF, as well as investment firms Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners.</p>
<p>"Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world's most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work," said Wilson.</p><p>"Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energised than ever about the future we are building."</p>
<p>"Electronic Arts is an extraordinary company with a world-class management team and a bold vision for the future. I've admired their ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, and as someone who grew up playing their games - and now enjoys them with his kids - I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead," said Jared Kushner, CEO of Affinity Partners. Kushner is US President Donald Trump's son-in-law.</p>
<p>PIF <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund-increases-stake-in-ea-by-55">increased its stake in EA in 2023</a>; now its 9.9 percent stake will roll over. The organisation also holds stakes in a number of gaming companies including Nintendo, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>, Embracer, Capcom, and more.</p>
<p>Ubisoft is another, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-to-get-surprise-free-story-dlc-later-this-year">Assassin's Creed Mirage set to receive a surprise free DLC</a> set in 9th century AlUla, an ancient Arabian city.

<p>The PIF was designed to diversify Saudi Arabia's revenue via investment in foreign companies. It's chaired by Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country's controversial ruler <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">blamed by the CIA for the assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi</a>, who has upheld the country's <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/">notoriously poor human rights record</a>.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>-inspired retro RPG Threads of Time has received a new gameplay trailer, showing off more of its time-travelling narrative.</p>
<p>From Canadian developer Riyo Games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-revealed-rpg-threads-of-time-will-compete-with-sea-of-stars-as-chrono-trigger-spiritual-successor">Threads of Time was first revealed at last year's Tokyo Game Show</a>. Now, a year later, this new trailer was shown at the PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct and it looks to be progressing nicely.</p>
<p>As with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s iconic classic, Threads of Time will take place across a number of time periods, from prehistory to a cyberpunk future, and is presented similarly to the Octopath Traveller HD-2D aesthetic.</p>

<p>One minute the adventurers are strolling through a bustling medieval town and battling the sort of fluffy or botanical creatures you'd typically expect in an RPG; the next they're exploring sci-fi facilities and a rain-soaked futuristic metropolis with flying cars overhead.</p>
<p>There are some beautiful animated scenes chopped in too, though I hope the character designs don't lean too heavily on Chrono Trigger nostalgia - I'm looking at you, robot.</p>
<p>What's really struck me, though, is the look of the battles. These are turn-based, but have a strong sense of depth with a perspective sitting between Octopath and Dragon Quest as characters fight across the foreground and background with some evocative environments.</p>

<p>There's no release date yet, though presumably it's set for release on PC.</p>
<p>It's also well-timed, following the critically acclaimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-stars">Sea of Stars</a> from fellow Canadian studio Sabotage as another Chrono Trigger-inspired retro RPG. That game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-stars-clockwork-dlc-will-release-later-this-month">DLC Throes of the Watchmaker was recently released</a>, if you need an excuse to return.</p>
<p>What's more, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-celebrating-chrono-trigger-anniversary-with-new-projects-sparking-re-release-hopes">Square Enix is this year celebrating the 30th anniversary of Chrono Trigger</a> and promised various projects would be released, sparking hope for some form of remake or remaster.</p>
<p>It's still unclear what's happening there, even as fans cry out for a re-release on current hardware. Until then, Threads of Time could well fill the gap.</p>
