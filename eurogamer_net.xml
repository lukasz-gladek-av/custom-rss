            <p>The legendary, unreleased Nintendo PlayStation was due to get an unnamed 2D space shooter as its first game - and the project was almost finished.</p>
<p>It's well-documented how Sony and Nintendo first partnered on an ill-fated disc drive add-on for the SNES - a project that ultimately resulted in Sony launching the PlayStation as its own console. But in a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtiJlzs0xRE&amp;t=1s">MinnMax</a>, former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida discussed playing the prototype Nintendo PlayStation system for the first time.</p>
<p>The first game everyone played, said Yoshida, was a 2D (or 2.5D) space shooter with assets streamed from the disc to offer richer graphics than had been seen at the time.</p>

<p>Yoshida compared the graphics to Silpheed developed by Game Arts that was released on Sega's Mega CD and used pre-rendered animation as a full motion video background.</p>
<p>Yoshida said he doesn't remember who developed or directed the game, though he wouldn't be surprised if the game still existed in Sony's archives on a CD.</p>
<p>As the Nintendo PlayStation was never released - and only one prototype seemingly still exists - Yoshida's comments are the only snippet we have of what kind of games players could have expected from the system.</p>
<p>Speaking of Nintendo, Yoshida also thought the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> announcement could have been a "larger reveal". "I am surprised there are not many surprises," he said, adding that the mouse controller was the only real shock.</p>
<p>The mouse functionality is something Yoshida can see being used for FPS games, he said. "But hopefully because it's Nintendo they'll use it in some more weird, bizarre, amazing way," he continued. "Something people wouldn't anticipate."</p>
<p>Yoshida hopes Nintendo Switch 2's full reveal in April will show us something new that's still hidden to us about the console.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement">Yoshida left PlayStation last month</a> after over 30 years at Sony.</p>
<p>He's since been discussing his time at the company and, in a previous interview, discussed how the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps-vita-almost-had-switch-like-capabilities-says-former-exec-shuhei-yoshida">PS Vita almost had Switch-like capabilities</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo has reported a huge drop in sales of its hardware and software, with Switch 1 console sales down 30.6 percent year-on-year for the nine months ending 31st December.
</p>
<p>
Switch 1 software sales also fell significantly - down 24.4 percent. In a statement, Nintendo blamed the scale of the drop on tough comparisons with 2023, and the launches of both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> and Super Mario Bros Wonder.
</p>
<p>
Sales of the aging Switch 1 have been falling for years, meanwhile, but Nintendo's latest results are worse than the company previously forecast. Alongside the impact of a poorer US dollar exchange rate, Switch 1's performance has now forced Nintendo to lower its expectations again for the remainder of the financial year. 
</p>

<p>
The company is now forecasting its net sales for the financial year ending on 31st March as 1.19tn yen (£6.16bn), down seven percent from its previous expectations, and its net profit as 270m yen (£1.39m), down 10 percent. 
</p>
<p>
It wasn't all doom and gloom. New releases included <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, which sold 3.91m copies - a good number, though predictably nowhere near the sales of either <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a> or Tears of the Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo also launched <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party">Super Mario Party</a> Jamboree, which sold an impressive 6.17m copies.
</p>
<p>
And, of course, the unstoppable <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> continued to sell well. It shifted another 5.38m copies over the last nine months of 2024, and now stands at a whopping 67.35m copies sold.
</p>
<p>
Switch 1 now stands at 150.86m consoles sold to date, just shy of the Nintendo DS's lifetime total of 154m.  While Nintendo should squeak past that, its less certain the console can reach the record 160m sales of PlayStation 2.
</p><p>
How many more units can Switch 1 sell? Nintendo's software line-up currently looks slim, with Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition due in March, before Metroid Prime 4, which feels likely to be a Switch 2 cross-gen game, later this year.
</p>
<p>
Switch 1 still has one final Pokémon game up its sleeve, Pokémon Legends Z-A, expected to arrive this summer. But it's now clear that Switch 2 can't come soon enough. We're next due an update from Nintendo - when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">presumably we'll hear about Switch 2's release date and price</a> - in April.

            <p>Ready your wingsuits, Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan scribe is set to write the Just Cause movie adaptation.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/aaron-rabin-just-cause-video-game-adaptation-universal/">The Wrap</a>, Aaron Rabin has been brought on to write the upcoming film adaptation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/avalanche-studios">Avalanche Studios</a>' action series. In addition to Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan, which starred John Krasinski in the lead role, Rabin is also known for Silent River and the upcoming action-thriller film sequel, Nobody 2.</p>
<p>The writer joins <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-movie-is-on-the-way">Blue Beetle director Ángel Manuel Soto on the Just Cause adaptation</a>, which is being produced by Kelly McCormick and David Leitch through 87North's first-look deal with Universal. If that name sounds familiar, it's because the company has also produced films such as 2024's Ryan Gosling-fronted stunt comedy The Fall Guy, and Bullet Train.</p>

<p>Word of a Just Cause movie adaptation of some kind has been around for a while now. Back in 2017, Aquaman star <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/aquaman-jason-momoa-set-to-star-in-just-cause-movie">Jason Momoa was said to be in talks to play Rico Rodriguez</a> in a movie based on the open world action game. While his casting was not mentioned in today's report, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movies-second-trailer-brings-deep-steve-lore-tree-punching-square-bee">Momoa will still get to flex his video game related acting muscles in this year's Minecraft adaptation</a>, which is set to be released in April.</p><p>But, back to Just Cause. While the plot for the upcoming film is being kept under wraps for now, the Just Cause video game series follows protagonist Rico Rodriguez, as he attempts to overthrow corrupt governments and regimes across the globe.</p>
<p>The most recent series entry was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/just-cause-4">Just Cause 4</a>. "Likeably scrappy open-world carnage," our Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-4-review-likeably-scrappy-open-world-carnage">Eurogamer's Just Cause 4 review</a>. "Weather effects and party balloons see a knockabout charmer return in decent form."</p>
<p>There was also a Just Cause mobile game in the works, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enixs-long-delayed-just-cause-mobile-officially-cancelled">this was cancelled in 2023</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Treyarch co-founder Peter Akemann - who more recently served as president of Skydance Interactive - has pleaded guilty to flying the drone that crashed into, and grounded, a firefighting plane assisting in the efforts to control the recent LA wildfires.
</p>
<p>
Akemann's drone crashed into the Super Scooper firefighting plane - capable of carrying over 1000 gallons of water to dump on fires - on 9th January (thanks <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/local-news/ex-skydance-exec-piloted-drone-crashed-plane-palisades-fire-1236123911/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>). The impact resulted in damage to the aircraft's left wing, grounded it for several days and preventing it from participating in the LA firefighting operation.
</p>
<p>
At the time of the crash, the US Federal Aviation Administration had implemented temporary flight restrictions barring drones from flying near the Southern California wildfires. Despite this, Akemann is said to have launched a drone from the top floor of a Santa Monica parking garage in an attempt to survey the Palisades Fire, but eventually lost track of it a mile and a half from its starting point - at which point it collided with the firefighting plane.
</p>
<p>
Authorities eventually traced the drone back to Akemann, and he's now <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/akemann-plea-agreement.pdf">agreed to plead guilty</a> to one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft - a misdemeanor offence that carries a prison sentence of up to one year. However, Akemann is hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane.
</p><p>
"This defendant recklessly flew an aircraft into airspace where first responders were risking their lives in an attempt to protect lives and property," acting US attorney Joseph T. McNally <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/culver-city-man-agrees-plead-guilty-recklessly-crashing-drone-super-scooper">said in a statement</a>. "This damage caused to the Super Scooper is a stark reminder that flying drones during times of emergency poses an extreme threat to personnel trying to help people and compromises the overall ability of police and fire to conduct operations. As this case demonstrates, we will track down drone operators who violate the law and interfere with the critical work of our first responders."
</p>
<p>
In a seperate statement, Akemann's defense attorneys said he is "deeply sorry" for the incident, adding he "accepts responsibility for his grave error in judgment, and is cooperating with the government in effort to make amends." However, they also pointed to a "number of mitigating factors that will come to light during the court proceedings", including the supposed failure of a geo fencing safeguard feature on Akemann’s DJI Drone.
</p>
<p>
Akemann co-founded Treyach - the studio best known for its work on the Call of Duty series - in 1996, and more recently served as president of Skydance Interactive, which he joined in 2016. The Hollywood Reporter says Akemann "recently left his role" at Skydance, however.
