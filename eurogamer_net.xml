            <p>
Borderlands 4, as we learned this week, is now arriving earlier than expected - but definitely not because of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, oh no. And with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-forward-perhaps-because-2k-knows-exactly-when-gta-6-is-coming-out">revised 12th September release date now out there</a>, developer Gearbox has shared more of its latest looty shooter in a new PlayStation showcase.
</p>
<p>
Weighing in at around 20 minutes, Gearbox's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KlRBwf3sjY">PlayStation-hosted Borderlands 4 "deep dive" video</a> spotlights a couple of new Vault Hunters, some of its new weapons, new traversal mechanics, its new planet, and more - all to whip-up enthusiasm for what creative director Graeme Timmins called "hands-down our best Borderlands ever".
</p>
<p>
Borderlands 4 - which supposedly harkens back to a time when the series was more "grounded", according to Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford - features four new Vault Hunters, and two were the focus of the studio's showcase: Vex the Siren and Rafa the Exo-Soldier.

<p>
Vex can utilise supernatural phase energy and conjure deadly minions, while Rafa comes equipped with an experimental exo-suit capable of "digistructing" an arsenal of weapons. In an <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/30/borderlands-4-revealing-vault-hunter-skills-new-planet-kairos-and-more/">accompanying PlayStation Blog post</a>, Gearbox noted players can choose from three signature abilities  for their Vault Hunters, and there's talk of unique class Traits, special arguments, capstone abilities, and three branching upgrade paths of passive skills.
</p>
<p>
The team also highlighted some of Borderlands 4 new movement abilities - including gliding, dashing, double-jumping, and point-grappling - as they offered a short introduction to the Kairos, the all-new, seamlessly connected planet where the series' latest action unfolds. Expect new faces, returning characters - including Claptrap, Moxxi, and Zane - plus a personalised Digirunner vehicle players can summon to speed around the place.
</p>
<p>
There's plenty more detail to be found across Gearbox's deep dive video and blog post, so if any of that appeals, remember: Borderlands 4 now launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 12th September and not two weeks later. Why? That's "100 percent" down to the studio's "confidence in the game and development trajectory backed by actual tasks and bug find/fix rates", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-not-the-reason-for-borderlands-4-release-date-change-randy-pitchford-insists">according to Pitchford</a>. And really, honestly, nothing to do with publisher Take-Two wanting to nudge it out the way of its other big game, GTA 6.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-hardware-revenue-continues-to-tumble-but-gaming-revenue-is-up-microsoft-reports<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Microsoft has <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q3/press-release-webcast">shared its financial earnings</a> for the third quarter of its 2025 fiscal year, and there's good news for Xbox - with gaming revenue up, despite hardware revenue continuing to fall.
</p>
<p> 
As a whole, Microsoft made $70.1bn in revenue during Q3 and saw a net income of $25.8bn, marking a 13 and 18 percent year-over-year increase respectively. That growth was predominantly driven by its Cloud and Office services, but its gaming division saw success too.
</p>
<p>
Overall, Xbox gaming revenue was up five percent year-over-year, and within that, Xbox content and services - which includes Microsoft's first-party game releases and Game Pass - saw an eight percent increase. While the quarter saw <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> launch for Xbox and PC, the company primarily attributed its Q3 gaming growth to Call of Duty and Minecraft. Additionally, Game Pass subscriptions are up - but it's unclear by how much, given membership figures haven't been revised since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-game-pass-now-has-34m-fully-paid-subscribers">Microsoft revealed they'd crossed 34m</a> last February.
</p>
<p>
These successes were offset, however, by a continuing decline in Xbox hardware numbers over Q3, with console sales falling by six percent year-on-year. Xbox's hardware slump has coincided with Microsoft's continuing efforts to pursue a platform agnostic approach for its releases, with its various cloud gaming partnerships meaning Game Pass titles can be streamed on everything from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-cloud-gaming-is-heading-to-meta-quest-vr-headsets">Meta Quest headsets</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-can-now-stream-xbox-games-direct-to-your-lg-tv-no-console-required">TVs</a>. Even so, Microsoft has repeatedly indicated it has no intention of backing out of the console market; not only has it discussed various Xbox handheld plans, it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-says-next-xbox-will-deliver-largest-technical-leap-seen-in-a-hardware-generation">confirmed work on an Xbox Series X/S is well underway</a>.
</p>
<p>
Xbox president Sarah Bon previously said this new console would focus on "delivering the largest technical leap that you will have ever seen in a hardware generation", and recent reports have claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-next-gen-console-reportedly-targeting-2027-with-handheld-device-due-this-year">Microsoft is currently aiming for a 2027 release</a>.
