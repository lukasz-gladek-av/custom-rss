            <p>
Summer might be coming to an end, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> isn't quite done holidaying yet. Its new getaway themed Adventure Awaits expansion arrives for all platforms on 2nd October, and ahead of its release EA has shared a first gameplay trailer, providing a better idea of what's in store.
</p>
<p>
A major new Sims 4 expansion means a new world to explore, and in Adventure Awaits' case that's Gibbi Point. Here, players can find three new neighbourhoods: Wanderwood Wilds and its forest trails, Crystal Valley with its sparkling rock formations, and the waterfront Jellyfish Junction.
</p>
<p>
Each of these features its own getaway location where Sims can retreat from the hustle and bustle of day-to-day life. There's Wanderwood Wilds' Camp Gibbi Gibbi, Crystal Valley's Love Highland, and Jellyfish Junction's Revive &amp; Thrive. And to aid Sims in their relaxation, Adventure Awaits introduces a new Scheduling Getaway feature enabling players to plan everything from long weekends to summer breaks, even recurring breaks. Additionally, new Custom Venues, in combination with the new Getaway System, mean it's possible to build getaways from scratch, complete with their own activities and rules.

<p>
By way of example, Adventure Awaits includes a Cosy Bed &amp; Breakfast, an Outdoor Kids Camp, a Fitness Retreat, and Cooking Competition - and more are available if you own other expansions. You can create a Corporate Retreat with Get to Work, for instance, an Off the Grid Survival Competition with Island Living, even a Dog Training getaway with Cats and Dogs. 
</p><p>
On top of all that, Adventure Awaits introduces new systems for child Sims. There are new Traits, new Formative Moments that shape young Sims' skills and personalities, evolving Childhood Sentiments that "influence experiences well into adulthood", plus new child focused aspirations (Cool Kid on the Block, for instance), new personality options (Goofball, Creative, Competitive, and Evil), even imaginary friends. 
</p>
<p>
Adventure Awaits also brings new activities. For the young 'uns, there's papercraft, archery, diving, and entymology, plus classic games like hide-and-seek or rock-paper-scissors. Adult Sims, meanwhile, can go kayaking, watersliding, take a spin class, test their survival skills in Elimination Challenges, even become a Park Worker, which offers two career paths: Camp Counselor and Park Ranger. There's a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/adventure-awaits-expansion-pack">little more detail over on EA's blog</a>, and you can see at least some of Adventure Awaits' new features in the gameplay trailer above. Oh, and if you missed it, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS0NxrRJm6I">original reveal trailer is here</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Sims 4's Adventure Awaits expansion arrives for Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Mac on 2nd October and costs Â£34.99. Anyone who picks it up before 13th November gets what EA is calling an "early purchase incentive" - the Toasty Tower Lamp, the Toasty Tea Kettle, and the Toasty Tootsies Socks.
