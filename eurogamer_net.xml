            <p>On its release back in 2023, Nintendo kept the Imprisoning War Sages from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> shrouded in a certain amount of mystery. In fact, despite them playing a fairly key role in terms of the overall backstory, we only saw them in the game very briefly.</p>
<p>That changed in last year's release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, which was set before the events of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Here, the Hyrule Warriors team was able to shine more of a light on the war's Sages, who we now know to be Ardi of the Gerudo, Qia of the Zora, Raphica of the Rito and Agraston of the Goron.</p>

<p>In Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, players are able to take on the role of each Sage as well as the likes of Princess Zelda and Rauru, as they fight through waves upon waves of bokoblins, Lynels and more.</p>
<p>But, why did Nintendo keep Tears of the Kingdom's Imprisoning War Sages under wraps like it did until the spin-off prequel? Well, director Hidemaro Fujibayashi has now said if the developer had shown the Sages' faces and shared their names before then, the story of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom "would have naturally grown too much" for the game.</p><p>"In Tears of the Kingdom there was a central theme running through the main story, and the Sages are depicted with their faces hidden by masks and without names," Fujibayashi said in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/898/G089833/20251205029/">4Gamer</a> (translated by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-explains-why-it-kept-the-imprisoning-war-sages-a-mystery-in-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">NintendoEverything</a>). The director then went on to state there were "many things" Nintendo "intentionally held back" for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a> sequel.</p>
<p>"If we had shown [the Sages'] personalities and faces, the story would have naturally grown too much," Fujibayashi further explained. "That's why I'm truly happy that the Sages have been more carefully picked up upon here in the Imprisoning War."</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-impressions-review-story-gameplay">Alex took Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment out for a spin</a> ahead of its release, calling it the series' "richest offering yet".</p>
<p>Since its release in November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-free-update-adds-more-weapons-and-enemies-to-the-chaos">updates for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment have added additional weapons</a>, as well as new Vicious enemies.</p>

            <p>There are a few series staples you can expect from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>: a guy called Cid, moogles, chocobos, that lovely arpeggio motif in the music, and… surveys? If you've been reading this site for a while - or, indeed, following the Final Fantasy series - you'll know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> likes to lobby the fanbase to hear our thoughts about the series' identity and future.</p>
<p>The publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-15-survey-hints-at-possible-future-updates">did it for Final Fantasy 15 back in 2017</a>, it did to find out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-polling-final-fantasy-fans-on-moogles-in-ff15">what we all thought about moogles in 2015</a>, Naoki 'Yoshi-P' Yoshida <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-on-dawntrail-criticism-community-feedback-and-the-future-of-final-fantasy-14">regularly uses surveys</a> to poll <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">FF14</a> players, and Square Enix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-successfully-expanded-the-series-audience-says-dlc-director">found out that more young people played Final Fantasy 16</a> via a survey in 2024. Keeping with tradition, then, we're seeing the Japanese company once again ask players about the storied series in a poll. And it closes on 9th January.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, we don't really know anything about where the mainline series is going. Yoshi-P said in an interview last year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/not-a-clear-cut-answer-whether-final-fantasy-17-will-be-turn-based-says-naoki-yoshida-following-clair-obscurs-success">the team isn't even sure whether the game will be turn-based or not</a> (though we do know, at least, Square Enix wants to keep whatever game comes out of its current work a 'cinematic experience').</p>
<p>If you've got big thoughts about what you want to see - something more turn-based, maybe? Something more in line with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> or Metaphor Refantazio, perhaps? - then you can <a href="https://questant.jp/q/6K9FPT4N">head on over to the link</a> and have your say about what you'd like to see more (or less) of in the series going forward.</p><p>Personally, I was electrified by the comments Kazutoyo Maehiro, director of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> remake, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-tactics-remake-could-open-the-door-to-a-sequel-if-it-sells-well-says-director">made in an interview last year</a>. Basically, he mentioned that if the re-release sold well, then it would "open the door" to a sequel and "prove the business viability of the strategy RPG genre."</p>
<p>There's an open field at the end of the survey where you can leave whatever comments you like. This is where I've opted to pop my interest in more Final Fantasy Tactics-related titles. Feel free to add what you want, but please, keep it civil.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> developer Sandfall will focus on what those at the studio personally think is "cool" for its next game, rather than feel any pressure to focus on what anyone else thinks it should do.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was met with widespread acclaim on its release last year, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">rounded out 2025 by scooping up the coveted Game of the Year accolade at The Game Awards</a>. This success has meant many eyes are now on Sandfall and what the studio will do next, with plenty of high expectations.</p>
<p>So, has this pressure changed how those at the studio will approach the developer's next game? Well, according to Sandfall's chief operating officer and production director François Meurisse, this new-found pressure is "not so important to us".</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=2961&amp;awinaffid=103504&amp;clickref=grd-gb-3689496626345421370&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.magazinesdirect.com%2Fuk%2Fedge-subscription%2Fdp%2F39f150bb">Edge magazine</a>, Meurisse said Sandfall already has "some great ideas" which it is "excited to explore". He also noted the studio isn't starting "from the same point" that it was when it began work on Clair Obscur. "The team already has five more years of experience. So maybe we can do some great stuff," he said (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-next-game-will-simply-focus-on-what-we-think-is-cool-ive-seen-too-many-tv-shows-and-books-be-swayed-trying-to-please-a-lot-of-people/">GamesRadar</a>).</p><p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen added she is "a bit of a people pleaser", and therefore it is "always in the back of [her] mind that we have a lot of fans now, and they have certain expectations and certain feelings towards the game". She admitted she would be kidding herself and us if she said she "didn't think about that" from time to time. However even though this may be the case, she said the team's creative "North Star" will always be its "own personal taste" in terms of what it thinks "is cool", and what the team itself enjoys.</p>
<p>"I've seen too many TV shows and books be swayed trying to please a lot of people, and in the process you end up losing the heart of what's there," Clair Obscur's lead writer said.</p>
<p>"So [we] feel like we need to trust our instincts and continue to trust the vision behind the studio."</p>

<p>Towards the end of last year, the success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was publicly acknowledged once again by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-publicly-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-calling-the-game-of-the-year-win-a-historic-first">French President Emmanuel Macron</a>, who said its Game of the Year win was a source of "great pride for Montpellier and for France".</p><p>During the awards show last month, developer Sandfall Interactive announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-expansion-is-available-right-now-adding-a-photo-mode-and-vibrant-new-world">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's previously teased expansion was available for all players</a>. While of course a welcome addition for the many fans out there, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-fans-cant-get-over-just-how-difficult-the-updates-new-bosses-and-challenges-are-now">this expansion and its bosses have proven tricky for some</a>.</p>
<p>For more, I recently spoke with actor Maxence Cazorla - who performed the physical side of things for Clair Obscur's Gustave, Renoir and Verso, and voiced Esquie - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-characters-a-life-changing-experience-and-the-mysterious-project-w-for-maxence-cazorla-expedition-33-is-more-than-just-a-game-of-the-year-contender">about his work on Expedition 33, and what the game has meant to him personally</a>.</p>
