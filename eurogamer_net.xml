            <p>Good news, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>' free 3.0 Switch update for all owners has been released earlier than we thought.</p>
<p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons' highly anticipated 3.0 update was expected to be released for those of us here in the UK at 1am tomorrow, 15th January. However, many of us very excited folks here at Eurogamer have discovered that the update is actually available to download now. Yes, you read that correctly. It is available <strong>now</strong>.</p>

<p>As I type, our wonderful Guides team is downloading the 3.0 update. I, alas, will have to wait for my lunch break, which thankfully isn't too far away. Anyway, I digress. Back to that update!</p>
<p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 sees - among other things - the grand opening of a new Resort Hotel down on the pier, which is run by Kapp'n's family, as well as a new Reset Service, courtesy of Resetti, that'll offer a quick way to get a fresh start.</p><p>Something our Kelsey is quite excited about is the introduction of bulk crafting. In fact, there are a few things she is excited about, and Kelsey has created a handy guide detailing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/top-five-things-in-animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update">the five things you need to check-out first in Animal Crossing: New Horizons' 3.0 update</a>.</p>

            <p>We're only two weeks into 2026, but the new year hasn't been kind to Ubisoft employees. Right after the closure of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shuts-down-assassins-creed-rebellion-developer-halifax-studio-just-weeks-after-it-unionized">Ubisoft Halifax</a> and layoffs at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-continues-new-wave-of-layoffs-as-55-jobs-are-expected-to-be-cut-at-massive-and-stockholm-offices">Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm</a>, roles are reportedly being cut at Ubisoft Abu Dhabi too.</p>
<p>Game industry news and analysis site <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-ubisoft-laying-off-staff-at-abu-dhabi-studio">Game Developer</a> shared on 14th January several employees at the studio were posting on LinkedIn about cuts happening <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7400125428398485507-ZyjH?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADFAsRABhOsYZ5gi1rHJt8siTTjfHP2Sa-k">as far back as December 2025</a>. A bit of digging reveals <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/daniel-kovacs-206b2316a_i-took-some-time-to-reflect-after-being-impacted-activity-7401147823175639040-t3WE?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADFAsRABhOsYZ5gi1rHJt8siTTjfHP2Sa-k">similar posts</a> by more ex-employees, with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zshafiq_opentowork-opentowork-ubisoft-activity-7416772579723665409-Xgp6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADFAsRABhOsYZ5gi1rHJt8siTTjfHP2Sa-k">the latest</a> appearing on the site earlier this week. The full impact of the layoffs at the studio is unclear, but it seems it's not being shut down.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/careers/locations/abu-dhabi">Ubisoft Abu Dhabi</a> was opened in 2011 and "serves as Ubisoft's Regional Hub for games development." The studio has worked on mobile games such as CSI: Hidden Crimes (pictured above) and the big free-to-play sandbox MMO <a href="https://www.growtopiagame.com/">Growtopia</a>.</p>
<p>The new wave of layoffs arrived shortly after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-announce-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios-to-lead-development-for-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-franchises">Ubisoft and Tencent formed the subsidiary Vantage Studios</a> to house the Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry franchises. It is widely assumed those are the safest Ubisoft properties moving forward, which explains why studios not directly involved with them are currently being hit the hardest.</p><p>Ubisoft's 2026 release schedule has yet to be defined even if we know new triple-A heavy hitters are in development as we speak. For now, we're expecting the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/raid-shadow-legends-collaboration-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake">Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag and Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remakes</a> to help boost those numbers, and we heard of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-division-definitive-edition">surprise "definitive edition" of the first Division game</a> earlier this week too.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Josef Fares, known for his outspoken and often expletive laden thoughts (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/josef-fares-sweary-oscars-rant-hidden-in-it-takes-two">remember <em>that </em>Oscars rant</a>?), has now shared his opinion on one of the moment's hottest topics: AI.</p>
<p>AI really can't be escaped these days. In 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">a report by Unity claimed 62 percent of studios using its tools used AI</a> at some point during game development. In this report, Unity noted animation was the top use case. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-third-of-developers-impacted-by-layoffs-in-last-12-months-according-to-gdc-survey">GDC survey from that same year</a>, meanwhile, said that around a third of industry workers reported using AI tools already. It is fair to say that figure will likely be higher now.</p>

<p>But, what of Fares' studio Hazelight, which has released acclaimed games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> since its conception.</p>
<p>"We have been working with AI for a long time in game development," Fares said during a recent interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/split-fictions-josef-fares-i-would">The Game Business</a>. The vocal developer added that if an AI tool is "helpful to get your vision out there", then he doesn't see "why we shouldn't look into it". However, when it comes to generative AI, he understands that's where people are less keen to see the technology adopted, and this controversial tool is where "the problem" is.</p><p>"It's really hard to answer. If you look at Midjourney, for instance, when it came out it was so impressive. And five years later… the bar hasn't gone up much," Fares explained. "Maybe this is the limit of it. You get someone generating a game concept and saying, 'oh look what might happen in five years?' But who knows? In five years, maybe it’s going to be like Midjourney… not much better."</p>
<p>When it all comes down to it, though, Fares stated there still needs to be "someone that has a vision or idea of what game it is", and therefore he doesn't  "see AI taking over". That said, he admitted it's also "really hard to answer", because: "Who knows what happens in the future?"</p>

<p>Elsewhere during his chat with The Game Business, Fares also shared his support for EA, stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-gets-more-than-they-deserve-says-split-fiction-director-josef-fares">the Split Fiction publisher gets "more shit than they deserve"</a>.</p>
<p>As for AI, last week a patent filed by Sony over a year ago resurfaced, revealing the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-has-patented-an-ai-gaming-ghost-that-will-play-playstation-games-for-you-when-you-get-stuck">company has ideas for an AI 'ghost' that could assist players if they get stuck in a game</a>.</p>

            <p>Following a strong launch back in October, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">Battlefield 6</a> unleashed a notable first season of content, which was expected to end around 20th January. However, following heated feedback, EA and Battlefield Studios are saying Season 2 will now arrive in February.</p>
<p>The meaty update on the state of the game and what's next <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2807960/view/497217247660478118?l=english">arrived on 13th January</a>, after the quiet Christmas break. The teams don't go into much depth about the "community feedback" that prompted the decision to delay season two until 17th February, but it reaffirms their vision as explained around the game's launch: Content won't be pushed out just to keep the live service going if more tinkering is needed.</p>

<p>The extension of season one will add almost an entire month to the battle pass completion time, and new content is coming to keep the faithful busy until 17th February. "The Season One extension update to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> and REDSEC will be released on 20th January, which will include new weekly challenges, a Bonus Path, and a continuation of the Season One Battle Pass until the start date of Season Two," the team said.</p>
<p>The 'Frostfire Bonus Path' will drop on 27th January, and add "new customisation rewards, including a Weapon Package and a Soldier Skin, as well as XP Boosts". This new path of the season one battle pass will only use regular weekly challenges for progression after criticism of past bonus challenges. Moreover, it can be worked on alongside the main path. And yes, owners of the premium pass will get extra cosmetics. Expect more details soon.</p><p>"Later this update, we'll be celebrating Valentine's Day: commit to your duo now, or forever hold your peace. We're also introducing another set of Daily Login Rewards and several Double XP Weekends throughout the update period," the latest post added. Events aren't slowing down, it seems.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 continues to enjoy success, but the (admittedly impatient) hardcore military shooter player base has been quite vocal about hit registration issues and the need for bigger maps even if Season One already delivered on that front. With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> missing most of its shots, Battlefield is in a good position at the moment, but looking at how massive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-has-now-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-so-youre-all-getting-a-golden-pickaxe-as-a-reward">Arc Raiders</a> is becoming, EA and Battlefield Studios could be on the clock to please the diehards before they decide to move on.</p>
<p>Needless to say, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vince-zampella-co-creator-of-call-of-duty-and-respawn-entertainment-has-died">Vince Zampella's recent passing</a> might have caused some chaos and confusion at Battlefield Studios, as he was the man tasked with leading the charge on Battlefield 6's development and the series' future after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-review-dices-magic-fps-formula-gets-spread-too-thin">2042</a> nearly killed the franchise.</p>
<p>That's a job well done, I say.</p>

<p>A notable addition here is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-xbox-game-pass-games-for-january">which is also set to arrive on Xbox Game Pass on 20th January</a>. "Capcom's follow-up to its first-person Resi reinvention is a fantastic horror romp - for its first half, at least." reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-village-review-an-entertaining-if-uneven-slice-of-horror">Eurogamer's Resident Evil Village review</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a> is another good'un, in my humble opinion. But, don't just take my word for it. Eurogamer contributor Kaan Serin was also rather taken with it on its release, awarding it four out of five stars. "Violent stakes once again meet zany shenanigans in Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, the series' much-improved second RPG," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">Eurogamer's Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth review</a>.</p>
<p>Should this leak prove accurate, the above games will be joining the likes of Need for Speed Unbound, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed">Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</a> and Core Keeper, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-ps-plus-monthly-games-for-january">which were added for all PS Plus members earlier this month</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-has-now-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-so-youre-all-getting-a-golden-pickaxe-as-a-reward">Arc Raiders</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> might be the online shooters of the moment, but that doesn't mean other recent hits like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> have gone under. In fact, NetEase's take on the property remains a strong alternative to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> which has received tonnes of love since its late 2024 debut. Now, Deadpool is almost here, and his gameplay trailer packs a punch.</p>
<p>The 'Merc with a Mouth' was finally confirmed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DY9eYEx6KQ">during last month's Game Awards</a>, after plenty of leaks and datamines. Marvel Rivals has been expanding at a much better pace than the aforementioned Blizzard-developed hero shooter ever did, typically dropping two heroes (or villains) per season into the roster, alongside new maps and modes. Traditionally, each hero has a single strict role (tank, DPS, or healer) as per the subgenre's conventions. However, Deadpool, much like in the comics and movies, writes his own rules… literally. You can check out Deadpool's trailer below.</p>

<p>Video games including Wade Wilson have acknowledged his fourth-wall-breaking abilities through dialogue and maybe a handful of zanier comic book moments. Gameplay-wise, he has always been represented as a goofy mercenary (who won't shut up) with access to lots of blades and guns. I mean, on a basic level, that's who he is. The Marvel Rivals team has taken the character's kit to the next level though.</p><p>My first impression is Wade could be a nightmare to properly balance after he arrives on 16th February. He can effortlessly swap between the Vanguard (tank), Duelist (DPS), and Strategist (healer) roles, and each kit comes with plenty of abilities that dish out incredible amounts of damage and notable buffs for his allies.</p>
<p>When NetEase first teased he'd be a flexible character, I certainly wasn't expecting him to whip out a comic book in the middle of a match and choose who he wants to be <em>inside </em>the game. That's the most Deadpool thing ever though.</p>
<p>Other highlights in the trailer include Deadpool taking selfies, his enemies being beaten up by comic book drawings on their screens, and a stylish MVP screen which also breaks the traditional boundaries of the game. I think it's safe to say this is the best adaptation of the character we've seen in a video game so far, and the fact it's all part of a fast-paced online shooter only makes it even more impressive.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmU6RtypJ3w">Season 6 of Marvel Rivals</a> (dubbed 'Night at the Museum') also kicks off this Friday, 16th January, and on top of Deadpool's arrival, players are hoping for matchmaking improvements and more quality of life fixes and tweaks.</p>

<p>Back in February, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">Marvel Rivals had amassed over 40 million players since its launch</a>. Despite this success, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">laid off an unspecified number of the Marvel Rivals development team</a> last year.</p>
<p>Following this, the Marvel Rivals publisher said the layoffs were a "difficult decision" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-publisher-netease-responds-to-shocking-layoffs-claims-they-were-to-optimise-development-efficiency">made to "optimise development efficiency" for the game</a>.</p>
