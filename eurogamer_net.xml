            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a> is getting The Devil's Triade update this fall, adding two the devil frame Uriel, a new quest, and two new protoframes. Yes, you can romance them.
</p>
<p>The update is a side story that's coming alongside the next major update: The Old Peace. The protoframes you'll be meeting are Harrow and Wisp, a sign that new protoframes will still be coming even as the game leaves <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframes-motorbiking-pal-romancing-boyband-battling-1999-expansion-finally-has-a-release-date">the Warframe 1999 setting</a>.
</p>
<p>Uriel, the devil-themed warframe coming alongside The Devil's Triade, was confirmed by Soulframe's creative director Geoff Crookes in a pre-Tennocon Q&amp;A as the last design by Michael “Mynki” James Brennan, who passed away last year.

<p>In that same pre-Tennocon Q&amp;A, Warframe community manager Megan Everett confirmed that those who choose to romance these new Protoframes as part of The Devil's Triade side story will not have to worry about pre-existing relationships in the Warframe 1999 setting. The reason being that Warframe 1999 is The Drifter's story, whereas this upcoming update focuses on The Operator.</p>
<p>There's been a lot of reveals of Tennocon this year. Earlier today, Soulframe got a new trailer and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-alpha-prelude-access-2025-delay-2026">opened the floodgates for anyone who signs up</a>. </p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a> fans won't need to be reminded it's a big weekend for developer Digital Extremes and its long-running sci-fi shooter. Thanks to this year's TennoCon live event, which is traditionally the time for the studio to dazzle its community with all sorts of things to come, we've now got a pretty good idea of what Warframe's next twelve months look like.
</p>
<p>
Top of the list for this year's big updates is The Old Peace, Warframe's next major quest and narrative chapter. It's basically the prelude to next year's big Tau update (which we'll get to in a bit) and comes packaged with a new side story called The Devil's Triad.
</p>
<p>
Focusing on The Old Peace's quest bit first, it whisks players back to the Tau of the past, where - to paraphrase the official description - they'll ecnounter a childhood Sentient friend named Adis, and experience the conflict between the Orokin, their creations, and a coalition of Dax Anarch Warriors upon the Perita moon. And as for that Devil's Triad side story, it'll serve as the introduction to three new characters: Father Lyon Allard (the Protoframe of Harrow), Marie Leroux (the Protoframe of Wisp), and new devil-themed Warframe Uriel.

<p>
Alongside all <em>that</em>, you've got a new enemy faction, a Focus expansion introducing a new Operator ability, and - on that subject - a full graphical remaster for Warframe's Operators, which includes new character models and cosmetic assets, new facial animations, and more.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date for The Old Peace yet besides its vague "2025" window, but you can at least keep your Tenno spirits up in the immediate terms with the tuneful Lullaby of the Manifold, which is leaping out of Digital Extremes' Old Peace reveal trailer and onto "most" major music streaming platforms on 21st July. Valkyrie gets some new premium in-game cosmetic options when her Heirloom Collection arrives on the same day, and - as summer departs in its annual seasonal strop - there's still more to come. 
</p>
<p>
In October, Digital Extremes is teaming up with tabletop RPG creator Paizo to bring Warframe to tabletops in both physical and digital forms, while other autumnal treats include the launch of Warframe's closed beta on Android (you can <a href="http://warframe.com/android">sign up for that here</a>), and another big update currently known only as "untitled". It might not have a name yet, but it'll still be one to watch, and it's introducing a very much-requested - and much-needed - tutorial quest teaching players how to use Warframe's complicated upgrade system, Mods. Digital Extremes has sought outside help for this one, and the resulting quest, appropriately known as The Teacher, has been developed in collaboration with Sumo Digital.

<p>
On top of all that, "untitled" brings an  Oberon rework, a new Lavos deluxe skin, plus various quality-of-life improvements, which you can learn more about in a livestream this September. And one more thing to add under 'relatively imminent': Caliban Prime Access arrives "soon".
</p>
<p>
And finally for your Warframe calendars, should that be a thing you own, there's the aforementioned Tau. It's described as a "monumental" new narrative chapter that follows on from the events of this year's The Old Peace, and it's launching in 2026. And if Digital Extremes' wish comes true, Warframe <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-studio-would-love-to-do-a-proper-switch-2-version-but-its-still-waiting-on-a-dev-kit-so-if-you-know-anyone">might even be available on Switch 2</a> by then.

            <p>EA is planning a three-day event that will finally include the reveal of the next Battlefield game. Rumour has it, it's called - yup, you've guessed it - Battlefield 6.</p>
<p>According to Battlefield content creator Rivalxfactor, via a combination of informants and a <a href="https://i.ibb.co/mVCZqL74/battlefield-6.jpg">now-deleted tweet</a> from a content creator who received a "massive" Battlefield 6 case in the mail, they believe a reveal is imminent, with Rivalxfactor stating they have it confirmed that "there is indeed a three-day RA event starting on 29th July".</p>

<p>"This is where Battlefield 6 will be revealed, devs will be interviewed in a somewhat fixed format, and the game will be featured with content creators," Rivalxfactor <a href="https://x.com/rivaLxfactor/status/1946401115240644819">wrote</a>. "The open beta will launch shortly after.</p>
<p>"It will be much like the BF1 event with players getting a live round in after the devs speak and video is showcased," they <a href="https://x.com/rivaLxfactor/status/1946400245388038395">added</a> on a different tweet.</p>
<p>As for the picture of the promotional case that's seemingly gone out to content creators? We can't presume it's real, of course - so take it all with the requisite dollop of salt - but the image shows a case with 'Battlefield 6' emblazoned across the front, its straps seemingly branded with different Battlefield modes, including Conquest, Breakthrough, PTFO, and Rush.</p> <div>

<p>Pretty much all we officially know about the next Battlefield so far is that it's set in the modern day, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">bring back traditional classes and more focused maps</a> after the unpopular changes made in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>. Beyond that, it's all speculation - although one sleuth scoured the new game's concept art and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-sleuth-seemingly-identifies-location-teased-in-next-games-first-bit-of-concept-art">identified landmarks suggesting it could be set in Gibraltar</a>. EA confirmed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-expected-to-release-before-april-2026">expects the series' latest instalment to arrive before April next year</a>.</p>
<p>Although the closed Battlefield playtest is described as the "most ambitious community testing program in franchise history" and requires participants to sign an NDA, plenty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefields-invite-only-playtest-has-just-begun-and-gameplay-is-already-leaking-online">gameplay footage has popped up in various corners of the internet</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reminds-battlefield-players-things-taking-place-in-labs-may-or-may-not-make-their-way-to-the-final-game">EA was not happy</a>, eventually hitting back at a grumpy Reddit thread about an unsupported claim about skill-based matchmaking, but stuff continues to leak, including clips of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhifj5/bf6_campaign/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">gameplay</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhnpdm/all_of_the_bf_labs_subfactions/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">factions</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhny43/gear_customization_heading_in_the_right_direction/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">gear customisation options</a>, its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lh7bzp/how_do_you_feel_about_battle_royale/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">battle royale</a> mode, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-single-player-campaign-details-leak-online">its single-player campaign</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-leak-confirms-return-of-fan-favourite-mode">18 minutes of Rush mode</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-image-suggests-the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-called-battlefield-6-and-the-reveal-event-is-coming-very-soon]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Outlast Trials Season 4, Project Diarchy, is now available, ushering in 2 new MK-Challenges, a reworked Rebirth system, new cosmetics, and an all-new Shopping Mall map in which new prime assets Otto and Arora Kress will terrorise you. Lovely.</p>
<p>Conjoined at birth, the Kress Twins "have a set of eyes both fore and aft". Able to spot a victim from any angle, you'll either have to stop them with a thrown vile of noxious poison, or "split them in two with their buzzsaw". Double lovely.</p>

<p>You can also expect a new trial - Kill the Politician - and the complementary MK Challenge, which sees you guarding them "door to door". There's also Sentence The Prosecuted in which you'll have to decipher the charges, pin them to the defendant, and "make sure that it sticks". Which probably means exactly what it says on the tin.</p>
<p>As for the Rebirth rework?</p>
<p>"After careful consideration, Easterman is reopening the Rebirth to all reagents who deserve it," Red Barrels writes. "Rebirth now offers two options: The original Rebirth for solo players. The new Rebirth, called Communal Rebirth, which is designed for teams."</p>
<p>Communal Rebirth drops the players in a random Trial with 3 unique variators - Mirror, Rebirth, and Classified. Rebirth now requires each member of a group to have 100 Rebirth Tokens. It is now possible to stack up to 1000 Rebirth Tokens, which is just as well, because Rebirth Token rewards for completing Trials have also been revisited, and you'll now get 5 Rebirth Tokens per Trial, and 3 Rebirth Tokens per MK-Challenge.</p>
<p>The original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outlast">Outlast</a> launched back in 2013, casting players as journalist Miles Upshur as he investigated the notorious Mount Massive Asylum. Its terrifying (and often quite grim) blend of first-person night-vision exploration and frantic chase thrills quickly attracted fans, leading to a story expansion the following year and a full-blown sequel in 2017.</p>
<p>This second outing - which saw players investigating a murder in the Arizona desert - ramped up the violence and strenuous pursuit sequences to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outlast-2-review">slightly less positive reception</a>, but it still did well enough that Red Barrels was able to launch a third game, co-operative multplayer survival horror <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outlast-trials">The Outlast Trials</a>, into early access in 2023.</p>
<p>"The Outlast Trials is excessive and frantically enjoyable - but can occasionally tip over into frustration more than fear," I wrote when I reviewed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outlast-trials-review-a-unique-obscene-spin-on-the-horror-staple">The Outlast Trials</a> back when it was released in early access, awarding it three out of five stars.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outlast-horror-series-is-getting-a-movie-adaptation">Lionsgate recently announced it's working on a film version of developer Red Barrels' survival horror series, Outlast</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outlast-trials-season-4-is-here-heres-whats-new]]></content:encoded>

<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> became the unexpected focus of industry drama last week when Krafton <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-leadership-replaced-by-krafton-despite-looming-early-access">announced it was 'replacing' three key members of Unknown Worlds' leadership team</a> - including studio founder and original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> director Charlie Cleveland - with Steve Papoutsis, CEO of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> studio Striking Distance. At the time, Krafton insisted it had "sought to keep the... co-founders and original creators of the Subnautica series involved in the game's development", despite their departure.</p>
<p>Fan pushback was swift, and the situation only grew murkier after Bloomberg reported Cleveland, as well as Unknown Worlds' chief executive officer Ted Gill and special projects director Max McGuire, had all been "pushed out" amid Krafton's sudden decision to shift Subnautica 2's early access launch from its announced "2025" window into 2026. It was also claimed the move - which Unknown Worlds' ousted leadership reportedly did not support - would mean the studio was unlikely to meet the revenue targets that would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-delayed-by-publisher-krafton-just-months-before-alleged-250m-payout-to-developers">unlock a promised $250m bonus for the development team</a>. Shortly thereafter, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-drama-escalates-ousted-developers-launch-legal-action-as-krafton-accuses-them-of-abandoning-project">Unknown Worlds' ousted leaders announced legal action against Krafton</a>.</p>
<p>"Krafton's decisions were made to ensure Subnautica 2 is the best possible game and lives up to fan expectations. Releasing the game prematurely with insufficient content, falling short of what fans expect in a sequel, would have both disappointed the players - who are at the heart of everything Krafton does - and damaged the reputations of both the Subnautica and Unknown Worlds brands," a Krafton spokesperson told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/krafton-responds-to-subnautica-founders-lawsuit-we-look-forward-to-defending-ourselves-in-court/">VGC</a>.</p>
<p>"While we are disappointed that Charlie, Max, and Ted have filed a lawsuit seeking a huge payout, we look forward to defending ourselves in court. In the meantime, Krafton remains focused on what matters: delivering the best possible game as quickly as possible to Subnautica’s fans."</p>
<p>All this comes after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-latest-subnautica-2-twist-krafton-confirms-this-leaked-internal-review-document-is-real">mysterious leak of an internal Krafton review document</a> last weekend, claiming Subnautica 2's planned early access release lacked "the freshness and volume expected of a sequel", and fell "short of meeting... high expectations". Almost immediately after, Krafton took the unusual step of announcing, unprompted, that the document was real, claiming that doing so would "minimise speculation and ensure accurate communication with players".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/kraftons-ready-to-take-on-subnauticas-creators-in-court]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ubisoft's own shareholders have directly challenged the publisher to respond to the huge swell of support behind Stop Killing Games – a consumer movement generated by Ubisoft's decision to take <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">The Crew offline last year</a>.</p>
<p>Stop Killing Games was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-aims-to-mount-political-and-legal-challenges-to-games-going-offline">launched last April by Accursed Farms YouTuber Ross Scott</a>, calling upon video game fans around the world to petition their local governments regarding the increasingly common occurrence of purchased games becoming unplayable due to publisher actions.</p>

<p>The games preservation movement was motivated by Ubisoft's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">shut down open-world racer The Crew's servers last March</a>, preventing access to both its multiplayer and single-player content due to its always-online nature. More controversy followed shortly after, when the publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown">began revoking customers' licenses to the game,</a> permanently removing it from their libraries and preventing hopes of resurrecting it through private servers.</p>
<p>"Regarding the petition, we operate in a market," Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said, as noted by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-ceo-ghost-recon-assassins-creed-shadows-valorant-annual-report">Game File</a> (paywalled) and spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/ubisoft-ceo-addresses-stop-killing-games-after-overseeing-the-deaths-of-the-crew-and-xdefiant-support-for-all-games-cannot-last-forever/">GamesRadar+</a>. "And, whenever we release a game, we provide a lot of support for that game. We also provide a lot of services to make sure that the game is accessible and remains playable 24/7."</p>
<p>Guillemot suggests the publisher already provides "information regarding the game and how long the game can be played", and pointed out it also adds an "online connection required" warning to the front of its boxed products as well as explain that the company can "cancel access to one or more specific online features upon a 30-day prior notice" in the fine print.</p>
<p>Guillemot also told shareholders it offered "a one-Euro fee proposed to all buyers of the game. For just one Euro they got to buy the next version." As Game File points out, this appears to be in reference to a sale last year that briefly sold <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-crew-2">The Crew 2</a> for $1/€1.</p>
<p>"This kind of issue is not specific to Ubisoft," Guillemot added. "All video game publishers are faced with that issue. You provide a service, but nothing is written in stone, and at some point, the service may be discontinued. Nothing is eternal. And we are doing our best to make sure that things go well for all players and buyers, because obviously, support for all games cannot last forever."</p>
<p>"The lifespan of a piece of software, whenever there's a service component, eventually services may be discontinued, because eventually the software may become obsolete over time," Guillemot concluded. "A lot of tools become obsolete 10 or 15 years down the line. They're no longer available. And that is why we release a new version. And so we have version two and then version three. But clearly this is a far-reaching issue, and we're working on it."</p>
<p>Gulliemot's response, however, feels a tad simplistic, as never-ending access to a game isn't what the Stop Killing Games movement is actually asking for.</p>
<p>"We are in favor of publishers ending support for a game whenever they choose," the FAQs <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/faq">explain</a>. "What we are asking for is that they implement an end-of-life plan to modify or patch the game so that it can run on customer systems with no further support from the company being necessary. We agree that it is unrealistic to expect companies to support games indefinitely and do not advocate for that in any way. Additionally, there are already real-world examples of publishers ending support for online-only games in a responsible way, such as: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gran-turismo-sport">Gran Turismo Sport</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/knockout-city">Knockout City</a>."</p>
<p>As Matt recently summarised for us, the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">consumer-driven initiative</a> is demanding games publishers leave their titles in a playable state once support is terminated, and it's already surpassed 1m signatures. Last week, EU industry body Video Games Europe - which represents the likes of Ubisoft, Take-Two, Warner Bros., Riot Games, Activision Blizzard, Microsoft, and Nintendo - weighed in, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-stop-killing-games-momentum-continues-top-eu-politician-offers-support-a-game-once-sold-belongs-to-the-customer">insisting the initiative's proposals would make games "prohibitively expensive to create".</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Stop Killing Games' <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074">official UK petition</a> has surpassed over 150K signatures, meaning it must now be considered for debate in parliament, despite the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/favourite-game-no-longer-playable-uk-government-says-it-wont-tighten-rules-to-punish-publishers-who-switch-off-servers">government's earlier response</a> that it had "no plans to amend UK consumer law on disabling video games".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-own-shareholders-demand-response-to-the-stop-killing-games-consumer-movement]]></content:encoded>
