            <p>
If you thought Hello Games might be slowing down as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> approaches its ninth birthday this year, think again. The studio is already back with another update for its ever-evolving exploratory space sim, and this one's an absolute whopper - expanding its virtual universe with "billions of new stars and planets", including fearsome gas giants.
</p>
<p>
Officially, today's release continues the work started in last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-borrows-some-of-light-no-fires-fancy-tech-for-a-planetary-overhaul-in-latest-update">Worlds Part 1 update</a> (its name, Worlds Part 2, kind of gives the game away), introducing a fresh batch of features and system overhauls contributing to an expansive universe refresh. That starts with Hello Games' new terrain generation system - borne from its work on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-studio-unveils-procedural-fantasy-planet-adventure-light-no-fire">upcoming Light No Fire</a>) - promising "more detailed" and "far more varied" landscapes. Players can expect huge mountains and dramatic vistas, with a range of new biomes bringing their own distinctive features.
</p>
<p>
Oceans, too, have had a substantial overhaul intended to make them more realistic. Large bodies of water can now be several kilometres deep, for instance, and benefit from improved lighting and new visual effects, with Hello Games highlighting its new caustics and light shafts, alongside oceans that become much darker the deeper players explore. And once down in the depths, there are apparently some extremely weird creatures to be found.

<p>
Hello Games also says No Man's Sky's completely rewritten lighting engine has led to more detailed shadows, light that flickers through leaves, and much darker and more ambient caves. Additionally, water can now reflect the skies and stars, and reacts physically to the world around it - surging as huge ships fly overhead or rippling gently in the rain.
</p><p>
And that's before we get to those aforementioned gas giants - massive spheres said to be ten times bigger than No Man's Sky's previous biggest planet. Players brave enough to venture down to their deeply unstable cores will face raging storms featuring new weather hazards - and can expect an experience Hello calls "truly end-game stuff". Additionally, today's update introduces a "huge" new quest tying together various story strands No Man's Sky has been building over the last nine years, alongside the likes of improved cooking, a new Colossus Refiner, and - for those with an insatiable urge to hoard ships - starship archiving.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, No Man's Sky is launching its next limited-time Expedition (titled Titan) in the coming weeks, giving players the chance to acquire a rare new living starship. First, however, Hello will be wrapping up the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-limited-time-expeditions-are-making-a-return-over-the-next-two-months">Redux version of last year's The Cursed expedition</a>, which is due to conclude next week. Full details of No Man's Sky's Worlds Part 2 update can be found in <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-ii-update">today's patch notes</a>, and there's also a <a href="https://youtu.be/2lG2DTjP-_M">deep dive developer video</a> to accompany the release.

"Against the odds, Bloober Team has delivered a remake that both expands the original game in just the right places, and gives careful attention to what it preserves," Vikki Blake wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Eurogamer's Silent Hill 2 Remake review</a>.

            <p>
MLB The Show 25 will skip its usual launch via Xbox Game Pass for the first time in years. 
</p>
<p>
The officially-licensed baseball game is notable for being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mlb-the-show-22-is-a-playstation-game-for-xbox-and-nintendo-switch-box">PlayStation's only franchise to launch on Xbox consoles and turn up day one on Game Pass</a>. This year's entry, however, will skip Microsoft's subscription service <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-owners-have-to-fork-out-full-price-for-the-sony-developed-mlb-the-show-21-but-xbox-owners-get-it-day-one-via-game-pass">for the first time since 2021</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"The game will not be on platform subscription services in 2025," a note from Sony on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/28/mlb-the-show-25-cover-athletes-revealed-paul-skenes-elly-de-la-cruz-and-gunnar-henderson/">PlayStation blog</a> states, ruling it out of appearing on PlayStation Plus either.
</p>
<p>
MLB The Show 25 is also notable for being the first in the series to ditch support for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. A Nintendo Switch version is still being released, however.
</p>
<p>
Sony has said it will reveal more about the game ahead of its launch on 18th March for all platforms. If you're really keen for this year's entry sooner, you can pay an unspecified amount extra for the game's Digital Deluxe Edition and start playing on 14th March instead.
</p>
<p>Despite regularly launching PlayStation games on PC, Sony's support of rival console platforms is still a rarity -  though last year did also see the arrival of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> on Nintendo Switch (but not Xbox Series X/S).</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer last year, Former PlayStation Studios boss Shawn Layden said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/there-comes-a-time-when-we-all-declare-the-war-is-over-former-playstation-studios-boss-shawn-layden-on-the-future-of-video-game-consoles">there would be a time "when we all declare the war is over" between console makers</a> - though he also didn't expect to see Sony first-party games arrive on Xbox any time soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Bungie has lifted the lid on a surprising new crossover for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>: cosmetics from the world of Star Wars. 
</p>
<p>
Stormtrooper, Praetorian Guard and Death Trooper outfits are on the way, alongside a Ghost shell themed around the Second Death Star. It even has a cute little green energy beam!
</p>
<p>
Additional Star Wars items will include a ship, emotes, finisher and Sparrow vehicle - which should be interesting, as Destiny's default Sparrows have always been closely inspired by Return of the Jedi's speeder bikes.
</p>
<p>
Destiny 2's Star Wars cosmetics will be available when the game's next update, Heresy, arrives next week on Tuesday 4th February.
</p>
<p>
Act 1 of Heresy sees players return to the Dreadnaught, setting of Destiny 1's brilliant The Taken King expansion, collect new weapons and gear, and undertake a new roguelike activity named The Nether (which is nothing to do with Minecraft).
</p>
<p>
Star Wars is the latest crossover to join Destiny 2, following previous collaborations with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-is-getting-a-ghostbusters-collaboration-next-week">Ghostbusters</a>, The Witcher, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.
</p>
<p>
With the conclusion of the Destiny franchise's major story saga last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-announces-major-changes-for-destiny-2-two-medium-expansions-coming-a-year">Bungie is now planning to launch two "medium-sized" paid expansions each year</a>, with the first due this summer, alongside free updates. 
</p>
<p>
The changes follow <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-bungie-latest-playstation-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">sweeping layoffs at the company</a> in 2024 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-bungie-latest-playstation-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">and 2023</a>, during which more than 320 jobs were lost, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-destiny-project-payback-no-longer-happening-senior-execs-depart">cancellation of a spin-off project titled Payback</a>.

            <p>
The developer of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-snap">Marvel Snap</a> has confirmed it has landed a new publishing partner in the wake of this month's outage that saw the game suddenly become unplayable in the US.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1884400415925817429?s=46">statement</a>, Second Dinner said it had "already signed agreements and started the work to bring almost all operational and publishing responsibilities in-house", with support from Skystone Games, a US-based indie games publisher.
</p>
<p>
Second Dinner had previously pledged to ditch its current publisher, Nuverse, in order to avoid any further disruption.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-snap-gets-surprise-us-suspension-as-stateside-tiktok-ban-takes-effect">Marvel Snap went offline in the US for over 24 hours</a> and was pulled from app stores in the country as a result of Nuverse's parent company being ByteDance - the Chinese owner of social meda app TikTok. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-in-talks-to-buy-tiktok-us-president-says">TikTok has officially been banned in the US</a> due to security concerns around how it handles user data, and similarly went offline for a brief period. For now, the ban has been paused while negotiations continue over an expected sale - with Microsoft reportedly one of the interested parties.
</p>
<p>
At the time of Marvel Snap's sudden outage, US users were greeted with a message apologising that the game "isn't available right now" as "a law banning Marvel Snap has been enacted in the US".
</p>
<p>
As players reacted in shock, the game's developers issued a statement which suggested they had been given no warning the downtime was set to occur.
</p>
<p>
"This outage is a surprise to us and wasn't planned. Marvel Snap isn't going anywhere," Second Dinner said in a defiant statement. "We're actively working on getting the game up as soon as possible."
</p>
<p>
After the game returned, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-snap-reveals-staggering-compensation-to-all-players-after-tiktok-ban-unexpectedly-took-it-offline">Second Dinner announced an enormous package of in-game rewards as an apology</a> to players, and pledged to find a new publisher "to make sure this never happens again".

            <p>
Hideaki Nishino has become Sony Interactive Entertainment's sole CEO, after a period of joint rule with PlayStation studios boss Herman Hulst. 
</p>
<p>
Sony's reshuffle also comes with a new boss for the overall company, with veteran exec and former CFO Hiroki Totoki now the company's overall CEO and president. 
</p>
<p>
Hulst, meanwhile, will remain the boss of PlayStation Studios - now reporting in to Nishino rather than running Sony's gaming arm alongside him.

<p>
Both men had shared leadership of PlayStation since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-is-retiring-in-march">last year's departure of former boss Jim Ryan</a>, with Nishino focused on the company's business side while Hulst focused on overseeing its game development studios.
</p>
<p>
Hulst will continue to look after "the development, publishing and business operations of SIE's first-party content" and further work with Sony Pictures to adapt key PlayStation franchises into films and TV series.
</p>
<p>
"I am truly honored to take the helm at Sony Interactive Entertainment," Nishino said in a statement. "Technology and creativity are two of our biggest strengths as we continue to focus on developing experiences that deliver entertainment for everyone. 
</p>
<p>
"We will continue to grow the PlayStation community in new ways, such as IP expansion, while also delivering the best in technology innovation.
</p>
<p>
"I want to thank Herman for his expertise and leadership as he continues his role as CEO, Studio Business Group," Nishino concluded. "I am deeply grateful for the PlayStation community and their continued support and I am very excited for what the future holds."
</p>
<p>
Sony has had mixed success over the past year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-console-sales-top-65m-as-astro-bot-sells-15m-copies-in-first-month">continued strong sales of PlayStation 5 hardware</a> but also the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reflects-on-concords-failed-launch-and-removal-after-two-weeks">high-profile failure of live-service shooter Concord</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">reported cancellation of other live-service projects</a>.
