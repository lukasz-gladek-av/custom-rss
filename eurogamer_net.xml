            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/avalanche-studios">Avalanche Studios</a> is the latest developer to be impacted by layoffs, as the company's UK studio is set to be closed as part of a workforce restructure that will impact its Swedish studios too.</p>
<p>The studio is known for the Just Cause series (not to be confused with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> developer Avalanche Software, owned by Warner Bros.) and was previously working on an Xbox exclusive called Contraband.</p>
<p>However, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-exclusive-contraband-reportedly-cancelled-as-avalanche-states-its-active-development-has-now-stopped">project was cancelled by Microsoft back in August</a>, with the studio writing in a statement: "Active development has now stopped while we evaluate the project's future."</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/studio-update">statement shared by the company</a> today, the decision to restructure has been made "in light of current challenges to our business and the industry".</p>
<p>It continued: "This review had led us to the difficult conclusion that we must make changes to our staffing and locations. As a result, we are proposing to close our Liverpool studio, and to initiate a collective consultation process, as required by UK law. This will impact all Avalanchers in Liverpool. The changes will also impact our other studio locations in Malmő and Stockholm, where we will reduce our workforce and restructure the teams to address our games' needs."</p>
<p>It concluded: "Despite these changes, we remain deeply committed to providing amazing games to our passionate player communities." The statement does not mention Contraband and its cancellation specifically.</p>
<p>Contraband, a co-op smuggling game, was revealed in June 2021 at the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase, but little of the game has been shown since. Its official trailer has been removed from the Avalanche website, though you can see IGN's video above.</p>
<p>Its cancellation arrived in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">wake of layoffs across Microsoft</a> in July, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">resulted in the cancellation of multiple projects</a> including The Initiative's Perfect Dark, Rare's Everwild, and an unannounced ZeniMax MMO.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-is-thriving-claims-ceo-doubling-down-on-ai-after-9000-employees-lost-jobs-in-latest-layoffs">Microsoft CEO and chairman Satya Nadella later claimed "Microsoft is thriving"</a>, largely due to its investments in AI.</p>
<p>Back in 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-100-avalanche-studios-developers-are-unionising">Avalanche Studios entered a collective bargaining agreement with Swedish unions</a>, which was planned to go into effect by the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p>"Over the past years, we've taken significant steps toward making Avalanche one of the best workplaces in the games industry," Avalanche CEO Stefanía Halldórsdóttir said at the time.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">$55bn private acquisition of EA</a> is expected to run smoothly, the Financial Times has reported, due to the influence of Jared Kushner and Saudi Arabia on The White House.</p>
<p>The acquisition announced yesterday will see a group of investors comprising Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, and investment firms Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, acquiring EA, the publisher known for its sports games, BioWare's RPGs, The Sims, and many more.</p>
<p>Though the acquisition won't be completed until Q1 FY27, a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f">report from The FT</a> suggests it won't face much opposition.</p>
<p>That's due to Saudi Arabia being considered a key ally to the US, as well as the involvement of President Trump's son-in-law Kushner, CEO of Affinity Partners.</p>
<p>"Kushner has a personal relationship and he has deep ties in Saudi Arabia. He is very comfortable operating in the Middle East. It created a basis of trust," a person briefed on the talks told the FT.</p>
<p>Another source stated: "We are in a regulatory environment that is welcoming of [Saudi Arabia]. We are not in what was the previous regime."</p>
<p>"What regulator is going to say no to the president's son-in-law?" stated another source close to the inner workings of the Trump administration.</p>
<p>The involvment of Saudi Arabia's PIF is controversial, due to the country's ruler Prince Mohammed bin Salman chairing the fund. He's been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">blamed by the CIA for the assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi</a>, and has upheld <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/">the country's notoriously poor human rights record</a>.</p>
<p>While the last big video game acquisition - Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard - was met with opposition, it seems this latest deal for EA will be less contested.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted the US Federal Trade Commission for comment on EA's private acquisition.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133">further report from the FT</a>, it's suggested the deal is a huge bet that AI can significantly cut EA's operating costs.</p>
<p>The $55bn buyout is backed by $36bn in equity and $20bn in JPMorgan debt, which EA will need to cover. AI will therefore be a key factor in cutting costs, according to sources involved in the transaction.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-is-the-very-core-of-our-business-says-ea-ceo">EA CEO Andrew Wilson stated AI is "the very core of our business"</a> at the company's Investor Day 2024. "For years we have talked about our games delivering experiences that are always new and different," he said. "We predict that with generative AI we will truly be able to fulfil this promise for billions of people for billions and billions of hours."</p>
<p>One area of AI innovation for the company is efficiency, which Wilson described as not just about cost saving but "doing what we do today faster, cheaper, and at a higher quality".</p>
<p>With the growing reputation of AI tools being used across the games industry, no doubt this presentation proved influential in the eventual acquisition by private investors.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ceo-of-ea-says-values-remain-unchanged-following-sale-saudi-investment-firms">statement to employees yesterday</a>, Wilson stated EA's "values and our commitment to players and fans around the world remain unchanged". However, the deal has sparked fear among fans for the future of EA's most queer-friendly franchises, including The Sims, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, due to the involvement of Saudi Arabia.</p>
