            <p>Ubisoft has responded to a damning report of mental and physical abuse at Indonesian support studio Brandoville.</p>
<p>The studio provided assistance to Ubisoft on the forthcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, though it closed in August last year, after which reports of abuse emerged.</p>
<p>"We are deeply disturbed by the recent reports surrounding Brandoville Studios," an Ubisoft spokesperson told Eurogamer. "We strongly condemn all forms of abuse, and our thoughts are with the affected employees."</p>

<p>Yesterday a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horrific-abuse-of-workers-at-indonesian-external-development-studio-revealed-in-new-report">report from People Make Games detailed allegations of abuse by Brandoville commissioner Kwan Cherry Lai</a>, who ran day-to-day operations of the studio.</p>
<p>Before its closure, the studio provided art and animation support for games like Assassin's Creed Shadows and Age of Empires 4.</p>
<p>However, reports allege from 2019 to the studio's closure in 2024, Lai abused multiple employees. This ranged from imposing a strict work schedule and daily Christian worship, to forcing an employee to write lines like a schoolchild, humiliating her in front of colleagues, and demanding a video of her slapping herself a hundred times as punishment.</p>
<p>Other abuse includes controlling the finances of employees and overworking a pregnant employee, whose prematurely born son sadly died after four months in intensive care.</p>
<p>You can watch the full report in the video above, though be aware it contains harrowing content and footage.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has also contacted Age of Empires publisher Microsoft, though a response is yet to be issued.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will launch next month, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-necessary-to-change-narrative-of-ubisofts-inconsistency-in-quality">delay in November</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Accurate models of Nintendo's under-wraps <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> have been shown off at the CES 2025 trade show in Las Vegas by accessories manufacturer Genki.
</p>
<p>
French website <a href="https://www.numerama.com/tech/1877968-la-nintendo-switch-2-se-devoile-en-avant-premiere-au-ces-2025.html">Numerama</a> went hands-on with one of these models and was told by Genki representatives that it was based on access to the actual Switch 2, which it expected to launch in April this year.
</p>
<p>
Incredibly, the report states that access to an actual Switch 2 unit via the black market is also now possible, "if you put up the money". 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo is still to announce Switch 2, but at this point it feels like there's little left to learn about how the next-generation handheld will look.
</p>
<p>
Still, these latest images - and video, below - of the Switch 2 dummy unit that Genki is showing off give us our best view yet of the hardware.

<p>
As we've seen in images of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/latest-switch-2-leaks-appear-legitimate-according-to-new-report">multiple previous</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-accessory-maker-pulls-trailer-showing-blurry-mockup-of-nintendos-next-console-design">Switch 2 accessories</a>, and as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">reported separately</a> prior to that, Switch 2 will be a slightly larger version of Nintendo's current hardware, with an additional "C" button on the right Joy-Con, magnetic attachments for the controllers, and an additional USB-C port on the device's top. 
</p>
<p>
Videos shown on Genki's stand, and also now on the company's website, show a highly-detailed look at the new Switch 2 Joy-Con - including its previously-rumoured optical sensor.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Nintendo for more.
</p>
<p>
Separately, yet another accessories manufacturer has begun advertising its own add-ons via Amazon in Japan. Images of a Switch 2 console cover from third-party company Laziro offer yet another look at what the handheld is expected to look like:

"Nintendo will not have much time in January, so a potential announcement early in the month could make sense,"  industry analyst <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-switch-2-design-leaks-nintendo-keen-to-announce-console-as-soon-as-possible-analyst">Serkan Toto told Eurogamer last month</a>. "You can bet that Nintendo is aware of all the leaks and not happy about them."
</p>
<p>Nintendo has itself revealed little about Switch 2. Officially, we only know for certain that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">the console will be announced before 31st March</a>, and that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">it will be backwards compatible with Switch 1 games</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has kicked off the new year by announcing a second open beta test.</p>
<p>This beta will include the content from the first beta - so Character Creation, Story Trial and the Slay Doshaguma Quest - as well as the chance to hunt down Gypceros, a returning monster for the series. If you took part in the first beta, you can transfer your character to the second beta. This data, Capcom said, can also be transferred to the full game on release, however it stressed the same isn't the case for any game progress made.</p>
<p>Those interested in giving the second open beta a go will be able to do so between 6th February, with things getting going from 7pm Pacific time - that's actually 3am on 7th February, for those of us in the UK. This wave of the beta will run until 9th February, culminating at 6.59pm Pacific (so, 2.59am on 10th February in the UK). Another beta weekend will take place the following weekend running between 13th February and 16th February. Timings remain the same.</p>
<p>The beta is available for those Monster Hunter Wilds' players on PC via Steam, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Those who take part will get some added bonuses in the full game, such as a decorative weapon charm.</p>
<p>"Please note that adjustments including performance, weapon changes, Hitstop, quality of life improvements and more will not be present or reflected in the second Open Beta Test build," Capcom added in a video announcing the beta, which you can see below.</p>

<p>The first Monster Hunter Wilds beta test took place towards the end of last year, and you may recall that while it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-numbers-are-well-wild">pulled in an impressive number of players</a>, it was a little rough around the edges. Many of those partaking shared screenshots of angular, almost Nintendo 64-looking graphics during the beta's run, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-has-graphical-problems-but-capcom-promises-final-game-in-a-better-state">creatures looking more akin to animated origami rather than the fully fledged monsters</a> they were meant to be.</p><p>However, Capcom has said it has listened to all of the feedback and requests that have come its way since that first beta, and are "working hard to improve the quality of the game for launch" (which is set for 28th February).</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is one of the Eurogamer team's most anticipated games of the year. Want to know our full list?

            <p>Physical game sales in the UK dropped by a massive 34.5 percent over the past year.</p>

<p>The news comes courtesy of the <a href="https://www.eraltd.org/streaming-and-vinyl-drive-music-to-twenty-year-high">Digital Entertainment and Retail Association</a> (ERA), based on data from Nielsen/GfK, India, and GSD.</p>
<p>Year-on-year, PC downloads dropped by five percent, digital console sales were down 15 percent, and physical games sales plummeted by 35 percent. Mobile and tablet gaming grew by 2.6 percent.</p>
<p>Perhaps one reason for this is the comparison with 2023, which saw huge physical sales of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>.</p>
<p>2024's biggest selling game in the UK was, unsurprisingly, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a>. It generated 2.9m sales, 80 percent of which were digital.</p>
<p>"After the breakneck growth of recent years, it is no surprise that the games market has slowed down, but it remains a giant," said ERA's CEO Kim Bayley. "Despite the attractions of digital business models to developers, we believe physical still has a role to play."</p>
<p>Despite year-on-year decline between 2023-2024, 2025 is predicted to bring growth to the industry, due to the expected release of Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> console and Rockstar's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>.</p>

        <p>"We will be working over the next few weeks to find all of our team new homes."</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Jar of Sparks, the Seattle-based "AAA" studio established by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> head of design Jerry Hook back in 2022, has halted work its currently unannounced first title as it searches for a new publishing partner, and that's it's looking to "find all of our team new homes" as a result.
</p>
<p>
When Jar of Sparks was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-design-jerry-hook-leading-new-netease-studio-jar-of-sparks">initially unveiled</a> in July 2022, it was described as a first-party developer for Chinese publisher NetEase that would focus on creating the "next generation of narrative-driven action games". Little has been heard from the studio since then, but Hook - who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinites-head-of-design-jerry-hook-leaves-343-industries">announced his departure</a> from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/343-industries">343 Industries</a> and Microsoft back in May 2002 - has now <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/jar-of-sparks/posts/">shared a statement on LinkedIn</a>, suggesting Jar of Sparks' future is uncertain.
</p>
<p>
"Earlier today," Hook wrote, "we notified our team that Jar of Sparks will be halting work on our current title as we search for a new publishing partner who can help bring our creative vision to life. Throughout this journey, our passionate, driven, and innovative team took bold risks and pushed boundaries, striving to create something truly new and exciting for the industry. We couldn’t be prouder of the groundwork we’ve laid together."
</p>
<p>
"As we prepare for this next step," Hook continued, "our talented team members will be exploring new opportunities... From the day we formed Jar of Sparks to this very moment, this team has accomplished remarkable feats—proving that a small, focused, and dedicated group can achieve great results. We thank each of them for their courage, skill, and friendship."
</p><p>
Jar of Sparks' announcement doesn't mention layoffs explicitly, but a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jerry-hook-1807781_earlier-today-we-notified-our-team-that-activity-7282186867880407040-fNNK">separate post from Hook</a> says the studio "will be working over the next few weeks to find all of our team new homes as we close our first project", suggesting the majority of staff will be departing following today's news. Eurogamer has reached out to Jar of Sparks for clarification, and to NetEase regarding its current relationship with the studio.
</p>
<p>
"Thank you to everyone who supported us throughout our journey here at Jar of Sparks," the statement concludes. "We look forward to updating you all with our next step in our journey."

            <p>
Curious to know what wild ideas Sony might be pondering for the future of gaming? Well, you're in luck: it's just unveiled new conceptual technology designed to ramp up immersion by sticking players inside a TV box and squirting smells into the room. So if you've ever wanted a whiff of Kratos after a hard day's slaying, your dreams are now one step closer to reality.
</p>
<p>
Not that Sony's Future Immersive Entertainment Concept (as it's officially known) is likely to be coming to living rooms anytime soon. As its name suggests, this is very much a CES 2025-focused proof-of-concept, showcasing just one possible future avenue for more immersive gaming, and not something even remotely close to production. It is, though, kind of neat, in a wildly gimmicky kind of way - taking some already existing ideas (all-encompassing displays, atmospherics whiffs, and so on) then reimagining them with cutting edge tech.
</p>
<p>
Essentially, Sony's Future Immersive Entertainment Concept is a giant cube of LED panels that completely surrounds the players inside. As they explore the game world - that of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s The Last of Us in the case of Sony's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jnhpsJe4bQ">new showcase trailer</a> - players are bombarded with  "audio, haptics, scent, and atmospherics" designed to draw them further into the experience.

Additionally, it's possible to wield physical tools that interact with the world on-screen, and we're shown a flashlight that only illuminates whatever it's being pointing at, as well as various weapons.
