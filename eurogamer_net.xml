            <p>Treyarch has shared more details on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> Season 1, including a look at its battle pass' rather unexpected new skins. These include a 'Raccoon Goon' skin for Niran, some kind of parasitic nightmare for Carver (see header image above) and a shark suit also for Carver, because why not.</p>
<p>The Call of Duty team has released a new system for its battle pass, which will now adopt a pages system to replace the sector map. In Treyarch's words, players should think of it all like a book.</p>

<p>"The first Page displays BlackCell Instant Rewards and the second Page shows premium Battle Pass Instant Rewards, followed by 100 in-game Battle Pass rewards across 14 Pages and a Completion Page that is instantly unlocked once all other Pages are completed," it explained, adding these pages include both free and paid content.</p>
<p>As for its content, which the developer noted is pretty ample, highlights include new weapon blueprints (there are 30 of them), those aforementioned operator skins, and some new equipment skins.</p>
<p>Players can get their hands on the premium battle pass for 1100 COD Points, or scoop up the 'Battle Pass Bundle' for 2400 COD Points, "including 20+ Tier Skips".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-boss-andrew-wilson-reportedly-tapped-for-disney-top-job<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
The boss of EA - publisher of EA Sports FC, Battlefield, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> and Dragon Age - is reportedly in the frame to replace Disney CEO Bob Iger. 
</p>
<p>
A new report by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/disney-explores-wider-field-of-candidates-to-succeed-iger-d1876792">The Wall Street Journal</a> states that EA CEO Andrew Wilson is among the top candidates currently being considered as a long-term replacement for Iger, who oversees all of Disney.
</p>
<p>
Iger is expected to leave Disney in 2026, after steering the company for more than 15 years. His tenure has seen the firm acquire Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and much of 21st Century Fox, launch Disney+ and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-acquires-15bn-stake-in-epic-games-making-games-and-entertainment-universe-in-fortnite">sign a $1.5bn deal with Fortnite maker Epic Games</a>.

<figcaption>Wilson formerly served as boss of the FIFA/EA Sports FC franchise.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBM2xyco_Kg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
The Australian-born Wilson has meanwhile served 24 years at EA to date and, while press conferences from the publisher are rarer these days, is the company's most prominent face. Wilson stepped up to become EA's CEO in 2013, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/john-riccitiello-out-as-ceo-of-ea">the resignation of the controversial John Riccitiello</a>.
</p><p>Wilson's time at EA includes years working as the boss of the FIFA franchise and then all of EA Sports, as the company raked in vast revenues from Ultimate Team and ultimately signed divorce papers with FIFA itself. Last year, Wilson re-organised EA into two distinct operations - EA Sports and everything else - dubbed EA Entertainment.</p>
<p>
Iger, meanwhile, who turns 74 in February, is currently on his second stint at Disney. His initial retirement in 2021 lasted just a year, before he returned due to the firing of his successor Bob Chapek.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted EA for comment. 
</p>
<p>So how is this year's FIFA - uh, EA Sports FC? "This is a new FC, with some genuine differences on- and off-pitch," Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc-25-review">Eurogamer's EA Sports FC 25 review</a>. "It's also the exact same FC it's always been."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Tequila Works, the Madrid-based company known for the likes of Gylt and Rime, has filed for insolvency.</p>
<p>As reported by Eurogamer's sister site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rime-developer-tequila-works-files-for-insolvency">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the company founders have also stepped down.</p>
<p>In a statement, newly appointed general manager TÃ©rence Mosca said he was "proud of what [the team] has accomplished together". However, due to "prolonged market conditions", the company had no other option but to file for insolvency.</p>

<p>"Since its founding in 2009, Tequila Works' game-development philosophy has always focused on 'creating things with gusto'," the statement read. "We are doing everything we can to provide support and guidance to our teams during this difficult time."</p>
<p>Last month, Tequila Works announced it had laid off a number of staff as part of a studio restructure. At this time, it also made the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rime-developer-tequila-works-lays-off-staff-as-part-of-studio-restructure">decision to cancel an unannounced game</a>.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> might be looming on the horizon, but it's not the only new place you'll be able to get your fix of creature-bopping action; Capcom and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>'s TiMI Studio Group have announced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> Outlanders, a new "fully featured" open-world survival game that's coming to mobile at some currently unspecified future point.
</p>
<p>
Monster Hunter Outlanders details are, unfortunately, extremely limited at present, but Tencent does say players will be able to partake in the series' "traditional hunting experience", crafting and building "individualised gear and tools" as they "explore and survive unique regions of an open-world map featuring natural environments, ecosystems and monsters."
</p>
<p>
There's also talk of "social features" and "regular world events and activities, creating immense opportunities for the community to have fun together". The assumption, of course - given TiMi's specialty and Outlanders' mobile focus - is the whole thing will be free-to-play, although that's not explicitly stated in Tencent's announcement.

<p>
Monster Hunter Outlanders doesn't have a release date yet, but when it does show up, it'll be available via Apple's App Store and Google Play. Tencent has also confirmed it plans to conduct "several play tests" ahead of its official launch, with more details set to be shared on social media and Outlanders' Discord server at a later date.
</p><p>
As for Capcom's next flagship monster hunting game, that'll be Monster Hunter Wilds, which launches for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam on 28th February. And if Wilds' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-numbers-are-well-wild">recent Steam open beta numbers</a> are anything to go by - and assuming Capcom can get those <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-has-graphical-problems-but-capcom-promises-final-game-in-a-better-state">lingering technical issues</a> fixed - the publisher could well have another big hit on its hands.
