It's update time for the PlayStation Portal, and Sony's latest release offers something markedly more exciting than usual: cloud streaming is coming to the handheld device if you're a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PlayStation Plus Premium</a> member, albeit initially as a beta.
</p>
<p>
Since its launch last year, the £200 PlayStation Portal - a PS5 peripheral rather than a standalone device - has enabled owners to stream games from their console to the smaller 1080p screen, with Sony pitching it as a way to share a living room TV or play PS5 games in another room of the house. Its uses were somewhat limited then, but Sony's latest update marks the great untethering, enabling PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers to play "select PS5 games" from the PS Plus Game Catalogue via the cloud, even without a PS5.
</p>
<p>
As per <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/">Sony's announcement post</a>, over 120 games will be supported during the beta, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ratchet-clank-rift-apart">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a>. Games can be streamed at up to 1080p/60fps (requiring a minimum internet connection of 13 Mbps) with major DualSense wireless controller features supported alongside cloud-based saves.

<p>
"Since Cloud Streaming (Beta) on PS Portal is still an experimental offering," Sony notes, "the features available during the beta period may change over time and may not reflect the final experience." Game Trials, the ability to stream games purchased on the PS Store, system features such as Party voice chat and game invites for select games, the Create button, 3D audio, and in-game commerce are all unavailable at these "beginning stages of publicly testing", for instance. Furthermore, players will initially only have access to PS5 games, with PS4 and PS3 games remaining unsupported for the time being. 
</p><p>
Once the beta is available, it can be accessed via an updated PS Portal by going to Quick Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Cloud Streaming (Beta), and then turning the toggle to 'on'. And if that all goes as planned, players should then see a new option on their PS Portal home screen enabling them to access games via cloud streaming. Alongside cloud streaming, Sony's latest PlayStation Portal update - which is available from today - introduces various "refinements in the audio experience", as <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/">detailed on the PlayStation Blog</a>.
</p>
<p>
Digital Foundry's Richard Leadbetter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-playstation-portal-review-impressive-hardware-but-is-remote-play-itself-good-enough">called the PlayStation Portal</a> an "interesting gadget" when it launched last year, despite the sense "Remote Play itself isn't as good as it should be." Richard also explicitly called out the lack of cloud streaming support on the device, so it'll be interesting to see Digital Foundry's response to Sony's latest news.

It'd be fair to say the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-trailer-gives-first-look-at-block-stars-jason-momoa-and-jack-black-in-action">live-action Minecraft movie's first trailer</a> didn't exactly arrive to rapturous applause. But now Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures are back for a second try, this time unleashing the deep Steve lore, tree punching, teleporting Ender Pearls, an unfortunate incident involving a chicken, and even an adorable square bee.
</p>
<p>
It all kicks off with some backstory for Jack Black's gloriously bejumpered Steve, detailing how he chiselled his way to a "wonderland where anything you can imagine is possible, as long as what you imagine can be built out of blocks". One brisk dance sequence later, and we're reintroduced to our cast of more recent newcomers to this strange world: Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison (played by Jason Momoa), Henry (Sebastian Eugene Hansen), Natalie (Emma Myers) and Dawn (Danielle Brooks). Sadly, there's still no sign of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-adds-jennifer-coolidge-to-its-star-studded-cast">Jennifer Coolidge</a>, which is where my primary interest in this whole endeavour lies, but I can wait.
</p>
<p>
But even without everybody's favourite yacht evacuator, it all looks like a harmless bit of enjoyable fluff, featuring Jack Black as his usual effervescent self, some energetic CGI (although the art style is still a little jarring), and - in this second trailer at least - enough Minecraft easter eggs to sate even the most militant eight-year-old fan. It even finds time for a bit of ye olde mild peril - complete with zombies and arrow-launching skeletons - when night falls at the end.

<p>
"Four misfits," explains the official blurb if you're looking for more context, "find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they'll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve."
</p><p>
"Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative... the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world." And if we can somehow ignore that second paragraph until it pops right out of existence, it doesn't actually sound that bad.
</p>
<p>
The Minecraft movie arrives in cinemas on 4th April next year, and there's also an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-animated-series-announced-for-netflix">animated Minecraft series on the way</a> from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>, if the whole live-action thing doesn't appeal.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> is cleared for takeoff, ready to give aircraft fanciers and digital globetrotters another jaunt across its beautiful world. But in a turn of events almost exactly mirroring the launch day woes seen by its 2020 predecessor, Flight Simulator 2024 is struggling to gt off the ground, with players complaining of lengthy post-install download times, installation freezes, and more as Microsoft's servers buckle under the demand.
</p>
<p>
Already, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537590/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_2024/">tarred with the Overwhelmingly Negative brush on Steam</a>, with players reporting a range of issues - all of which are eerily familiar to those seen back in 2020. Mostly, the finger is once again being pointed toward developer Asobo's insistence that players download the bulk of the game - equalling approximately 50GB - through the in-game interface, utilising Microsoft's servers instead of Steam's. That's traditionally been a languid pursuit at the best of times, but on launch day - when everyone is struggling to get in at once - it's proving even more glacial.
</p>
<p>
Some users are seeing their downloads stall at 97 percent, while others, having successfully cleared that first hurdle, then report being stuck in lengthy log-in queues. Additionally, Flight Simulator's reliance on streaming means plenty of people are having a miserable experience even if they do get in, with reported issues including sluggish world loading and even invisible planes. "I can only marvel at the depth of the simulation," wrote one Steam reviewer, "as it now feels like Boeing was actually involved in building the servers."

<p>
"I enjoyed the short movie about a man and a plane," added another frustrated user. "However, it seemed quite expensive for its length - around one minute. I would wait until the loading screen is on sale before purchase because it does get quite samey after the 70th loop." As for the Microsoft's Flight Simulator subreddit, it's currently awash in some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/1gv54xo/status_update/">top</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/1gv3nhh/server_loading_times/">class</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/1gv5ekg/msfs_2024_will_use_cloud_streaming_the_cloud/">memes</a>.
</p><p>
Over on Flight Simulator's support page, Microsoft has <a href="https://x.com/MSFS_Support/status/1858932444260421714">acknowledged the issues</a> players are experiencing. "We are aware of user reports of long initial loading times into Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024," it wrote. "With so many users initialising the sim concurrently, we have a large number of server requests. We are working to help resolve the issues as soon as possible."
</p>
<p>
"For users whose initial load is past 90 percent and no longer progressing, we recommend a reboot," it added, immediately eliciting a collective scream from everyone without a high-speed internet connection. "Otherwise we advise waiting to allow the loading to proceed as normal." The Xbox support page, meanwhile, <a href="https://x.com/XboxSupport/status/1858954069924065751">acknowledged</a> "slow download and install times", suggesting players keep an eye on its <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status">live status page</a> while it investigates.
</p>
<p>
Some Steam customers have also expressed concern that Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024's lengthy in-game install solution means downloads are eating into the platform's two-hour refund window. Back in 2020, Valve moved to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-users-want-microsoft-flight-simulator-refund-time-extended">assure customers only actual play time would be counted</a>, but it's not yet confirmed the same applies in 2024.
</p>
<p>
Developer Asobo has, of course, been talking a big game for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 ahead of launch, promising a frankly staggering list of activities, including aerial firefighting, search and rescue, helicopter cargo transport, crop dusting, skydive aviation, hot air balloon tours, and more. It's also teased "literally trillions of trees", even the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-will-let-you-climb-out-your-plane-walk-a-trail-and-watch-the-sunset">ability to get out your plane and walk a trail</a> - all of which sounds like it'll be marvellous, as long as Flight Simulator navigates its launch day turbulence on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and Game Pass, and sticks the landing.
