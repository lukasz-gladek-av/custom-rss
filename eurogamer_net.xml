            <p>The Minecraft Movie team has released another trailer for the upcoming film, which intends to whet appetites and put emphasis on the idea that creativity is key to survival. But, that's not what everyone is talking about.</p>
<p>Rather, it is our first look at the film's depiction of Minecraft's villagers that has caused quite the stir among, well, anyone who has had to look at them.</p>
<p>These chaps are rather unusual looking. "God has abandoned us," <a href="https://x.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1889776013724283175">one social media commentator said</a> under a screenshot of the Minecraft Movie villagers. Another added: "They look like square cousins of the dad from Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs."</p>

<p>You can see how the Minecraft Movie's villagers look for yourself in the trailer above.</p>
<p>And, just for posterity because it is one of those images I can't actually bring myself to look away from even though I do want to, here they are again in a screengrab from the trailer.</p>
<p>So,  what do you think?</p>

<p>"Four misfits," explains the official blurb if you're looking for more context on the upcoming film, "find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they'll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve.</p>
<p>"Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative... the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world."</p>
<p>The Minecraft Movie is set to release this April. It stars Jack Black as Steve (which right now appears to be Jack Black but in a blue T-shirt) and Jason Momoa as Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison.</p>
<p>Away from the big screen, an animated Minecraft series was also announced for Netflix back in May. Netflix will produce the project alongside Minecraft developer Mojang Studios, while WildBrain Studios - the studio behind Sonic Prime - will handle the development.</p>
<p>While further details are thin on the ground, it is said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-animated-series-announced-for-netflix">upcoming show will "feature an original story with new characters</a>, showing the world of 'Minecraft' in a new light".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has shut down the iOS version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-crystal-chronicles">Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles</a> due to an ongoing bug.</p>
<p>Players had reported they were unable to access additional content purchased for the iOS game, which the publisher has stated was due to changes made to the in-app purchases model.</p>
<p>"Further investigation revealed that we are unable to completely fix the bug and implement the new changes, making it unlikely to resume service for the game," a <a href="https://na.finalfantasy.com/news/2719">notice from Square Enix</a> reads. "Thus, we must regretfully announce that we will end support for the iOS version of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles."</p>

<p>Players who made in-app purchases in January 2024 or later will be able to request a refund via Apple Support.</p>
<p>The game is no longer available to download. Though free-to-play, it included in-app purchases for the full version of the game ($24.99) and individual DLCs.</p>
<p>Crystal Chronicles was first released for the GameCube in 2003, but sales suffered due to the need for a complex Game Boy Advance setup to fully enjoy. The game was then remastered for Switch, PS4, Android and iOS in 2020.</p>
<p>Square Enix has confirmed the other versions of the game remain unaffected.</p>
<p>The news follows other mobile games shut down by Square Enix in the past couple of years, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-final-fantasy-mobile-game-ends-global-service-this-time-the-one-with-ariana-grande">Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dissidia-final-fantasy-opera-omnia-will-shut-next-year">Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> battle royale <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-mobile-battle-royale-the-first-soldier-shuts-down-next-year">The First Soldier</a>.</p>
<p>These were all shut down due to declining player numbers. While Crystal Chronicles has suffered from this purchase bug, Square Enix clearly did not deem it worthy of fully fixing, perhaps due to similarly low player numbers.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-exceeded-square-enix-expectations-but-game-sales-drop-overall">latest financial report</a>, Square Enix revealed net sales of its mobile games had plummeted by over 32 percent, owing to the closure of these games.</p>
<p>However, profits from mobile games remain higher than its HD games (console and PC), and are further dwarfed by MMO profits.</p>
<p>That's a key reason the company is developing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-mobile-officially-revealed">mobile version of Final Fantasy 14</a>, though it's set to be free-to-play and won't include gacha mechanics.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
