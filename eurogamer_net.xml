            <p>September has another game to look forward to, with LEGO Voyagers being scheduled for release on 15th September. The game is coming to pretty much all major platforms, which means PS5, PS4, Xbox Series consoles, Switch, and PC (Steam and Epic Games Store).</p>
<p>The co-op adventure is in development at Light Brick Studio and will be published by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>About LEGO Voyagers</p>
<p>From the makers of LEGO Builder’s Journey comes a new two-player cooperative adventure about friendship and play. When two friends make it their mission to rescue an abandoned spaceship, they embark on a journey beyond their wildest dreams, ultimately learning the value of being connected.</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience what it feels like to be a LEGO brick. Tumble, jump, snap together, and build your way through rich brick worlds.</li>
<li>Unravel a poetic, non verbal narrative, set in beautiful brick built environments, supported by an atmospheric soundtrack.</li>
<li>Cooperatively solve the game’s many challenges and discover how two bricks are better than one. Play locally on the same screen, or online.</li>
<li>Invite a friend to join your adventure for free with the Friend’s Pass. As long as one of you owns LEGO Voyagers, you can both play the full co-op experience together.</li>
</ul></blockquote>

            <p>After delaying and then cancelling Football Manager 2025 due to ongoing issues getting the massively reworked game ready, SEGA and Sports Interactive have announced that Football Manager 2026 is coming.</p>
<p>Details on the game are sparse, with no new details beyond the fact that we know Sports Interactive planned for FM25 to be a huge evolution of the series which had seen more iterative changes and improvements over the years prior.</p>
<p>According to SEGA FM26 will "take players on a journey to define their footballing destiny with our most immersive and visually rich Football Manager experience yet. The potential for storytelling is redefined by taking players closer to the heart of the beautiful game."</p>
<p>The move to the Unity game engine should bring the 3D match engine up to modern standards. While the teaser released by Sports Interactive doesn't show an actual match in action, it does tease some in-engine visuals and points to the official Premier League licence.</p>
<p>You can watch that small teaser trailer below:</p>
