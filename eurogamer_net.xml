            <p>
With the season of giving now officially upon us, Jingle Jam has unveiled its latest PC charity bundle - this year featuring the stellar likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a>, Shadows of Doubt, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>, which can all be snapped up in support of a bunch of good causes.
</p>
<p>
In total, the Jingle Jam 2024 Games Collection feature 18 titles (all supplied as Steam codes), and there's a lot of good stuff to be found. For the most part we're in the realm of indies, although Sega and Two Point Studios' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-point-campus-review-university-was-never-this-fun">enormously enjoyable Two Point Campus</a> sneaks in too.
</p>
<p>
Also up for grabs are ColePowered Games' wildly ambitious procedurally generated detective noir Shadows of Doubt (which we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadows-of-doubt-review-an-unmatched-detective-similation-when-it-works">gave three stars</a> back in October), superb sci-fi narrative adventure Citizen Sleeper (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-review-a-gentle-cerebral-game-of-belonging-and-survival">Recommended</a>), survival city builder Frostpunk (also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frostpunk-review-a-thrilling-but-thin-frozen-city-building-game">Recommended</a>), and minimalist puzzler Patrick's Parabox (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/patricks-parabox-review-a-simple-minimalist-puzzler-with-recursive-depths">four stars</a>!).

<p>
But there's more: roguelike card battler Widlfrost is in there (this one <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/our-personal-top-five-games-of-2023">made Bertie's Games of 2023 list</a>), as is wonderfully engaging sci-fi construction sim Mars First Logistics, sticker store management game Sticky Business, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-crabs-treasure-feels-a-natural-evolution-for-an-underwater-soulslike">crustacean-themed Souls-like Another Crab's Treasure</a>, and the sequel to acclaimed 2018 tabletop-style RPG adventure, For the King 2.
</p><p>
Also included is the well-received blackjack roguelike adventure Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/scorn-review-beautifully-grotesque-puzzle-horror-that-doesnt-quite-congeal">Geiger-esque horror Scorn</a>, action-tower defense game Orcs Must Die 3, dystopian racer Death Sprint 66, dating sim action-RPG Eternights, card-battling rogue-like Hadean Tactics, hand-drawn puzzle adventure Submachine: Legacy, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fights-in-tight-spaces-review-a-strategical-secret-agent-beat-em-up-thats-almost-there">Fight in Tight Spaces</a> - a "stylish blend of deck-building, turn-based tactics, and thrilling animated fight sequences in classic action-movie settings". And if you prefer you lists in bullet point form:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers</li>
<li>Wildfrost</li>
<li>Two Point Camps</li>
<li>Shadows of Doubt</li>
<li>Patrick's Parabox</li>
<li>For the King 2</li>
<li>Citizen Sleeper</li>

<li>Scorn</li>
<li>Orcs Must Die! 3</li>
<li>Fights in Tight Spaces</li>
<li>Death Sprint 66</li>
<li>Eternights</li>
<li>Frostpunk</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Jingle Jam 2024 Games Collection is a bit of corker, then, and if you're sufficiently swayed, all the above can be acquired for a very reasonable donation of £35. Or rather, for a minimum donation of £35 - with more appreciated if you're able, seeing as organisers are hoping to raise as much money as possible for this year's eight selected charities.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, money accrued though Jingle Jam 2024's charity bundle will go to Autistica, Campaign Against Living Miserably, Cool Earth, Sarcoma UK, The Trevor Project, Wallace &amp; Gromit's Grand Appeal, Whale and Dolphin Conservation, and War Child. You can read more about each charity - and purchase this year's games bundle - over on the <a href="https://jinglejam.tiltify.com/">Jingle Jam website</a>. At the time of writing, it's successfully raised £1,277,979.

Activision has announced it'll be giving those few remaining Call of Duty fans who haven't already bought this year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> or played it through Game Pass the chance to get stuck in for free next week, as part of a seven-day trial.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Free Trial starts next Friday, 13th December, on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. It'll continue into the following week, wrapping up on Friday, 20th December.
</p>
<p>
Going by the <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1863976795113918904">infographic shared as part of Activision's announcement</a>, participating players can get stuck into Team Deathmatch, Hardpoint, Domination, Kill Confirmed, Kill Order, and Prop Hunt modes as part of the the Free Trial - with Black Ops 6's Racket, Hacienda, Extraction, Hideout, Heirloom, and Nuketown Holiday maps all included.

<p>
There's good news for anyone craving some undead slaughter too; Black Ops 6's Free Trial is set to offer a taste of Zombies mode, with Standard and Directed versions of Liberty Falls and Terminus all present according to that infographic. What's not clear, however, is if XP progress will be carried over to the full game, should players be sufficiently enthralled to make a purchase - but hopefully Activision will share more details before next Friday comes around.

Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell was, admittedly, lukewarm on Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">reviewed it in October</a>. "I had an alright time, and then left it much earlier than expected," he wrote, "with few real reasons to come back". Hence his three star score.
</p><p>
Still, Microsoft seemed pleased with the commercial response to the Black Ops 6's launch. The company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-records-for-game-pass-subscriber-adds-on-launch-day-says-microsoft">called its arrival</a> the "biggest Call of Duty release ever", saying it had set a record for "Game Pass subscriber adds on launch day."

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/friday-the-13th-the-game">Friday the 13th: The Game</a> and Predator: Hunting Grounds developer IllFonic has announced an unspecified number of layoffs, as it 'realigns to a refined strategy'.
</p>
<p>
IllFonic CEO and co-founder Charles Brungardt confirmed the job cuts in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/illfonic_an-update-from-illfonic-activity-7270138603437989888-6BkN">statement posted to social media</a>. "Today," he wrote, "we had to accept the harsh reality that the state of the industry has impacted us here at IllFonic... It is with the heaviest of hearts that cuts to our teams had to be made today as we realigned to a refined strategy."
</p>
<p>
"There is a lot of talent in the group," Brungardt continued, "and if you or your team is hiring, please reach out so people can be connected to open roles."

<p>
IllFonic - which has studios in Golden, Colorado and Tacoma, Washington - is perhaps best known for its asymmetrical multiplayer horror Friday the 13th: The Game, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/friday-the-13th-the-game-dev-bestows-max-power-on-all-players-ahead-of-shutdown">pulled from sale last December</a> after the company's license rights expired.
</p>
<p>
The developer has since attempted to replicate the formula with this year's Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game, but its Steam concurrents have <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1556100/charts/#6m">plummeted from the hundreds to double digits</a> in recent months, suggesting it's struggled to resonate with players.
</p><p>
IllFonic hasn't revealed the number of employees affected by today's layoffs, but the news continues a devastating 2024 for the games industry. Around <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">14,000 workers</a> are believed to have lost their jobs since the start of the year, in addition to the 10,500 laid off in 2023. So why's this happening? GamesIndustry.biz's Chris Dring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">shared his thoughts</a> earlier this year.
