            <p>FromSoftware has released a sweet spread of new statistics for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> ahead of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-will-see-an-iconic-dark-souls-boss-return">the Forsaken Hollows DLC later this week</a>. It's revealed many an interesting tidbit, including a reminder Souls fans still love a certain Dark Souls 1 character.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/more-numbers-the-night-the-latest-stats-elden-ring-nightreign">The full blog post</a> starts by breaking down the player split between each Deep of Night depth, a selection of five tiers increasing the difficulty of the game significantly as you progress through them. It turns out the largest chunk have reached depth one, with 37 percent of Nightreign players still lurking around in the shallow side of the pool.</p>
<p>33 percent of players have reached depth two, depth three is the bar for a respectable 20 percent, depth four is the limit of seven percent, and finally depth five has been achieved by three percent of players. An intriguing spread of skill in a generally tough game!</p>

<p>Then you've got the favourite skins across each Nightfarer. Surprising no one, the Artorias skin is the most popular for Wylder. However, what might shock you is Solaire isn't the most popular skin for Guardian! Kids aren't praising the sun like they used to, it seems. Alternatively, it could just be due to the slight goofiness to the Solaire skin, whereas Wylder's Artorias skin looks exceptionally cool. Wylder's Artorias skin is also the most popular skin overall, used roughly 18m times in total.</p><p>FromSoftware also provided the top ten most used emotes, which reveals Golden Order Totality reigns supreme. As a T-Pose, its popularity is little surprise. Next up comes Spread Out, a handy way of expressing your exhaustion after a tough battle, and third place goes to Bravo as the go-to congratulatory round of applause.</p>
<p>Which of the field bosses are the most deadly? You may not believe this, but it isn't the Bell Bearing Hunter! He came in fourth, while Royal Carrion Knight took the first place podium. Just dodge the magic gang, c'mon. Second place goes to Draconic Tree Sentinel, where as Erdtree Avatar takes third. Now <em>that</em> is shocking. As a caveat, it should be noted that players do also opt to avoid some bosses they find out in the field. Who knows, maybe Bell Bearing Hunter is so scary people don't even try.</p>
<p>To conclude, a nice fact: There have been over 1.2 billion players rescued so far in Elden Ring: Nightreign. People sure do love helping each other out it seems!</p>
<p>If you've not checked out Elden Ring: Nightreign yet and think now's a good time to do so, give <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Eurogamer's Elden Ring: Nightreign review a read</a>! In it, reviewer Ed Nightingale wrote: "FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off is an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour."</p>
