            <p>Nintendo is gearing up to release some new content for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>.</p>
<p>Age of Imprisonment is set before the events of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, and is the latest crossover with Koei Tecmo's Warriors franchise. It is a frenzied affair, but one that I have had a lot of fun thrashing and crashing my way through over these past few weeks.</p>

<p>And, it looks like I will be heading back to the moblin-filled lands of Hyrule again, when Nintendo's free update goes live on 27th November. That's this Thursday.</p>
<p>This forthcoming update will add additional weapons, as well as new Vicious enemies and "more" to the game, <a href="https://x.com/NintendoEurope/status/1993318901262823923">Nintendo wrote on its social media channels</a>. According to the Japanese site, when this update goes live, Zelda and Calamo (a personal favourite of mine) will have their own Sync Strike. This will see the series' princess chase after Calamo's Boomerang. "If you can press [X] at the right time, you will succeed in catching the boomerang and your attack will be powerful," the <a href="https://www.gamecity.ne.jp/zelda-fuuin/jp/update/">machine translated page reads</a>.</p><p>This update will be the first of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-only-came-out-this-week-but-already-two-free-updates-are-planned-for-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">two previously confirmed updates headed for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. Earlier this month, the official Zelda Musou social media account revealed these updates were in the works, and would allow fans to "enjoy Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment for even longer".</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-impressions-review-story-gameplay">Alex took Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment out for a spin</a> ahead of its release, calling it the series' "richest offering yet".</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Nintendo news, we got our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-think-these-set-photos-are-telling-us-a-lot-more-about-the-legend-of-zelda-movie-than-nintendo-is-letting-on-analysis">first look at official photos from The Legend of Zelda live-action film earlier this month</a>. These images showed Bo Bragason as the titular Princess Zelda, complete with bow and arrow, and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link.</p>

            <p>Katsura Hashino, director of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> and the Persona games at Atlus, wants to create "JRPG 3.0" as the next evolutionary step of the genre.</p>
<p>Hashino spoke at Korean gaming conference G-Star 2025 earlier this month, which was reported by <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/714/G071477/20251114074/">4gamer</a> (and translated by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/persona-and-metaphor-refantazio-creator-says-he-wants-to-create-jrpg-3-0-fundamentally-changing-the-genres-structure-and-presentation/">Games Radar</a>). He separated JRPGs into three eras: 1.0 being those of the past, 2.0 being those of the present generation, and 3.0 being those of the future.</p>
<p>JRPG 1.0, said Hashino, are the "true classics", and while he didn't name any specific examples, the likes of the original Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest games are likely implied. Then, the genre evolved into 2.0 with "its current style, which feels higher quality due to how much more responsive they are to the player."</p>

<p>As for JRPG 3.0, Hashino didn't provide any explicit details, but said he believes "there will be a greater dimension to these games and they'll change the genre's structure and presentation at a fundamental level".</p>
<p>It begs the question: what does this mean for Persona 6?</p>
<p>Atlus has been recently looking more to the past for inspiration. Last year, the studio released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-3">Persona 3</a>: Reload, a remake of the series' popular third entry, while a remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-4">Persona 4</a> is currently in development.</p>
<p>Then there's Metaphor: ReFantazio. Yes, it was the start of a brand new franchise for Atlus, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atlus-persona-follow-up-metaphor-refantazio-gets-release-date">Hashino described it as a "culmination of our RPGs"</a> marking the 35th anniversary of the company. It fits firmly into Hashino's "JRPG 2.0" definition, with its narrative structure and turn-based combat perfecting what Atlus had achieved with its previous games.</p><p>That's not to say the company hasn't experimented. 2016's Persona 5 proved so popular it spawned multiple spin-offs, namely Persona 5: Strikers and Persona 5: Tactica, both of which had different battle systems. There's also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-the-phantom-x">Persona 5: The Phantom X</a>, which brought the series to mobile.</p>
<p>Still, it's unclear how Persona 6 will evolve the series' formula. Very little is known about the game, though it's been officially mentioned by Atlus on a couple of occasions. In a job listing interview in 2021, Atlus director Naoto Hiroaka stated the studio will "have to create a 6 which exceeds 5. However, exceeding 5 will be difficult with the current staff" (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/persona-6-confirmed-by-atlus-director-in-job-listing/">Games Radar</a>).</p>
<p>More recently, Persona 6 was included in a fan survey on the future of the series back in October, the first time it's been officially mentioned by name (thanks <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/atlus-mentioned-persona-6-1-and-2-remakes/">The Gamer</a>). Let's hope that's a sign news is coming.</p>
<p>And while Persona 3: Reload introduced improved elements taken from Persona 5 (and presumably, the Persona 4 remake will do the same), I'm personally hopeful Persona 6 may go further and step away from formulaic conventions like The Velvet Room and stereotypical characters.</p><p>What's particularly interesting for the genre is the success this year of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, which follows typical genre conventions of Japanese RPGs but was made by a French studio. It's been widely praised for its turn-based combat, which includes action prompts - expanding on elements of Super Mario RPG, Lost Odyssey, and Legend of Dragoon.</p>
<p>Creator Guillaume Broche had intended to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-fresh-take-on-rpg-traditions-could-revitalise-the-genre">create a "big realistic" AAA turn-based game</a>, which arguably hadn't been seen since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-the-last-game-that-made-me-cry-clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-on-the-iconic-xbox-360-rpg-lost-odyssey-and-its-unexpected-legacy">Xbox 360 exclusive Lost Odyssey</a>.</p>
<p>"It was very overwhelming," Broche told Eurogamer on the attention the game has received. "I was expecting turn-based fans to stand up and say 'oh this looks cool', but I wasn't expecting this community to be that excited actually. It's like we awakened a sleeping dragon."</p>
<p>At the very least, Expedition 33 has heightened interest in turn-based Japanese RPG-style games. No matter how Atlus evolves the genre with Persona 6, the future of JRPGs is looking bright.</p>
