            <p>Bandai Namco's shuttered MMORPG Blue Protocol project has been extended a new lifeline courtesy of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>-funded developer Bokura.</p>
<p>At the end of August, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namco-and-amazon-games-published-mmorpg-blue-protocol-has-worldwide-release-cancelled">Bandai Namco announced plans to shut down the servers of its anime MMORPG Blue Protocol</a> in Japan and cancelled its release in the West altogether, saying "it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you".</p>

<p>Now, however, Blue Protocol has been reincarnated as Star Resonance, with some of its original development team joining the new one at Bokura. Although set in the same world as Blue Protocol, Regnas, the team said Star Resonance players can expect a reworked gameplay and storyline.</p>
<p>And it seems Bokura has hit the ground running, too. A <a href="https://bpm.bkrgame.com/web202412/news-detail.html?newsid=18543902">closed beta test</a> is already planned for players on Android devices and PC, although sadly, that's only open to Chinese players for now.</p>
<p>As yet, there's no firm release date either in China, Japan, or beyond. Blue Protocol's servers are due to go dark on 18th January 2025 (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/bandai-namcos-unsuccessful-mmorpg-blue-protocol-to-be-reincarnated-as-star-resonance-by-chinese-studio/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>Ed went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blue-protocol-is-amazons-next-punt-on-east-meets-west">hands-on with Blue Protocol last year</a>, which was set to follow the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lost-ark">Lost Ark</a> and New World as Amazon Games' next big MMO. However, he had concerns of whether the game could differentiate itself from its key competitors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
A year has now passed since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-the-things-we-noticed-in-the-gta-6-trailer-you-may-have-missed">Rockstar's record-breaking first Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer</a> landed, and there's been no real news on the game since.
</p>
<p>
While some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-fans-think-rockstars-hidden-yet-another-clue-in-the-moon">fans look to GTA 6's moon for word on when we'll hear more</a>, others are taking matters into their own hands - by going back to last December's trailer and using it to build bits of the game for themselves. 
</p>
<p>
There are several shots in the video below by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FyfT3zs3mQ">Dark Space</a> that, at a glance, could be mistaken for the real thing. The video shows a street from Vice Beach and some of the  downtown Stockyard area recreated using custom assets and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> engine.

Later, Dark Space mocks up a rumoured cutscene, where players will apparently hook a chain to a safe to rip it out of a pawn shop using a truck. As they say, it'll be interesting to see how close to the final game all of this looks - whenever the time comes.
</p><p>
There's also a section where we see the estimated size of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>'s map from above, as a plane flies over both it and the GTA 5 map at the same speed. The inferrance here is that GTA 6's map will be bigger than its predecessor's - though this was to be expected, and exact measurements are likely best saved for the final game.

Rockstar publisher Take-Two has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-doubles-down-on-gta-6-release-date-after-delay-rumours">GTA 6 set to launch in late 2025</a>. Next year is a big one for the company, with Borderlands 4 and Mafia: The Old Country both also set to arrive between April 2025 and the end of March 2026.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-reveal-trailer-brilliantly-recreated-in-real-life">GTA 6 reveal trailer has been recreated</a>. Earlier this year, fans remade the video using real-life footage and actors.
</p>
<p>Speaking of actors, our Christian Donlan recently took a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-hamlet-is-a-luminous-documentary-about-staging-shakespeare-inside-gta-online-that-brings-fresh-nuance-to-the-game-and-bard-alike">Grand Theft Hamlet, a luminous documentary about staging Shakespeare inside GTA Online</a> that brings fresh nuance to the game and bard alike.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has released a new job trailer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> Mobile, showing its touchscreen battles for the first time.</p>
<p>The UI for Final Fantasy 14 - as with many MMORPGs - is particularly complex, with each job (or class) having multiple abilities mapped out on a player's hotbar. With the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-mobile-officially-revealed">announcement of Final Fantasy 14 Mobile</a>, many players wondered how this would transition to a mobile touchscreen.</p>
<p>Well now we know. The trailer - <a href="https://weibo.com/tv/show/1034:5108677439324201">shared on Chinese social media site Weibo</a> - includes battle animations for all of the nine starting jobs, with their various job actions located in the bottom right of the screen around a large central primary attack used for continuous combos.</p>

<p>Players can then cycle through abilities, with cooldowns clearly displayed, while health and MP are located at the bottom of the screen as always.</p>
<p>It's tidy but, personally, looks far too small. When some jobs have up to 11 abilities to choose from, those ability icons look impossible to accurately select, while the fonts are tiny.</p>
<p>The trailer also does not include any character movement during battle, perhaps suggesting a simplified battle system without positionals (attacks where position around an enemy is vital for dealing damage). This also means there's no dodging of AoE attacks in this trailer, though perhaps that's indicative of a lazy player relying too much on their healer (we all know this from bitter experience).</p><p>Speaking of healing, the Scholar and White Mage jobs are the only characters in the trailer to switch targets (all others face a single enemy). It's still unclear how switching between friend and foe will work, though appears to be a quick direct tap of the screen - something else that could get fiddly in the heat of battle.</p>
<p>Still, it's impressive to see running and appears faithful to the original experience. Fans appear particularly impressed by the Monk and Summoner animations.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 14 Mobile will be free-to-play without gacha, and will follow the base game A Realm Reborn.</p> <div>
