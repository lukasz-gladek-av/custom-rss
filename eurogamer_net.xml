            <p>The first update for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-developers-super-thrilled-its-headed-to-playstation">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is here, available across PC and Xbox.</p>
<p>Along with a variety of fixes, this update has notably added full ray tracing (with path tracing) for Nvidia GPUs on PC. The Indy team said you will need to have a minimum of 12GB VRAM to get the most out of this feature, however.</p>

<p>Other PC-specific fixes include improved performance on larger game levels for those players using an 8GB VRAM video-card, and a fix for torch or lighter flames flickering when playing the game at a high refresh rate.</p>
<p>More generally, across platforms, photos that Indy takes when out and about should now appear more quickly when inspecting them from the journal. On the UI side of things, the Adventure Book list will now get updated immediately after unlocking a new book.</p><p>There are also a fair smattering of mission fixes, however I won't go into specifics here to avoid spoilers.

<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is available now for PC and Xbox. It will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">coming to PlayStation 5 in the spring of next year</a>.</p>
<p>We awarded Indiana Jones and the Great Circle five stars on its release. "Indiana Jones really feels like he comes full circle (sorry) in this latest adventure. At long last, there's an Indy game that nails both the puzzles and the kind of action we know so well from the films, and it does so with wit, charm and a real eye for spectacle," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Eurogamer's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Well shatter my Infinity Stones. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/free-to-play-hero-shooter-marvel-rivals-off-to-heroic-start-on-steam">Marvel Rivals' supercharged start</a> has now seen an astonishing 10 million players assemble over the game's opening weekend. 
</p>
<p>
A free-to-play six-on-six team shooter from Chinese giant NetEase, Marvel Rivals launched last Friday for PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, on PlayStation 5 and on Xbox Series X/S. 
</p>
<p>
As of midnight last night, NetEase <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1865909229070016851">announced</a> that 10 million players had joined in across the game's various platforms. Excelsior!

Marvel Rivals' roster of current and upcoming characters includes Marvel Cinematic Universe stalwarts such as Iron Man, Hulk, Scarlet Witch, Black Widow, Wolverine and Groot, along with other fan favourites such as Iron Fist, Cloak and Dagger and, of course, Squirrel Girl. (Seriously, when is she getting her MCU debut?)

As for how it plays, well, Marvel Rivals has been compared to Blizzard's hero shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Indeed, over the weekend, Blizzard's former boss - the ever-chatty Mike Ybarra - suggested Marvel Rivals was as much of an Overwatch copycat as the widely-discussed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencents-horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-also-coming-to-ps5-of-all-platforms">Horizon Zero Dawn clone Light of Motiram</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-blizzard-boss-blasts-marvel-rivals-similarity-to-overwatch">Ybarra also seemed to suggest Marvel Rivals had copied Overwatch's character of Widowmaker</a> for Black Widow. The character - played by Scarlett Johansson in the MCU - was created by Marvel legend Stan Lee in 1964.

            <p>Indie game platform itch.io has been taken offline after Funko allegedly logged a "bogus phishing report" to the website's registrar.</p>
<p>In a brief message posted this morning to Bluesky, the itch.io team said that Funko used "trash" AI-powered brand protection system Brand Shield and despite responding to challenge the phishing report, the site's domain has instead been disabled.</p>
