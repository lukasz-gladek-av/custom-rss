Hello, person of exceptional musical taste; as you'll already be aware, assuming  you read the headline first and didn't just fall headfirst into this story by accident, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>'s sublime soundtrack is now officially available across all major music streaming platforms, meaning you'll be able cavort along to Divine Beat Dancing Lion's  boss battle music (costume not mandatory) until your extremities start to bleed.
</p>
<p>
Bandai Namco's newly released digital Shadow of the Erdtree OST totals 36 tracks (compared to the 67 tracks found in the base game), and features contributions from long-time From Software collaborators Tsukasa Saitoh, Shoi Miyazawa, Yuka Kitamura, Yoshimi Kudo, as Tai Tomisawa, alongside series newcomer Soma Tanizaki.
</p>
<p>
And as you'll already know, being a person of exceptional musical taste, Shadow of the Erdtree's soundtrack is a <em>treat</em>, featuring some of the best tunes in the entire game. Who can forget the hip-swishing fury of Divine Beast Dancing Lion, for instance, or the thrilling majesty of The Twin Moon Knight, or the sorrowful dignity of The Putresecent Knight? Or how about the cosmic splendour of The Mother of Fingers, the mournful Shaman Village, or even the bowel-loosening terror of the Abyssal Wood? Oh, and the absolutely gorgeous St. Trina's theme, which is fab for all sorts of reasons, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNBpg8Apvvs">especially this</a>.

<p>
It's cracking stuff, and the whole thing is now officially available - in most cases to either stream via subscription or buy - on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6ucsCXHRL0OXnAM51V8Cb9?go=1">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_m7ysHzZR8PaDYTXIy6Kk0pOhosGM3Dh8U&amp;src">YouTube Music</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0DM7FNLVJ">Amazon Music</a>, Deezer, Line Music, AWA, Mora, and Recochoku. Full links can be <a href="https://lnk.to/6fGbIkfK">found here</a>. For whatever reason, Shadow of the Erdtree's complete soundtrack is not currently featured on Apple Music or iTunes, but there <em>is</em> a <a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/album/shadow-of-the-erdtree/1760572104">truncated variant</a> knocking around on Apple's service.
</p><p>
Sadly, there's no new behind-the-scenes video to accompany this latest soundtrack release, but we can at least still enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIKUzL1cLpA">this performance of The Twin Moon Knight</a> shared a couple of months ago - you know, just to temporarily satisfy those ears of exceptional taste.

            <p>
Infinity Nikki, the hotly-anticipated "cosy" open-world adventure from the designer of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, now has a release date.
</p>
<p>
Android, iPhone, PC and PlayStation 5 versions of Infinity Nikki all arrive on 5th December, Singaporean developer Infold Games confirmed today, allowing players to dress up, explore and befriend cute pets in an ever-expanding open world.
</p>
<p>
Infinity Nikki is the most ambitious project yet for the Nikki series, which has to date enjoyed enormous popularity in China.

This latest entry boasts involvement from Nintendo veteran Kentaro Tominaga, who worked for 20 years at the Mario maker and served as game designer on Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 
</p>
<p>
Infold's hopes for this new entry are clearly high, with a worldwide marketing push and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinity-nikki-tops-30m-registrations-and-its-not-even-out-yet">30m registrations for Infinity Nikki</a> already under its brightly-coloured belt. And yes, that is Jessie J singing the song for the game's trailer, above.
</p>
<p>
Infinity Nikki's smartphone predecessor Shining Nikki was downloaded 100m times, though was the subject of a cultural spat in South Korea over traditional costumes - leading to the game's Korean version being pulled, and criticism of the developer's handling of the issue.
</p><p>
At Nintendo, Tominaga served as assistant director on GameCube classics such as Zelda: The Wind Waker, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-twilight-princess">Twilight Princess</a> and Mario Kart: Double Dash. More recently, he worked on Zelda: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-link-between-worlds">A Link Between Worlds</a> and received a special thanks credit in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.

            <p>
There's a lot to love about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, but one of its most impressive and remarked-upon technical aspects is undoubtedly its advanced rendering of characters' hair. 
</p>
<p>
Hairstyles move and sway naturally as you and your party walk, while long hair streams out behind as you run. Your whole hairdo reacts if you are impacted by a sudden force or object.
</p>
<p>
There are up to 50,000 strands of hair on each of Dragon Age: The Veilguard's main characters, powered by something BioWare and EA's Frostbite engine team call Strand Hair technology. It's something originally worked upon for EA Sports FC, but which has been expanded upon greatly here.

<figcaption>Here's a video version of our Dragon Age: The Veilguard review.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f0BX-JXzek" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
"While Strand Hair is present in other EA games, the BioWare team had to push the limits even further for Dragon Age: The Veilguard," EA writes in a new deep-dive <a href="https://www.ea.com/technology/news/strand-hair-dragon-age-the-veilguard">blog post</a> on Stand Hair. "For example, implementing Strand Hair technology for characters who have waist-length hair with horns on their head presented some unique challenges.
</p><p>
"With hair attachments that move seamlessly, and the decoupling of simulation and render tessellation, this is the first EA game to offer such detailed physics-driven long hairstyles. The Frostbite team increased maximum hair length from 63 points to 255, and implemented a new system for complex hair structures like braids."
</p>
<p>
Tomb Raider's TressFX eat your heart out.
</p>
<p>
There's some detailed technical notes on how it all works, though perhaps the most interesting bit here is how BioWare had to overcome difficulties dealing with the wealth of other semi-transparent objects on screen. In EA Sports FC, this hadn't been much of an issue. Here, in scenes frequently enveloped in fog, smog or fire, it was. 
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, BioWare developed a system where each hairdo is rendered multiple times, with opaque and transparent layers rendered and then blended on the fly.
</p>
<p>
"We first render the opaque part of strand hair, and then we render transparent objects," BioWare's senior rendering engineer James Power noted. "The shaders for the transparent objects use the transparent hair depth texture to determine whether the shading pixel is 'under' or 'on top' of the strand hair. If it's below, it renders the hair and marks a stencil bit (think of it as a masking texture)."
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
There's discussion here too of how Strand Hair's "high memory footprint" is handled without degrading the performance. Dragon Age The Veilguard was never going to have a full squad of 22 characters on-screen all with Strand Hair at once, as is the case in EA Sports FC. But the added complexity of longer hair and more technical environments mean BioWare needed ways to adjust memory usage when multiple characters are shown.
</p>
<p>
For lower quality settings on PC, as well as Xbox Series S, the ability to ditch Strand Hair for more standard hairdo assets is also supported.
