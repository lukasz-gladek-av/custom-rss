            <p>
Almost exactly eight years since Blizzard <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-isnt-planning-to-remaster-warcraft-1-and-2">said</a> it wasn't planning to remaster Warcraft 1 &amp; 2 because they're "just not that fun any more", the studio has announced it's doing just that - and both spruce-ups are available today as part of Warcraft's 30th anniversary celebrations.
</p>
<p>
The original Warcraft helped catapult Blizzard into the big leagues when it launched back in 1994, with Warcraft 2 quickly emerging to sate its growing fanbase the following year. And the studio's newly announced remasters promise a range of enhancements to the games' classic real-time strategy action, starting with new hand-drawn visuals - said to capture the originals' art style - which can be toggled on and off in real-time.
</p>
<p>
As for Warcraft 1 specifically, Blizzard has added "modern controls", including right-click move, bounding box select, and a faster game speed. That's on top of the UI and UX improvements - including tool tips, health bars, mission select screens, and increased unit select - that've been implemented across both titles. Additionally, Warcraft 2 Remastered retains the original's multiplayer, and all legacy custom maps are fully compatible and playable in the new version.

<p>
Warcraft 1 Remastered and Warcraft 2 Remastered are available for PC via Battle.net right now (there's no word on whether they might eventually show up on other stores), costing <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-gb/product/warcraft-1-remastered">$9.99</a> and <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-gb/product/warcraft-2-remastered">$14.99</a> respectively. Additionally, there's a <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-gb/product/warcraft-remastered-battle-chest">Battle Chest bundle</a>, priced at $39.99, featuring the new remasters and Blizzard's much-maligned <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warcraft-iii-reforged">Warcraft 3: Reforged</a>. 
</p><p>
Despite the latter's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warcraft-3-reforged-houses-a-fantastic-rts-but-blizzard-has-fluffed-the-remake">terrible launch reception</a>, Blizzard has continued to improve the title since its arrival in 2020, with today bringing a new 2.0 update for all players. This includes overhauled environments and lighting, a revamped UI, up-rezzed HD versions of all classic Warcraft assets, plus a range of quality of life improvements - in-game hockey customisation and revamped ladder were mentioned - and "much, much more".

Fans believe that whatever you pick in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>'s pack opening carousel, you'll get the same cards regardless.
</p>
<p>
That's right: carefully choosing the booster pack you want to open from the game's carousel doesn't matter. 
</p>
<p>
Whether you're looking for a bent corner, crossing your fingers or dropping lots of real-world money on the game versus playing for free, the cards are all the same - and actually pre-determined. Choice is an illusion! 
</p>
<p>
Where's the evidence? Well, YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJhGaOrd1qU">Rustywolf</a> has come up with this convincing video where he shows a script he's authored that sniffs data packets sent by Pokémon TCG Pocket to the game's servers. 
</p>
<p>
Behind the scenes, you can see that pack opening data is determined as soon as a pack is purchased, before the user picks the on-screen booster they want to open or sees any of its cards. 
</p>
<p>
The video below shows this all in action, with card IDs received from the game's server and able to be cross-referenced with the game's card database - revealing the cards you'll get whatever pack you pick before you've even picked it.
