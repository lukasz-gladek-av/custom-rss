<p>He accompanied his message with photographic proof, showing that on 20th June, he'd finally earned a gold sticker on every Joker, something less than 1 percent of all global players have managed to do thus far.</p>
<p>Responding to a commenter on Bluesky, Localthunk <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/localthunk.com/post/3ls3v7nhrf22i">confirmed</a> he'd reached the achievement by running a "mostly Ghost, some Painted and Yellow" deck, although "every now and then [he]'d throw in a random one too just for fun".</p>

        <p>But "not the gaming rights".</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Hollywood producer, director, and screenwriter Adi Shankar has acquired the rights to Duke Nukem.</p>
<p>Shankar - who developed both the Castlevania and Devil May Cry animated shows for Netflix - told <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a64929637/adi-shankar-castlevania-devil-may-cry-interview/">Esquire</a> he has "video games in production", and has been approached with "different IPs and companies that want to work with [him]", as well as "obviously more" Devil May Cry. In amongst that is Duke Nukem, albeit "not the gaming rights".</p>

<p>"I got video games in production. Obviously more Devil May Cry," he said. "I'm being approached with different IPs and companies that want to work with me. I bought the rights to Duke Nukem. Not the gaming rights, but I bought it from Gearbox.</p>
<p>"It's a middle finger to everybody. When Duke Nukem blew up, a bunch of people sat around trying to turn it into a brand, when it's just a middle finger. Duke Nukem can't be made by a corporation, because the moment a corporation makes Duke Nukem, it's no longer Duke Nukem. I don't intend on having anyone tell me what to do on this one."</p>
<p>As for his Devil May Cry show? Shankar said Season 1 "had to be the gateway drug", but in Season 2, "the storytelling is going to pivot".</p>
<p>"Season 2 is going to be different, stylistically and tonally, from season 1. Virgil is a big, very important character. It's essentially a new show," Shankar added.</p>
<p>"I have goals. I want to body Arcane, surpass it in viewership... Arcane is the Joker lighting cash on fire, and it's great. With season 2 of Devil May Cry, I want to beat that. Show up to a tank fight with a water balloon and destroy the tank. Because that's cool."</p>
<p>Celebrating Devil May Cry's latest sales milestone, Capcom said the anime had been met with critical acclaim and boasts more than 5.3m views, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-devil-may-cry-animated-series-gets-positive-update-one-week-after-debut">has now been renewed for a second season</a>. Along with Johnny Yong Bosch as Dante, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-voice-actor-kevin-conroy-posthumously-stars-in-netflixs-devil-may-cry-anime">first series of Devil May Cry included legendary Batman voice actor Kevin Conroy as VP Baines</a>.</p>
<p>"Netflix's long-gestating animated adaptation of Capcom's venerable hack-em-up gives Dante his blockbuster action hero moment," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-season-1-review">Eurogamer's Devil May Cry season one review</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/hollywood-producer-adi-shankar-acquires-rights-to-duke-nukem]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Rebel Wolves, the studio from former CD Projekt director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, has dropped a new trailer giving us our first meaningful look at The Blood of the Dawnwalker's gameplay.</p>
<p>Recorded on PC - and clearly labelled as a pre-beta "work-in-progress" - the trailer presents a bumper-length introduction to some of the game's features and gameplay mechanics. You can check it out below:</p>

<p>As well as watching protagonist Coen in action, and some of the gorgeous environments he'll visit, we also get a good long look at his perks menu, too, and learn a little more about how to balance his human qualities with his superhuman ones.
</p>
<p>"Using hexes consumes his health," explains design director, Daniel Sadowski. "The way our magic system works, there's always a price to pay for manipulating reality."
</p>
<p>Rebel Wolves confirmed its first project would be dark fantasy RPG Dawnwalker <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-game-directors-new-studio-confirms-first-project-as-fantasy-rpg-dawnwalker">at the beginning of last year</a>. Described as a "brand-new role-playing saga", it's single-player and open-world, with a "strong focus on story and narrative", casting players as Coen - a "young man turned into a Dawnwalker, forever treading the line between the world of day and the realm of night". You must "fight for your humanity or embrace the cursed powers to save your family".</p>
<p>Alongside Tomaszkiewicz, Rebel Wolves counts former CD Projekt scribe Jakub SzamaÅ‚ek as its narrative director and main writer, with other team members including design director Daniel Sadowski, animation director Tamara Zawada, art director BartÅ‚omiej GaweÅ‚, CFO MichaÅ‚ Boryka, and studio head Robert Murzynowski - who have collectively worked on games such as Cyberpunk, Thronebreaker, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-warrior-2">Shadow Warrior 2</a>, and The Witcher series.</p>
<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series in 2026.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-gameplay-from-former-the-witcher-developers-fantasy-rpg-the-blood-of-the-dawnwalker]]></content:encoded>
