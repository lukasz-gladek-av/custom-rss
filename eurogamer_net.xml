            <p>PlayStation hit <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> released towards the end of last year, and quickly won itself praise for its platforming prowess and limitless charm. It went on to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-2024-winners-list-who-won-what-this-year">win Game of the Year at the Game Awards in December</a>, but its award-winning streak didn't end there.</p>
<p>Astro Bot was nominated for four awards at the New York Game Awards last night, which were co-hosted by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> president <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/reggie-fils-aime">Reggie Fils-Aimé</a>. Of those four, it went on to win three: The Tin Pan Alley Award for Best Music in a Game, the Central Park Children's Zoo Award for Best Kids Game and the Big Apple Award for Best Game of the Year.</p>

<p>With Fils-Aime hosting, and after numerous comparisons between Astro Bot and some of Nintendo's own Mario platformers, the stage was set for the big man to give his verdict. Thankfully, his words about Astro Bot were playful and full of praise. </p>
<p>"I have to admit it," Fils-Aime <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=jPsQ7JX8G4Q">said</a>, "Astro Bot almost outdid Nintendo at its own game." This good-humoured remark was met by appreciative laughter.</p>

<p>We here at Eurogamer were equally taken with Astro Bot on its release, awarding it a sparkling five out of five stars.</p>
<p>"When it's all done I'm left with that strange feeling of being very well cared for. I've seen a bunch of wild sights. I've messed around with cool gadgets, used the controller in unusual ways, tilting it, yes, but also blowing into it, trying to read the buried hieroglyphs of its rumble, I've ticked boxes, collected things, unlocked things, nodded at references that make me feel old, or sharp-eyed, or generally in the know," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-review">Eurogamer's Astro Bot review</a>.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry, meanwhile, called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-astro-bot-is-virtually-flawless-a-ps5-masterpiece-and-a-gaming-celebration">Astro Bot "virtually flawless and a joyous celebration of gaming"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>An iconic anthem from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> was heard on the runway this week during a Louis Vuitton fashion show by Pharrell Williams.</p>
<p>Yes, bizarre as it may seem, a bunch of moody male models lazily wandered along a catwalk as the stabbing, dramatic strings of bad boy Sephiroth's theme song One Winged Angel were performed by a live orchestra.</p>
<p>Williams is the Men's Creative Director at the French fashion house and was in charge of the music selection, which also included tracks he's written for The Weeknd and multiple K-pop acts.</p>

<p>One Winged Angel, from series composer Nobuo Uematsu, certainly makes for an intense opening though, and stands out from the other hip-hop tracks.</p>
<p>Why was it chosen? It certainly doesn't seem to relate to the actual fashion show, which was more preppy, tweed tailoring and streetwear than wings and long silvery hair.</p>
<p>Still, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> certainly seems pleased with the inclusion. And as musician Alex Moukala pointed out, Pharrell's debut album cover with NERD features a band member playing a PS1, so maybe this is a full circle moment.</p>

<p>This isn't even the first time Final Fantasy music has been heard at an event this year. AEW wrestler Kenny Omega debuted a new entrance song at Wrestle Dynasty in Tokyo earlier this month, which was written by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> and 16 composer Masayoshi Soken.</p>
<p>Omega is clearly a fan of the series, considering his finishing move is called the One Winged Angel.</p>

<p>It's also not the first time we've seen a Final Fantasy collaboration with Louis Vuitton.</p>
<p>Back in 2016, Final Fantasy 13 protagonist Lightning appeared in a Louis Vuitton campaign to become an unlikely fashion icon.</p>
<p>It's a big week for Final Fantasy 7 fans as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-pc-technical-specs-revealed-ps5-console-exclusive-being-optimised-for-steam-deck">Rebirth is released on PC</a>, which comes with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-verified-for-steam-deck-handheld">Steam Deck verification</a> too but hopefully <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-asks-pc-players-to-avoid-offensive-or-inappropriate-mods">no weird mods</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
