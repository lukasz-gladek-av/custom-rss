<p>"Good grief, what fun," we wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rollerdrome-review-roll7-delivers-a-game-of-impossible-style">Eurogamer's Rollerdrome review</a> back in 2022, slapping it with a rare Essential badge. "Few games sing for you like this. Few systems compliment and combine so elegantly and relentlessly, with such small and simple moments of care for everything in it, from the little blipping noises for reloading and picking up health (straight out of Grand Theft Auto - Rollerdrome's full of ultimate video game sounds) to the booming pistols of Lara Croft. And no game has ever been so cool."</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/conan-exiles">Conan Exiles</a>, on the other hand, secured a recommended, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/conan-exiles-review-a-handsomely-sculpted-survival-game">Eurogamer's review</a> saying: "If Ark and Rust are the flaccid alpha males of survival gaming, Conan is the cocksure challenger angling for an advantage".</p>
<p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cheeky-tweet-hints-at-the-next-big-franchise-coming-to-xbox-game-pass">Spyro Reignited Trilogy hit Xbox Game Pass last week</a>. The trilogy of titles are available to play whether you subscribe to Game Pass Standard, Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass, across cloud, console and PC.</p>
<p>Xbox recently reaffirmed its commitment to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-reaffirms-commitment-to-bringing-great-games-to-more-people-on-more-devices">"bringing great games to more people on more devices"</a> and plans to "extend" its strategy to bring its most notable franchises to other platforms like PS5 and Nintendo Switch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
BioWare had the look of its excellent RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard nailed a decade ago, when early work first began right after Dragon Age Inquisition's launch. 
</p>
<p>
Artwork shared by BioWare veteran Matt Rhodes reveals a very familiar-looking Minrathous, capital of Tevinter and the location for The Veilguard's opening mission, created 10 years before The Veilguard finally arrived. 
</p>
<p>
It's fascinating to see this, as well as other early production art from Rhodes, and consider how much of what became The Veilguard was nailed down already - even before the launch of Inquisition's final expansion, Trespasser. Simultaneously, it's also a little unbelievable that fans still had so long to wait to finally play it!
</p>
<p>
"The first real piece of concept art I made for this project," Rhodes wrote, sharing artwork of Minrathous on social media. "We knew we were going to Tevinter, so this was the first attempt to flesh that out."

<p>
As described by Rhodes, the image shows: "a powerful magister being carried on a palanquin by her elven slaves, and scrappy adventurers trying to evade mage patrols and survive in an urban labyrinth".
</p>
<p>
Rhodes has been at BioWare for 20 years and served as art director on the Dragon Age franchise for the past six. 
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, Rhodes showcased other Veilguard artwork created in 2014. There's some fascinating similarities to the final game here, including several images of Solas - and even one where he appears to be undertaking his ritual from Veilguard's opening.

The Veilguard finally launched last month, after a lengthy development which saw the project rebooted several times. At one point, the game would have included multiplayer elements. Ultimately, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/report-says-next-dragon-age-will-now-be-single-player-only-due-to-anthems-fortunes-reversing-eas-original-plans">these were dropped</a> - and the result is a single-player BioWare RPG that stands amongst the developer's best.
</p>
<p>
"A fantasy role-playing game of astonishing spectacle," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>. "This is the best Dragon Age, and perhaps BioWare, has ever been."
</p>
<p>
It took a little while for me to find my groove, but the more of Dragon Age I play, the more I find myself enamoured with its vast world and wonderful characters. If you're playing, Eurogamer has a lengthy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard walkthrough, tips and tricks</a> to help with your playthrough - as well as a guide to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-how-to-get-the-best-ending-good">best Dragon Age: The Veilguard endings</a> when the time comes for you to finally step up and (hopefully) save the day.

            <p>The Game Awards has confirmed that DLC, remakes, and remasters are all eligible for all categories of its awards, including Game of the Year.</p>

<p>"The Game Awards aims to recognise the best creative and technical work each year, irrespective of the format of that content’s release," the website now says. "Expansion packs, new game seasons, DLCs, remakes and remasters are eligible in all categories, if the jury deems the new creative and technical work to be worthy of a nomination.</p>
<p>"Factors such as the newness of the content and its price/value should be taken into consideration."</p>
<p>This now means that remakes like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> could be in contention, as well as DLC like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>. Elden Ring won the TGA Game of the Year award in 2022.</p>
<p>It also means games with seasonal content like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, Destiny, and other live-service games are also eligible, even if the base game itself released several years ago.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-sweeps-the-game-awards">Baldur's Gate 3 secured the top award</a>, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> snapping up several awards, too. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-2023-has-broken-its-own-viewership-record-with-118m-livestreams">The Game Awards 2023 broke its own viewership record</a>, clocking up around 118 million livestreams.</p>
