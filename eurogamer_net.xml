Three years after the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>'s Expanded &amp; Enhanced edition on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, the game's next-gen features have - just as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-gets-new-pc-version-that-adds-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-features-for-free">Rockstar promised last month</a> - finally made the jump to PC in a free update for all existing users.
</p>
<p>
From today, Grand Theft Auto 5 Legacy (as the original PC version is now being referred to) has been delisted from PC store fronts to make way for GTA 5 Enhanced. And as per <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/7551a7k917554a/free-upgrade-for-grand-theft-auto-v-on-pc-now-available">Rockstar's announcement</a>, this new edition introduces a range of features, including new vehicles, new ambient wildlife, and support for Rockstar's GTA+ subscription service.
</p>
<p>
It also adds new graphics options, including the ray traced shadows and reflections first introduced on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5, alongside other additions - such as ambient occlusion and global illumination - exclusive to PC. That's in addition to support for higher resolutions, higher aspect ratios, and higher framerates, as well as AMD FSR and Nvidia DLSS support - with Frame Generation support coming at a later date.

<p>
Elsewhere, DualSense controller owners can now use its adaptive triggers during gameplay, and Rockstar is also touting faster loading times via SSD and DirectStorage, as well as enhanced audio - including Dolby Atmos, and improved fidelity of speech, cinematics, and music.
</p>
<p>
And for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">Grand Theft Auto Online</a> players, the updated PC version gets kernel-based anti-cheat protections and proactive voice chat moderation, as well as the lies of new vehicles, Chameleon Paints, and high-performance mods from Hao's Special Works. 
</p>
<p>
All this comes with a higher set of minimum and recommended PC specifications, but anyone unable to meet those increased demands can still access Grand Theft Auto 5 Legacy via the game's launcher. Be aware, though, the two versions are considered entirely separate, meaning friends will all need to be using the same version if they want to play together. Additionally, it's <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/89953o1153a39a/pre-load-the-free-grand-theft-auto-v-pc-upgrade-now">necessary to migrate Story Mode and Online progress to the new edition</a>.
</p>
<p>
To coincide with the launch of GTA 5 Enchanced, Rockstar is discounting the game by 50 percent on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3240220/Grand_Theft_Auto_V_Enhanced/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/grand-theft-auto-v">Epic</a> store, bringing the price down to Â£14.99 until 20th March.
</p>
<p>
All this PC activity comes as Rockstar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">prepares to release GTA 6 this autumn</a> - although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-pc-version-teased-by-take-two-boss-acknowledges-platforms-growing-importance">publisher Take-Two has hinted the PC version won't arrive until later</a>. That tallies with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-set-for-pc-debut-in-early-2026-accessories-company-claims">recent claims by accessories company Corsair Gaming</a>, which suggested the PC release isn't due until "early 2026".

Dead by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deadlight">Deadlight</a> is waving goodbye to a horror icon. Developer Behaviour Interactive has announced Pinhead - and his Hellraiser Chapter DLC - is being yanked from sale on 4th April. 
</p>
<p>
Pinhead <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-teasing-hellraiser-additions-removing-stranger-things-dlc-in-november">joined the Dead by Daylight roster</a> back in September 2021, following in the footsteps of other legends of horror including Halloween's Michael Myers, Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Krueger, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre's Leatherface.
</p>
<p>
As Hellraiser might have it though, where there's pleasure, there's also pain, and Pinhead - AKA The Cenobite - is shuffling back to his corner of Hell early next month, taking his fancy box of torment with him. As <a href="https://deadbydaylight.com/news/hellraiser-last-chance-sale/">explained in Behaviour's announcement</a>, however, he's only retreating from digital store fronts - existing owners can continue playing with old needle-bonce after 4th April, but no new purchases of the Hellraiser Chapter DLC will be possible.

<p>
If that news has suddenly spurred you into a last-minute FOMO purchase, it's additionally worth noting the Hellraiser DLC is being removed from first-party digital stores from today, 4th March (with the exception of Switch's eShop, which says goodbye to Pinhead on 18th March), but it'll still be available to purchase via <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a>'s in-game store until 4pm GMT on 4th April. And to encourage a few final purchases ahead of the Hellraiser Chapter's removal, Behaviour is discounting The Cenobite and his Cosmetics by 50 precent in Dead by Daylight's store.
</p>
<p>
Behaviour hasn't explained <em>why</em> the DLC is being removed from sale (its <a href="https://forums.bhvr.com/dead-by-daylight/kb/articles/493-faq-the-hellraiser-content">official FAQ</a> goes with the line, "As with all Live-Service Games frequent updates and additions are to be expected"), but the answer is almost certainly licensing-related. Dead by Daylights's Stranger Things DLC was similarly withdrawn in 2019, although that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stranger-things-returns-to-dead-by-daylight">did eventually return</a>, implying Pinhead could also be back - if only Behaviour's legal team can solve that pesky Lament Configuration.
