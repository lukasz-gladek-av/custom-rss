            <p>Capcom is "investigating" an issue that's impeding progress for some players in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>
<p>Players are reporting that in Main Mission: Chapter 5-2 A World Turned Upside Down, a key NPC is not spawning where they should, essentially blocking all further campaign progress.</p>

<p>"Hunters, we are currently investigating the following issue," the publisher/developer stated on social media.</p>
<p>"There may be cases where an NPC does not appear, disabling story progression in Main Mission: Chapter 5-2 A World Turned Upside Down. We are currently working on these issues and will provide further updates when we have them."</p> <div>

<p>As yet, there's no confirmation on when this may be addressed, but Capcom has been whack-a-mole-ing issues fairly swiftly over the weekend. For instance, <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/1896084293438648676">a hot fix patch resolving issues with the Smithy and "Grill a Meal"</a> is already live, so make sure you apply any patches before you play to ensure you're using the latest version.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds has already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">smashed the 1m concurrent players barrier on Steam</a> and if you're one of the many players who likes to jump back into the character editor because you've given your hunter a beer gut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-you-can-change-your-monster-hunter-wilds-character-once-for-free-before-capcom-makes-you-pay-up">you might appreciate knowing you can modify your character once for free</a>, but any further substantive changes to your gender or body shape requires before Capcom makes you cough up some cash.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Eurogamer Monster Hunter Wilds review</a>, our Matt awarded it 4/5, saying: "Wilds remains an exhilarating piece of work - so refined, so alive, so giddily, chaotically joyful when it all comes together that it feels like the ultimate culmination of everything the series has been working toward over the last two decades.</p>
<p>"And if it continues Monster Hunter's legacy of generous post-launch support - where the series has traditionally felt the freest to get daft and indulge in its more sadistic tendencies - it'll be fascinating to see how this beautiful new baseline for the series develops."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>PlayStation's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-studio-firesprite-has-been-shedding-talent-amidst-accusations-of-toxic-culture-staff-say">recently cancelled Twisted Metal game</a> was reportedly a battle royale.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/cancelled-twisted-metal-live-service-a-battle-royale-featuring-out-of-vehicle-combat">MP1st</a>, the abandoned game - known internally as Project Copper - allegedly blended third-person shooting mechanics alongside the vehicular combat the series is known for.</p>

<p>How do we know this? A UI programmer working at Firesprite from April 2022 to October 2023 has <a href="https://www.hugoflsilva.com/project/1">uploaded</a> obscured screenshots from the work-in-progress to their portfolio. Whilst the game isn't explicitly mentioned and the images are blurred, you can nonetheless still see early prototypes of the third-person action both in and out of vehicles.</p>
<p>"I was part of Project Copper leading the UI team," the developer wrote on their online portfolio. "I was tasked with creating a generic UI system to be used in multiple projects in the company, I was also managing a team of 2 UI Programmers while working with other teams."</p>

<p>As for the game itself? The dev describes Project Copper a "third person vehicular action combat game based on a classic IP owned by PlayStation developed by Firesprite (PlayStation Studios)".</p>
<p>"It had third person shooter mechanics wrapped with third person vehicle combat with the objective of being the last one standing," they added.</p>
<p>Back in February 2022, Sony stated it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">aimed to launch over 10 new live service games</a> over the coming years. A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-exec-jim-ryan-believes-live-service-games-will-dominate-over-subscriptions">then-Sony exec Jim Ryan said he believed live service games were a key part of gaming's future</a>, confident in PlayStation's live service push.</p>
<p>However, since then, the company has been pulling back on this vision, with several proposed projects cancelled, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">including two more in January</a>.
</p>
<p>In related news, just last week, Peacock shared its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-twisted-metal-season-two">first trailer for the second season of Twisted Metal</a>. The upcoming second series stars Anthony Mackie, Stephanie Beatriz, Joe Seanoa, Will Arnett and Anthony Carrigan.</p>
<p>"As they try to survive an onslaught of dangerous new foes and familiar faces alike, including the murderous clown Sweet Tooth, things get complicated for John when he reunites with his long-lost sister, the vigilante Dollface," reads the official blurb.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
