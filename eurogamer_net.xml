            <p>
Last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> was stellar for many, many reasons, and composer Akira Yamaoka's gorgeous reworking of his nearly 20-year-old original soundtrack was undoubtedly one of them. So when you tell me the whole thing is being released as a fancy £125 six-disc vinyl edition, my power to resist - even as my bank balance screams in protest - is minimal.
</p>
<p>
Konami's newly announced <a href="https://www.lacedrecords.co/collections/silent-hill/products/silent-hill-2-limited-deluxe-x6lp-boxset">Silent Hill 2 Limited Edition Deluxe X6LP Boxset</a> is beautiful in a so-putrid-you-can-almost-smell-it sort of way. Each inner sleeve features strikingly grimy artwork from developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s concept work, and each translucent disc - officially described as "brown + red" - has the lurid purple sheen of rotting meat. Delightful!
</p>
<p>
Across the six discs - which are being released by Laced Records in collaboration with Konami - you get 93 tracks from last year's remake (I will inevitably be wearing a deep groove into Laura's Theme - Repetition) and there's 32-page art book featuring liner notes from Akira Yamaoka.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
And for those with far better impulse control than me, Laced is also releasing two alternate additions with fewer tracks and a smaller price tag. The <a href="https://www.lacedrecords.co/collections/silent-hill/products/silent-hill-2-deluxe-double-vinyl">Silent Hill 2 Double Deluxe Vinyl</a> features an 'essential selection' of 27 tracks from Yamaoka's soundtrack across two "black heavyweight" LPs for £36, and there's also an <a href="https://www.lacedrecords.co/collections/silent-hill/products/silent-hill-2-exclusive-edition-deluxe-double-vinyl">Exclusive Edition Double Deluxe Vinyl version</a> which is identical in content and price, but which comes on foggy hued "milky clear" discs.
</p>
<p>
All three editions are set launch this October, and pre-orders are available now.
</p>
<p>
And if you haven't already played Bloober Team's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake. Eurogamer contributor Vikki Blake <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">awarded it five stars in her review</a> and it earned itself fourth place in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-50-best-games-of-2024-ranked">Eurogamer's best games of 2024</a>. All of which is incredibly encouraging for Bloober's next game, Cronos, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloober-has-found-its-feet-with-cronos-the-new-dawn-its-survival-horror-follow-up-to-silent-hill-2">alternate history sci-fi horror partially set in 1980s Krakow</a>.

            <p>Warner Bros had a 48 percent decrease in games revenue last quarter, as it failed to release a single game.</p>
<p>The company has released its latest earnings report, with the dip in revenue also owing to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> failing to meet expectations on its release last year, as well as strong carryover sales from the previous year of both the incredibly popular <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> making for a tough comparison.</p>
<p>So why no games? Back in March, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-cancels-major-game-expansion-as-financial-woes-continue">reported the company cancelled a planned expansion to Hogwarts Legacy</a>, in addition to plans for a Definitive Edition with all content.</p>

<p>The expansion was never officially announced, but was reported by Bloomberg last year. Reportedly, it was cancelled due to the extra content not being substantial enough to justify its price.</p>
<p>Additional content for Suicide Squad has also now been curtailed, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-final-chapter-brings-game-to-a-cheap-end">the final Suicide Squad chapter</a>  released in January this year. The full game remains playable both online and offline, though fans complained its final addition was a cheap conclusion to the story.</p>
<p>After launch, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">game failed to meet sales expectations</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flopped-due-to-perfectionism-and-ill-suited-genre-pivot-report">reportedly flopped due to an ill-suited genre pivot</a>, a constantly shifting vision, and a culture of perfectionism. The studio, Rocksteady, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs">suffered layoffs</a> as a result, but is now reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-has-a-new-single-player-batman-game-in-development-teases-new-report">working on a new single-player Batman game</a>.</p>
<p>Warner Bros also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">cancelled its Wonder Woman game</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thats-all-folks-another-warner-bros-live-service-bites-the-dust">ended support for live-service brawler Multiversus</a>, closing Monolith Productions and Player First Games in the process.</p>
<p>All of this has led to a quarter with no game releases from a major publisher.</p>
<p>Its next release will be Hogwarts Legacy on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> - one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">many launch games</a> arriving alongside Nintendo's new console</p>
<p>Still, the company is doing alright when it comes to films. In a letter to shareholders, the company described Warner Bros. Motion Pictures as recently "demonstrating strong momentum", driven largely by the massive success of A Minecraft Movie.</p>
<p>The game adaptation has grossed almost $900m globally since launch, with over $300m <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">generated in its first weekend</a>. It's the top grossing film of 2025 to date.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-releases-digitally-next-week">film will be available digitally later this week</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Word on the street is that Rockstar is getting ready to release a GTA 4 port for modern consoles.</p>
<p>According to the latest rumours from known Rockstar insider Tez2, a spruced up version of the open-world action game could release later this year, followed by a remaster of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne-3">Max Payne 3</a>.</p>
<p>Writing on the <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1001944-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-2/page/90/#comment-1072547918">GTA Forum</a>, Tez2 said someone at Rockstar had "hinted" at a GTA 4 port, and "by now it should've gone up a year in development". The insider added that this port was one of the reasons <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-shuts-down-ambitious-mod-that-put-gta-4s-liberty-city-in-grand-theft-auto-5">Rockstar put the stoppers on the fan-made Liberty City Preservation Project earlier this year</a>. This project would have added a playable version of Grand Theft Auto 4's map to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA5</a>.</p>

<p>"If [Rockstar] still follow their plan laid out from the pandemic days, they'll do an MP3 port after 4. So that is an opportunity to do a bundle or a Definitive Edition. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> 1 &amp; 2 remakes, and a Max Payne 3 port," Tez2 wrote.</p>
<p>GTA 4 is set in Liberty City - Rockstar's version of New York - and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-cast-and-locations-revealed-troublesome-rappers-vice-city-and-beyond">where GTA 6 protagonist Lucia Caminos hails from</a>. So, a GTA 4 port ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>'s release may be a nice way to tide players over until next May, while also offering a bit of background on Lucia's once home.</p>
<p>Haven't played GTA 4 for yourself yet? Well, on its release Eurogamer called it "a genuinely ground-breaking blockbuster" in video game history back in the day.</p>
<p>"There were moments playing GTA 4 that I thought back to my initial experiences with games, and realised exactly how far we've come. There's never been anything quite like GTA 4in the world. That there makes me genuinely happy to be a gamer," Kieron Gillen wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-iv-1-8">Eurogamer's GTA 4 review from 2008</a>. "Also, beating up people and taking their money and stuff."</p>

<p>As for the future of the series, the next new mainline entry will be Grand Theft Auto 6, which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">due to release across PS5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th May 2026</a>.</p>
