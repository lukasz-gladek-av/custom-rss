            <p>Nintendo is releasing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> bundle which will include both the console and upcoming release, Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p>
<p>Of course, this bundle will include the Switch 2 edition of the game, which the team previously said will boast improved graphics and frame rates.</p>
<p>Those interested in picking up this bundle will be able to pre-order from tomorrow, 23rd July. The bundle will then launch on 16th October, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced">when Pokémon Legends: Z-A itself finally releases</a>. I have popped an email over to Nintendo to check pricing, and will update when I hear back. </p>

<p>Nintendo has previously bundled games with its consoles. On Switch 2's launch last month, many opted for the console that came with a downloadable <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> code.</p>
<p>As for Pokémon Legends: Z-A, here's what the official blurb says: "Pokémon Legends: Z-A is a new frontier for the Pokémon video game series, blending an RPG story unfolding in a single city with action elements and a real-time battle system unlike anything seen before in the franchise.</p>
<p>"Trainers can look forward to the beginning of a new adventure in Lumiose City - one woven by people and Pokémon together!"</p> <div>

            <p>The Pokémon Company provided a fresh look at its forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> during today's Pokémon Presents stream, including a reveal of its all new Mega Dragonite.</p>
<p>The iconic gen one dragon hasn't previously had an evolved form, but this new game will introduce its mega evolved form as part of the game's story.</p>
<p>It's set in Lumiose City, part of the Kalos region from gen six, and will feature wild pokémon that have begun mega evolving on their own and gone rogue. It'll be down to players, alongside Team MZ, to take them down.</p>

<p>Team MZ are the protectors of Lumiose city, and includes fashion designer Naveen and professional dancer Lida. Other characters in the game include detective Emma and Pokémon Research Lab director Mable.</p>
<p>During the daytime, players will explore the city, find pokémon to add to their party, customise their characters and pokémon, and help out the citizens in side quests.</p>
<p>At night, they'll take part in the Z-A Royale, competing against powerful trainers to climb the ranks.</p>
<p>All footage shown in the new trailer was seemingly from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> edition of the game, though it honestly still looks pretty basic visually. On the new console, players can expect improved graphics and frame rates.</p>
<p>The game will release on 16th October this year, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced">announced back in May</a>, across both Switch 1 and Switch 2. The Pokémon Company has already shown a fair amount of the game, so now we're just waiting on that release to try it for ourselves.</p>
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is something of a spiritual successor to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-budget-bare-minimum-or-the-series-purest-form">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>, released back in 2022. It was praised for its action-RPG gameplay, but suffered performance issues.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/mega-dragonite-debuts-in-fresh-look-at-pokemon-legends-z-a]]></content:encoded>
