            <p>Firaxis has revealed its hugely-anticipated sequel, Civilization 7, will boast a diverse and "representative" cast of leaders.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ungeek.ph/2025/01/representation-is-a-key-factor-in-selecting-civilization-vii-leaders-says-firaxis/">Ungeek</a>, executive producer Dennis Shirk said that "digging deep in history" to find the best leaders is "always the most exciting part of [developing] the game".</p>

<p>"We do that throughout the first year of development, the Leaders and the Civ choices, and everybody has their favourite," Shirk explained. "We have community feedback from the past game for people that we know that they'd like to see return. We've got criteria to make sure that we have representation around the globe for finding new leaders, digging deep into history, and saying, look at this person, this is awesome, we want to represent them."</p>
<p>The "really involved" process also taps into the expertise of the in-house historians who not only recommend "really popular" leaders, but "underrepresented" ones, too.</p>
<p>"We have all of the 2K local teams on speed dial to make sure that we can constantly talk to them about who would be really good representatives for certain parts of the world," Shirk added.</p>
<p>"Our in-house historians are making recommendations for not just Civilizations and Leaders that we think are going to be really popular, but also for ones that are underrepresented that we want to represent. So, it's just a big bucket of discovery. It's just a lot of discussion, a lot of back and forth, but it's a really exciting process."</p>
<p>Civilization 7 - the very long-awaited latest instalment in developer Firaxis' beloved 4X strategy series - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-gets-february-2025-release-date-and-first-gameplay-trailer">will be launching for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on 11th February, 2025</a>.</p>
<p>Potential purchasers can choose from three different editions. First up, the Standard Edition costs £60 (£50 on Switch) and includes the base game and not much else. There's also an £90 Deluxe Edition (£80 on Switch), which includes five days of "advanced access" starting on 6th February, the Tecumseh and Shawnee Pack, the Deluxe Content Pack, and the post-launch Crossroads of the World Collection.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-game-of-thrones-alum-is-lending-their-golden-pipes-to-civilization-7">Sean Bean is passing his role as narrator on to another Game of Thrones alum: Brienne of Tarth</a> (well, Gwendoline Christie, but you know what I mean).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Koei Tecmo said it has taken "strict action" against thousands of provocative Dead or Alive fanart images because the characters are "like daughters" to their creators.</p>
<p>As reported in <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/1653862.html">GameWatch</a> (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/theyre-like-daughters-to-us-around-3000-pieces-of-offensive-dead-or-alive-fanart-gets-removed-by-koei-tecmo-yearly/">Automaton</a>), Koei Tecmo's legal affairs lead, Tomotoshi Nishimura, recently addressed a copyright conference in which he revealed that whilst the company was pragmatic and even supportive of "<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/otaku">otaku</a>" fan culture, it had no choice but to issue copyright strikes against amateur images that are created for, uh, "adult purposes".</p>

<p>And the scale is not to be sneezed at, either.</p>
<p>Whilst it would be impractical for Koei Tecmo to pursue every inappropriate image, Nishimura said that the legal team takes action against 2000-3000 doujinshi - the sale of self-published works based on existing franchises and characters - every year. That's despite the fact the latest game in the series, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-or-alive-6">Dead or Alive 6</a>, was released six years ago in 2019.</p>
<p>With an all-new instalment called Venus Vacation Prism: Dead or Alive Xtreme expected later this year, however, Nishimura is probably expecting a few more naughty images than usual.</p>
<p>At the same copyright conference, an attorney for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-attorney-explains-why-its-strengthening-measures-against-illegal-emulation">Nintendo discussed the company's stance on emulation and what it considers to be illegal</a>, according to Japanese law.</p></div>

            <p>Tomb Raider 4 - 6 Remastered will restore unused voice lines from Angel of Darkness, and make some quality of life changes to Kurtis Trent's abilities.</p>
<p>Tomb Raider 4 - 6 Remastered includes <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-last-revelation">Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation</a> (1999), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-chronicles">Tomb Raider: Chronicles</a> (2000), and - of course - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-the-angel-of-darkness">Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness</a> (2003). As with the first batch of remastered <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider games</a>, each of the next three games will feature improved visuals that bring new life to environments, characters, and artefacts. There will be the option to toggle between classic and modern graphics as well, much like with Tomb Raider 1 - 3 Remastered.</p>
<p>The Tomb Raider team has now laid out some additional changes and tweaks coming specifically to Angel of Darkness, the series' widely panned entry from the early 2000s. Perhaps these changes will allow Angel of Darkness to rise gloriously from the ashes like a reborn phoenix..?</p>

<p>Let's start with Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness' Kurtis Trent, who is playable for a brief section of the game. Tomb Raider 4 - 6 Remastered will restore Kurtis' ability to wield the Chirugai in-game. He will also be able to project a psychic shield around himself, shoot around corners while making his way about in stealth mode, and sprint like Lara does. Huzzah!</p><p>Meanwhile, the remaster team has restored some unused voice lines from Lara Croft herself and Kurtis. These lines will be able to provide players with "more context" about what is going on, which should help them "better understand the story".</p>
<p>These additional lines of dialogue will also provide a few more hints here and there.</p>
<p>Other quality of life improvements pegged for Angel of Darkness include Werner Von Croy's Notebook now opening automatically the first time Lara wakes up in the derelict railway carriage, with the notebook getting new entries as the game progresses.</p>
<p>"Additionally, some inventory items have been restored, such as Von Croy's cane, which holds a secret that can only be unlocked in the inventory," teases the Tomb Raider 4 - 6 Remastered team.</p>

<p>As for the original trilogy, on its release last year, we awarded the Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered collection four stars, while acknowledging some of the dated qualities.</p>
<p>"I still love this collection, because it's carefully made and lovingly updated, but also awkward, elbowy, frustrating and prone to leaving me stuck. It's a collection that understands that Tomb Raider was absolutely a game about its controls, and it still should be - even if it doesn't quite know how to deliver on that," our Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-i-iii-remastered-review">Eurogamer's Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Desperate Silksong fans believe a new ARG hinting at the long-awaited game's release date has begun, involving the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and a slice of cake.
</p>
<p>
Let's break it down. Two days ago, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> and Silksong co-creator William Pellen updated his social media handle, profile name and picture on X. 
</p>
<p>
His handle is now @everydruidwaswr, his name is now "little bomey" and his profile picture is a slice of cake. It's this slice of cake which fans have now linked to Switch 2.
</p>
<p>
Why? Well, Pellen went on to tweet: "something big is coming. keep your eyes closed tomorrow". Tomorrow meaning the 16th January - which was of course when Switch 2 was announced. 
</p>
<p>
So maybe Pellen was just in the know, as a lot of people were, about the Switch 2 reveal? Or, Silksong fans say, maybe there's more! 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">something big is coming. keep your eyes closed tomorrow</p>— little bomey (@everydruidwaswr) <a href="https://twitter.com/everydruidwaswr/status/1879751713621725206?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>
A Google reverse image search on the slice of cake image does throw up something odd: that it comes from a recipe page posted on 2nd April 2024. That's exactly a year ahead of 2nd April 2025, when Nintendo will hold a huge Switch 2 Nintendo Direct and unveil the console's game line-up properly.
</p><p>
Could it be deliberate? Over on the Silksong <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1i31gas/what_we_know_so_far_about_the_william_pellen/">reddit</a>, fans say developer Team Cherry has dropped similarly labyrinthine hints previously. Fans also reason that an appearance in the Switch 2 Direct would be a reasonable place for the game to finally materialise. 
</p>
<p>
Silksong's launch made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-moments-set-to-shape-video-games-in-2025">Eurogamer's list of our most anticipated moments of 2025</a> - if it actually launches this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-will-no-longer-launch-in-first-half-of-2023">following years of delays</a>.
</p>
<p>"Silksong is the fast-paced and fluid sequel Hollow Knight deserves," we said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-the-fast-paced-and-fluid-sequel-hollow-knight-deserves">after playing a demo of the game</a> - all the way back in 2019.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
