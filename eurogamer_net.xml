            <p>The upcoming third season of HBO's The Last of Us TV adaptation will feature a new actor playing WLF member Manny.</p>
<p>As first reported by <a href="https://www.nexuspointnews.com/exclusive-the-last-of-us-season-3-set-to-recast-danny-ramirez">nexuspointnews</a>, Danny Ramirez has departed the show due to scheduling conflicts. As such, the role is now being recast, though who will fill Manny's shoes is yet to be determined.</p>

<p>As well as The Last of Us, Ramirez is also known to many as Joaquin Torres/Falcon in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He is due to appear in Avengers: Doomsday, as well as in the upcoming Jean-Michel Basquiat biopic Samo Lives.</p>
<p>As for Manny, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-adds-danny-ramirez-tati-gabrielle">when Ramirez was first announced to be joining The Last of Us</a>, the showrunners described his character as "a loyal soldier whose sunny outlook belies the pain of old wounds and a fear that he will fail his friends when they need him most".</p><p>Ramirez's Manny joined fellow newcomers <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-casts-kaitlyn-dever-as-abby-for-season-two">Kaitlyn Dever as Abby</a>, Tati Gabrielle as Nora, Ariela Barer as Mel, Spencer Lord as Owen, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-series-casts-beef-actor-young-mazino-as-jesse">Young Mazino as Jesse</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-adds-schitts-creek-star-catherine-ohara-to-its-cast">Catherine O'Hara as Gail </a>and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/isabela-merced-cast-as-dina-in-hbos-the-last-of-us-adaptation">Isabela Merced as Dina</a> for the second season of The Last of Us.

<p>Ramirez is not the only key team member to be leaving the show for season three. Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation">Neil Druckmann announced he was stepping back from the series after The Last of Us season two</a>, in order to focus on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s gaming output, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-studio-naughty-dog-reportedly-mandated-crunch-to-ready-a-demo-for-intergalactic-the-heretic-profit">includes Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. Druckmann had previously worked on The Last of Us' adaptation as a co-showrunner, director, writer and producer.</p>
<p>While he's returned to full-time video game development, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-will-retain-high-level-role-on-the-last-of-us-season-three-to-ensure-its-as-deeply-faithful-as-season-one">Druckmann has since said he will remain somewhat involved in The Last of Us' adaptation at a "very high level"</a> to make sure it's "as deeply faithful" as the show's first season was.</p>

            <p>Toshiyuki Itahana, character artist for the Final Fantasy series, including games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-crystal-chronicles">Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>: Dawntrail, has left <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://note.com/itahana/n/n277aa9cc7148?sub_rt=share_pb">Writing to fans online</a>,  Itahana expressed that he decided to leave Square Enix last year after the 25th anniversary of the Final Fantasy series, feeling both "a strong sense of accomplishment" and that it was the "right moment" to move on.</p>
<p>Itahana revealed in the same post that he intends to move forward as a freelance illustrator and character designer, stating he's currently learning from senior freelance illustrators as well as asking fans of his to support him moving forward.</p>

<p>Itahana concluded the message by thanking fans who experienced his work so far, writing: "To everyone who played the games I worked on at Square Enix, and to all those I had the pleasure of working with over the years, thank you very much. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude, and I sincerely hope for your continued support in the future."</p><p>It's certainly an interesting time for the Final Fantasy franchise. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-major-shareholder-fundamental-reassessment-final-fantasy-future">Not only have major shareholders recently urged for a reassessment of the series</a>, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-do-you-want-to-happen-to-the-final-fantasy-franchise-youve-got-a-few-days-to-tell-square-enix-directly">Square Enix is asking fans directly what they want to see with Final Fantasy moving forward</a>. We may be in the verge of an era of great change with the series, who can say.</p>
<p>Regardless, with Itahana's departure Square Enix is waving goodbye to one of its most beloved artists. One that's likely to get a lot of work as a freelance in the future.</p>
