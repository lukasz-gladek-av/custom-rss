            <p>
Sony has announced a souped up version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a>, the 2019 PS4 not-zombie game where you ride around on a motorbike to escape hordes of enemies.
</p>
<p>
PlayStation 5 and PC (via both Steam and the Epic Games Store) versions will launch simultaneously, on 25th April, Sony announced tonight during its latest State of Play broadcast.
</p>
<p>
If you owned Days Gone on PS4, or already on PC, you'll have the option to upgrade to this new version for $10 (UK price TBA).

<p>
This time around, Days Gone's hordes will be bigger in the new survival arcade mode Horde Assault, and there are fresh Permadeath and Speedrun modes as well. 
</p>
<p>
As you'd expect, this version's visuals have also been given a polish, with increased draw distance, shadows and lighting, and additional accessibility features like game speed and controller remapping. 
</p>
<p>
Tonight's announcement comes just a couple of weeks after it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">Days Gone developer Bend Studio recently had an under-wraps live-service project cancelled by Sony</a>, in the wake of Concord's high-profile flop.
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg previously stated that the studio had been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-gone-studio-says-it-still-plans-on-creating-cool-sht-after-sony-pulls-plug-on-latest-game">working on a new game that included multiplayer and was set to build on Days Gone's open-world systems</a>. It is unclear what the team is working on next.

            <p>The release date for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> has been confirmed during this evening's State of Play.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-leaks">As leaked last week</a> (spot of poetry for you there), the remake of the 2004 game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a> will arrive on 28th August.</p>
<p>Along with confirmation of the release date, we also got the official release date trailer, which you can see below complete with a bottom spanking Ape Escape monkey. Yes, the special minigame "Snake vs Monkey" where you have to capture the Pipo Monkeys is back. Having written that, though, I have just seen that Snake vs Monkey is in PS5 and Steam versions, but not Xbox. "A different special game will be implemented for the Xbox version! Please wait for further details," reads the blurb on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/METAL%20GEAR%20SOLID%20%CE%94:%20SNAKE%20EATER%20-%20Release%20Date%20Trailer">Konami's Xbox release date trailer</a>. </p>

<p>"It was basically our mission, our duty, to kind of continue making sure that the series lives on for future generations," Okamura said. "After all, we leave behind much more than just DNA, as Solid Snake would say - but again, who is Solid Snake?"</p>

            <p>
The promised DLC expansion for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> has been revealed as a prequel called Overture.
</p>
<p>
Once again, players will take the role of Geppetto's puppet but will follow the legendary Stalker in the final days of the city of Krat. It's due out this summer.
</p>
<p>
The DLC has a distinct winter theme, with plenty of snow and fluffy hats, as well as some flashy-looking combat moves. Check out the trailer below.

<p>
Mainly, I'm excited about the prospect of new bosses to fight against and fresh weapon combinations - the trailer includes both a bow and a pair of nasty looking claws that will do serious damage.
</p>
<p>"We knew that the end of Lies of P was just the beginning for what our team had in store for fans," said Jiwon Choi, game director at Round8 Studios. "Lies of P: Overture allows us the opportunity to fully explore the past and present of our universe. We are grateful for our community’s patience as our team took the time to tell the story we’ve always wanted to share."</p>
<p>
Lies of P first released back in 2023 from Korean publisher Neowiz. It's a Soulslike in a Belle Epoque setting, with the developer aiming to take on FromSoftware at its own game.
</p>
<p>
It mostly succeeded, with Lies of P considered one of the best Soulslike games not created by FromSoftware. The prospect of more puppet goodness in this DLC is definitely enticing.
