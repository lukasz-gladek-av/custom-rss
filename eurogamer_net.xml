            <p>Free-to-play "Halo meets Portal" shooter Splitgate 2 says it hears you "loud and clear" about some of the eye-watering prices that have popped up on its in-game store.</p>
<p>In a video update posted to Twitter, 1047 Games' CEO Ian Proulx said he was "doubling down" on being "community first" and confirmed the team was slashing its $80 cosmetics bundle - which was reportedly already on sale from an original $145 price tag - to $40 after fans complained about the pricing.</p>

<p>

<p>Proulx also touched upon his "Make FPS Great Again" cap, saying: "Obviously, some people didn't receive it the way we intended. Our intention is truly to make FPS [games] as good as possible. It's plain and simple."</p>

            <p>A new Tales Of remaster is on the way.</p>
<p>As part of the 30th anniversary celebration, a blink-and-you'll-miss-it tease popped up on social media earlier today, confirming there's a new Tales of Remastered project in the works. Which one? Well, Bandai Namco's being coy about that.</p>

<p>"The next Tales of Remastered will be announced this summer!" the tweet said andâ€¦ well, nothing else, really. And as for exactly what "this summer" means? That could be the end of August. It could be the end of today. Who knows. As <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bandai-namco-teases-new-tales-of-remaster-announcement/">VGC</a> points out, its proximity to this evening's Xbox Games Showcase is probably not a coincidence, though.</p> <div>

<p>As always, we'll let you know as/when this pops up again.</p>
<p>The Tales series is an RPG franchise that's been around for three whole decades. Kicking off in 1995 with Tales of Phastasia, there have since been 28 mainline titles and multiple spin-off games across all kinds of media, including anime and manga. Our most recent game was Tales of Graces f Remastered, which released at the beginning of the year.</p>

    <div id="main-content">
        

        <p>"Maintaining transparency and confidence with the community here is always our goal," the developer said.</p>

    </div>

  </p>

    

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Gearbox has confirmed via a statement that its games do not contain "spyware" after fans had "concerns about Take-Two's terms of service".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/49520/discussions/0/598528766295202095/">statement</a>, published to Steam, explicitly states that Gearbox's publisher, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>, does "not use spyware in its games", and confirmed its privacy policy applies not only to players, but also labels, studios, games, and services across all media and platform types.</p>
<p>Gearbox was forced to make the clarification after all of the Borderlands games were review-bombed on Steam by players who believe the updated terms were suspicious. Others were unhappy that the revised agreements made mods "a bannable offense", along with using cheats and exploits, or even just using a VPN. A forced arbitration clause for unhappy players in the US also caused considerable consternation.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the details of the revised EULA have <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/49520/discussions/0/598528666219110913/">fans reporting that the latest update</a>, if accepted, gives Gearbox "access to root access to your computer under the guise of 'anticheat' software," including access to "IP address, personal information, network traffic, and pictures on your PC", which the developer refutes.</p>
<p>"We know there have been some concerns from Borderlands fans about Take-Twoâ€™s Terms of Service. Maintaining transparency and confidence with the community here is always our goal, and we wanted to address some of these concerns," the statement begins.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Steam / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"Take-Two does not use spyware in its games. Take-Twoâ€™s Privacy Policy applies to all labels, studios, games, and services across all media and platform types such as console, PC, mobile app, and website. The Privacy Policy identifies the data activities that may be collected but this does not mean that every example is collected in each game or service."</p>
<p>The latter half of the statement, however, was still contentious for some.</p>
<p>"Take-Twoâ€™s Terms of Service prohibit mods that allow users to gain an unfair advantage, negatively impact the ability of other users to enjoy the game as intended, or allow users to gain access to content that the user is not entitled to," the statement added. "We do this to protect the integrity of the game experience for all users. Take-Two generally does not seek to take action against mods that are single-player only, non-commercial, and respect the intellectual property (IP) rights of its labels and third parties."</p>
<p>Gearbox locked the thread so players could not respond, but players are continuing to make their thoughts known via the user review sections of all Borderlands games on Steam.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-slam-gearbox-ceo-randy-pitchfords-message-to-cost-sensitive-fans">Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford double-doubled down on comments about the cost of Borderlands 4</a>, by inviting "cost sensitive" fans to download <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tiny-tinas-wonderlands">Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</a> from the Epic Games Store for "FREE".</p>
<p>These latest comments come after Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford made headlines when he told a X/Twitter commenter that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/80-for-borderlands-4-too-costly-randy-pitchford-says-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen">"real fans" would find a way to get their hands on a copy of the game, even if it came with a $80 price tag.</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-randy-pitchford-seeks-to-justify-80-real-fans-comment">He later tried to justify it</a>, all the while saying pricing was "not [his] call".</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 is arriving earlier than expected on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-forward-perhaps-because-2k-knows-exactly-when-gta-6-is-coming-out">12th September</a>, and developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-some-new-borderlands-4-gameplay-to-go-with-that-revised-release-date">Gearbox recently shared more of its latest looter shooter in a new PlayStation showcase</a>. It showed off a couple of new Vault Hunters, some of its new weapons, new traversal mechanics, its new planet, and more, all to whip up enthusiasm for what creative director Graeme Timmins called "hands-down our best Borderlands ever".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As for what it shows? Well, not much. At just 15 seconds long, you can blink and see it, but it's officially called Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy. It appears to show what may well be a prequel based on Sophia.</p>
<p>It's slated to arrive in 2026 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series. It's possible it'll pop up again in this evening's Xbox Games Showcase. Just try and feign surprise.</p>

            <p>As part of IGN Live, Sandfall Interactive has unveiled the opening 10 minutes of an all-new documentary following the team as it developed and released Clair Obscur: 33 Expedition.</p>

<p>There is no release date as yet for the documentary, as it's currently a work-in-progress. However, the ten-minute taster offers a great insight into what to expect, including the revelation that that delightful moment between Monoco and Verso was entirely improvised.</p>
<p>Jennifer English (Maelle), Ben Starr (Verso), Shala Nyx (Sciel), Kirsty Rider (Lune), Rich Keeble (Monoco), and Maxence Cazorla (Esquie) also joined the IGN Live stage to talk about their work on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</p>
<p>"We were all really excited," English said. "We weren't as stressed as the developers were, but I was dead nervous about it because we put all our love and heart into it and hope it pays off - and thankfully it did."</p>
<p>"You can do whatever you do in the studio, but then it stops being yours. You don't know what itâ€™s going to become," Ben Starr added. "There are so many circumstances that go into the release of a game, and I felt, personally, there was a huge amount of pressure. It's a game I wanted to be good for the team because they had put so much work into it, and because we didn't just come into it, we were an additional part of it."</p>
<p>Sciel actor Shala Nyx also explained how their character has resonated so deeply with players.</p>
<p>"It's so cinematic. It's just so wonderful to be the voice and body of a character that is so rich and has so much emotional depth," Nyx said.</p>
<p>"I've had so many people reach out to me about how my character has helped them with their depression and helped them with their mental health. It's so ephemeral and every moment is so rich, and that's a testament to the writing."</p>
<p>"Outstanding artwork and glorious combat bring Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's bold, painterly world to life," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Eurogamer's Clair Obscur review</a>.</p>
<p>On its first day, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 sold 500,000 copies. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-500k-sales-in-one-day">Within three days, the game had hit a million copies sold</a>. Then, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-a-fitting-sales-milestone">33 days after its release on 28th May, the game has reached 3.3 million sales across PC and console</a>. "We couldn't make that up," said a social post sharing the news.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We're back this Sunday afternoon to cover the summer Xbox Games Showcase live. The show begins at 6pm UK time (7pm CEST/ 1pm EDT/10am PDT) and our updates will appear automatically below. You can also leave comments and chat along with us while watching the stream. You know the drill.</p>
<p>What do we expect? Firstly, note that this is a combined showcase so the general Xbox part of the show will happen first before we move to an Outer Worlds 2-specific broadcast after. We don't know how long either part of the show will last.</p>
<p>Microsoft hasn't given us any indication of games, either, but we expect to see more of the delayed Fable 4 - maybe a detailed look at gameplay - as well as another look at last year's announced games Perfect Dark (the reboot) and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/state-of-decay-3">State of Decay 3</a>. I wonder whether we'll also finally see more of Rare's long-in-development - perhaps lost-in-development - fantastical forest game Everwild, which was originally announced in 2019. Microsoft went on the record earlier this year to say <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-rares-everwild-is-still-in-development-and-xbox-is-committed-to-giving-the-team-the-time-it-needs">Everwild is still in development and getting the time it needs</a>.</p>
<p>Gears of War: E-Day will probably emerge like a burrowing locust swarm, at some point, and perhaps we'll see more of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inxiles-clockwork-revolution-is-a-time-bending-rpg-which-owes-a-lot-to-bioshock-infinite">inXile's BioShock-like Clockwork Revolution</a>. We may hear more about what Double Fine is up to, now it's owned by Microsoft, and - whisper it - there's talk Bethesda might drop the big one, Elder Scrolls 6. Work a Halo announcement in there from 343 and this could be a big show.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Game Fest 2025</a> kicked off last week with a State of Play broadcast from Sony, then springboarded on Friday with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-june-2025-everything-announced">the Opening Showcase</a>, which brought a ninth Resident Evil game, among other things. There was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wholesome-direct-2025-everything-announced-at-the-cosy-indie-showcase">the Wholesome Direct</a>, which we rounded up for you, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/day-of-the-devs-2025-everything-announced-in-the-big-indie-showcase">Day of the Devs</a>, which we rounded up too. Look for a Future Game Show roundup soon.</p>
<p>See you at 6pm?</p><figure>

We're getting a look at Asus' Xbox handheld now. It looks like a Switch 2 or a Steam Deck I suppose.

<p>
It can stream games, download and play games natively. It's got an Xbox button. Powered by AMD Ryzen.

Safe way to open the show. Remember, there's an Outer Worlds 2 direct after this. Obsidian is riding high after Avowed earlier this year, I'd say. That was a relatively unexpected success.

Now, if I were Microsoft, I'd start the show with a big bang to get our attention. Maybe I'd follow that up with another big bang and then dip it slightly, maybe introduce some talking heads, and then gradually build the momentum back up.

Hello hello! The Eurogamer team is assembling. I've got the Future Game Show on another screen - I've been trying to catch up. Some great announcements at the start and I was particularly excited to see a new game from Call of the Sea developer Out of the Blue, called Call of the Elder Gods. Looks like very much the same thing and I'm all here for it.

Hello and happy Sunday to everyone. We could be in for an exciting show later on. What are you hoping to see?
</p>
<p>
I wonder if there'll be any disruption to the show because of the protests taking place in downtown LA. The National Guard are expected to arrive there at some point. Chris Tapsell is there for us and says things are getting a bit weird. Fingers crossed he's okay.
