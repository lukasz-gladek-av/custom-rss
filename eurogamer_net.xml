Carrie Patel, who served as game director on this year's acclaimed fantasy action-RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a>, has confirmed her departure from Obsidian Entertainment after nearly 12 years with the studio and announced a new role at Netflix.
</p>
<p>
Patel, who was very much the face of Avowed throughout its development, shared the news in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carrie-patel-80003aa/">brief update on LinkedIn</a>, revealing she's now working within Netflix's gaming division, having joined Oxenfree developer Night School Studio as a game director.
</p>
<p>
She offered no further clue as to what she'll be working on at Night School in her update, but the Oxenfree and Afterparty studio has an impressive track record, despite its limited output since being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-acquires-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">acquired by Netflix in 2021</a>. It released Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals in 2023 but nothing else until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-new-netflix-black-mirror-series-has-another-bandersnatch-like-gaming-crossover-moment-but-you-might-not-even-notice-it">Black Mirror tie-in Thronglets</a> arrived earlier this year - a release that followed an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-culls-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">unspecified number of layoffs at Night School</a> in March.

<p>
Netflix's gaming strategy has taken some dramatic shifts in direction since the streaming service's first tentative steps back in 2021. After an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-halo-infinite-creative-head-joseph-staten-joins-netflix-games">initial focus on mobile titles</a>, it seemed ready to stride into the world of AAA console gaming in 2023, even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-acquires-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">hitting up longtime Halo creative lead Joseph Staten</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> executive producer Chacko Sonny, and God of War art director Rafael Grassetti to found a new development team.
</p>
<p>
However, Netflix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-closes-aaa-internal-studio-led-by-halo-creative-head-joseph-staten">quietly closed the studio late last year</a>, and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-games-boss-says-consoles-not-the-future-as-streamer-looks-to-phone-controlled-party-games">reportedly now focusing on</a> narrative and transmedia projects, on big mainstream IP, on being a destination for families, and on party games played on TVs using mobile phones as a controller. That does, of course, still leave room for Night Studio - and Patel - to continue making the kind of games it does best.
</p>
<p>
As for Avowed, prior to Patel's departure from Obsidian, she suggested it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-director-hints-at-a-future-for-the-franchise">wasn't a one-and-done effort</a>. "Now that we've built this wonderful world, and also built this team strength and muscle memory around the content and gameplay in this world," she explained, "I'd love to see us do more with it." Next up for Obsidian, though, is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2. It's due later this year, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-announces-june-showcase-event-reveals-game-getting-this-years-big-spotlight">special developer deep dive set to air on 8th June</a> following the Xbox Games Showcase.

            <p>
Worried the impending arrival of $80 games might price you out of your favourite hobby? Well if Borderlands 4 follows suit, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has suggested the community should just suck it up and deal with it. "If you're a real fan," he recently told a potential purchaser, "you'll find a way to make it happen."
</p>
<p>
Pitchford made the proclamation on social media after a <a href="https://x.com/oldgoldsot/status/1922412081023783167">Borderlands fan opined</a>, "Randy, [Borderlands 4] better not be $80. Don't take that risk, a lot of gamers aren't gonna pay $80 and feed this notion of constant increase of the price tag. You are the CEO, you have some say with the price when it comes to your publisher."
</p>
<p>
But Pitchford begged to differ. "Not my call," he <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1922454876803551555">insisted</a>, before dismissing pricing concerns. "If you're a real fan, you'll find a way to make it happen. My local game store had Starflight for Sega Genesis for $80 in 1991 when I was just out of high school working minimum wage at an ice cream parlour in Pismo Beach and I found a way to make it happen."
</p>
<p>
The response from Borderlands fans on social media was, unsurprisingly, swift, strong, and overwhelmingly negative. "Thanks, now I won't buy the Game even if it costs $70", one person <a href="https://x.com/NikTekOfficial/status/1924852589121687964">wrote</a>, while another <a href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1924850023625318758">added</a>, "That has to be one of the worst CEO replies from recent memory." Another <a href="https://x.com/RaistlinJustice/status/1924787599610122325">called</a> Pitchford's comment "elitist [and] out of touch"; "Rich person says just find the money," another <a href="https://x.com/Obey1Cannoli/status/1924818949494944151">wrote</a>, with plenty more using <a href="https://x.com/FergusMcburgs/status/1924823182374285777">considerably stronger language</a>.
</p>
<p>
Of course, none of this means Borderlands 4 <em>will</em> cost $80 dollars when it eventually arrives, but the industry certainly seems to be heading in that direction. Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">got the ball rolling earlier this year</a>, when it announced a $79.99 USD price tag for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, and Microsoft was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">quick to follow</a>, confirming some Xbox game prices would rise to $79.99 at the end of 2025 - presumably in time for this year's Call of Duty.
</p>
<p>
Notably, however, Borderlands 4 publisher Take-Two has relayed a more cautious approach to price increases, with CEO Strauss Zelnick recently reiterating the company's stance on variable, game-by-game pricing. While some analysts have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">speculated next year's GTA 6 might reach as much as $100</a>, one of the only confirmed prices on Take-Two's upcoming roster is Mafia: The Old Country, which costs $50. Borderlands 4 pricing details are yet to be shared.
</p>
<p>
But while customers might balk at the rising cost of games, former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rising-game-prices-would-happen-sooner-or-later-says-former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida">recently suggested the move was inevitable</a>. "I think it was going to happen sooner or later," he explained in the wake of Mario Kart World's price reveal, "maybe not from Nintendo, but it was going to happen eventually. We live in contrasting times, where inflation is real and significant, but people expect games that are ever more ambitious and therefore expensive to develop to cost the same. It's an impossible equation."
</p>
<p>
As for Borderlands 4, that's set to launch for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on 12th September after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-forward-perhaps-because-2k-knows-exactly-when-gta-6-is-coming-out">Take-Two announced it was bringing its release forward</a>.
