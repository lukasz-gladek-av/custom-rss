            <p>A sudden update for Armored Core 6 on Steam has spurred hopes among fans of the third-person mecha action game that something big is coming to The Game Awards next week.</p>
<p>The update, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1888160/history/">which can be seen on the game's SteamDB page</a>, shows a change to the application <em>has</em> happened. However, we can't see what has changed. It could be absolutely nothing, <em>or</em> it could be preparation for something substantial… In this murky realm of possibility, a flicker of hope has been lit.</p>
<p>"Babe wake up. Armored Core got another SteamDB update 1 week before the Game Awards," <a href="https://x.com/Etheox/status/1996259179225620778">posts user Etheox on X</a>. It is worth noting of course that Armored Core 6 has received several Steam page updates over this year and no DLC announcements.</p>

<p>The game, while successful, has been left largely alone since its release in 2023. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/armored-core-6-has-had-its-best-weapons-nerfed">It received an impactful nerf to some of its most powerful weapons</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/armored-core-6-now-has-1v1-and-3v3-ranked-online-matchmaking">ranked matchmaking support for both 1v1 and 3v3</a>. Aside from that, it's been left well enough alone, which is a shame! More Armored Core would be a wonderful thing.</p><p>It is worth noting that previous Armored Core games have recieved DLC packs in the past. Take <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/armored-core-5">Armored Core 5</a>, which was updated with the Modeler's Pack. This brought a vast number of new AC parts and weapons to the game. While big narrative updates aren't the norm with the series, FromSoftware has proven keen to create such content for its games in recent years. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-difficulty-harder-than-main-game-the-forsaken-hollows">Take Elden Ring: Nightreign's recent Forsaken Hollows DLC</a>, an injection of difficult content adding life to the multiplayer spinoff.
</p>
<p>Armored Core 6 was an outstanding game from FromSoftware. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review">In Eurogamer's review</a>, Caelyn Ellis wrote: "FromSoftware delivers a superlative action game that builds on its Soulslike pedigree while staying lean and laser-focused."</p>

            <p>Portal shooter Splitgate 2 will be making its return from beta later this month, and to mark this return developer 1047 Games has rebranded it with a new name.</p>
<p>The free-to-play Splitgate: Arena Reloaded will arrive across PC (via Steam, Epic Games Store and Windows), Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5 and PS4 on 17th December.</p>
<p>"After months of community feedback, testing and rebuilding the entire experience, this is Splitgate refocused on what made it special in the first place: classic arena combat without factions, abilities, or extra noise," the developer shared on Splitgate: Arena Reloaded's announcement, along with a new trailer you can see below.</p>

<p>1047 Games said Splitgate has "always been about the arena first", though the developer admitted it had somewhat missed the mark when it released Splitgate 2 earlier this year. As such, it has now taken elements from both the original Splitgate and its short-lived sequel, removed the bits that "didn't fit" and "refined" the ones that did.</p><p>"In the process, we not only rebuilt the game, we reconnected with the magic of the genre that built this studio in the first place. A Return to the Arena," the studio wrote, saying arena shooters are part of its DNA.</p>
<p>"Splitgate has always been a love letter to the classic shooters that sparked a lifelong passion for games for so many of us. They were fast, expressive, and skillful, and they brought people together around shared experiences.</p>
<p>"With Splitgate : Arena Reloaded, our goal is to bring that feeling forward for a new generation while keeping it fresh for the players who have been with us from the start."</p>
<p>You can check out the various changes coming to Splitgate: Arena Reloaded below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed Splitgate 2's factions, abilities, and select equipment so the focus is back on classic arena combat without the extra noise.</li>
<li>Rebuilt progression from the ground up so your time in game feels rewarding, with weapon and character cosmetics you can earn simply by playing.</li>
<li>We've added a true Classic Arena mode with even starts and new map pickups, recapturing the feel of the original.</li>
<li>Fine tuned combat to better match expectations for a modern arena shooter, with more meaningful gunfights and fewer "what just happened" moments.</li>
<li>Completely overhauled the ranked system so your rank reflects your actual skill for players who love to climb and compete.</li>
<li>Added key systems you have been asking for: Mode Select, Player Stats, Ranked Leaderboards, and Account Levels.</li>
<li>Introduced five brand new maps and six fully reworked arenas, bringing the total map pool to 20.</li>
<li>Added three new LMG primary weapons and the iconic Power Weapon, the Railgun.</li>
</ul>

<p>Closing, 1047 Games acknowledged that relaunches such as this one can be "met with scepticism", and it appreciates that. However, the studio is proud of what it has built with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded, and will be sharing more in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>"From everyone at 1047 Games, thank you for your feedback, your patience, and your passion over the last few months," it closed. "We hope to see you back in the arena on December 17."</p>

<p>Splitgate 2 was initially released earlier this year, but soon after the studio and its founder Ian Proulx admitted they had taken the game out of beta too soon. "We had ambitious goals with Splitgate 2, and in our excitement to share it with you, we bit off more than we could chew," a statement in July read. As such, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-fails-to-make-fps-great-again-goes-back-into-beta-resulting-in-layoffs-and-server-shutdowns">the shooter returned to beta</a>, and layoffs were made at 1047 Games.</p>

            <p>The full release of action role-playing game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> - otherwise known as the 1.0 release - has slipped further away again. The game is currently in early access, remember.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-path-of-exile-2-10-release-this-year-as-ddos-attacks-blamed-for-server-issues-and-huge-new-update-revealed">Grinding Gear Games had been targeting a potential March 2026 release for Path of Exile 2</a> - that's what game director Jonathan Rogers told me a few months ago. But in an interview conducted yesterday, Rogers told me he didn't think the studio would hit that date.</p>
<p>"I'm fairly confident that we won't be out of 2026," Rogers said, "but as I said, I never want to really completely promise anything. But I don't think it'll end up being March; we'll have to see."</p>
<p>His comments follow those made during a Path of Exile 2 presentation Q&amp;A shortly before we spoke, in which he said: "I don't have a specific timeline but I certainly wouldn't want to be any later than the end of next year. Obviously we're trying to get there as fast as we can, but I certainly wouldn't want to slip into 2027."</p>

<p>The obstacles to a Path of Exile 2 launch are threefold: the campaign, balance changes and endgame content. Path of Exile 2 currently has only four of six campaign-acts implemented, the most recent one - the fourth - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-path-of-exile-2-10-release-this-year-as-ddos-attacks-blamed-for-server-issues-and-huge-new-update-revealed">having been introduced in August</a>. These are big things, and even if we assume the two missing acts are ready to release in the game's next quarterly updates, presumably one after another, we're still potentially looking at one in spring 2026, and one in the summer, and they will both need testing time. Factoring that in, an autumn 2026 release at the earliest seems more reasonable.</p><p>That's assuming, of course, there are no balance changes or endgame changes that hold that up - both being areas Rogers wants "in a good place" before the game comes out. This is a constant pursuit for a game like Path of Exile 2, and balance changes have already interrupted the early access flow of content <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-fixes-incoming-following-criticism-of-dawn-of-the-hunt-updates-slow-pace">as Grinding Gear Games sought to address issues with the hunter class</a> it introduced back in April. This, then, is a potential risk any time the studio introduces a significant new element to the game, such as a player class, which it's just about to do again with the druid in the upcoming update, The Last of the Druids (0.5.0).</p>
<p>Alongside the new druid class, Grinding Gear Games will introduce a new world (league) for players to play in - something it does in every update. This upcoming league, The Fate of the Vaal, is themed around an ancient Vaal civilization and their lost, time-altering temple that's located somewhere underground. The cool thing is once you find it, you'll have to piece the dungeon together yourself, a bit like you do in the blueprint-adjusting puzzle game Blue Prince, although it's actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/loop-hero-review-round-and-round-the-garden">an indie game from 2021, Loop Hero</a>, the idea is inspired by, Rogers told me.</p>
<p>The autumn Path of Exile 2 update, which includes the new druid class, the new league, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-performance-boost">a significant performance boost for all platforms</a> but especially consoles, arrives 12th December.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-early-access-review">Path of Exile 2 launched into early access in December 2024</a>, so it's been out for about a year now. What was already a very impressive package back then has only grown since. This is, in my mind, the action RPG to beat.</p>
