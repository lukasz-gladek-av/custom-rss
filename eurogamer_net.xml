            <p>
A day after dropping jaws and making the recently anounced delay even tougher to bare, Rockstar has confirmed GTA 6's hugely impressive second trailer was a mix of "gameplay and cutscenes" captured "entirely in-game" on a PlayStation 5.
</p>
<p>
GTA 6's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-second-trailer-is-here">second trailer dropped earlier this week</a>, offering a closer look at its world - which includes the return of the Miami-inspired Vice City - and its sprawling cast of characters than we saw in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-will-release-on-xbox-series-xs-and-playstation-5-in-2025">2023's scene-setting first showing</a>. Rockstar subsequently released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-trailer-2-analysed">detailed character breakdowns</a> and dozens upon dozens of screenshots for eager fans to scrutinise still further.
</p>
<p>
Inevitably, plenty of chatter immediately ensued, some of it lauding the incredible amount of detail on display, some of it frantically sharing screen captures of Jason's rippling torso, and some of it casting doubt on the little note at the end of the trailer claiming it was all captured on PS5. At the very least, people speculated, Rockstar must have <em>surely</em> meant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>?

<p>
But the developer has now moved to quell any lingering doubts, suggesting that, yes, everything we saw in its most recent trailer was indeed generated by Sony's now nearly five-year-old console, and all of it was in-game. "Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 2 was captured entirely in-game from a PlayStation 5," the studio <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1920181314092765494">confirmed in a statement shared on social media</a>, "comprised of equal parts gameplay and cutscenes."
</p>
<p>
So there you go; let dazzlement and bewonderment be yours. The downside to all this excitement, of course, is that GTA 6 is still some considerable way off following its recent delay. Publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-doubles-down-on-gta-6-release-date-after-delay-rumours">previously</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">repeatedly</a> insisted GTA 6 would launch this autumn, but last week - after months of reports suggesting a delay was likely - Rockstar announced a new release date of 26th May next year, saying it needed "this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve."
</p>
<p>
And while its new release date leaves a big GTA-shaped hole in the 2025 release schedule, it does at least mean publishers previously unwilling to commit to launch dates for their own titles fearing GTA 6's dominance are likely now moving quickly to fill the void. Earlier this year, game execs <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-publishers-talk-challenges-of-gta-6-launch-in-new-report-we-dont-want-to-be-anywhere-near-that">bemoaned the "havoc" Grand Theft Auto 6's lack of a release date</a> was causing, with one saying, "We don't want to be anywhere near that."
</p>
<p>
With a full year still to go until GTA 6's arrival on Xbox Series X/S and PS5, it might be some time before Rockstar reveals more. But for those keeping track, here's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">everything we know so far</a>.

            <p>
13 years after the Louvre announced it was teaming up with Nintendo to create an audio tour of the world-renowned Parisian art museum guests could enjoy using 3DS handhelds, it's been revealed the service is coming to an end this September.
</p>
<p>
The Louvre <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/louvre-replaces-audio-guides-with-5000-3ds">unveiled the partnership in December 2011</a>, explaining it would be introducing 5,000 3DS machines equipped with custom software designed by Nintendo to replace the museum's stock of traditional audio guides.
</p>
<p>
Starting in 2012, visitors <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shigeru-miyamoto-demos-3ds-louvre-tour-guide">could roam the museum's halls with a 3DS in hand</a>, listening to audio commentary detailing the artwork they encountered along the way. A more elaborate version, known as Nintendo 3DS Guide: Louvre, was commissioned and introduced the following year, providing an expanded 30 hours of audio, plus new visual material including 3D views and photographs of the museum and its exhibits.

<p>
GPS transmitters installed within the museum enabled guests who'd rented 3DS machines equipped with the software to learn more about nearby artwork based on their current location. Nintendo also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-3ds-louvre-guide-released-on-eshop">released this version on the 3DS eShop</a>, providing purchasers with a way to explore the Louvre from the comfort of their own home. The company even went as far as to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Nintendo-3DS-Guide-Louvre/Nintendo-3DS-Guide-Louvre/1-One-day-the-Louvre/1-One-day-the-Louvre-836504.html">release an Iwata Asks Q&amp;A</a> and air a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WavLP_3ew-A">special Nintendo Direct</a> featuring <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> and  Satoru Iwata touring the Louvre and showing the 3DS guide software in action.
</p>
<p>
But now, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-3ds-officially-discontinued">3DS discontinued</a> and Nintendo's focus having long shifted to Switch and its imminent successor, the Louvre has announced the service's impending demise. "The New Nintendo 3DS console audio guides will go out of operation in September 2025," it revealed in a <a href="https://www.louvre.fr/en/visit/visitor-amenities">message on its website</a>, "to be replaced by a new system." It's unclear if the museum's partnership with Nintendo will continue in a different form - perhaps with Switch or the upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> - or if it plans to introduce something completely different.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">arrives in less than a month</a> on 5th June. And if you're wondering, it'll be approximately 16 times lighter than the Mona Lisa.
