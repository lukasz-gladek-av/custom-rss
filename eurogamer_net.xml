            <p>The first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> community event, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-update-opens-up-the-north-line-towards-new-stella-montis-map-in-massive-community-event">which asks players to contribute resources to unlock a new explorable area of the game</a>, has been made substantially harder mere hours after launch as the playerbase was completing it too quickly.</p>
<p>Community manager Ossen addressed the sudden change on the official Arc Raiders Discord server, writing: "You have been progressing the unlock event much faster than we anticipated. We had no idea all of you would be so altruistic for the Stella Montis cause, and you are donating so much more than we could imagine. We want this event to be experienced by Raiders all over the world and therefore we are raising the bar to unlock Stella Montis expecting you to surprise us again."</p>
<p>Eurogamer can confirm the change was substantial, seeing firsthand the progress bar had reached at least 8 percent completion this morning before it shot all the way back down to around 1 percent. So, you may have to wait a little longer to play on the new map: Stella Montis.</p>

<p>If you were wondering why the progress bar was completed so quickly, there are a few explanations. The first is the simplest: the game is incredibly popular and Embark didn't expect people to be so keen to throw resources at this event.</p><p>It could also be down to the resources required. The community event requires players to contribute basic resources, like fabric and plastic. These aren't hard resources to gather, in fact Nugget (the resource gathering chicken in your raider hideout) gathers them for free in large quantities. As such, dedicated players have accrued hundreds of these resources. Personally speaking, I had over 600 of each basic resource this morning, and was easily able to contribute plenty to the effort.</p>
<p>This all begs the question: when will the community event conclude? Well, it's safe to assume players will have at least a few days to log in and contribute to the community event. The rewards for doing so are a mystery right now, but if you contribute a relatively small amount you can earn merit points that'll be redeemable when the event concludes. So get to it!</p>
<p>If this sounds exciting to you, why not read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">Eurogamer's Arc Raiders review</a> to figure out if it's the game for you! In it, reviewer Rick Lane describes it as: "Rich PvE combat and an unusually friendly community make Arc Raiders a more approachable extraction shooter than most, but Embark Studios' continued use of AI voice generation is a black mark against its reputation."</p>
