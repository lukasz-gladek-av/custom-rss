            <p>Futuristic racer Fast Fusion will receive an update later this week, adding new tracks and a new rendering mode without upscaling.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-fast-fusion-most-technically-impressive-switch-2-launch-title">Digital Foundry reported</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> launch game actually renders at a low image resolution but uses the console's DLSS equivalent to upscale the image. Put simply, the game has been criticised for poor image quality, despite being such a fast game.</p>
<p>Now, developer Shin'en Games is introducing a new render mode called "Pure" that removes upscaling and instead renders at a native 1440p when docked (and 1080p in handheld).</p>

<p>What's more, a new Carbium Cup will be added, including three new tracks: Alpine Trust, Sunahara Plains, Zenshoh Habitat.</p>
<p>Players of previous game Fast RMX may recognise these tracks, though they have all-new graphics and changed layouts to make use of Fast Fusion's Hyperjump feature.</p>
<p>Further additions include: a new particle effect for snow, two new jukebox entries, a lower price to unlock the third cup for easier progression, fixed an issue where the game shut down when changing render mode, while stability and performance improvements have been implemented.</p>
<p>The update will arrive on 26th June.</p>

<p>Fast Fusion is one of the few brand-new launch games for Nintendo's new console. It's the follow up to Switch game Fast RMX, itself an improved version of Fast Racing Neo on Wii U.</p>
<p>Anyone who's a fan of the F-Zero or WipEout series will find much to enjoy here, with the game's high speed thrills, rollercoaster tracks, and techno soundtrack. Indeed, it's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/f-zero-gx-on-switch-2-is-virtually-unplayable-without-remapping-the-controls">modern day rival to F-Zero GX</a> - one of three GameCube games available on Switch 2 through Nintendo Switch Online.</p>
<p>"The Switch 2's best launch exclusive might not be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, but another racing game," wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-best-launch-exclusive-mario-kart-world-fast-fusion">Eurogamer's Tom Orry on Fast Fusion</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-launch-game-fast-fusion-gets-update-to-improve-image-quality]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Popular gaming peripheral manufacturer Dbrand has acknowledged a defect affecting a small number of its Project Killswitch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2?page=2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> cases.</p>
<p>This defect impacts the lip attaching the joycons to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> screen, disconnecting when the console is held up by a singular joycon. Speaking to influencer Nintendo Prime, the company has stated it's in the process of fixing the issue.</p>
<p>"Yep, we're definitely working on it. Ultimately, this is a manufacturing tolerance issue on the small lip keeping the Joy-Con Grips attached to the Joy-Cons (some were a hair too thick)," Dbrand told Nintendo Prime. "We've got a replacement program set up already, where anyone who is affected is able to email robots@dbrand.com with 'July Joy-Cons' in the subject to be added to the list for replacement stock in July."</p>

<p>According to Nintendo Prime, Dbrand also acknowledged this problem was replicable among a "small number of units from their run". Nintendo Prime didn't share the exact number he was told, but reemphasised any defective Killswitch cases could be replaced for free in July.</p>
<p>There are plenty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-accessories-deals-third-party-jsaux">great third-party accessories for the Nintendo Switch 2</a> - Dbrand's Killswitch included! These enhance the play experience on what is already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">a pretty rad console</a>.

            <p>"Major job cuts" are set for Xbox as part of a company-wide reorganisation.</p>
<p>That's according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/microsoft-plans-major-job-cuts-at-xbox-gaming-division">Bloomberg report</a>, which states these cuts will begin next week. While Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier said it is currently unclear how many people will be affected by the alleged job cuts, "it's expected to be big".</p>
<p>According to the report, sources famaliar with the company's plans said managers within Xbox are expecting "substantial cuts across the entire group".  </p>
<p>This would not be the first time Microsoft and Xbox have made headlines for layoffs in the last 18 months.
