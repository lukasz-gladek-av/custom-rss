            <p>Good news, ghost-hunting fans - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>'s genre-defining voice recognition feature is coming to consoles.</p>
<p>Although PC players have long been able to experience the horror game with the added stress of voice recognition, the October console release shipped initially without the feature.</p>

<p>Now, however, Kinetic said the feature is ready to go on both PS5 and Xbox consoles, enabling console players to try out the voice prompts for equipment like the Spirit Box and Ouija Board, as well as Monkey Paw.</p>
<p>The delay of some of Phasmo's fan-favourite equipment and tools hasn't put console players off, however - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-marks-22m-total-sales-with-its-2025-roadmap-and-changes-to-maps-kit-and-our-humble-journal">the ghost-hunting sim has sold two million copies on console</a> since it came out of early access last October, bringing the total sales across all platforms to 22 million.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-marks-22m-total-sales-with-its-2025-roadmap-and-changes-to-maps-kit-and-our-humble-journal">Phasmophobia outlined the road ahead for the spooky sim in 2025</a>, confirming map reworks, new ghost-hunting equipment, "thrilling seasonal events", and a brand-new location, too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>NetEase is reportedly pulling back on its international game investments.</p>
<p>The Chinese megacorp's backtrack commenced at the end of last year when it cut jobs and/or "paused" productions at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-will-pause-operations-at-fresh-aaa-game-studio-while-seeking-new-partner">Worlds Untold</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">Jar of Sparks</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">Liquid Sword</a>, but now <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netease-studio-cuts">Game File</a> reports the company is "actively shopping around more of its non-Chinese studios" in the hope of divestiture.</p>

<p>Sources talking to Game File under the promise of anonymity claim NetEase plans to divest itself of the majority of its overseas teams. If they can't secure a buyer, studios like Quantic Dream and Grasshopper Manufacture could face closure.</p>
<p>Other studios at risk include Anchor Point, GPTRACK50, Jackalyptic Games, Nagoshi, Pincool, Rebel Wolves, Skybox Labs, Studio Flare, T-Minus Zero Entertainment, and more.</p>
<p>NetEase declined to comment formally but told Game File: "All studios and projects are in constant review and evaluation, and NetEase will determine changes needed to be made throughout that process".</p>
<p>Earlier this week, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">cut jobs at its US-based Marvel Rivals creative team</a>, despite the game's significant success, claiming the decision was made to "optimise development efficiency". It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">insisted it "has not wavered in its global expansion plans"</a> amid reports it's unloading "as much as all" of its overseas game companies due to rising costs.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Matt reported that Marvel Rivals - which has been a huge success for publisher NetEase since its launch last year - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-was-reportedly-almost-cancelled-at-one-point-because-netease-objected-to-paying-disney">reportedly almost didn't make it to release</a> as its CEO objected to paying Disney for the use of its characters.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
