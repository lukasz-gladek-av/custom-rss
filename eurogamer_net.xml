            <p>
Activision has pulled the PC Game Pass version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-ww2">Call of Duty: WW2</a> offline while it investigates an unspecified "issue" some reports claim is a remote code execution exploit that's left some players grappling with app pop-ups, PC shut downs, and even screens full of pornography.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty: WW2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-games-list-this-month-price-6400">made its PC Game Pass debut at the end of June</a>, but the celebrations were short-lived. The shooter has now been taken offline, affecting both the Game Pass and the PC Microsoft Store release, but not those available elsewhere, including Steam and Battle.net.
</p>
<p>
As to why this has happened, Activision's <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1941286795565728085">official response</a> is vague, only saying the game was "brought offline while we investigate reports of an issue". However, there's evidence from the community that the newly released version of Call of Duty: WW2 may be vulnerable to remote code execution exploits, enabling an attacker to run malicious code on a player's PC.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty streamer Wrioh, for instance, posted to social media with claims of being "hacked". An <a href="https://x.com/wrioh75753/status/1940597447467979053">accompanying video</a> showed their gaming session being interrupted by a pop-up text window proclaiming to have "just RCE'd your ass", before it's revealed Wrioh's desktop wallpaper has been changed to an image of a <a href="https://labusinessjournal.com/advertorials/most-influential-intellectual-property-attorney-mm/">beaming lawyer</a>.
</p>
<p>
In <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1940639088576811516">another post</a>, the VX-Underground malware and cybersecurity research collective (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-ww2-pulled-from-pc-following-reports-of-remote-code-exploit-trolling-players-with-notepad-pop-ups-pc-shutdowns-and-desktop-wallpaper-of-a-lawyer/">PC Gamer</a>) shared additional images of a purported CoD: WW2 RCE attack, including an in-game error message featuring the phrase, "Your PC is now mine". In an accompanying message, VX-Underground referenced an "unpatched RCE exploit" and claimed, "Someone is trolling gamers with Notepad pop ups, PC shutdowns, and gay pornography."
</p>
<p>
VX-Underground member Smelly then <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1940889734269501446">provided an "educated guess"</a> as to what's happening in Wrioh's video. "The concern in this particular case," they summarised, "is that this means an attacker is capable of deploying information stealer malware, a RAT (remote administration tool), or ransomware. Thankfully, it appears this attacker is primarily interested in memeing and fucking with people." There's a little more technical detail in the full post.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty: WW2 for PC Game Pass and the Microsoft Store has now been offline since the weekend, with no sign of its imminent return and no update from Activision. While RCE vulnerabilities have been associated with numerous other games in recent years, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-patches-a-security-vulnerability-that-could-give-hackers-full-console-takeover">Nintendo's Mario Kart 8</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-fixes-cs-go-exploit-that-could-give-hackers-control-of-pcs">Valve's Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</a>, perhaps the most notable example is FromSoftware's Dark Souls series. It took over ten months for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-souls-remastered-finally-gets-its-online-features-back-on-pc">Dark Souls Remastered's online support to be restored</a> after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-souls-online-servers-are-down-following-reports-of-a-security-issue">being pulled in 2022</a>, so Call of Duty: WW2 fans will likely be hoping for a speedier resolution. We've asked Activision for comment.

            <p>If you have already played The Last of Us Part 2 on its initial PS4 release, plus again thanks to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-tech-analysis">souped-up PlayStation 5 Part 2 Remastered release</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-finally-gets-itself-a-pc-release-date">then once more on PC</a>, but still want to play through the game <em>yet again</em> but with another new twist, well now you can.</p>
<p>Developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> has today announced a free update for Part 2 Remastered across PS5 and PC, which will let you play through Ellie and Abby's stories chronologically. <strong>Please be aware of potential spoilers for The Last of Us Part 2 below. </strong></p>

<p>"Those who have already played will know its story is told non-linearly, as Ellie and Abby's motivations, realisations, and emotional stakes unfold across myriad flashbacks and present-day storylines," Naughty Dog wrote in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/introducing-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-chronological-experience-out-today/">blog post detailing this Part 2 update</a>.</p>
<p>"While this structure is very intentional and core to how our studio wanted Part 2's themes and narrative beats to impact players, we always wondered what it would be like to experience this story chronologically. And now finally, we can answer that question."</p>
<p>Naughty Dog hopes that replaying Part 2 with Ellie and Abby's stories more interwoven like this will give players a deeper understanding and insight into the game's narrative. It noted now, players will see Ellie receive her guitar from Joel and then her learning to play in a more fluid manner.</p>
<p>Then, when it comes to Seattle, players will see just how close Ellie and Abby actually come to crossing paths as they each make their way through the city on their own journeys of revenge and grief.</p>
<p>"It was no small feat to bring The Last of Us Part 2's story chronologically together, given that Part 2's story is so meticulously put together," Naughty Dog said, adding new trophies have also been added as part of this update for those who complete the game in chronological order.</p>
<p>In addition to base game tweaks, this update will also include two new skins for The Last of Us Part 2's roguelike mode No Return. In a Naughty Dog crossover, players who complete The Last of Us Part 2's narrative chronologically will be able to adorn Joel in Nathan Drake of Uncharted fame's garb. Tommy, meanwhile, has got himself a Sam Drake skin.</p>

<p>"We here at Naughty Dog are so grateful for all the love and support we've seen from The Last of Us fans these last few months," Naughty Dog closed. "From the launch of The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered on PC, to The Last of Us Complete on PlayStation 5, to seeing your weekly reactions to season two of the television series, it's been such a pleasure to celebrate this moment with you."</p>
<p>As for the TV series, The Last of Us season two wrapped earlier this year, with subsequent seasons still to conclude Part 2's narrative. Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation">Naughty Dog studio head Neil Druckmann announced he was stepping away from the adaptation</a>. Soon after, Halley Gross - who co-wrote The Last of Us Part 2 with Druckmann, before also working on the show - announced she was also taking a step back from the HBO series to focus on other projects.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/you-can-now-play-the-last-of-us-part-2-in-yet-another-way-as-naughty-dog-releases-chronological-mode]]></content:encoded>
