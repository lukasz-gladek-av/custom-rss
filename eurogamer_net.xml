<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> might still be lacking an early access release date beyond a vague "2025" window, but that hasn't stopped Unknown Worlds from cranking the hype handling a little harder, with the studio having now shared a few additional details as part of a new video Q&amp;A.
</p>
<p>
Last time around, Unknown Worlds offered a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-shows-off-first-in-game-footage-as-developer-charts-road-to-early-access">first, fleeting look at Subnautica 2 gameplay</a>, but for its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbvNYN76ArQ">latest video update</a>, creative producer Scott MacDonald and community manager Donya Abramo tackled a couple of burning fan questions. Admittedly, most of them ended with 'not yet', 'maybe at some point', and 'no', but there were still a couple of facts to glean.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the most notable tidbit came in form of confirmation that Subnautica 2 will ditch the controversially chatty protagonist of 2021's standalone expansion Below Zero and return to the silent protagonist approach of the first game, although that doesn't mean other characters won't be voiced. The decision accompanies the introduction of customisable characters, with players able to select from a handful of pre-designed protagonists before diving in. Unknown Worlds notes there'll potentially be some further "freedom to express yourself as your character", but whatever that means, it won't be util after early access launch.

<p>
As for the world of Subnautica 2, it's set on a brand-new ocean planet promising "all-new mysteries, creatures, and experiences", and Unknown Worlds says it's aiming for the game to be the "biggest and most exciting" series entry "ever" when it hits 1.0 in a few years time. It isn't, however, exactly sure "how big and how deep [players will] be able to go over the course of early access", but says the initial early access launch map will be more sizeable than those of the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> and Below Zero at a comparative time.
</p>
<p>
And a vast new underwater world to explore means vehicles. Unfortunately for fans of the Cyclops, Seamoth, and even the Sea Truck seen in earlier games, none of those are returning for the sequel. However, Unknown Worlds says new vehicles are coming - including a big sub scheduled to arrive later in early access - that'll be "designed in the same spirit [as their predecessors], just more suited to the brand-new environment they need to navigate". Additionally, "some of your favourite tools [will return], but improved", and base building is set to offer "more customisation than ever before".
</p>
<p>
What else? The studio stresses that, despite supporting co-op for up to four players, Subnautica 2 is being designed as a solo experience first. That means it should retain the sense of "isolation and terror" that made the original such a winner, although the studio readily admits it "won't really be able to protect" that atmosphere if players opt to bring friends along for the ride. Sadly, there's no local split-screen option for those wanting to cuddlefish up on the couch, but cross-play is supported between Xbox and PC platforms, and as for proximity chat, that's currently being 'investigated'. VR support isn't on the cards at present, however.
</p>
<p>
And all of that brings us back to the big question of a release date, but Unknown Words says it's "not quite ready to share one just yet". Nor is it talking platforms beyond PC and Xbox, only teasing Subnautica 2 will hit other machines "when the time is right". It is, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-gets-first-trailer-and-its-launching-into-early-access-next-year">still scheduled for a 2025 release</a>, and will be available as part of Game Pass on day one.

            <p>The not-E3 week is about to begin as Sony readies a PlayStation State of Play broadcast for 10pm UK time (11pm CEST / 2pm PT / 5pm ET) tonight. We'll cover the broadcast live right here, reporting the major talking points in case you're out walking the dog or stuck somewhere else, and you can also - hi regulars! - assemble in the comments to watch along and chat with us.</p>
<p>What do we expect to see? Sony hasn't said much. We know the broadcast will be an enigmatic "40+" minutes long, but Sony hasn't mentioned anything about content beyond "the show highlights a selection of great games from creators across the globe", which isn't very helpful. But it does leave us free to speculate.</p>
<p>Fairly safe bets include seeing gameplay for the October-bound samurai sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Y≈çtei</a>, as well as something from Kojima's baby-powered walking game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, although note that there will be a separate Death Stranding 2 showcase this Sunday, 8th June.</p>
<p>We're hopeful of seeing more of the Wolverine game made by Spider-Man dev Insomniac, we've seen some rumours swirling about a possible 2.5D God of War game, and there are the perennial calls for a remake of Bloodborne. Will our dreams finally come true?</p>
<p>Also, Donlan would like a new Ape Escape game. Thanks.</p>
<p>Summer Games Fest gets into full swing as we approach the weekend. The opening broadcast will happen on Friday night and there's a busy weekend of shows to follow. Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Games Fest 2025 hub</a> has all the times and dates you'll need.</p><figure>

            <p>Epic Games has confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is upgraded on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> to include 60FPS support, higher resolution graphics, greater view distances and more. This will be available from tomorow, 5th June - the same day the Switch 2 launches.</p>
<p>This comes via a fresh news post <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-comes-to-nintendo-switch-2">on the Fortnite website</a>, which lists out all the improvements coming to the game for those able to get their hands on the shiny new console. The full list can be found below:</p>

<p>Using the mouse controls, the standard analogue stick will be disabled as players use both joycons to play the game and navigate the UI. Players will be able to choose in the settings whether or not they prefer to use the left, right, or both Joycons to play via dedicated control schemes.</p>
<p>For those who log on to Fortnite on the Nintendo Switch 2 before 31st March, 2026, a free emote will be their prize. This Wishing Star emote is exclusive to Switch 2 players for now, though Epic does note that the emote may be sold in the store following the March 2026 cutoff.</p>
<p>Epic also confirms in a FAQ that the Nintendo Switch pro controller will be usable when playing Fortnite on the Switch 2, and those who already linked their Epic and Nintendo accounts will not have to redo the process on the new console.</p>
<p>As a final note, the Save The World game within Fortnite is the only unavailable experience on the Switch 2 version, everything else is playable. Save The World, for those unaware, is the PvE Co-Op building game that first came out in Early Access in 2017,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-save-the-world-mode-will-no-longer-go-free-to-play-this-year"> before getting a full release in 2020</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
