Unknown Worlds has shared a first in-game look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>, as part of a new developer video charting the highly anticipated underwater survival sequel's "road to early access".
</p>
<p>
Subnautica 2 (actually the third game in the acclaimed series, following 2021's standalone <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> expansion Below Zero) was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-new-subnautica-game-is-in-early-development">confirmed to be in the works</a> all the way back in 2022. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-gets-first-trailer-and-its-launching-into-early-access-next-year">first trailer finally arrived last October</a>, but it was purely a scene-setting cinematic - tipping a nod to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-responds-to-publisher-claims-its-a-multiplayer-live-service-game">sequel's new co-op mode</a> - rather than offering any actual gameplay.
</p>
<p>
Skip ahead seven months, and we've now been given a first glimpse of how Subnautica 2 looks in-game. Unknown Worlds shared the early footage as part of its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8oqrucfXQo">Road to Early Access developer video</a>, in which Subnautica 2 design lead Anthony Gallegos offered a small taste of things to come across the update's brief runtime.

During his chatter, we got a tease of some new environments - including what appears to be the Subnautica 2 equivalent of the first game's Safe Shallows (the sequel is set on a brand-new world) and a bioluminescent underground area - plus a few new aquatic creatures. There's a second or two of a strange waddling thing with a fan-like tail, for instance, and a large fish headbutting rocks. We also got a peek at co-operative swimming and base building.
</p>
<p>
It's not a lot to go on, admittedly, and the studio still hasn't announced an early access release date. All we know right now is it's due to launch "later" this year for Xbox Series X/S and PC (via Steam and Epic), and it's coming to Game Pass too.
</p>
<p>
Previously, Unknown Worlds said it expected Subnautica 2 to launch into early access with its co-op multiplayer mode, "several biomes, some narrative, and a variety of creatures and craftables". There's plenty of time for things to evolve from there, too, given the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-launching-with-multiplayer-and-several-biomes-but-early-access-will-last-2-to-3-years">studio is anticipating</a> early access will last "about two to three years."

Control fans eager to return to the depth of the Oldest House won't have long to wait. Remedy Entertainment has confirmed its three-player PvE Control spin-off, FBC: Firebreak, releases for PC and consoles on 17th June, with talk of plenty of post-launch support to come.
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-control-developer-remedy-reveals-first-ever-multiplayer-game">unveiled last October</a>, promising a co-operative take on the Control universe in which players, cast as members of the Federal Bureau of Control's Firebreak response unit, must keep the Oldest House's numerous paranatural anomalies - from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-spin-off-fbc-firebreaks-latest-trailer-brings-extradimensional-furnaces-and-exploding-pink-goo">weird pink goo</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-multiplayer-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-asks-the-question-what-happens-when-the-offices-post-it-notes-fight-back">sentient Post-It notes</a> - in check. Each Job takes players to different corners of the ever-changing building - some familiar and some new - and features different mechanics, enemies, objectives, and even status-effect-style conditions.
</p>
<p>
Remedy offered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s2x2a35wP8">another look at FBC: Firebreak in its latest developer livestream</a> earlier today, sharing details about the game's battle-pass-style progression system, Requisitions. These come in two flavours: standard Requisitions, which are free to all players, and premium Classified Requisitions, which must be purchased with real money.

<p>
Standard Requisitions contain weapons, armour, and equipment that can be unlocked using in-game currency earned through play, while items in Classified Requisitions are cosmetic only with no gameplay benefits. Notably, there's no expiration date on Requisitions, meaning players can unlock items in their own time. In addition to Requisitions, Remedy has outlined its post-launch content plans, confirming it intends to release at least new Jobs in 2025, with more coming next year. These will be free to all players.
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak launches for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272540/FBC_Firebreak/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/fbc-firebreak-fc3830">Epic</a>) on 17th June. The standard edition costs £32.99/€39.99/$39.99 USD, and it'll also be available on day one via PC Game Pass, Game Pass Ultimate, and PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium.
</p>
<p>
Those looking for something a bit fancier can pick up FBC: Firebreak's Deluxe Edition which costs £39.99/€49.99/$49.99 USD and throws in a variety of premium cosmetics. These include the Firestarter and Pencil Pusher premium voice packs, the Golden Firebreak spray, the Firestarter armour set, the Scorched Remnant double-barrel shotgun skin, plus the premium Firestarter Classified Requisition, which features 36 unlockable cosmetics. Remedy notes standard edition owners can upgrade to the Deluxe version for £7/€10/$10.
