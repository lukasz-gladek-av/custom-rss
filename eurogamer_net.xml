            <p>Bethesda has hidden a secret message in a social media post ostensibly marking <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>'s second anniversary.</p>
<p>It's only 12 seconds long, and starts pretty much as you'd expect, but halfway through the <a href="https://x.com/StarfieldGame/status/1963980745728229522">video teaser</a>, the music and visuals are interrupted, the black/blue palette is replaced by yellow and brown, and we see snippets of black text and a secret message.</p>

<p>Thanks to some keen-eyed Starfield fans, somebody's already pieced together the clues and shared that message with us: "Terran Armada".</p>
<p>While we don't yet know what Terran Armada is, let alone when it'll release, fans are positing it's possibly the name of the next DLC or expansion, and are already sharing on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1n99blb/dlc2_is_titled_terran_armada/">Starfield subreddit</a> what's top of their wishlist.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="740"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1n99blb/dlc2_is_titled_terran_armada/">DLC2 is titled "Terran Armada".</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sklain/">u/Sklain</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/">Starfield</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>"Yeah, this is interesting because 'Terran' when used in the correct context can only mean 'of Terra' or 'from earth'," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1n99blb/comment/nckva3j/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">suggested</a> one player. "Looks like our planet might be more than it seems in Starfeild. With the rumors of a Starborn DLC or update I wonder if a bunch of Starborn resettled the earth in secret or something?"</p>
<p>"I'm just happy to have something to speculate and theorize on again since that has been one of the most fun parts of gaming releases since [I] was a kid," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1n99blb/comment/ncl7fiz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> someone else.</p>
<p>Hopefully, Bethesda won't leave us hanging for long and will confirm what's coming sooner rather than later â€“ we'll keep you posted.</p>
<p>Last month, Bethesda teased an upcoming update for Starfield would improve space travel following a datamine that discovered hints of an overhauled "cruise mode". After a hasty patch removed hints of the cruise mode from the files, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-teases-starfield-space-travel-update-after-datamined-leak">Bethesda has since come forward with its hands up and admitted that yes, cruise mode is real</a> and is on the way somewhat soon.</p>

            <p>Square Enix director Tetsuya Nomura still doesn't have any specific <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-hearts-4">Kingdom Hearts 4</a> news for us just yet, but he wants you to know that the teams are making "great progress" on both the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> sequel and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> Part 3.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-look-at-kingdom-hearts-4-in-three-years-suggests-mickey-mouse-is-playable">Other than a sneak peek back in May</a>, we haven't seen or heard anything since Kingdom Hearts 4 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-4-is-officially-on-the-way">shown back in 2022 for the series' 20th anniversary</a>, which is likely why Nomura joked in a recent livestream about seeing "a lot of comments" from fans eager to know more about the game.</p>

<p>"I'm seeing a lot of comments asking about Kingdom Hearts 4," Nomura said, as translated by <a href="https://x.com/aitaikimochi/status/1963954361362419884">Aitaikimochi</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/kingdom-hearts-4-final-fantasy-7-ever-crisis-tetsuya-nomura-update/">TheGamer</a>). "We are making great strides and going according to schedule. So please wait for more information on that!"</p>
<p>Admittedly, that doesn't give us much to go on, but it should be a relief to fans to know everything is "going according to schedule". And as for Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3?</p>
<p>"[Motomu] Toriyama supposedly said we will have news around the time of the second anniversary of FF7EC," he added. "We are making great progress on the game! And I can't say anything else. I'm not gonna be like, 'Well, actuallyâ€¦' If I did, people would be really surprised if it's during this FF7EC livestream.</p><p>"But we are indeed making a lot of progress with the game. We already have decided when we will make the announcement as well, and we will stick to that time schedule. So don't worry, but please wait for it."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> finally released fresh screenshots of Kingdom Hearts 4 back in May, giving us our first look at the game in three years. Before then, the last time the game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-4-is-officially-on-the-way">shown was back in 2022 for the series' 20th anniversary</a>, in which we were treated to Sora's return and the expansive metropolis of Quadratum.</p>
<p>The day before those new screenshots, Square Enix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-cancelled-but-kingdom-hearts-4-still-on-the-way">cancelled mobile game Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link</a>.</p>

            <p>Epic Games has sped up repercussions for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> players who used V-Bucks and refunded them through an exploit on Xbox, essentially getting the in-game currency for free.</p>
<p>As we moved into the weekend, the studio <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1964118061763432684">said</a> it had now "fixed a delay" and would be claiming back any items that were bought through currency that had been refunded on Xbox or previously gifted from fraudulent accounts.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the system it uses to revoke items on Xbox between December 2024 and July 2025 "malfunctioned", the company <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1964011363363107319">warned</a> some players "may now see a message that their payment was reversed or refunded and see recent items have been removed, even from transactions from several months ago".</p>

<p>It comes after some Xbox players abused an exploit through which they could buy V-Bucks through Microsoft, apply them to their accounts, and then refund them.</p>
<p>After clarifying this "does not affect regular purchases on Xbox or any other platform that weren't refunded", the Fortnite Status X/Twitter account added:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Update on Xbox refund issue:</p><p>Ordinarily, when a player receives a refund of a real-money Fortnite purchase, the purchased items are removed from their account.

</p></div>
<p>"Ordinarily, when a player receives a refund of a real-money Fortnite purchase, the purchased items are removed from their account," Epic explained. "When V-Bucks are purchased, spent, and refunded, causing the playerâ€™s V-Bucks balance to go negative, items most recently purchased and gifted with the refunded V-Bucks are removed from the playerâ€™s account and the gift recipient's account.</p><p>"Unfortunately, the system we built for this malfunctioned on Xbox between December 2024 and July 2025. During this time, players were receiving refunds, but the refunded V-Bucks and items purchased with refunded V-Bucks remained in the playerâ€™s account and gift recipient accounts."</p>
<p>While Epic accepts that over this period most players "continued using purchasing and refunding in good faith as usual", some "exploited the situation to make large numbers of purchases, often with many accounts. Some even set up shops to accept payments from players and gifted them items purchased with refunded V-Bucks".</p>
<p>It's taken so long to sort the issue, however, that when Epic began processing back-dated refund requests on Xbox on 4th September and confusing players, it's now "making a correction to distinguish between accounts that made ordinary refund requests, and accounts exploiting the refund system".</p>
<p>"We're restoring the items that were removed earlier this week for players who made less than 7 refunds since Dec 2024. It was our fault that we didn't update the V-Bucks balance in their account immediately as we should have. This will take a few days," Epic conceded.</p><p>"The removed items will stay removed for anyone who received 7 or more refunds, and for items received through gifting from players who made 7 or more refunds during this time. This is the ordinary approach to refunds from our terms of service, and these item purchases were taking advantage of an exploit with the V-Bucks refund system."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-return-to-ios-in-the-uk-uncertain-as-epic-accuses-uk-regulator-of-deprioritising-store-competition">Epic Games recently claimed the return of Fortnite to iOS in the UK is "uncertain"</a> as it's been unable to bring the Epic Games Store to iOS this year, "if ever", after the CMA â€“ the UK's competition regulator â€“  has "deprioritised store competition entirely", following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">lengthy legal battle between Epic and Apple</a>.</p>
