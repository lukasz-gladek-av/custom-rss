            <p>Publisher Nacon and developer Rogue Factor have announced demos across both PC and consoles for upcoming slasher Hell is Us.</p>
<p>Hell is Us - which stars <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atmospheric-slasher-hell-is-us-lands-september-release-date-as-well-deus-exs-elias-toufexis">Elias Toufexis, aka Adam Jensen from the Deus Ex series, as the game's protagonist RÃ©mi</a> - is set to release later this year, on 4th September. Ahead of this, the team is releasing a demo across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>The demo will be available on 12th August. So, that's just under one week's time.</p>

Not sure yet what Hell is Us is all about? "If war is the closest we get to hell on earth, it's because Earth harbours the worst of demons: humankind," reads the official blurb. "In an isolated country ravaged by infighting, discover the secrets of your past and deal with the repercussions of a mysterious calamity."

</p><p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sci-fi-action-rpg-hell-is-us-gets-pc-demo-out-today-on-steam">Hell is Us team previously released a demo on PC</a>, which plopped players into the start of the game. At this time, the studio said the demo wasn't going to be available on consoles due to "technical constraints". Those constraints have clearly been resolved for next week's demo.</p>
<p>As for what you can expect from the upcoming demo, it <em>sounds</em> like it will be the same as the earlier PC demo. In a <a href="https://x.com/HellisUsGame/status/1952756941345747256">post on social media</a>, the studio said: "Oh yes, PC is coming back too!" I have emailed Nacon to ask for clarification on what the demo will include.</p>
<p>The team has promised, though, that this version of the demo on PC will be "even better" than the one that came before. "4k can actually run at 60fps now," the Hell is Us studio said. "Isn't that great? We got you."</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/HellisUsGame/status/1952848364900692225">subsequent reply</a>, Rogue Factor confirmed that PS5 will also support 60fps.</p>

<p>Our Lottie had a little shot with Hell is Us last year.</p>
<p>"The narrative already has me hooked - the human story of a country drowned in war, its people barely surviving, running alongside a supernatural mystery of unknown horrors emerging from the dark - while combat mechanics show excellent promise for when Hell is Us is released," she wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atmospheric-slasher-hell-is-us-abandons-maps-and-quest-markers-and-channels-brilliant-immersion-in-return">Eurogamer's Hell is Us Gamescom preview</a>.</p>
<p>Will you be giving the demo a go later this month?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/atmospheric-slasher-hell-is-us-is-getting-a-demo-on-xbox-playstation-and-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The team behind open-world adventure RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> is ending support for those on PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>Developer HoYoverse has said it made this decision because of "limitations related to hardware performance and platform application size".</p>

<p>The PS4 version of Genshin Impact will be removed from the PlayStation Store later this year, on 10th September. Then, on 25th February next year, all of the in-game purchases will be removed from both the PlayStation Store and the in-game shop.</p>
<p>"Before Genshin Impact's update discontinuation on PS4, any items purchased from the PlayStation Store but not yet claimed in-game can still be obtained by logging into Genshin Impact on PS4," the team assured.</p>
<p>Service for those playing Genshin Impact on PS4 will then officially end on 8th April, 2026. "Any items purchased from the PlayStation Store but not yet claimed in-game can only be claimed by logging into Genshin Impact on PS5 after this date," the developer said.</p>
<p>HoYoverse noted that those on PS5 will not be impacted by these changes, and the game will "continue to operate normally" on the console, as well as other available platforms. It has advised anyone playing on PS4 to transition over to either PlayStation 5 or other supported platforms. "Your game progress will not be affected," it said.</p>
