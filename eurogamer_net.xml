            <p>Pokémon developer Game Freak has suffered another huge leak of data, revealing the studio's purported planned projects until 2030.</p>
<p>The leak comes a year to the day after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-developer-game-freak-reels-from-unprecedented-gigaleak-of-significant-internal-data">"teraleak" of "significant internal data" that revealed unannounced Pokémon games</a>. Game Freak later acknowledged it was hacked, admitting personal employee information had been obtained. Then, in April this year, Nintendo filed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-lawyers-want-to-force-discord-to-reveal-pokemon-teraleak-source">request to subpoena Discord</a> for the hacker's identity.</p>
<p>This new leak, revealing alleged future projects and concept art from new and old games alike, arrives mere days before the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, amid suggestions the same hacker was holding back this information.</p>

<p>The budget for Pokémon Legends: Z-A was reportedly just 2bn yen (around $13m). Typically, Japanese game development budgets are smaller than those we see in the West (for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to lower staff salaries), but this still feels like a very small amount for what is considered one of Nintendo's most significant series. What's more, as recent Pokémon games on Switch have suffered from poor performance, there's concern among the fanbase of a lack of investment to ensure future games run more smoothly.</p><p>Across the internet, there's notable commentary on this aspect of the leak, specifically. The <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1o5wqxi/massive_pokemon_leak_purportedly_covers_nextgen/njcd9ef/">top comment</a> on a reddit thread discussing the leaks simply jokes that the whole leak is "just a Post-It note that says, 'even lower budget for next game'." <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1o5wqxi/massive_pokemon_leak_purportedly_covers_nextgen/njcg4mv/">Another comment</a> reflects: "A lot of people are going to complain about the money budget and not enough people will complain about the time budget of these games." Another poster notes: "The only leak I would care about is that they suddenly get a better engine, and actually treat Pokemon as a modern game with a high budget."</p>
<p>Within the leak itself, details have been shared purportedly covering the next four games planned until 2030.</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler warning!</strong></p>
<p>The first of these is the next mainline game, the tenth generation, which reportedly has the codename Gaia and will be known as Pokémon Wind and Waves. It's seemingly set for release next year, followed by DLC in 2027, and will be set in Southeast Asia. Leaked screenshots of concept art show open, jungle areas, while budget-wise it's reportedly costing 3bn yen - another surprisingly small budget, but hitting roughly $20m, this time, a marked bump over Z-A's $13m (probably thanks to a series of planned improvements, such as a new engine, which commenters hope will improve performance on console hardware).</p>
<p>This will reportedly be followed by another Legends game, to be set in the Galar region of Sword and Shield - with the fitting codename of Ringo.</p>
<p>Then there's project Seed, which will reportedly combine multiple regions from past games. Lastly, the eleventh generation is reportedly aiming for a 2030 release.</p>
<p>Of course, it's worth questioning the validity of this information. Even if the reported details are true, the documents could well be outdated and plans may have changed since. There's also plenty of fan speculation wrapped up around the details.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted The Pokémon Company and Nintendo for comment on the validity of the leaks.</p>
<p>The news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-pokemon-legends-z-a-spoilers-are-out-in-the-wild-ahead-of-its-release-this-week">follows leaks of Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> ahead of its release this Thursday, 16th October. Copies of the game are already out in the wild, are being streamed on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, and illegal ROMs are already available, meaning spoilers are abundant.</p>

            <p>Digital Extremes has announced that its upcoming action MMORPG Soulframe will be receiving a founders pack that eager fans can purchase for exclusive items, gear, and a way to make a "permanent mark" on the game.</p>
<p>Announced during the recent Soulframe Devstream 11, the team dove into the latest updates for the nature-themed fantasy game in detail for its keen audience. What these rewards are remains largely a mystery, though we know they'll be themed around the first Envoys (names for play characters): Galene, Pothia, and Josalfar. More information is set to come in the future, but for now the price point and what these items will look like remain a mystery. Though, <a href="https://www.soulframe.com/en/founders">the illustration on the Soulframe website could be a pretty good clue</a>.</p>
<p>Digital Extremes also announced that Founders Pack owners would be able to invite a number of their friends to Soulframe: Preludes (Digital Extreme's version of an early beta version of the game). Earlier this year, the company opened the floodgates to any pending or new applications to join these preludes as part of its annual event: Tennocon.</p>

<p>Let's break down the Founders pack. So the "permanent mark" is the initial eyebrow raiser, and could be a callback to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a> Founders pack and a particularly cool perk it had. Warframe, Digital Extreme's first MMO, had Founders in-game names attached to specific missions, so players could hover over and see a list of Founders when they were looking around the star map (A sort of mission select). These days, the Founders names are found across the various Relays (player hubs), but nonetheless it's a permanent mark that went down well.</p><p>However, with that Warframe Founders pack came with Excalibur prime, Skana Prime, and Lato Prime. These are suped-up versions of pre-existing frames (playable characters) and weapons, and remain extremely cool pieces of gear that will likely never return to the game, especially given they mark a player who helped Digital Extremes out at their lowest point. However, these items also contribute to your account's mastery rank, a measure of player prestige, which has left some feeling a little sour over the years.</p>
<p>It's as such very unlikely that these Soulframe Founders items will contribute to your Soulframe account's Master level, given this continuous frustration from a portion of the fans. However, this hasn't been stated outright as of writing. An account's Master level in Soulframe provides Virtue points, which can basically be used to increase your ability damage, range, and duration. Though, it's worth noting some weapons scale with Master rank.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Digital Extremes to ask whether these Founders items will contribute to a Soulframe account's Master Rank, and received the following response courtesy of PR: "We’ll have more info to share on Soulframe Founders in the coming weeks".</p>
<p>Also announced in the Soulframe devstream was a small narrative addition to the Waste Bear Fable, a main quest of sorts currently playable in Soulframe: Preludes. In addition, a new interaction with the Witch Vermina will explore the colours of the world, unlocking the dye system for gear customisation.</p>
