            <p>
Sega and Sports Interactive have scrapped Football Manager 25, and will now refocus on getting ready for the series' next release.
</p>
<p>
The announcement this morning, made as part of Sega's latest financial results, is a surprise move for the annual sporting franchise. But it follows repeated delays for FM25 - which had been billed as the biggest leap forward for the series in a generation.
</p>
<p>
Previous setbacks saw FM25 delayed twice, with its most recent postponement meaning it was set to arrive at an awkward moment, mid-football season. It would also have meant Sports Interactive needing to sell two entries in the series - FM25 and the expected FM26 - within the same calendar year. 
</p>
<p>
Now, FM25 is no more - something Sports Interactive has today issued an apology for, and said that anyone who had pre-ordered the game would now be automatically refunded. 
</p>
<p>
"For the large numbers of you who pre-ordered FM25, we thank you enormously for your trust and support – we're very sorry to have let you down," a <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-1">statement</a> from Sports Interactive reads. 
</p>
<p>
"We know this will come as a huge disappointment, especially given that the release date has already moved twice, and you have been eagerly anticipating the first gameplay reveal."
</p>
<p>
As previously announced, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/football-manager-24-cannot-be-updated-with-new-season-assets-says-sports-interactive">there will be no update to the series' most recent entry, FM24, with fresh player data</a>. This would be a "substantial undertaking" that would "divert critical resources away from the development of the next release which requires our full focus", Sports Interactive said today, and the cancellation of FM25 has not changed this.
</p>
<p>
Sports Interactive had previously said it would update fans in January 2025 - a deadline it says it was forced to miss by a week due to compliance with Sega being a publicly traded company.
</p>
<p>
"We can only apologise for the time it has taken to communicate this decision. Due to stakeholder compliance, including legal and financial regulations, today was the earliest date that we could issue this statement."
</p>
<p>
Sports Interactive blamed the decision on "a variety of challenges that we've been open about to date, and many more unforeseen".
</p>
<p>
"As we approached critical milestones at the turn of the year, it became unmistakably clear that we would not achieve the standard required, even with the adjusted timeline," the statement continues.
</p>
<p>
"Whilst many areas of the game have hit our targets, the overarching player experience and interface is not where we need it to be. As extensive evaluation has demonstrated, including consumer playtesting, we have clear validation for the new direction of the game and are getting close – however, we're too far away from the standards you deserve.
</p>
<p>
"We could have pressed on, released FM25 in its current state, and fixed things down the line - but that's not the right thing to do. We were also unwilling to go beyond a March release as it would be too late in the football season to expect players to then buy another game later in the year.
</p>
<p>
"Through the cancellation, every effort is now focused on ensuring that our next release achieves our goal and hits the quality level we all expect. We will update you on how we are progressing with that as soon as we are able to do so.
</p>
<p>
"Thank you for reading, your patience and your continued support. Our full focus now returns to creating a new era for Football Manager."
</p>
<p>
Last year, Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell sat down with Sports Interactive boss Miles Jacobson for an in-depth chat on the studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fm25-is-not-a-continuation-of-fm24-the-big-football-manager-interview">plans for the future of the Football Manager franchise</a>, and to hear why "FM25 is not a continuation of FM24". The chat covers discussion on the state of Game Pass, AI and the Premier League - plus detail on why some past Football Manager features had to go.

            <p>
Switch 2 might have been officially revealed, but there's still a whole lot we don't know about it. And while Nintendo is staying stubbornly tightlipped until April, a newly surfaced patent appears to confirm at least a few previously reported details the company has so far only teased.
</p>
<p>
Mostly, we're talking Joy-Cons here, with early reports having claimed Switch 2's detachable controllers would include a few new tricks not seen in those of the original console. That starts with magnets, with Switch 2's Joy-Cons have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-report-details-magnetic-joy-con">long been rumoured to use magnets</a> to attach to the console instead of the finicky rails system used previously.
</p>
<p>
Which brings us to Nintendo's <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025027801&amp;_cid=P22-M6TRNW-94344-1">newly unearthed game controller patent</a>, initially filed in August 2023 and published today. "This game controller is detachably mounted to a body device that has a recess," it reads, "that comprises a first magnet and a second magnet at the bottom of the recess, and that can execute game processing."
</p>
<figure><div>

<p>
Furthermore, the patent gives some additional insight into how the magnets have been implemented to avoid randomly dropping off at inconvenient intervals. "The first button and the second button are provided in the longitudinal direction in the top surface of the protrusion," Nintendo writes. "The first button and the second button are to be pressed by a user. The first button is attracted to the first magnet by a magnetic force. The second button is attracted to the second magnet by a magnetic force."
</p>
<p>
Admittedly, the inclusion of magnets isn't much of a revelation - Switch 2's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">reveal trailer</a> already suggested as much - but Nintendo hasn't actually made it official. And it's a similar story for built-in Joy-Con mouse functionality, another rumoured feature for Switch 2. January's reveal trailer certainly lent credence to those earlier reports, what with it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-trailer-appears-to-confirm-joy-con-mouse-functionality">including a controller sliding suspiciously around on its side</a>, but, again, it's a feature not yet made official.
</p>
<p>
Back over in the patent, however, and Nintendo has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lhjtpx27ja2b">included a diagram</a> of a right Joy-Con being used just like a mouse. Its detachable edge is face down on a surface while the user grips it mouse-style, one finger on the bumper - presumably for clicking input - and a thumb on the control stick. Other illustrations show a user dual-wielding two Joy-Cons mouse-style, like some sort of mouse-using ninja, while another shows a Joy-Con being deployed mouse-like in one hand and in standard formation in the other. Flexibility is apparently key.
</p>
<p>
It is, if nothing else, an interesting reminder that's there's still so much to learn about Nintendo's new console following a reveal that was light on just about everything. Beyond, that is, a general glimpse of Switch 2's Switch-but-more-so aesthetic, and a new Mario Kart that's managed to illicit chatter as wide ranging as 'Could this possibly be open world?!' right through to 'What on earth have they done to Donkey Kong?!'.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, no solid answers to the many questions we have about Switch 2 will likely come until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">April's Nintendo Direct</a> - which will hopefully finally include the Captain Rainbow revival we've all been waiting for. Until then, feel free to direct your gaze elsewhere on Eurogamer for a refresher of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">everything we currently know about Switch 2</a>. You can probably add 'almost definitely magnets' and 'mouse, eh?' to that list now too.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> has now sold a staggering 210m copies, publisher Take-Two announced this evening in its latest financial results. 
</p>
<p>
The new total means Rockstar's wildly-successful game has shifted another 5m copies over the last three months of 2024, up until 31st December. 
</p>
<p>
There's a fresh lifetime total for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, also. It now stands at 70m copies sold, up three million units on last quarter - which would be jaw-droppingly impressive in comparison to pretty much any other game out there, other than GTA 5.
</p>
<p>
New content is still being pumped out for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a>, such as December 2024's Agents of Sabotage update, and the multiplayer portion of Rockstar's aging game continues to be one of Take-Two's biggest earners. 
</p>
<p>
This year will see GTA 5 mark its 12th anniversary on sale (it originally launched in September 2013 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360). Red Dead Redemption 2, meanwhile, will turn seven in October.
</p>
<p>
It's around then that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">Take-Two has said GTA 6 will finally arrive</a> - during its launch window which has now been re-confirmed for sometime this autumn. 
</p>
<p>
"There's always a risk of slippage and I think as soon as you say words like absolutely, you jinx things," Take-Two boss <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">Strauss Zelnick told IGN</a> this evening, when asked about the likelihood of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> not making its current launch window. "We feel really good about it."
</p>
<p>
It's a busy year for Take-Two in general, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> 7 on 11th February, Mafia: The Old Country in the summer, GTA 6 in autumn and Borderlands 4 before the year's end.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> has had a bit of a bumpy start on PC, but with a couple of emergency hot fixes now under its belt, developer Insomniac, alongside porting partner Nixxes, has released its first major patch - targeting reports of crashing, among other things.
</p>
<p>
Marvel's Spider-Man 2 made its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-2-recommended-specs-and-pc-features-detailed">long-awaited PC debut</a> last Thursday, but reports from frustrated players soon surfaced, highlighting significant crashing issues, bugs, and poor optimisation. It didn't take long for the game to amass a "mixed" rating on Steam as complaints continued piling in, and Insomniac <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-2-steam-hotfix-hopes-to-address-pc-ports-stability-woes">responded quickly with a series of hot fixes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, the studio has released its first full patch for Spider-Man 2, primarily targeting "several crash fixes based on feedback from [players] and our crash reporting system." There's more beyond that, however, with update v1.205.0.0 also implementing a backup system for autosaves, fixing a number of visual bugs related to DLSS Ray Reconstruction and raytracing, and addressing a range of UI related bugs.

<p>
Menu toggles have also been introduced for Film Style Animation and Comic SFX, and there are interface improvements intended to simplify starting New Game+. 
</p>
<p>
Insomniac acknowledges not all reported issues have been addressed in its first patch, but says it's "committed to improving your experience and [will] continue to work on regular updates with more bug fixes, improvements and performance optimisations."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell had good things to say about Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on PlayStation 5, calling it "simple, familiar, and occasionally cluttered [but] still brilliant fun" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-review-1">his four star review</a>. Hopefully, Insomniac and Nixxes can resolve the PC version's current issues and give the game the port it deserves. For now, though, you'll find full patch notes below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Various crash fixes based on player feedback and data from our crash reporting system.</li>
<li>Improvements to crash reporting with screenshot support.</li>
<li>Film Style Animation and Comic SFX can now be toggled via Settings &gt; Game &gt; Camera.*</li>
<li>User interface improvements to simplify starting a New Game+</li>
<li>Implemented autosave backups. At key points in the story the game will create a backup of the autosave slot.</li>
<li>Added mouse scrolling to the manual load/save menu.</li>
<li>Various improvements and bug fixes to the user interface.</li>
<li>Reduced noise in character hair when using DLSS Ray Reconstruction.</li>
<li>Enemies webbed to surfaces no longer have a black background when using ray-traced shadows and ray-traced ambient occlusion.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug related to ray-traced reflections that could cause pixelation artefacts along water edges.</li>
<li>Settings for Subtitle Text Size, Closed Caption Text Size, Icon and Prompt Size and Audio Listening Mode are no longer synchronized between different devices.**</li>
</ul>
<p><em>*These options become available after obtaining the Across the Spider-Verse Suit. ** As a result of this change, these settings will be reset to their defaults after you install this update.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
