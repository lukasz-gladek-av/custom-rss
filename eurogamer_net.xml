            <p>Almost 200 <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> developers working at Activision Blizzard have unionised, joining the Communications Workers of America (CWA) after the "overwhelming majority" of workers signed up.</p>
<p>A wall-to-wall unit - now known as The Overwatch Gamemakers Guild-CWA (OWGG-CWA) - the union includes game developers across all disciplines, including design, production, engineering, art, sound, and quality assurance.</p>

<p>"The massive layoffs in the video game industry, and at my own studio, became one of the first reasons I started to learn about how to organise to create a healthier workplace for everyone," said Frank Le Cocq, VFX artist and organising committee member.</p>
<p>"When we began our union efforts, it was empowering to know that our coworkers next door at World of Warcraft had already successfully gone through the process."</p>
<p>"California continues to be a hub for video game organising, and we are excited to welcome Overwatch game developers to CWA alongside our video game union siblings at World of Warcraft and SEGA of America," said CWA Local 9510 President Jason Justice. "When workers come together to build power, we become able to ensure a brighter future for all."</p>
<p>Microsoft has recognised the union alongside the other 2100+ plus Microsoft workers who have formed a union with the CWA.</p>
<p>As game development becomes increasingly insecure all over the world, more and more developers and performers are organising collective bargaining. Following news of the SAG-AFTRA strike last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-union-equity-stands-in-solidarity-with-sag-aftra-but-wont-authorise-its-own-strike">Equity stated it stood "in solidarity", but would not be authorising a strike</a>. It did, however, recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/actors-union-stages-baftas-protest-seeking-improved-conditions-for-performers">call on the games industry to improve conditions for performers</a>, and a protest took place outside last month's BAFTA Games Awards as Equity members held placards reading "Union contracts in gaming now".</p>
<p>Last month, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal">US union warned of "alarming loopholes" for "AI abuse"</a> in the latest proposal to end industrial action. Negotiators on behalf of video game companies responded that "meaningful progress" had been made.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has revealed Borderlands 4 - which boasts the biggest Borderlands map to date "by far" - has no minimap because the team "wants you to play the game and not play the map".</p>
<p>Addressing fans queries and questions on a panel at PAX East yesterday, Pitchford implored we "play the game first and understand the choices [the development team has] made" before passing judgement on changes Gearbox has made to the shooter's head's up display (HUD).</p>

<p>"We made a big freaking world," Pitchford explained, as transcribed by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/randy-pitchford-asks-fans-to-play-the-game-first-before-judging-borderlands-4s-new-minimap-free-hud/">PC Gamer</a>. "And a lot of the things you do can be local space, but a lot of the things you do or want to do are out there, and a local space map is not a good way to navigate when you're thinking about objectives and opportunities - several at the same time that might be miles away - and a compass really helps us do that.</p>
<p>"We want you to play the game and not play the map," he added. "So we made a commitment, and we put all of that investment into this compass system, and you still have the big map. It's one click away. And we put more cool stuff in there than we've ever done before. We even have, like, an AI-driven kind of navigation system that will give you a GPS on the big map to show you the line of where you can go."</p>
<p>That said, Pitchford said the team was "open to thinking about things in the future" and implored players to do the same.</p>
<p>"[P]lay the game first and understand the choices we've made, and I think you'll see and understand when you realise how big this world is and how playing the game in the world is better than playing the map.</p>
<p>"We're on the offense, you guys," he added. "Sometimes we're like, white-knuckling to the landing, you know? And we've got a lot of work to do. We're working our asses off. But the momentum is insane. The velocity is insane. I don't think we've ever been in a better spot this far from launch as we are with Borderlands 4."</p>
<p>Borderlands 4, as we learned a couple of weeks ago, is now arriving earlier than expected on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-forward-perhaps-because-2k-knows-exactly-when-gta-6-is-coming-out">12th September</a>, and developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-some-new-borderlands-4-gameplay-to-go-with-that-revised-release-date">Gearbox recently shared more of its latest looter shooter in a new PlayStation showcase</a>. It showed off a couple of new Vault Hunters, some of its new weapons, new traversal mechanics, its new planet, and more all to whip-up enthusiasm for what creative director Graeme Timmins called "hands-down our best Borderlands ever".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Devil May Cry director Hideki Kamiya has revealed he'd "love" to remake the first game in Capcom's classic hack-and-slash series, acknowledging the aging original "really does feel like a 24-year-old game design" after all this time.
</p>
<p>
Back in December, Kamiya confirmed he'd entered into a new partnership with Capcom - the publisher he left in 2006 after helming such classics as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a>, Okami, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/viewtiful-joe">Viewtiful Joe</a> - and was responding to a fan question inspired by the news during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOBoqQCcRTQ">latest episode of his YouTube show</a> (as translated by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideki-kamiya-says-hed-love-to-remake-devil-may-cry-now-hes-working-with-capcom-again/">VGC)</a>. When asked how he might approach a remake of the first Devil May Cry, he replied, "I'd love to do that."
</p>
<p>"I usually don't replay my own games after release," he continued, "and Devil May Cry is no exception. But once in a while, I catch gameplay clips and think, 'Yeah, this really does feel like a 24-year-old game design.'" As to how he might tackle a remake, Kamiya said, "With today's technology and game design approach... I'd want to remake it from the ground up. If that ever happens... well, I don't think seriously unless it's really happening, so right now, I don't have anything in mind. But if the time comes, I'll come up with something. That's what I do! So Capcom, leave it to me! Also, let me handle Viewtiful Joe too!"

<p>
Since its debut outing in 2001, Devil May Cry - which follows the demon-hunting adventures of white-haired protagonist Dante - has seen five major instalments (plus the polarising <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dmc-devil-may-cry-review">2013 reboot DmC: Devil May Cry</a>), but Kamiya only directed the first. After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-on-leaving-platinumgames-i-couldnt-allow-myself-to-kill-my-soul">departing PlatinumGames in 2023</a>, he formed new studio Clovers, which is currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-in-the-works-with-capcom-and-hideki-kamiyas-new-studio-clovers">working with Capcom to create a sequel to his beloved action-adventure Okami</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for Devil May Cry, the series has remained dormant since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-5-review-an-unashamedly-old-school-retooling-of-an-action-classic">2019's well-received fifth instalment</a>, but it recently returned to the spotlight thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-season-1-review">Netflix's anime adaptation</a>, which Eurogamer contributor Graeme Virtue called a "spirited take on the mythos" last month.
