            <p>Nintendo has released a new update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, and it's another big one.</p>
<p>Version 1.4.0, to give it its proper name, has made swathes of changes to Nintendo's latest Mario Kart installment, ranging from the way music tracks are displayed all the way to UFO entries.</p>
<p>There are tweaks to the smart steering, some course changes for those taking part in "VS Race", "Race" in "Online Play" or "Wireless Play", and adjustments to the speed at which Dash food reappears. You will also now dash when riding on Manta Ramp's back, and there also <em>so much</em> more on the list. Nintendo has really gone to town with this one.</p>
<p>Alas, there's still no mention of racing on individual tracks in multiplayer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-fine-tunes-race-selection-in-vs-race-pool-responding-to-player-criticism">but we all know that's something everyone wants</a>. Maybe next time...</p>

            <p>Obsidian Entertainment, one of gaming's busiest developers, has announced a delay for this year's remaining <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> update. This was to include a Photo mode and New Game Plus mode, among other things, and it will now be held back - as well as enlarged - for the game's anniversary on 18th February 2026.</p>
<p>"If you've been following our Update Roadmap, you'll know we planned to release an update this fall. To break the bad news first: Avowed will not be receiving a fall update," <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1995917924708876634">Obsidian announced on X</a>. "The good news is that we're shifting our efforts toward a larger update coming next February, timed with the anniversary of the game's release.</p>
<p>"This update will include everything originally planned for fall, plus additional features that will make it our biggest update yet. Stay tuned as we head into the new year for more details on what's planned for the Living Lands."</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=equGBZBUjVg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>The features listed for the Anniversary update include the New Game Plus mode, the Photo mode, a new weapon type, "changing appearance in the world" (which I think means the ability to change your character's appearance in the world), new character presets, more Godlike feature presets, "and many more". The other two updates this year - one in the spring, one in the summer - brought new abilities, items, NPC behaviours, an arachnophobia-safe mode, and other improvements.</p><p>Avowed was a very pleasant surprise when it arrived at the beginning of the year. A carefree action-adventure which delighted in exaggerated fantasy, it used smaller open-world areas to provide a sandbox exploration experience, and matched them with a tactile and experimental combat system to strong, and very enjoyable, effect. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">I was very complimentary of Avowed in my review</a>.</p>
<p>Avowed wasn't Obsidian's only big RPG released this year, however. The studio also released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outer-worlds-2-review">sci-fi RPG The Outer Worlds 2 in October, which Alex reviewed and liked</a>, and the studio released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grounded-2">Grounded 2</a>, which was a collaboration with Eidos Montreal. That's an early access release so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-2-wobbles-while-walking-a-line-between-frustration-and-brilliance">Grounded 2 is still finding its little insect legs</a>, but it's a powerful new foundation for the game and franchise to build on for, potentially, years to come.</p>

            <p>According to new filings, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund is set to own the vast majority of EA if the proposed record-breaking acquisition goes through.</p>
<p>These filings, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/saudi-fund-to-own-almost-all-of-electronic-arts-after-buyout-661e92be?mod=hp_lead_pos4">discovered by the Wall Street Journal</a>, have been made to Brazilian antitrust regulators. These filings suggest that Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund would own 93.4 percent of the video game publisher.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund is making this attempt to acquire EA alongside private equity funds Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, the latter founded and owned by Jarred Kushner - son-in-law to President Donald Trump.  Silver Lake would own 5.5 percent, while Affinity Partners would own 1.1 percent.</p>

The acquisition itself is record breaking due to the absurd $55bn cost attached to taking the video game giant private. Of that $55bn, $20bn is in debt.</p><p>Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-private-acquisition-deal-expected-to-go-smoothly-says-report-as-what-regulator-is-going-to-say-no-to-the-presidents-son-in-law">they are expected to proceed smoothly according to reports</a>. That being said, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabias-investment-fund-reportedly-low-on-cash-and-limiting-investment-following-ea-acquisition">the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund may be a little strapped for cash at the moment</a>. The Public Investment Fund will still need to put up billions of dollars to actually take ownership of EA once it is approved over the next year or so.</p>
<p>CEO of EA Andrew Wilson spoke on the deal, stating: "Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world's most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work."

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shovel-knight">Shovel Knight</a> developer Yacht Club Games is at a "make-or-break" moment in the studio's history, and needs Mina the Hollower to do well.</p>
<p>Mina the Hollower is a game I have had my eye on since I started at Eurogamer. In fact, I think its announcement was one of the very first articles I wrote for the site. In a first for the company, Mina the Hollower has nothing to do with Shovel Knight. Rather, this time players will have the chance to take on the mantle of adorable but feisty mouse Mina as she sets out to save a cursed island from the perils that have befallen it.</p>
<p>The game features a top-down adventure style reminiscent of Game Boy Zelda game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/zelda-links-awakening">Link's Awakening</a> in a gothic, Castlevania-esque world. And, a lot rides on its success when it comes out next year.</p>

<p>As detailed in a new report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/creator-of-hit-game-shovel-knight-is-at-make-or-break-moment">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled), in the time since Shovel Knight, Yacht Club divided its team in two (with one team set to work on an unannounced 3D version of Shovel Knight which it had "been fantasizing about for years", and one to work on the "less ambitious" Mina the Hollower). Yacht Club also moved into a new office in Los Angeles. However, then the pandemic hit in 2020, and Yacht Club like the rest of us had to adjust to a different way of doing things.</p><p>Work on Mina the Hollower didn't progress as quickly as the studio had hoped, and in 2024, Yacht Club acknowledged that the two-team structure wasn't working, and after laying off some staff and cutting back on other expenses, merged back into one team. The studio's focus was now solely on Mina the Hollower, and work on the Shovel Knight sequel was paused. The project also had a change in leadership, with studio founder Sean Velasco taking over as director from Mina the Hollower's brain child Alec Faulkner, who is said to have clashed with some of his team.</p>
<p>And now, it is "make-or-break for sure," Velasco has admitted. "If we sold 500,000 copies, then we would be golden," he said of Mina the Hollower. "If we sold even 200,000, that would be really, really great."</p>
<p>However, if the studio only sells around  100,000 copies of Mina the Hollower, "that's not so good". The studio founder did say that if Mina the Hollower were to "flop", then Yacht Club Games would still exist, but it would require some kind of cash injection fast. The studio is already taking steps to keep the studio afloat, and will be moving to fully remote at the end of the year. It will also be shifting its attention to only working on one project at a time.</p>
<p>"What we're doing in the future is try to figure out ways to have a game come out every couple of years, instead of every five or six," said Nick Wozniak, another Yacht Club founder.</p>
<p>"We haven't released a game in so long."</p>

<p>Mina the Hollower was intended to debut on 31st October, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shovel-knight-developers-zelda-like-game-mina-the-hollower-delayed">was pushed back without a new release date earlier this year</a>. At this time, Yacht Club stated it wasn't "a major delay" but just "a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine".</p><p>I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-the-fabled-hollow-knight-the-much-anticipated-bloodlines-2-and-more">played the demo for Mina the Hollower on Switch 2 earlier this year</a>, and loved it. "I collected Bonestone, I popped off various goblins and bats, I burrowed my way underneath enemies to spring up excitingly from behind and I negotiated perilous pits, all while bopping along to a gloriously retro-infused soundtrack… Oh yes, I am certainly looking forward to Mina the Hollower's full release," I wrote back in August. This feeling hasn't changed.</p>
