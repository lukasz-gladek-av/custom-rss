            <p>Publisher Take-Two fully supports <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> following its decision to delay <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> into next year.</p>
<p>GTA 6 was initially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-highly-confident-of-autumn-2025-release-window">slated for an unspecified release this Autumn</a>. However, just this afternoon, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">developer announced it was delaying the release until 26th May, 2026</a>. "With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto 6 is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve," Rockstar said today.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250502895390/en/Take-Two-Interactive-Software-Inc.-Reiterates-Expectations-to-Achieve-Sequential-Increases-in-and-Record-Levels-of-Net-Bookings-in-Fiscal-2026-and-2027">Take-Two's head Strauss Zelnick has responded to the delay</a>, stating the company supports "fully Rockstar Games taking additional time to realise their creative vision", adding on its release GTA 6 will be "a groundbreaking, blockbuster entertainment experience that exceeds audience expectations".</p>

<p>Said Zelnick: "While we take the movement of our titles seriously and appreciate the vast and deep global anticipation for Grand Theft Auto 6, we remain steadfast in our commitment to excellence. As we continue to release our phenomenal pipeline, we expect to deliver a multi-year period of growth in our business and enhanced value for our shareholders."</p>
<p>The Take-Two head added he still expects the company to have a prosperous 12 months, even with GTA 6 being a little further off on the horizon, now releasing during the company's 2027 fiscal year.</p>
<p>In a press release, Take-Two said the expectation is that "the company will achieve sequential increases in, and record levels of, net bookings in fiscal 2026 and 2027".</p>
<p>Take-Two is slated to release its next financial results on 15th May.</p>

            <p>
Apple has formally updated its App Store guidelines to reflect the dramatic decision laid down by a US judge around alternative app store payments. 
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">fiery injunction passed this week</a>, Apple was told it could no longer dissuade app makers from offering other payment methods by applying a 27 percent commission on their proceeds. The move allows apps and games to offer direct - and potentially cheaper - options for in-app purchases, at least in the US.
</p>
<p>
Apple said it disagreed with the judgment and would appeal the decision, though would comply as instructed in the meantime. The company has now updated its App Store rules, and developers are rushing to take advantage.
</p>
<p>
"On the United States storefront, there is no prohibition on an app including buttons, external links, or other calls to action, and no entitlement is required to do so," Apple's rules now state (thanks, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/05/01/apple-app-store-guidelines-external-links/">9to5Mac</a>). 
</p>
<p>
"The prohibition on encouraging users to use a purchasing method other than in-app purchase does not apply on the United States storefront," Apple continues. "The External Link Account entitlement is not required for apps on the United States storefront to include buttons, external links, or other calls to action."
</p>
<p>
Last night, music streaming service Spotify said it had already submitted an app update to Apple which directs users to its website, bypassing payment via the App Store where Apple takes its 30 percent cut. 
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-05-01/following-landmark-court-ruling-spotify-submits-new-app-update-to-apple-to-benefit-u-s-consumers/">blog post announcing its move, Spotify said</a> users would finally be able to "see how much something costs in our app", such as subscriptions and information on promotions - and in the future, potentially easier-to-buy audio books.
</p>
<p>
Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney has stated that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> will return to the iPhone App Store in the US next week, after an absence of five years. 
</p>
<p>
The company has also offered a "peace proposal" to Apple, and suggested it would "drop current and future litigation on the topic" if Apple rolled out these changes worldwide. Seems unlikely, but you never know.
</p>
<p>
Sweeney previously said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-sweeney-no-regrets-on-fortnite-app-store-drama-as-epic-game-store-launches-on-mobile-in-europe">Fortnite had lost around $1bn in missed revenue from taking on Apple</a> and getting kicked off its app store for deliberately breaking the rules - but that it had been worth it.

            <p>
Rockstar has delayed the launch of GTA 6 to 2026.
</p>
<p>
The highly-anticipated sequel will now arrive for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th May 2026, Rockstar announced today in a short statement. 
</p>
<p>"Hi everyone, Grand Theft Auto 6 is now set to release on 26th May, 2026," the company wrote in a statement shared via social media.</p>
<p>"We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.</p>
<p>"With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto 6 is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.</p>
<p>"We look forward to sharing more information with you soon. Sincerely, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>."</p>

<p>Today's news comes ahead of parent company Take-Two's next financial results briefing, set for 15th May, and days after Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-not-the-reason-for-borderlands-4-release-date-change-randy-pitchford-insists">Borderlands 4's recent launch date change was nothing to do with any other game</a>.
</p>
<p>No other information was announced by Rockstar today - and there's certainly no sign of a new GTA 6 trailer. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-first-trailer-released-early">Rockstar released GTA 6's first - and so far only - look at the game back in December 2023</a>, at which point it was set for launch this year.</p>
<p>Rockstar's confirmation of a delay follows months of speculation over whether the game would still make its 2025 launch window, despite assurances from Take-Two that the game was still on track. 
</p>
<p>In November 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-doubles-down-on-gta-6-release-date-after-delay-rumours">GTA 6's publisher insisted the game would arrive in autumn 2025</a> despite whispers of a delay, something it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">doubled down upon again just a few months back</a> in February.</p>
<p>"This calendar year is shaping up to be one of the strongest ever for [Take-Two], as we plan to launch <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> 7 on 11th February, Mafia: The Old Country in the summer, Grand Theft Auto 6 in the fall, and Borderlands 4," the publisher noted in a now-outdated earnings report. </p>
<p>And just a month ago, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-release-date-is-still-secret-because-take-two-boss-wants-to-maintain-the-anticipation-and-excitement">the publisher was still keeping the GTA 6 date close to its chest to "maintain the anticipation and the excitement"</a>. Still, reading back through his comments now, there is a suggestion of caution around announcing a firm date too early. Here's what he said:</p>
<p>"We do have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance, and we found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement on the one hand, and balance the excitement with unmet anticipation," Zelnick noted.</p>
<p>The delay is at least good news for other games hesitant to lock down a launch date towards the tail end of 2025. Indeed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be">EA boss Andrew Wilson previously said the company would be willing to delay its next Battlefield</a> - currently expected to release before April 2026 - if "some things happening in the year" meant that "wasn't a great window for us".</p>
<p>Sony, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-announced">waited until last week to confirm an October launch date for Ghost of Yōtei</a>, likely its biggest PlayStation launch for the year. Its hard to imagine the company did that without knowing the game would not clash with Rockstar's behemoth.</p>
<p>Rockstar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta6-active-development-now-well-underway-rockstar-says">first confirmed GTA 6 development was "well underway" back in 2022</a>, following reporting that stated the game's initial scope had been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-grand-theft-auto-6-plans-reportedly-featured-four-protagonists-and-three-cities">pared back to allow for a smoother development and the ability to grow the game's world post-launch</a>.</p>
<p>
As it is, GTA 6 will be set in a modern day version of Vice City - the Grand Theft Auto version of real-world Miami - and star a Bonnie and Clyde-style pair of protagonists. Here's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">everything we know about GTA 6</a> for more.
