            <p>
With Dragon Age: The Veilguard's one-week anniversary looming, BioWare has released its first big patch for the well-received fantasy action-RPG; and as an added treat, the studio has also tossed in some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> themed armour to mark this year's N7 Day.
</p>
<p>
The Veilguard's first patch isn't admittedly, a particularly sexy one in terms of fixes. Its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1845910/view/4453590197273100466?l=english">release notes</a> suggest an update primarily focussed on massaging away some relatively minor annoyances - but given Digital Foundry called the game's initial release an "attractive, technically solid" one <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-dragon-age-the-veilguards-pc-port-is-polished-performant-and-scales-well-beyond-console-quality">on PC</a>, and "polished [and] performant" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-dragon-age-the-veilguard-on-consoles-is-an-attractive-technically-solid-release">on consoles</a>, there didn't appear to be anything particularly egregious in need of fixing,
</p>
<p>
Still, if you're an owner of an Nvidia 40-series GPU who couldn't access Dragon Age: The Veilguard's DLSS options, or were finding Harding and Taash's banter looping endlessly, then those - alongside exactly 43 additional issues - should now be remedied on PC and consoles.

<p>
Perhaps the most exciting part of the patch then, is the inclusion of the aforementioned Mass Effect-inspired armour - a surprisingly dashing blend of practical chest plate, dinner jacket overcoat, and N7 helmet - that can be acquired via a new chest in the Lighthouse, and which you can see at the top of this page. This, of course, has been released to commemorate the return of BioWare's annual N7 Day - celebrations that have also seen a Mass Effect TV show officially announced, plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-rolling-out-cross-save-support-from-today-as-ps5-pro-enhancements-arrive">returning collaborations with No Man's Sky</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>.
</p><p>
In a <a href="https://x.com/bioware/status/1854577078806429869">message shared on social media</a>, BioWare wrote, "November 7 has arrived once again, and as always, we're grateful for the opportunity to celebrate all things Mass Effect! This year is a little different, as we just launched Dragon Age: The Veilguard as a studio; so we're purposefully seeing things lighter as we celebrate the launch of the game...Although we're a little quieter this year, we couldn't be more excited for what's to come."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Robert Purchese had a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">lot of good things to say about BioWare's latest Dragon Age in his five star review</a>. "From head to toe, wing to wing, The Veilguard is exquisitely realised and full of sophistication across systems and storytelling," he wrote. "It's warm and welcoming, funny and hopeful, gentle when it needs to be, and of course it's epic - epic in a way I think will set a high bar not only for BioWare in years to come but for role-playing games in general."

It's been a good few years since reports surfaced Amazon was looking to adapt <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> for television, but finally - as N7 day rolls around once more - the show has been made official.
</p>
<p>
A Mass Effect TV show was first touted back in 2021, when former BioWare lead writer Mac Walters explained various factors has contributed in the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-explains-why-the-mass-effect-movie-fell-by-the-wayside">shifting its initial vision of a movie adaptation toward something for the smaller screen</a>. Later that same year, reports surfaced claiming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-nearing-a-deal-for-mass-effect-tv-series">Amazon was "nearing a deal" for a Mass Effect TV series</a>, as part of its ongoing push into sci-fi and fantasy storytelling.
</p>
<p>
And now those reports have been confirmed. Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/mass-effect-tv-series-amazon-writer-marvel-1236203755/">says</a> a Mass Effect TV series is now officially in development at Amazon, with Fast &amp; Furious 9 (AKA F9: The Fast Saga) scribe Daniel Casey on writing and executive producer duties. Casey isn't a complete stranger to sci-fi, having previously written 2018 movie Kin and done rewrites for 2016's 10 Cloverfield Lane.

<p>
Also executive producing are Karim Zreik, EA's Michael Gamble, and Ari Arad, who's served as producer on everything from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted">Uncharted</a> movie and last year's terrible Borderlands adaptation, to the Spider-Verse series and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-film-releases-some-time-within-this-decade-so-thats-something">Nintendo's upcoming Zelda film</a>.
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, details of Amazon's Mass Effect adaptation are limited, but we do know ardent gamer and former Witcher Henry Cavill at one time had an interest in the project. Back in February 2021, Cavill was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-teases-secret-project-that-appears-to-be-related-to-mass-effect">snapped alongside a script</a> apparently related to Mass Effect; then in December that year, not long after Amazon was said to be nearing a deal, Cavill casually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-would-love-to-discuss-being-in-the-mass-effect-tv-series">revealed</a> he'd "love to have a conversation" about it. However, with Cavill now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-reportedly-set-to-star-in-a-warhammer-40k-series-at-amazon">confirmed to be involved with Amazon's Warhammer adaptation</a>, it's likely things have change.
</p>
<p>
One person probably <em>not</em> excited about a Mass Effect TV series is ex-Bioware lead writer David Gaider, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-bioware-writer-mass-effect-tv-show-cringe">previously said</a> the idea of BioWare television adaptations made him "cringe".
</p>
<p>
"For starters, Mass Effect and Dragon Age had a custom protagonist," he explained. "Meaning said TV show will need to pick whether said protagonist will be male or female. Boom, right off the bat you've just alienated a whole bunch of the built-in fan base who had their hopes up... Secondly, those protagonists are designed to be a bit of a blank slate, one that the player fills out with their decisions. That's not going to work for a passive medium. So, suddenly, the protagonist will have their own personality... and their own <em>story</em>. That will be weird."
</p><p>
"Both Mass Effect and Dragon Age's plots were, at best, serviceable," he continued. "Those plots had to take into account the player's agency. They were kind of the shell upon which that player's emotional engagement was delivered - usually through the companions and the choices themselves. Choice heightened engagement. Interactivity was the star, not the plot."
</p>
<p>
"Take all that out, lose most of the companions, and you potentially end up with... a pretty run-of-the-mill fantasy or science-fiction show, one where a lot of the built-in audience has possibly been turned into outraged, howling malcontents before it's even released."
</p>
<p>
Amazon has, of course, already navigated similar issues with this year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> TV adaptation, and that ended up releasing to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-review">significant acclaim</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks">commercial success</a>. So time will tell if Gaider's concerns prove warranted.
