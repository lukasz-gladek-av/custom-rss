            <p>
You probably already know EA's about to hold a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> open beta so you can check out its multiplayer component ahead of release, and you probably also know EA's holding an open beta <em>early access</em> event so you can get stuck in even earlier. But you might not be aware there's another way to get an early access key if you missed out previously.
</p>
<p>
As its name suggests, Battlefield 6's open beta is open to all, but the early access bit, running from 7th-8th August, is restricted. Everyone who signed up to EA's Battlefield Labs programme prior to 31st July is eligible to play early access, as is anyone that got a code from Battlefield 6's recent streamer showcase. EA Play Pro subscribers are also in, and key giveaways are seemingly still happening on Battlefield's official Discord, but the sentiment from EG team members who've tried there is basically be "good luck with that lol". Luckily, there's still one more opportunity to get involved if you don't yet have access, and it sounds relatively foolproof. 
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-open-beta-twitch-drops">detailed on the Battlefield website</a>, EA is also giving away keys during the early access period itself. Interested parties just need to link their EA and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> accounts, which you can <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/login?client_id=rg5jwqeyulmyy5s5zsu7juu2l3q1ue&amp;redirect_params=client_id%3Drg5jwqeyulmyy5s5zsu7juu2l3q1ue%26prompt%3Dnone%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Faccounts.ea.com%252Fconnect%252Flinking%252Fthirdparty%253Fcallback%253Dtrue%26response_type%3Dcode%26scope%3Duser_read%2Bviewing_activity_read%2Buser%253Aread%253Aemail%26state%3DRVMxOjIuMDoxLjA6U1Qya2ZocXJKQ3h1dE5jVWg6cnNjMmg">do can over on Twitch</a>, then simply watch 30 minutes of a participating Battlefield 6 streamer playing the open beta early access on either 7th or 8th August. Obviously, the sooner you watch, the sooner you can get stuck in yourself. One small caveat to all this: it's not entirely clear just how many keys will be available this way, with EA only saying "while supplies last".

<p>
It's probably also worth noting the Twitch giveaways continue beyond early access and into Battlefield 6's two open access weekends, which take place 7th-8th and 14th-17th August. Watch a participating streamer for one hour during these times and you'll unlock the Mimic Weapons Package; two hours unlocks the Landslide Soldier Skin, three hours unlocks the Shattered Vehicle Skin, and four hours unlocks the Imperial Skin. Don't forget to manually claim them from your Twitch Drops Inventory (you'll need to do this before the promotion expires), and they'll then be available when the full game launches for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on 10th October. If you don't already know, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-where-to-buy">here's what's included in each edition</a>.
</p>
<p>
To access the beta itself, you'll need to download the Battlefield 6 open beta client from the platform store of your choice, and PC players looking to get involved should also be aware some prep work may be required ahead of time. EA has elsewhere noted players will <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/articles/technical-issues/secure-boot/">need to activate Windows 10 and 11's Secure Boot security feature</a> in order to play. This, it says, "allows games supported by EA Javelin Anticheat to detect and remove bad actors, resulting in fewer cheaters and a better experience for players."
</p>
<p>
There's a lot riding on Battlefield 6 after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-admits-battlefield-2042-flopped-but-would-have-been-less-than-10-percent-of-annual-revenue-anyway">disastrous Battlefield 2042</a>, and EA has spent plenty of energy trying to reassure fans it's getting things right this time. There've been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">plenty of community playtest sessions</a> via Battlefield Labs, and developers assurances have included promises this latest entry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield">will avoid goofy crossover skins</a> in order to "stray true" to the series. There's also been talk of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">more focused maps and the return of classes</a>, but Eurogamer's Connor Makar was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-multiplayer-takes-a-bold-risky-new-direction">left "unconvinced" after a recent Battlefield 6 preview</a>.

            <p>The Humble bundle building team has detailed its August Choice collection of games, which includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-royal">Persona 5 Royal</a>, Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden and My Time at Sandrock, to name three.</p>

<p>As ever, Choice membership fees include a five percent donation to charity. This month's charity is DonorsChoose. Here's a little bit about it all:</p>
<p>"DonorsChoose is the leading way to give to public schools. Since 2000, 6.5 million people and partners have contributed $1.8bn to support more than three million teacher requests for classroom resources and experiences.</p>
<p>"As the most trusted crowdfunding platform for teachers, donors, and district administrators alike, DonorsChoose vets each request, ships the funded resources directly to the classroom, and provides thank yous and reporting to donors and school leaders."</p>
<p>You can find more information via <a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/">donorschoose.org</a>.</p>

<p>So, what of the games themselves? Personally, i quite like the sound of Wildmender, pictured above, which is described as a "desert gardening survival game".</p>
<p>Then there's My Time At Sandrock , which fully released in 2023, after a successful Kickstarter in 2020 followed by an early access period in 2022. It's a follow-up to My Time at Portia, and treads a similar path to its gentle farming and life simulation predecessor, though this time set in sandier frontier-esque surroundings.</p>
<p>Banishers: Ghost of New Eden, meanwhile, is a supernatural action-RPG from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> studio Don't Nod. We awarded it four out of five stars on its release. "Don't Nod drops the melodrama for a poignantly performed story about grief and injustice, where the difficult choices tug at your heart and principles," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-review">Eurogamer's Banishers: Ghost of New Eden review</a>.</p>
