            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> creator Don't Nod is delaying the second half of its upcoming narrative adventure Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage by a month, with Tape 2 now set to release on 15th April.
</p>
<p>
Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage marks the first time since 2020's Twin Mirror that Don't Nod has revisited the narrative adventure genre that put it on the map, and it follows the story of four high-school friends across two timelines. One half recounts the group's hazily nostalgic "magical summer" of 1995, while the second timeline picks up 27 years later, when the friends reunite to "confront the long-buried secret that made them promise to never speak again."
</p>
<p>
It's a tale that'll also be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-creators-lost-records-launches-in-two-parts">split across two releases</a>, with Tape 1 ("Bloom") launching for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 18th February. Part 2 ("Rage") was previously scheduled to launch a month later on 18th March, but Don't Nod has now announced it's pushing Tape 2's release back an additional four weeks, to 15th April.

<p>
In a statement detailing the delay, the studio said it had made the decision in order to "allow for additional optimisation and to give the team the necessary time to refine the experience for players and enhance the storytelling for a truly immersive continuation of the journey."
</p><p>
Both parts of Lost Records were originally due to launch last year, but Don't Nod announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-life-is-strange-team-delays-new-game-to-avoid-new-lis-launch-date">shifting their release into 2025</a>, ostensibly to avoid <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>. "Let's give both titles the space they need to be enjoyed by our players within the large community we have built," Don't Nod boss Oskar Guilbert said at the time.
</p>
<p>
As previously announced, both halves of Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage - which Don't Nod says should provide a total of around 10-12 hours playtime - will be available through a single purchase. The game's usual price is £35.89/39,99€/$39.99 USD, but the studio has also now confirmed a limited-time launch discount of 10 percent.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Tom Phillips <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-creators-discuss-leaving-their-hit-narrative-adventure-series-behind-building-on-it-with-lost-records">spoke to Don't Nod about Lost Records</a> in 2024. Since then, the studio has admitted its most recent titles - Jusant and Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-nod-bets-on-lost-records-bloom-rage-as-multiple-projects-fail-to-meet-expectations">failed to meet sales expectations</a>, leading to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jusant-lost-records-studio-dont-nod-says-69-jobs-at-risk-as-part-of-reorganisation-project">potential job losses</a> as it embarked on a "reorganisation project to ensure the company's long-term future" amid "deteriorating" financial results. Employees later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/workers-at-dont-nod-to-strike-in-reaction-to-studios-recent-redundancy-plan">announced strike action</a> in response to the studio's redundancy plan.

            <p>
Grand Taking Ages, a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> "parody" that uses AI artwork and voice acting, has done enough to convince Valve it should launch on Steam. 
</p>
<p>
That's despite Sony recently stepping in to remove a PS5 version of the project set to launch on the PlayStation Store.
</p>
<p>
Originally titled Grand Taking Ages 6, the now re-named game has a July 2025 release date on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3464800/Grand_Taking_Ages/">Steam</a>, and there's fresh detail on what the game actually is. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-pulled-gta-6-parody-game-grand-taking-ages-from-the-playstation-store-but-its-now-cleared-for-release-on-steam">IGN</a>, developer Violarte said Grand Taking Ages would be a management simulator, where players attempt to run a game developer. (Presumably you are not rewarded for getting booted off the store of a major console manufacturer.)
</p>
<p>
Adjustments have been made in order to convince Steam owner Valve that Grand Taking Ages is actually a legitimate project, with changes to the game's logo and presentation "to clearly differentiate the game" from Rockstar's own GTA 6.

<p>
According to Violarte, its project was taken down by Sony despite the defence that it was clearly a parody. Indeed, the developer suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-hamlet-is-a-luminous-documentary-about-staging-shakespeare-inside-gta-online-that-brings-fresh-nuance-to-the-game-and-bard-alike">the recent Grand Theft Hamlet project</a> - a film in which a production of Shakespeare's classic play is performed within <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> - proved just this.
</p><p>
"We genuinely believe that, with the recent updates, Grand Taking Ages is now ready to be relisted on the PlayStation Store," Violarte concluded, saying it had requested Sony now reinstate the game's store page. "We strongly believe that there will be no issues with Sony this time, given the adjustments we've implemented."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Sony for comment.

            <p>Nintendo has been nominated at this year's GLAAD award for trans representation in last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/paper-mario-2-thousand-year-door">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> remake on Switch.</p>
<p>GLAAD is a non-profit organisation focused on LGBT+ advocacy. It runs annual awards to celebrate LGBT+ representation in media, with video games included since 2019.</p>
<p>This year's nominees include Nintendo for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/paper-mario">Paper Mario</a> ghost companion Vivian, whose trans identity was restored in the remake.</p>

<p>In the Japanese GameCube original release, Vivian is trans but is deliberately misgendered by her sisters. However, some territories removed this in their translations, including the English and German versions.</p>
<p>For the remake, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paper-mario-remake-confirms-companion-is-trans-after-references-removed-from-original-translation">Nintendo restored the original dialogue</a> - and therefore Vivian's trans identity. The change was widely celebrated by the LGBT+ community.</p>
<p>Other nominees include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, which features LGBT+ relationships and a non-binary companion character, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, which features a bisexual protagonist.</p>
<p>The full list of nominees is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caravan SandWitch (Studio Plane Toast / Dear Villagers)</li>
<li>Dragon Age: The Veilguard (BioWare / Electronic Arts)</li>
<li>Dread Delusion (Lovely Hellplace / DreadXP)</li>
<li>Dustborn (Red Thread Games / Spotlight by Quantic Dream)</li>
<li>Fear the Spotlight (Cozy Game Pals / Blumhouse Games)</li>
<li>Life is Strange: Double Exposure (Deck Nine / Square Enix)</li>
<li>Minds Beneath Us (BearBone Studio)</li>
<li>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door (Intelligent Systems / Nintendo)</li>
<li>Sorry We’re Closed (à la mode games / Akupara Games)</li>
<li>Until Then (Polychroma Games / Maximum Entertainment)</li>
</ul>
<p>It's notable that the majority of these games are from indie developers, as major studios lag behind in terms of LGBT+ representation.</p>
<p>As per a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nearly-1-in-5-gamers-are-lgbt-says-new-glaad-study">GLAAD study last year</a>, nearly one in five gamers are members of the LGBT+ community, yet LGBT+ storylines and characters account for less than two percent of all games.</p>
<p>The report focused on the importance of diverse representation: 72 percent of LGBT+ players said seeing characters matching their gender identity or sexual orientation well-represented made them feel better about themselves, while 68 percent wished there were more prominent LGBT+ storylines.</p>
<p>Last year's winner for Outstanding Video Game at the GLAAD awards was, perhaps unsurprisingly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/from-mediterranea-inferno-to-baldurs-gate-3-the-queer-ecstasy-of-monster-loving">Baldur's Gate 3</a>.</p>
<p>Other previous winners include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/creating-a-legend-how-respawn-delivers-diverse-representation-in-apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-true-colors-review-a-beautiful-return-to-small-town-mystery-and-young-adult-drama">Life is Strange: True Colors</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-a-gut-wrenching-sequel">The Last of Us Part 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tell-me-why-review-memory-and-identity-converge-in-another-taut-young-adult-adventure">Tell Me Why</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
