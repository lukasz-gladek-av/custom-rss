            <p>On 9th September, Riot Games' fighting game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/project-l">2XKO</a> will release into its closed beta. The game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/league-of-legends-free-to-play-fighter-officially-named-2xko">first announced officially in February 2024</a>, would appear to the layperson as a quick turnaround. The reality for those who have kept their eyes peeled for any crumb of info about the game couldn't be further from the truth.</p>
<p>Back in March 2016, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/3/8/11181204/riot-games-acquires-radiant-entertainment/">Riot Games acquired Radiant Entertainment</a>, developers of forward-thinking fighter Rising Thunder. It's here that whispers about a Riot fighting game first circulated. Then, in 2019, Riot Games revealed the then-called <strong>Project L</strong> as part of the publisher's 10th anniversary. This 1v1 fighter would later be scrapped, with development restarting towards the 2v2 duo play fighting game we have today.</p>
<p>The consequence of this timeline is that for the ultra dedicated 2XKO fans, this game has been almost a ten years in the waiting. For those with a decent memory, six years and counting. As such a perception has risen among a portion of the fighting game fanbase, one of impatience and general confusion as to why things have taken so long.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>At Evo 2025, I sat down with both 2XKO executive producer Tom Cannon and game director Shaun Rivera, and asked whether the game was revealed too early, and the conflict between what the team considers the 'proper reveal' versus the 'perceived reveal' of a game a decade in the making. Would they go back and re-think the reveal of Project L if they could?</p>
<p>"I don't know that I would," says Tom Cannon. "For sure, there was a cost to doing that. It puts a clock in player's minds, now the meme is [that there's been] nine years of development. The reality was that we were deep in R&amp;D when we showed that. But we needed the player's reaction to that announcement to sort of kick us in the butt, and inspire us to make something that wasâ€¦ special and different."</p>
<p>Cannon continues: "On the timeline when we don't do that, I don't know if we end up with <strong>this</strong> game. There were costs for sure, but y'know, when we showed that we paid a lot of attention to how fighting game fans were reacting. The reaction we got was 'oh wow, that looks interesting, I'll check it out'. We wanted people jumping out of their chairs! We didn't get that reaction, so we had to do better and take it back to the shop."</p>
<p>Rivera shares Cannon's lack of regret on the matter, pointing to the openness of the development process as a strength of 2XKO, and Riot Games in general: "For our team, we haven't spent decades making a fighting game. We're learning as we go. One of the things that I really love about working at Riot - I just celebrated my 13th anniversary - this company really encourages all their developers working there to talk to players. When I think back to myself when I played fighting games a long time ago, I wanted to know what the developers were thinking.</p>
<p>"The fact we have this opportunity to put this game in front of players like in Alpha Lab 1 and 2, and at Evo, it's something I'm pumped about. To your point, hey, has it been too long? I think people just want to play the game. But we're learning as we go through, and we have this date now: 9th September."</p>

<p>While, these days, information and play tests for 2XKO are abundant, those early years were often islands composed of teases separated by oceans of radio silence. Can anything be done about the perceived development time for Riot's fighting game? Rivera doesn't believe so.</p>
<p>"Not really. Honestly, once Radiant was acquired, there's a lot of amazing folks who worked on Rising Thunder who are still on our team today - Tom and Tony included. We're sitting at Evo, right? Once people hear that and go, 'cool, fighting game when?' With the first 1v1 version of the game we tested with players before my time, there was a feeling that it was cool, but that it wasn't good enough.</p>
<p>"I've been on the project for five years, we made the choice to make a 2v2 duo play game. It's a big difference, right? This version of the game has not been the full length of time, but there's no way to avoid that acquisition."</p>
<p>When asked if this perception versus reality is a problem, he concluded by stating there's only one thing the team can do about it: get the game in front of people and build from there.</p>
<p>"Sometimes you've just got to deal with it, you know. This is one of those instances where there was a lot of love for Rising Thunder, Tom and Tony.  It's no surprise that there's excitement around that. It's something we've got to push through, and at the end of the day the way you solve it is by getting the game in front of players and keep making it better over time."</p>
<p>With 2XKO, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-2xko-riot-aims-to-make-a-beginner-friendly-fighting-game-but-will-that-ever-be-possible">Riot aims to make a beginner-friendly fighting game</a>, and taking this long in development is a key aspect of that plan. We're going to have to wait just a little bit longer, though, to see whether that decision - and the cost of the notably early reveal - will bear any fruit.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/was-riot-games-fighting-game-2xko-revealed-too-early-interview]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you've been wondering just how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s Secure Boot requirement and anti-cheat system Javelin have been holding up during Battlefield 6's gargantuan open beta test, AC from EA's Anti-Cheat team has revealed that during the Open Beta alone, Javelin has blocked over 300,000 attempted cheat efforts and reviewed 100K+ potential cheaters.</p>
<p>"Your reports help us zero in and lead us to finding up-and-coming cheat communities, reporting one actual cheater often can lead to new detection techniques and help us keep them from impacting your experience," <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/battlefield-6-beta-feedback-en/update-battlefield-6-update-on-secure-boot--cheats/12439803">AC explained in a forum post updated over the weekend</a>. "Anti-Cheat isn't one and done, it's an ever-evolving battlefield, and what has worked for us previously or in different games doesn't always work in all of them."</p>

<p>"Since Open Beta Early Accessâ€™s launch, Javelin has prevented 330,000 attempts to cheat or tamper with anti-cheat controls, and [players have] reported 44,000 instances of potential cheaters during day one and another 60,000 so far today," AC added.</p>
<p>"We are already using these with our own Gameplay Integrity team to add and improve our detections for Battlefield 6. They are also working with the Battlefield Positive Play team, to actively remove those reported we confirm to be cheaters."</p>
<p>For those wondering why DICE was requiring Secure Boot in the first place, AC explained that Secure Boot "is not, and was not intended to be a silver bullet".</p>
<p>"Secure Boot is how you're helping us build up our arsenal. Itâ€™s another barrier that helps us make it harder for cheat developers to create cheat programs, and makes it easier for us to detect it when they do," AC wrote.</p>
<p>"Secure Boot prevents your machine from running with vulnerable drivers enabled. So if Secure Boot is running and we see those drivers loaded, we know something's a bit off."</p>
<p>Battlefield 6, is set to release on the 10th October. Everyone who requested access to Battlefield 6's Labs tests has been given access to these weekend tests, which - it turns out - is a lot of people. Don't worry if you can't get on this weekend, though; <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1954200952455544937">you can still complete the Weekend 1 challenges next week</a>, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-multiplayer-takes-a-bold-risky-new-direction">Connor's already spent some quality time with the highly-anticipated shooter, writing</a>: "[Playing Battlefield 6] leaves me in a state of cautious optimism. I think the building blocks for a truly fantastic Battlefield game are here with Battlefield 6 - perhaps even an all-time great - but I need to see a little more, need to play a little more. I need to see where the dice fall, whether the gamble of bold gameplay changes land well - where the hivemind of Battlefield's playerbase find new strategies beyond the this-beats-that approach of old, say - or whether they simply muddy an otherwise potentially brilliant experience."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-anti-cheat-system-has-already-prevented-330000-attempts-to-cheat-or-tamper-with-anti-cheat-controls]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microsoft has "assured players that Turn 10 and Playground Games will continue to support Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5".</p>
<p>In the wake of brutal cuts which saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">over 9000 employees laid off from Microsoft last month</a>, including across its gaming divisions, the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">The Initiative's Perfect Dark reboot, and a new ZeniMax MMORPG were all cancelled</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/candy-crush-developer-king-reportedly-replacing-laid-off-staff-with-ai-tools-they-helped-to-build">roughly 200 staff from Candy Crush developer King were laid off</a> and reportedly replaced by the AI tools they helped to build.</p>
<p>At the time, Microsoft told Eurogamer the layoffs were "necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace". A few days later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-motorsport-is-no-more-claims-former-turn-10-employee-following-microsoft-cuts">we reported Forza Motorsport was "no more", according to a former employee at developer Turn 10 Studios</a>, though it was emphasised that the Horizon series will continue.</p>

<p>Now Microsoft has again stressed that support is ongoing, writing on social media: "Dear Forza Community, we know many of you have questions about whatâ€™s next for the Forza franchise, and we appreciate the support of our incredible community.</p>
<p>"We wanted to assure players that Turn 10 and Playground Games will continue to support Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5. To start, hereâ€™s more info about whatâ€™s coming next to Forza Motorsport". The post then linked to a <a href="http://aka.ms/FMUpdate21Tours">webpage</a>.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Dear Forza Community, we know many of you have questions about whatâ€™s next for the Forza franchise, and we appreciate the support of our incredible community.

<p>Interestingly, Microsoft didn't outline what's next for the Horizon franchise, only pledged commitment to the latest in the series, Forza Horizon 5. As racing driver and content creator Steve Alvarez Brown, aka SuperGT, <a href="https://x.com/_SuperGT/status/1953515312621449397">pointed</a> out, "this offers zero clarity as to whether Forza Motorsport will continue beyond the current game."</p>
<p>Last month, we learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-forza-horizon-5-is-ps5s-highest-selling-game-of-the-year-so-far-says-analyst">was the highest-selling game on PS5 this year so far, surpassing 3 million copies sold</a>. Though previously an Xbox-exclusive, Forza Horizon 5 released on Sony's rival platform at the end of April.</p>
<p>By comparison, Forza Horizon 5 has been played by more than 45.5 million players across Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, though predominantly via the Game Pass subscription, since its release in 2021. On Steam, it's sold a further 6.5m copies (also since 2021).</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-stresses-it-will-continue-to-support-forza-motorsport-and-horizon-5-despite-cuts-at-studio-turn-10]]></content:encoded>
