            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, Nintendo's forthcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> platformer, will have a musical twist centred on a previously leaked character inclusion.</p>
<p>In a Direct presentation, Nintendo detailed more on how the new game will play, beyond the punching and rock deformation previously shown.</p>
<p><strong>Spoilers follow</strong>, if you're looking to keep surprises to yourself.</p>

<p>Donkey Kong is joined by a little purple rock companion during Bananza, but now Nintendo has revealed this character is in fact baby Pauline.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/oops-nintendo-accidentally-reveals-surprise-character-appears-in-donkey-kong-bananza">Pauline's inclusion was accidentally leaked by Nintendo</a> itself back in April, but now her role in the game has been officially unveiled.</p>
<p>Pauline is the damsel in distress in the original Donkey Kong game, meaning her inclusion here is not only a fun throwback, but means Bananza could act as something of a prequel.</p>
<p>She's more recently been seen as the mayor of New Donk City in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, singing the theme song Jump Up, Super Star! (as well as a rather <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-8-deluxes-final-wave-of-dlc-arrives-next-week">sassy inclusion as a racer in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's DLC</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/best-mario-kart-world-character-tier-list">more recently also in Mario Kart World</a>).</p>
<p>It's her singing ability that characterises Pauline's inclusion in Donkey Kong Bananza. By learning songs acquired from the Giant Elders (who look to be musically themed), Pauline can sing to transform Donkey Kong. These transformations include a zebra to run over water and an ostrich to fly and reach hard to reach areas, though they'll require gold to build up Bananergy.</p>
<p>The Direct also includes multiple vocal songs, presumably sung by Pauline. She can also be controlled by a second player in co-operative mode.</p>

<p>The antagonists of the game, meanwhile, are the Void Company: Grumpy Kong, Poppy Kong, and leader Void Kong. This trio is responsible for stealing DK's bananas, beginning the game's story. Cranky Kong and his rhino Rambi will also feature.</p>
<p>As DK explores (and destroys) more of the subterranean worlds, he'll collect Banandium Gems - the big golden bananas. These are found by exploring, or by completing challenges in hidden Ruins, and are used to improve stats. The independent Ruin arenas, along with the free-form exploration, hint at an almost <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a>-esque influence (though progress is more linear).</p>
<p>Other inclusions in Donkey Kong Bananza are multiple outfits for both DK and Pauline (each with benefits), fossils to collect, a music player to enjoy Pauline's singing from the soundtrack, and a photo mode.</p>
<p>And… was that the DK Rap?! <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dk-rap-composer-explains-why-nintendo-didnt-credit-him-in-the-super-mario-bros-movie">Composer Grant Kirkhope previously explained to Eurogamer why he wasn't credited for the song's inclusion in the Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, but it's inclusion in this new game is a surprise.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza will also include an Assist Mode, just like the most recent DK platformers on Switch, to make gameplay a little easier.</p>
<p>Another slightly odd addition is DK Artist mode, where players can carve Donkey Kong's face using the Switch 2's mouse mode. It reminds me of the Mario face-pulling in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, a Donkey Kong and Pauline amiibo figure is on the way to celebrate the game's release, while DK-themed amiibo support will have some fun benefits in-game.</p>
<p>"Yes, everyone might have been expecting Mario, but Bananza's brawny obliteration is far better suited to his one-time enemy," wrote former Eurogamer editor Tom Phillips during his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-reveals-a-proper-generational-upgrade-though-its-biggest-new-idea-remains-unproven">hands-on preview of Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>The game will release on Switch 2 on 17th July, yet already some fans have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananzas-secret-in-game-language-has-already-been-decoded-months-before-launch">deciphered its secret language</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
