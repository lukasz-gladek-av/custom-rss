Somehow, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth">The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth</a> celebrates its tenth anniversary this week, and, to mark the occasion, developer Edmund McMillen has announced the poop-obsessed roguelike's long-awaited online co-op mode is getting its full release on 18th November.
</p>
<p>
Online co-op for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth (that's the 2014 remake of McMillen's 2011 original, if you're unfamiliar), was <a href="https://x.com/tyronerodriguez/status/1707522206358761705">initially announced</a> in September last year. Since then, a number of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250900/view/3645131352093069363?l=english">beta sessions</a> have been held for owners of Isaac's Repentance expansion.
</p>
<p>
But now, a little over a year since online co-op was confirmed, McMillen has <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/1853502568863031303">announced</a> the mode will fully launch for everyone on 18th November. It'll support 2-4 players online, with its own completion markers, and arrives for free as part of a "considerable" balance update.

<p>
According to McMillen, this update "heavily focuses on buffing items [players] believe are lacklustre/bad." And while no additional details have been shared as yet, McMillen <em>has</em> posted some old Isaac-related design documents - including ending storyboards, boss designs, and enemy treatments - beneath his <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/1853502568863031303">social media announcement</a>.
</p><p>
But if that's still not enough to get you into the celebratory spirit for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth's tenth anniversary, the game and all its expansions are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Rebirth/">currently discounted on Steam</a> until 11th November. There's 50 percent off the base game, and 41 percent off the Complete Bundle, which you'll need to get if you want the DLC.
</p>
<p>
As for what's next for McMillen, his long-in-the-works <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/686060/Mewgenics/">cat-breeding roguelike adventure Mewgenics</a> (initially announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/edmund-mcmillen-details-his-upcoming-cat-lady-sim-mew-genics">all the way back in 2013</a>) is expected to arrive next year.
