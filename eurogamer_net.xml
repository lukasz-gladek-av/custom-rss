            <p>Sony has announced four new games on the way to its PSVR2 headset, three of which are coming this year.</p>
<p>One of those is Dreams of Another, the next game from Q-Games - the studio behind the PixelJunk games. Dreams of Another is from multimedia artist Baiyon, the director of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pixeljunk-eden">PixelJunk Eden</a>.</p>
<p>The game sees players control "The Man in Pajamas", but has the philosophy of "No Creation Without Destruction". As such, shooting in this game creates the world around you from circular particles.</p>

<p>I was able to play the game (though not in VR) at the Game Developer Conference earlier this year, and found its use of "point cloud rendering" to be particularly mesmerising. I can only imagine how it'll look in VR, in both third and first person. Dreams of Another is due for release later this year.</p>
<p>Before that, though, there's Grit and Valor - 1949. A tactics rogue-lite, players take the role of a commander in an alternate timeline World War 2 to win battles by moving pieces chess-style on a tactical grid. It's due out on 21st August.</p>

<p>Also coming later this year is Hotel Infinity, a follow-up to Manifold Garden from Studio Chyr. This surreal puzzle game has players exploring an abstract hotel to solve riddles. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/manifold-garden-review-rewiring-strange-architecture-in-the-void">Manifold Garden received a rare Essential from Eurogamer</a>, so expect good things from this one.</p>

<p>Last up is <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/24/introducing-meteora-a-cosmic-survival-racer-for-ps-vr2/">Meteora</a>, a "cosmic survival racer" coming to PSVR2 next year. Players will navigate "explosive asteroid belts, electrically charged debris, and icy barriers" as a meteor racing across space. Energy Crystal can increase your mass and Stardust boosts your velocity, but should you focus on survivability or speed?</p>
<p>You can read more about all four games on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/24/reveals-and-updates-on-upcoming-ps-vr2-titles/">PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>
<p>Sony has been criticised for not supporting its PSVR2 headset. In its latest State of Play showcase, only one VR game was included - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-more-than-a-decade-classic-stealth-series-thief-is-being-revived-for-psvr2">Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow</a> - though this will also be released on other VR platforms.</p>
<p>The Meta-owned Beat Games also recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/support-for-beat-saber-on-ps4-and-ps4-ends-shining-a-light-on-psvr2s-lack-of-success">ended support for Beat Saber on PS4 and PS5</a>, what many consider to be VR's killer app.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Microsoft announced it has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-dips-its-toes-into-vr-with-limited-edition-xbox-themed-meta-quest-headset">collaborated with Meta on a limited edition Xbox-themed Quest 3S headset</a>, as the company dips its toes into the world of VR.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-remembers-psvr2-exists-announces-four-new-games-coming-soon]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Futuristic racer Fast Fusion will receive an update later this week, adding new tracks and a new rendering mode without upscaling.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-fast-fusion-most-technically-impressive-switch-2-launch-title">Digital Foundry reported</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> launch game actually renders at a low image resolution but uses the console's DLSS equivalent to upscale the image. Put simply, the game has been criticised for poor image quality, despite being such a fast game.</p>
<p>Now, developer Shin'en Games is introducing a new render mode called "Pure" that removes upscaling and instead renders at a native 1440p when docked (and 1080p in handheld).</p>

<p>What's more, a new Carbium Cup will be added, including three new tracks: Alpine Trust, Sunahara Plains, Zenshoh Habitat.</p>
<p>Players of previous game Fast RMX may recognise these tracks, though they have all-new graphics and changed layouts to make use of Fast Fusion's Hyperjump feature.</p>
<p>Further additions include: a new particle effect for snow, two new jukebox entries, a lower price to unlock the third cup for easier progression, fixed an issue where the game shut down when changing render mode, while stability and performance improvements have been implemented.</p>
<p>The update will arrive on 26th June.</p>

<p>Fast Fusion is one of the few brand-new launch games for Nintendo's new console. It's the follow up to Switch game Fast RMX, itself an improved version of Fast Racing Neo on Wii U.</p>
<p>Anyone who's a fan of the F-Zero or WipEout series will find much to enjoy here, with the game's high speed thrills, rollercoaster tracks, and techno soundtrack. Indeed, it's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/f-zero-gx-on-switch-2-is-virtually-unplayable-without-remapping-the-controls">modern day rival to F-Zero GX</a> - one of three GameCube games available on Switch 2 through Nintendo Switch Online.</p>

            <p>Popular gaming peripheral manufacturer Dbrand has acknowledged a defect affecting a small number of its Project Killswitch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2?page=2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> cases.</p>
<p>This defect impacts the lip attaching the joycons to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> screen, disconnecting when the console is held up by a singular joycon. Speaking to influencer Nintendo Prime, the company has stated it's in the process of fixing the issue.</p>
<p>"Yep, we're definitely working on it. Ultimately, this is a manufacturing tolerance issue on the small lip keeping the Joy-Con Grips attached to the Joy-Cons (some were a hair too thick)," Dbrand told Nintendo Prime. "We've got a replacement program set up already, where anyone who is affected is able to email robots@dbrand.com with 'July Joy-Cons' in the subject to be added to the list for replacement stock in July."</p>

<p>According to Nintendo Prime, Dbrand also acknowledged this problem was replicable among a "small number of units from their run". Nintendo Prime didn't share the exact number he was told, but reemphasised any defective Killswitch cases could be replaced for free in July.</p>
<p>There are plenty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-accessories-deals-third-party-jsaux">great third-party accessories for the Nintendo Switch 2</a> - Dbrand's Killswitch included! These enhance the play experience on what is already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">a pretty rad console</a>.

<p>The Switch 2 has proven so tempting, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/california-man-steals-10k-of-nintendo-switch-games-from-libraries-now-faces-more-than-a-large-late-fee">one bloke pilfered over $10,000 worth of Switch games from libraries</a>, one can only assume because he was <em>so</em> excited to play them all on more powerful hardware. It's not like third-party publishers couldn't do with the help, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-third-party-sales-reportedly-very-low-despite-record-breaking-console-launch">as their games struggle to ship in spite of record breaking console sales</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/popular-third-party-switch-2-case-suffers-manufacturing-defect-in-small-number-of-orders-producer-promises-its-working-on-it]]></content:encoded>
