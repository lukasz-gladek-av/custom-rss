            <p>HP is always a major player at CES in Las Vegas, and it has announced a raft of HyperX-branded and OLED-equipped gaming laptops with next-gen Intel and AMD processors - including one it claims is the "world's most powerful gaming laptop with fully internal cooling". HP has also unveiled a series of (mostly) OLED gaming monitors, including a tantalising 34-inch 360Hz ultra-wide.</p>
<p>HP is also launching a small collection of PC and console peripherals to accompany their new machines, including in-ear headsets, keyboards and a fight stick. These include some interesting options that set a promising tone for 2026. </p>
<h2><strong>HyperX Omen Max 16, Omen 16 and Omen 15 laptops</strong></h2>
<figure>

<p>HP's Omen laptops have continued to garner largely positive reviews since they launched in 2023, and now new generation models have broken cover at CES. The flagship HyperX Omen Max 16 looks particularly interesting, with a high-end spec sheet that tops out with an RTX 5090 24GB laptop graphics card and a next-gen Intel processor, consuming up to 300W of power - up 50W from the prior-gen design. HP claim that's the fastest gaming laptop on the market, barring ones that rely on external CPU or GPU cooling. Given how draining this laptop could be at full bore, it's only natural that it's fed by a redesigned 460W GaN charger. For context, that's three times more wattage than the fastest MacBook Pro charger, allowing the laptop to reach 50 percent from empty in around 30 minutes.</p><p>This laptop is also the first Omen laptop to carry the HyperX branding. Over the next year, HP is going to be moving all of its gaming PCs under the HyperX umbrella, with the Omen Max 16 being the first.</p>
<p>Other highlights from the Omen Max 16 include a 16-inch 2560x1600 OLED display rated for 240Hz play, a 1000Hz keyboard (a 4x faster polling rate than prior models) and a triple-fan cooling system. There's also AI software, as is apparently required for CES announcements, which is meant to smartly adjust system, hardware and game settings to attain the best balance of performance, fidelity and noise.</p>
<p>Finally, configurations are available with up to 64GB of DDR5 RAM and 2TB of PCIe 5.0 NVMe storage, with recent component price surges ensuring that these models will cost an arm and a leg. Thankfully, more modest configurations with RTX 5070 Ti or 5080 GPUs, 16 or 32GB of memory and 512GB or 1TB of storage are also available, though as with all of HP's announcements, no pricing information has been provided.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The vanilla HyperX Omen 16 looks like a more mainstream option at the same 16-inch size, with a wider range of current and next-gen AMD and Intel processors paired with RTX 5060 or RTX 5070 graphics solutions. The Omen 16 therefore tops out at 200W of total platform power, with a proportionately smaller battery and charger. Interestingly, one model supports an 8000Hz keyboard polling rate, something I'm surprised isn't available on the Omen 16 Max; the only other notable difference is that the 2560x1600 display is limited to 165Hz versus the 240Hz on the Max model. Expect a better value proposition here, even if you're missing out on blistering-edge performance.</p><p>The Omen 15 is likely to be the most popular offering, with an even wider range of configurations available that top out at 170W of combined CPU and GPU power. This time, some 15 different next-gen Intel (and some AMD) processors are paired with RTX 5050, 5060 or 5070 graphics cards. Memory maxes out at 48GB, storage at 1TB and screens range from a 2880x1800 120Hz OLED to a more mainstream 1920x1200 165Hz IPS display. Once again, an 8000Hz polling rate keyboard is available for minimising input lag on some models, while Omen AI optimisations are available on every variant.</p>
<h2><strong>HyperX Omen OLED 34, OLED 27q, OLED 27qs and 24 G2 gaming monitors</strong></h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>While the OLED 34 is the only one to feature a next-gen panel, the smaller options are worth considering too - especially for gaming. | <span>Image credit: <cite>HP</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>HP is going (almost) all-in on OLED gaming monitors this year, with three new OLED models and a single smaller IPS screen.</p>
<p>The flagship is the HyperX Omen OLED 34, a 3440x1440 360Hz ultra-wide monitor. Ultra-wides of this size and resolution previously topped out at 240Hz, so the OLED 34 ought to be an even better choice for playing the sorts of fast-paced esports titles that can conceivably maintain this high of a frame-rate.</p><p>The Omen OLED 34 is built around Samsung Display's new 34-inch "V-Stripe" QD-OLED panel. This next-gen screen follows LG Display's lead in moving to a vertical RGB stripe instead of the triangular subpixel arrangement found in the previous four QD-OLED generations. That ought to improve the clarity of fine elements like text, one of the very few weaknesses of OLED panels and one of the major reasons they're not as keenly recommended for productivity work as they are for playing games or watching videos. Subpar text rendering is especially noticeable on displays with relatively low pixel density values, and a 34-inch 1440p ultra-wide definitely qualifies. The screen also appears less purple under bright light than prior generation QD-OLED panels, can produce brighter highlights and is more resistant to scratches. </p>

<p>The Omen OLED 34 also boasts factory colour calibration (with a quoted average DeltaE value of less than 1.0), nearly complete coverage of the DCI P3 and Adobe RGB colour spaces (99 percent and 96 percent respectively), and the rare ability to change OSD settings from within Windows, all of which are nice additions for colour-sensitive work. If you normally work on a laptop, you'll also be glad to hear that the Omen OLED 34 supports up to 100W of USB-C charging and comes with a two-device KVM. Finally, the OLED 34 comes with a three-year warranty that covers burn-in, and HP has also shored up their burn-in and colour shift countermeasures under the "OLED CoreProtect" moniker.</p>
<p>OLED may not be the default choice for productivity, but as someone that does mix in writing, coding and photo editing amongst longer bouts of gaming, these improvements (especially the new subpixel structure) do sound appealing.</p>
<p>The HyperX Omen OLED 27q and Omen OLED 27qs are both built around 27-inch 2560x1440 panels, with the 27q clocked at a modest 240Hz and the 27qs at a blistering 500Hz. The more expensive model also benefits from a brighter display (rated for at least 500 nits in HDR), with the same excellent colour gamut coverage, factory colour calibration and other productivity-minded features as the OLED 34.</p><p>Finally, the Omen 24 G2 is the firm's new budget option, with a solid 24-inch 1920x1080 IPS panel clocked at 180Hz. This looks like a Fast IPS panel, with a quoted 1ms GtG response time, making it a good all-rounder for gaming and content creation at a significantly lower price than the OLEDs that make up the rest of the new lineup.</p>
<h2><strong>HyperX Origins 2 and Eve 1800 keyboards, Cloud Earbuds III and III S, Clutch Tachi fight stick</strong></h2>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Rounding out the announcements, HP unveiled a small collection of PC and console peripherals. The highlight for me is an Xbox-compatible fight stick, the Clutch Tachi, which uses trendy TMR switches, sports light-up pudding keycaps and can be customised with 3D-printed parts, like the Omen 34 and Omen 27qs monitors above. It also supports four SOCD modes, allowing you to set up exactly what happens when up and down or left and right inputs are sent simultaneously.</p>
<p>HP is also going magnetic with one of its keyboards, the Origins 2 Pro 65, which allows it to offer the usual raft of FPS-focused features like rapid trigger and SOCD. If you don't need that tech, you can opt for the cheaper but equally compact Origins 2 65 - or the larger Origins 2 1800 with a more compacted layout that retains all keys. Both of these use standard mechanical switches with acoustic improvements, support up to 8K polling, and can be customised with frosted cases, replacement switches and keycaps. There's even a membrane-based 1800 layout board, the Eve 1800, which probably won't be ideal for FPS but does at least come with some nifty features, such as 10-zone RGB lighting and dedicated media buttons along the left side.</p><p>Rounding out the accessories is the HyperX Cloud Earbuds III, available in a vanilla model and an upgraded Cloud Earbuds III S variant. The standard option looks affordable, with a 3.5mm output and a simple in-line remote, while a collection of four silicone ear tips aim to offer a comfortable fit. The upgraded III S instead opts for a USB connection, allowing for virtual surround sound; these also come with a small carrying case and have an up-rated microphone.</p>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>It's interesting to see that HP has turned to the HyperX brand for seemingly their whole gaming lineup these days, after acquiring the peripherals company from former owners Kingston in 2021. HP Omen definitely sounds more natural to me than "HyperX Omen", but I guess it's something I'll have to get used to. </p>
