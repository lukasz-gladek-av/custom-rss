<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a> players will receive several in-game items as "compensation" for September's troubled launched, which developer KT Racing has acknowledged was marred by "technical and server difficulties" resulting in customer "dissatisfaction".
</p>
<p>
Anyone that played Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown prior to its first major patch on 30th September will automatically receive two unique items in their inventories, both coinciding with Season 2's launch sometime after 18th December.
</p>
<p>
The first of these is a custom-built Adventurer edition of the 1986 Porsche 911 Carrera Coupe, "fully equipped for the island's off-road roads". Eligible players will also receive a pack of five stickers that can be used to customise their cars.

<p>
Before their arrival, however, Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is set to receive a second major patch, currently scheduled to launch on 5th November. This primarily features graphical enhancements for PS5, but there's also talk of optimisations for Xbox Series X/S and PC, alongside network upgrades, improved peripheral compatibility, and numerous bug fixes - as <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1249970/announcements/detail/4505380324428942358">detailed on Steam</a>, where the game is still rated Mostly Negative.

Eurogamer contributor Mike Channell detailed Solar Crown's technical woes when he reviewed it in September, finding them severe enough that the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-review-tech-issues-mar-the-return-of-the-original-name-in-open-world-racers">received two stars out of five</a>. "Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown's only hope is that it can keep its technical niggles at bay," Mike wrote, "and that its novel, lovingly crafted recreation of Hong Kong Island is enough to claw its way to cult favourite status among genre fans and digital tourists."

Ubisoft has detailed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>' "biggest update yet" ahead of its arrival later this month, sharing the news in its first developer blog since former creative director Julian Gerighty's departure to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-quietly-confirms-its-working-on-the-division-3">focus on The Division brand</a>, including The Division 3.
</p>
<p>
Gerighty confirmed he'd soon be handing over the Star Wars Outlaws reigns in an <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/star-wars-outlaws-massive-entertainment-interview-creative-director-julian-gerighty-and-game-director-mathias-karlson-exclusive/">interview with GamesRadar</a> last month, explaining, "It's been announced that I'm executive producer on The Division, so these are my last weeks [on Outlaws]". And now, new creative director Drew Rechner has provided a look ahead at Star Wars Outlaws' future.
</p>
<p>
Rechner highlighted "three key areas in which we're looking to improve the game" in a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/7n2akTSlEV3Wk1aRRwONFZ/star-wars-outlaws-dev-update-1-pushing-into-hyperdrive">new developer post</a>, starting with combat, where he sees a "real opportunity to add more depth and excitement... further rewarding your tactics and precision." Stealth, meanwhile, will see improvements to "readability and consistency of enemy detection" while also "providing choice in how you want to approach each encounter."

<p>
Developer Massive Entertainment's final focus is character controls, with the studio looking to improve "the reliability of cover... the responsiveness of climbing and crouching [and] the consistency of the controls overall." All this is set to be addressed in Star Wars Outlaws' Title Update 1.4 release on 21st November, and Rechner says specific details on the planned changes will be shared in the "upcoming weeks" .
</p><p>
21st November is also the day Star Wars Outlaws comes to Steam (Ubisoft will, of course, be bringing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-new-ubisoft-games-to-release-day-one-on-steam-starting-next-february">all its new titles to Valve's platform on launch day</a> starting February next year), and the same day the game's first story expansion, Wild Card, releases.
</p>
<p>
Star Wars Outlaws' 1.4 update marks the latest in a series of patches designed to "polish and improve the player experience" following Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">admission earlier this year</a> that sales had been "softer than expected". At the time, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said the development team was "fully mobilised" to update the game "in order to engage a large audience during the holiday season [and] position [the game] as a strong long-term performer".
