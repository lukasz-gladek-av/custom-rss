<p>Whilst the NSPCC acknowledges the risks that come with online gaming, the NSPCC also hears from many young people on the benefits of playing games, both online and offline, with one 14-year-old saying: "Sometimes I get overwhelmed with everything going on around me.</p>
<p>"My new support worker knows I love board games, and he showed me I can play Cluedo online! Itâ€™s part of my strategy now when I need a distraction, it feels really good to have plans to help me cope."</p>
<p>"The NSPCC is excited to announce the launch of the Game Safe Steam sale. The proceeds will help us to support children and young people through services, such as Childline," said Lewie Procter, head of gaming partnerships at the NSPCC.</p>
<p>"We are thrilled that popular games, such as Cluedo, Hypnospace Outlaw and Yes, Your Grace, are on sale, giving gaming fans a chance to make a difference.</p>
<p>"We want to thank Steam for partnering with us and to the developers and publishers for supporting this brilliant initiative. We are proud to work with them and look forward to continuing to raise awareness of online safety on gaming platforms."</p>

            <p>Subcult Joint's frantic 2D Metroidvania, Cookie Cutter, is finally coming to Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>As well as the base game, in which players "punch, stab, slice, and maul enemies as Cherry, a take-no-prisoners fembot trying to survive a twisted planet on the brink of destruction", the Switch Overkill Edition boasts three updates and upgrades, including fully voiced dialogue for every character, new map features, and brand-new special moves and upgrades for Cherry.</p>

<p>Other new features include new cinematics to "add more style and background to the story", "tons" of gameplay tweaks and progression balancing, and a handful of special Nintendo Switch-flavoured easter eggs, too.</p>
<p>There's also now a new feature that helps you "gauge completion status".</p>
<p>"Love turns to rage and chainsaws in Cookie Cutter, a bold new take on the Metroidvania sub-genre," teases the blurb. "Cookie Cutter features gorgeous hand-drawn animation, an enormous dystopian world to explore, epic boss fights, gruesome carnage, and so much more."</p>
<p>As yet there's no firm release date, but publisher Rogue Games hints it'll be "this spring"/Q2. Players on PC via Steam, PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X/S don't have to wait, of course - Cherry's already waiting for you.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 developer and publisher Saber and Focus has acknowledged fans' "cold" response to recent changes, stressing to players they were "not looking to transform Space Marine 2 into a full live service game".</p>
<p>After introducing a new way for players to unlock cosmetic items, the team acknowledged player "FOMO" but assured the community that the items would be available "for everyone" "later", expecting only "the most dedicated players" able to unlock items early.</p>

<p>"We have noted that the Community Events have received cold feedback since we introduced them as an additional way to unlock cosmetic items," the teams at Saber and Focus wrote in a <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/166-february-community-update">joint update</a>.</p>
<p>"We saw that many of you mentioned FOMO generated by the events. Rest assured, we are not looking to transform Space Marine 2 into a full live service game. The items available through events WILL be available later, for everyone. We want Community Events to be a way to unlock the items in advance, for the most dedicated players, and not to be a source of frustration and stress for everyone.</p>
<p>"However, that means we must provide a smooth experience in unlocking said items, which has not been the case so far," the statement added. "We deeply apologise for the trouble, and are currently working on a simplified process to unlock the items, to make the experience less constraining."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the update, Focus confirmed there's still "a bit of a wait" for Patch 7, but 6.0 Datavault Update released earlier this month ushers in new free and season pass content, as well as new packs, maps, perks, and QoL improvements.</p>

            <p>Capcom is "investigating" an issue that's impeding progress for some players in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>
<p>Players are reporting that in Main Mission: Chapter 5-2 A World Turned Upside Down, a key NPC is not spawning where they should, essentially blocking all further campaign progress.</p>

<p>"Hunters, we are currently investigating the following issue," the publisher/developer stated on social media.</p>

<p>As yet, there's no confirmation on when this may be addressed, but Capcom has been whack-a-mole-ing issues fairly swiftly over the weekend. For instance, <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/1896084293438648676">a hot fix patch resolving issues with the Smithy and "Grill a Meal"</a> is already live, so make sure you apply any patches before you play to ensure you're using the latest version.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds has already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">smashed the 1m concurrent players barrier on Steam</a> and if you're one of the many players who likes to jump back into the character editor because you've given your hunter a beer gut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-you-can-change-your-monster-hunter-wilds-character-once-for-free-before-capcom-makes-you-pay-up">you might appreciate knowing you can modify your character once for free</a>, but any further substantive changes to your gender or body shape requires before Capcom makes you cough up some cash.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Eurogamer Monster Hunter Wilds review</a>, our Matt awarded it 4/5, saying: "Wilds remains an exhilarating piece of work - so refined, so alive, so giddily, chaotically joyful when it all comes together that it feels like the ultimate culmination of everything the series has been working toward over the last two decades.</p>
<p>"And if it continues Monster Hunter's legacy of generous post-launch support - where the series has traditionally felt the freest to get daft and indulge in its more sadistic tendencies - it'll be fascinating to see how this beautiful new baseline for the series develops."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
