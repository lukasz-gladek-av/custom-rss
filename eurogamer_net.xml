        <p>Hitting the milestone unlocks a bevy of treats for all who pre-register.</p>

            <p>Over 30 million people have pre-registered for Infinity Nikki.</p>
<p>Consequently, Infold Games confirmed all registration milestones have been unlocked, meaning players across PC, PS5, and mobile devices will secure a four-star outfit, 20 Resonite Crystals, 300 Threads of Purity, and 50,000 Blings.</p>

<p>To mark the achievement, Infold dropped a new gameplay overview trailer subtitled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54yRMWCF3hs">Unfold Your Whim</a>, "offering a glimpse into the journey ahead".</p>
<p>Infinity Nikki tasks players with collecting Whimstars and special outfits that give Nikki unique abilities.</p>
<p>"Each new ability allows Nikki to explore deeper, discover hidden paths, and interact with the vibrant open world around her," Infold teases. "Alongside her, Momo, her loyal companion, offers a camera feature for players to capture memorable moments throughout their adventure."</p>
<p>For some, this milestone may not be surprising. In August, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-dress-up-adventure-from-legend-of-zelda-dev-has-over-12-million-pre-registrations">over 12 million of us had already signed up</a> for the "cosy open-world adventure" follow-up to the highly successful mobile series of dress-up games.</p>
<p>We still don't have a release date for Infinity Nikki yet, however when the time does come, it will be available across PlayStation and PC, alongside Android and iOS devices. In the meantime, you can still <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/news/2">sign up for the Infinity Nikki playtest here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The release marks the first time the fan-favourite action-RPG will be available on a physical PS5 disc, as the collector's edition merely included a download code.</p>

<p>"Mark your calendars! Black Myth: Wukong arrives in physical form on 12th December, 2024!" PM Studios posted to X/Twitter.</p>
<p>Asked if that date also applied to UK purchases, PM Studios simply replied: "Yep!", then <a href="https://x.com/PMStudiosUSA/status/1854923502605783056">confirmed</a> the same release date for players in Europe.</p> <div>

<p>At the time of writing, it's unclear if the physical edition will ship with any accompanying goodies, such as an instruction manual, but it has been confirmed that it includes the "deluxe edition upgrade" as well as the base game.</p>
<p>The deluxe edition includes the Bronzecloud Staff weapon, Wind Chimes curio, and the Folk Opera armour set. You'll also get a "selected" digital soundtrack.</p>
<p>Microsoft has again confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch">delay to the Xbox release of Black Myth: Wukong</a> is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates">not due to "platform limitations"</a>.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong was released in August on PC and PS5, but the Xbox version was delayed for an unknown reason. Speculation grew the developer was struggling to run the game on the Series S console, while other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusion-over-black-myth-wukongs-missing-xbox-release-follows-claims-of-playstation-exclusivity">rumours suggested the game was, in fact, a PlayStation console exclusive</a>.</p>
<p>A representative from Microsoft has now confirmed the game is still on the way, though it won't comment "on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-continues-its-dominance-with-new-milestone">Black Myth: Wukong had already sold 10m copies</a> after just three days on sale, even without an Xbox version.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
