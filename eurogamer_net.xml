  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Slowly but steadily, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is building up an impressive library of third-party ports, and Bethesda has been aggressively (and unsurprisingly) pushing to get as many of its heavy hitters on the platform since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a>'s arrival last December. Now, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> has arrived to great fanfare and is surprisingly great on the hybrid console.</p>
<p>Of course, we always wanted the FO4 Switch 2 port to turn out good, but our expectations were lowered after Skyrim's frankly disastrous launch on the system (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skyrim-switch-2-port-gets-proper-performance-and-quality-modes">which has since been fixed and greatly improved</a>). Would it mirror that mess or the Skyrim port's latest iteration? The answer is surprising: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a> currently offers an even better experience than Skyrim across both docked and portable play.</p>
<p>The shocker comes in the form of three different graphical modes available from the get-go versus Skyrim's two: Quality, Balanced, and Performance. In-game, however, they're named as 30, 40, and 60 FPS targets respectively, but that's what they are. The presence of the 40 FPS mode instantly confirms Fallout 4 is making good use of the Switch 2's 120 Hz screen and VRR capabilities, but it seems the 30 and 60 FPS modes also run on portable mode without lowering the refresh rate, with helps with responsiveness across the board. Even better, I've yet to notice any instances of screen tearing. Another pleasant surprise is TVs with 120 Hz capabilities can access the 40 FPS mode too.</p>
<p>In-depth testing by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdPfzW17WPM">ElAnalistaDeBits</a> has also revealed that, in docked mode, the game targets 1440p at 30 FPS, 1080p at 40 FPS with a nearly identical graphical setup, and dynamic 1080p (often below the target) with lowered graphical settings at 60 FPS. On portable mode, 1080p is the target in all modes, but the image can get quite blurry in Performance (60 FPS) mode. Check out my own screenshots near Sanctuary below:</p>



<p>The 30 FPS mode is the clear winner here when it comes to image clarity and settings, with texture resolution and filtering also seeing a significant boost vs. the other modes. Of course, you'll have to put up with less responsive controls and sluggish camera movement that just doesn't feel good enough anymore if you ask me.</p><p>The 40 FPS mode looks noticeably softer, but still provides a clean image result even when playing in portable mode in my experience. The extra 10 frames per second greatly help with the game feel, and with the console's 120 Hz screen, it lands very close to the experience of running it at 60 FPS.</p>
<p>Finally, at 60 FPS, you're getting frankly good results in interiors and areas that aren't overly busy, but the console has a harder time hitting the target in most exterior areas and crowded enemy encounters. This isn't such a big deal when running the game in portable mode due to VRR's help, but the image simply becomes too soft and blurry, especially when looking at distant details. Even my girlfriend, who typically doesn't pay much attention to graphics and was playing FO4 for the first time last night, complained about it looking "bad." Perhaps the shocker here is the actual graphical settings didn't seem as paired back as in Skyrim when going for 60 FPS.</p>

<p>As for stability, I'm happy to report it hasn't crashed on me a single time yet, something I couldn't say about the recent re-releases of the game on other platforms. Load times are virtually identical to recent iterations of the game on consoles, too. The missed opportunity here might be the lack of gyro or mouse controls, which makes Skyrim a more complete port at the time of writing. Hopefully, patches will add in those platform-specific control options as the fifth Elder Scrolls gets a 40 FPS Balance mode in exchange for them.</p><p>Overall, I'm quite impressed with this Fallout 4 port at launch, especially considering the current-gen refreshes and last year's Anniversary Edition launch were a bit of a technical nightmare. Moreover, lessons were learned following Skyrim's disappointing launch and recent improvements. Though the teams and tech involved are different, I'm now quite excited for how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-everything-announced">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Oblivion Remastered</a> could be translated to Switch 2 later this year.</p>

            <p>French video game publisher Nacon has filed for insolvency, after the company's majority shareholder Bigben Interactive failed to make the partial repayment of its bond loan to its bondholders. This, Nacon said, was due to "an unexpected and late refusal by its banking pool".</p>
<p>A company is insolvent when it can't pay its debts, meaning it is at risk of being closed down. Last week, the Styx: Blades of Greed publisher stated its situation "required the rapid implementation of a financial restructuring with its creditors in order to ensure the continuity of its operations". </p>
<p>This morning, Nacon subsequently announced its available assets "do not allow it to meet its due liabilities". As such, the company will now file for insolvency with the Court and "request the opening of judicial reorganisation proceedings".</p>

<p>The publisher stated its aim is to "assess all possible solutions to ensure the sustainability of the company's activity under the best possible conditions, protect employees, and preserve jobs, while renegotiating with its creditors in a calm and constructive framework".</p><p>Nacon said this procedure will allow the publisher to "continue its business, renegotiate its debts, and develop a credible and effective continuation plan". It added the suspension of the company's share price which was first announced on 20th February will remain in effect for now.</p>
<p>In addition to the recently-released Styx: Blades of Greed, Nacon also handled publishing duties for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hell-is-us">Hell is Us</a> and RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business, to name a few. The publisher will be hosting its next Nacon Connect showcase next month, on 4th March. You can check out a little teaser for it below.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/styx-blades-of-greed-review">Jim recently awarded Styx: Blades of Greed four stars</a>, stating while it "isn't quite as well cut out as a fine piece of quartz", it is still "easily the best stealth game in years".</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Bungie has released another Marathon short cinematic trailer for one of its playable characters / shells, this time for Rook. All this only a few days prior to the game's scheduled Server Slam test.</p>
<p>Unlike prior trailers, which show off the combat prowess of the various types of shells players can use, Rook is a scavenger keen on looting scraps rather than taking on fights themselves. We see them temporarily turn NPC enemies friendly, only to be scared by one of the other shells they're looting and unloading their gun haphazardly.</p>
<p>This then turns the pacifism off from those NPCs, causing rook to run away with their ill-gotten goods. It's the classic loot goblin archetype from extraction shooters, for players keen on avoiding fights and being a bit of a vulture in-game. We even see alien vulture-like creatures throughout the trailer, hitting the point home.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this marks yet another character trailer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-come-has-come-for-you-to-judge-marathon-for-yourself-again-theres-a-new-server-slam-running-late-feb-into-march">ahead of the Marathon Server Slam</a>. Between the 26th February until the 2nd March. During this time, anyone interested in trying out Marathon will be able to do so for free, ahead of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-soars-to-steams-top-sellers-after-release-date-reveal">the game's full release on the 5th March</a>.</p><p>In other Marathon news, the developers recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-outlines-marathon-networking-and-security-features">released information about the game's security features and anti-cheat initiatives</a>, stating there will be no second chances for those found cheating in Bungie's upcoming extraction shooter. The game continues to show signs of early popularity even before its released, sticking to the upper echelons of Steam's Top Sellers page prior to its debut.</p>

            <p>The live-action God of War series from Amazon and Sony has found its Baldur.</p>
<p>Ed Skrein has been cast as Baldur in the upcoming show. Skrein's previous roles include in Jurassic World Rebirth, where he played Bobby Atwater, and as supervillain Francis Freeman / Ajax in Deadpool. He also popped up in Game of Thrones' third season as Daario Naharis.</p>

<p>Fans of the games will of course know who Baldur is (yes, my butt got kicked and then some), but for those unfamiliar with the God of War antagonist, here's the show's official character description, as shared by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/ed-skrein-cast-baldur-prime-video-god-of-war-1236734596/">Deadline</a>:</p>
<p>"Baldur may be the youngest son of Odin, but he's his father's most dangerous weapon. Charismatic, unpredictable and armed with a razor-sharp tongue, Baldur lives by his own rules. As a boy, Baldur was cursed; this curse denied him the ability to feel pleasure and physical sensation. This fuels an insatiable anger and bloodlust in Baldur, who favors a brawling fighting style that blends his immense power with the raw impact of his fists.</p>
<p>"Above all else, he longs for an opponent that can truly match his prowess in battle. An opponent that can finally make him feel something." (Enter Kratos stage right.)</p>
