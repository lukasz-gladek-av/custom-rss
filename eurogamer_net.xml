            <p>Speaking to Eurogamer, Grasshopper Manufacture co-founder and Romeo is a Dead Man director Goichi Suda (also known as Suda 51) has spoken more about his opinions of generative AI in game development, after previous statements indicating the technology wouldn't be used in the upcoming action game.</p>
<p>Eurogamer asked Suda on whether the Romeo is a Dead Man people will play in a few days would be as good, or artistic, a game if generative AI were used in its development, he responded with the following:</p>
<p>"For me personally, a lot of the AI stuff I see pops up on social media. As far as it's come, there's something about the images and videos you see that feels off. Most people have that same kind of sense, something psychological lets you know something isn't right here. Something's kinda funky.</p>

<p>"They've been saying the day will come when AI will fool people, when you won't know something is AI. That may be true, but honestly, I don't think it has reached those levels yet. When I see something made with generative AI something in the back of my brain gets set off.</p><p>"If I used AI to make Romeo: A.) it would have been a fake Romeo. Not that he was a real person to begin with, but people would notice something shallow about the character. He would be hard to relate to, and kind of creepy.</p>
<p>"And, B.) The way we make games now, the specific skills of the studio and people we know, be it practical effects, art, creating graphics on their own… those skills and passion the humans put into their works comes across to players. It's something people can feel, not just that it was person-made not AI-made, but you can tell someone poured their heart into this. Someone worked hard to make this happen."</p>
<p>When asked about his previous statements, and how he felt about Japan's Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association survey last year which found <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese developers were using the technology in some form</a>, Suda emphasised he didn't have strong feelings on it, and shared his belief that wider use of the technology would depend on player wants.</p>
<p>He also revealed that, at one point, Netease had a research section looking into generative AI, but eventually shuttered it for reasons Suda couldn't confirm for certain. He did, however, have his theories.</p>
<p>"As far as not using any AI for our games, it started as a Netease policy for all their companies," Suda said. "They originally had a section researching and developing AI-related stuff, but at one point they decided not to do that any more. They folded that section and told their studios to not use AI in games, to not use it at all."</p><p>Suda, when asked why exactly the section shut down, shared his own assumptions. "I don't know, they never explained directly why. If I had to assume, it was probably one or both of two things. A lot of gamers out there don't like AI and having it in their games. Another thing is issues with copyright infringement. That can be tricky to get around, and clear before making something. That was probably part of it too - it would be easier to get rid of it altogether. But, again, that's my assumption. No one told me directly."</p>

            <p>Epic Games has released a series of new figures today as part of a "year in review" lookback on Steam storefront rival, Apple lawsuit bane, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> forever-maker the Epic Games Store - and there are some interesting stats in the mix.</p>
<p>The headline figure, of a few, is that the Epic Games Store hit a total of 6.65bn gameplay hours in games launched via the store - a number that is down noticeably year-on-year, by 14 percent. But third-party gameplay hours - that is, time spent playing games that aren't Fortnite or any other published by Epic - were up by 4 percent to 2.78bn. Between the lines then, that suggests a fairly notable drop in first-party games' playtime, specifically that of Fortnite, with the wildly popular battle royale-cum-crossover platform still the top game on the store overall.</p>
<p>"That's the logical conclusion on hours [played]," Epic Games Store's vice president and general manager, Steve Allison, confirmed to Eurogamer during a brief interview on the figures. "But you've got to remember Fortnite's coming off one of its best years ever on PC," he added, noting that "relative to the state of the industry," it was still "outpacing" a lot of other games. Fortnite "still remains the biggest game in the world on many fronts," he added, while conceding that "the conclusion is fair and accurate" that it had seen a noticeable drop compared to 2024, enough to offset the rest of the store's growth.</p>
<p>Another key stat from the review details player spending - a tad businessy, maybe, but something that makes for interesting reading amongst the ongoing debate on live service games and, frankly, the future sustainability of the industry as a whole. There, third-party games saw a huge increase in spending, up by 57 percent to $400m. For context, Epic had what Allison called a "down year" in 2024, where the equivalent spending was $255 million, 18 percent down on 2023's figure of $310m, which also makes last year's increase especially large.</p><p>The reasonable guess as to what drove that would be the rising popularity of 'gacha' games, such as Kuro Games' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuthering-waves-tier-list-best-characters-9436">Wuthering Waves</a> and MiHoYo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai Star Rail</a>, on the store. Epic puts Wuthering Waves, Honkai, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> in its top five, 'mythic'-rated top games rankings, alongside staples Fortnite and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rocket-league">Rocket League</a>, and their relatively aggressive monetisation, centred on gachapon vending machine-style loot boxes, would suggest that's where the big spending growth is coming from.</p>
<p>"Obviously MiHoYo does really well here, and has chosen to be exclusive here" Allison said, "but they are not the lion's share of the spending on the store." Instead, Allison claimed the spending was "pretty dispersed across third-party games." Notably, other high-ranking games on the store continue to be live services with significant microtransactions, such as EA Sports FC 26, Grand Theft Auto 5, and Infinity Nikki.</p>
<p>There was also another record set, in total monthly active users playing Epic Game Store games in December 2025, with 78m logged-on, presumably tying in with the usual flurry of holiday freebies and sales - but again that's offset, this time over the wider year's average. Monthly active users were down 1 percent to 67m on average, and daily active users down 2 percent to 31m.</p>
<p>Those free games meanwhile have now ticked over the 100 mark, with 662m free games claimed, Epic putting the total value of those - presumably at full retail price - at $2,316 per player.</p>
<p>Finally, Epic also announced some relatively big plans for the Epic Game Store in terms of new features this year, including social functionality that "maybe is better than anyone's doing," Allison said. Expect much more on those, and the wider player opinion of the Epic Games Store, from us here very soon.</p>

            <p>It appears that the press kit for Ubisoft's cancelled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</a> would have included a collectible dagger.</p>
<p>A video which allegedly shows off this collectible was recently shared online, with the dagger being unpacked from a wooden box with Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake markings.</p>

<p>While this dagger is, for now, only an alleged collectible for Ubisoft's Sands of Time remake, which would have been part of the press Kit sent out to media, many have said its reported existence shows just how close the Prince of Persia team was to releasing its game.</p><p>As a reminder, Ubisoft's Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-details-whats-new-in-its-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">unveiled in 2020</a>, but suffered numerous delays and setbacks since. This included the game seemingly being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-years-on-ubisofts-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-still-in-the-conception-phase">rebooted from scratch</a> in 2023. However, it seemed the great wait was coming to an end, as towards the end of last year, Ubisoft itself had its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">Sands of Time Remake slated for release during"Q4" of the current financial year</a>, which comes to an end on 31st March. So, in just a couple of months.</p>
<p>Alas, it wasn't to be, though, and last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">Ubisoft announced a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset"</a>, which saw the company delay seven unspecified projects, close two studios and cancel multiple games including its Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has Ubisoft for comment on the alleged <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> press kit.</p>

<p>Soon after Ubisoft announced its company reset, the team behind Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time's embattled remake shared a few words of its own, acknowledging the cancellation was "deeply disappointing" for fans. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sands-of-times-shock-cancellation-does-not-mean-we-are-stepping-away-from-the-franchise-says-remake-team">it was keen to stress this "does not mean [its] stepping away from the franchise" for good</a>.</p>
