            <p>After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-announcement-teased-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-latest-map">plenty of whispers and speculation</a>, today Activision confirmed what we were all hoping for: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</a> and 4 are back, and getting remade from the ground up.</p>
<p>The upcoming combined remake will feature new skaters (so, professional skateboarder Tyshawn Jones, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mystery-tony-hawk-remaster-now-mentioned-by-pro-skater-involved-in-the-game-even-though-activision-hasnt-announced-it-yet">let slip he was part of the game ahead of today's announcement</a>), as well as "gnarlier tricks, an even sicker soundtrack, and, for the first time in 10 years - brand-new parks". That soundtrack will include songs from the original games such as Ace of Spades by Motorhead, as well as new tracks which "capture the spirit of modern skate culture".</p>
<p>The game will also boast cross-platform online multiplayer for up to eight skaters.</p>

<p>"Developed with attention to detail by Iron Galaxy Studios and in collaboration with Tony Hawk and Activision, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 picks up seamlessly right where the critically acclaimed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> 1 and 2 game left off," the official blurb reads.</p>
<p>"Choose from a legendary pro skater roster that includes Tony Hawk, Bucky Lasek, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Geoff Rowley, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Chad Muska, Eric Koston, Rodney Mullen, Jamie Thomas, Rune Glifberg, and Bob Burnquist, or opt for the new skaters, including Rayssa Leal, Chloe Covell, Jamie Foy, Zion Wright, and Yuto Horigome. And, in true Tony Hawk's Pro Skater fashion, there will be secrets to unlock."</p>
<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be released across PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC (via Steam, Battle.net and Microsoft Store), and Nintendo Switch on 11th July. It will also be coming to Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC.</p>
<p>If you are interested in getting your hands on Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/">you can pre-order now</a>. Those that do will gain access to the Foundry Demo coming in June (although, please note this demo will only be available across PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC), as well as the Wireframe Tony Shader at launch.</p>

<p>If you choose to plump for either the Digital Deluxe and Collector's Edition, you will also get earlier access to the full game, beginning 8th July. The Digital Deluxe Edition of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will also give you access to other extras such as Doom Slayer and Revenant characters, in-game skate decks, Create-a-Skater items, and "more".</p>
<p>The Collector's Edition, meanwhile,  includes everything in the Digital Deluxe Edition, but also comes with a Limited-Edition full-size Birdhouse skateboard deck which has a printed Tony Hawk autograph.</p>

<p>Plans to give Pro Skater 3 and 4 the remake treatment were reportedly scrapped after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-studio-vicarious-visions-has-been-merged-into-blizzard">Activision made the decision to merge developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard</a> in 2021. But, that clearly wasn't the end of it after all, and in September last year, Tony Hawk himself teased something was in the pipeline. More pertinently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-has-been-talking-to-activision-again-as-pro-skater-25th-anniversary-looms">Hawk revealed he had been "talking to Activision again" last September</a>, and added these talks were " insanely exciting" and he was "working on something" with the studio.</p>
<p>So, are you ready to get back on your boards when Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 releases this summer?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
