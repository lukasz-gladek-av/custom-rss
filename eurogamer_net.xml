            <p>Escape from Tarkov is coming to Steam.</p>
<p>Rumours began to swirl when Battlestate's head of studio, Nikita Buyanov, posted a captionless gif to X/Twitter over the weekend showing an old man delightedly holding down the steam button on his iron.</p>

<p>Definitive proof? Hardly, even if Buyanov were willing to troll his own playerbase. Fast-forward to today, though – 31st August – and it's confirmed: Escape from Tarkov is coming to Steam.</p> <div>

<p>The page has yet to go live on Valve's digital store, so we're yet to get any of the specific details, but Buyanov shared an image of the Steam logo superimposed on a Steam listing for Escape from Tarkov (see above), and wrote: "Yes! The page on Steam will be available soon. All the details later."</p>
<p>The Steam launch could coincide with another milestone for Battlestate – version 1.0 the tactical FPS will finally release on 15th November, 2025.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/escape-from-tarkov-apologises-for-pve-mode-misstep-saying-it-did-not-foresee-such-a-reaction">Last year, Escape from Tarkov developer Battlestate apologised</a> after it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/escape-from-tarkov-u-turns-on-decision-to-lock-exclusive-pve-mode-to-a-special-edition-following-blacklash">u-turned on a decision to lock an "exclusive" PvE mode to its €300 Unheard Edition</a> following player feedback, saying it is "very sorry that fans and the game community in general are experiencing these feelings".</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> will reportedly sell for around £17/$20/€20.</p>
<p>That's according to eagle-eyed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> fans who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1n3hj7a/gamestop_listed_silksong_with_price/">spotted</a> that the highly anticipated sequel was listed on <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nintendo-switch/products/hollow-knight-silksong---nintendo-switch/432032.html">Gamestop</a> (link since deleted) for $20.</p>
<p>Initially, it was thought this <em>had</em> to be a placeholder price, as the game has long been the <a href="https://gaminganalytics.info/gbwish_last">most wishlisted title on the Steam platform</a>. When players tried to purchase the game but couldn't complete checkout, this only strengthened the feeling the listing had to have been incorrect.</p>

<p>However, since then, noted and usually reliable <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n496oj/billbilkun_hollow_knight_silksong_price_is_1999/">Dealabs leaker</a> Billbil-Kun has <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/hollow-knight-silksong-on-vous-devoile-le-prix-de-sa-version-pc-60443">all but confirmed the rumour</a>, revealing not just the Steam prices for Hollow Knight: Silksong, but also the price point on GOG.</p>
<p>According to the leaker's "recent research", Silksong will indeed retail for less than £20/$20/€20:</p>
<ul>
<li>UK: £16.75 (Steam) / (GOG Unknown)</li>
<li>Europe: €19.50 (Steam) / €8.29 (GOG)</li>
<li>U.S.: $19.99 (Steam) / $19.99 (GOG)</li>
<li>Canada: $25.99 (Steam) / $27.19 (GOG)</li>
<li>Australia: $29.50 (Steam) / $30.19 (GOG)</li>
<li>New Zealand: $28.99 (Steam) / (GOG Unknown)</li>
<li>Japan: (Steam Unknown) / ¥2939 (GOG)</li>
</ul>
<p>The price points for console and Switch versions remain unknown. Dealabs did, however, add weight to rumours that there is no physical version of the game planned at this time.</p>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong will release on Thursday, 4th September 2025 for PC, Switch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series. Yet contrary to what you may believe, Silksong hasn't been in development hell for that time, however – in fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-silksong-hasnt-been-in-development-hell-hype-skyrocketed-sales-of-the-original-game-to-give-team-cherry-financial-freedom">Team Cherry's developers say they were just having too much fun making it</a>.</p><p>The end of months of speculation has not been good news for all, of course; announcing the date so late in the game's development - a mere two weeks from release - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksongs-release-date-causes-delays-for-more-games-than-you-might-think">meant a slew of games which already had early September release dates suddenly found themselves in a difficult position</a>.</p>
