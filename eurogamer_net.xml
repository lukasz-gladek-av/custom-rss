            <p>UK prime minister Keir Starmer has called the firing of 31 employees from GTA developer Rockstar "deeply concerning", adding that ministers will look into the controversial dismissals.</p>
<p>Last month, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">Grand Theft Auto maker was accused of union busting</a> after it fired Rockstar staff who were purportedly involved in union activities. The company, however, claimed the affected staff were fired for gross misconduct. Soon after, UK trade union Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff">issued a legal claim against Rockstar</a> for these dismissals, again noting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-rockstar-games-staff-were-fired-for-sharing-internal-company-messages-on-an-employee-and-union-only-discord-server-new-report-suggests">all those affected were union members</a>. Meanwhile, over 200 employees from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-north">Rockstar North</a> signed a letter to management, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-a-blatant-unapologetic-act-of-vicious-union-busting-hundreds-of-rockstar-employees-sign-letter-to-management-demanding-fired-colleagues-get-reinstated">condemning its actions</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the topic has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstars-controversial-dismissal-of-31-employees-is-such-a-big-deal-its-made-its-way-to-uk-parliament">arisen once again in parliament</a>, with Edinburgh East and Musselburgh MP Chris Murray asking the prime minister if he agrees all companies "regardless of profit size" must "follow UK employment law and all workers have the right to join a union".</p>

<p>Responding to Murray's concerns regarding Rockstar, Starmer said: "It's a deeply concerning case. Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we're determined to strengthen workers rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union.</p>
<p>"Our ministers will look into the particular case the member raises and will keep him updated."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Murray met with the IWGB about the dismissals at Rockstar. "This has impacted many residents in varying ways, all have lost their livelihood, all have lost a role which they have invested a combined 200 years of service to, with some residents even now forced to leave the UK due to the removal of their visa sponsor," Murray said. "The consequences of this decision by Rockstar on so many families cannot be understated".</p><p>The Edinburgh East and Musselburgh MP additionally arranged a meeting with Rockstar to question the developer about its actions. "The meeting only entrenched my concerns about the process Rockstar used to dismiss so many of their staff members," Murray stated, adding he was "not assured their process paid robust attention to UK employment law". Further, the MP said the meeting with Rockstar did not convince him that the company's course of action was "necessary".</p>
<p>"Alarmingly, I did not leave informed on exactly what these 31 people had done to warrant their immediate dismissal," he closed. "The meeting began with us MPs refused entry unless an NDA was signed, a request they eventually withdrew after it being made clear this would not be signed."</p>

<p>Along with the ongoing situation between the affected members of staff and Rockstar, the company also recently also delayed the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, moving the game from May of next year into November. </p>
<p>Publisher Take-Two said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">the most recent GTA 6 delay is designed to give "some additional time to finish the game with the high level of polish players expect and deserve"</a>. It added "Rockstar has our full support of course", and that the Take-Two team is "confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience".</p>
