            <p>Nintendo's Alarmo clock now has a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> theme in a free update.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-just-unveiled-an-alarm-clock-that-plays-mario-coin-noises-when-you-roll-over">Nintendo announced the device</a>, it stated Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> themes would soon be available by linking a Nintendo Account.</p>
<p>Now Mario Kart is available, though there's no news yet on that Animal Crossing theme.</p>

<p>A Nintendo Account is required for the download, but so is purchasing an Alarmo. It's currently not on general sale in Europe and America and is only available to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers.</p>
<p>In Japan, subscribers must enter a lottery for a chance to purchase. However, that was recently changed to a pre-order opportunity with delivery not expected until early February 2025.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-no-longer-publicly-launching-99-alarmo-clock-in-japan-this-january">wider launch was planned for mid-February next year</a>, but this has been postponed due to stock shortages.</p> <div>

            <p>Marvel Rivals game director Thaddeus Sasser has said he believes PlayStation sci-fi shooter Concord failed because it didn't bring anything of "unique value" to its players.</p>
<p>Sasser's own game Marvel Rivals released last week across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. After a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/free-to-play-hero-shooter-marvel-rivals-off-to-heroic-start-on-steam">confident start on Steam specifically</a>, the free-to-play shooter went on to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-opening-weekend-sees-10m-players-join-in">welcome over 10 million players on its debut weekend</a>. In contrast, and despite high hopes from Sony, Concord failed to take off in the same way. Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-sales-fail-to-lift-off-on-steam-where-just-660-people-played-at-launch">a lacklustre launch</a> in August, the game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">taken offline just two weeks after its PC and PS5 debut</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/marvel-rivals-dev-concord-failed-it-didnt-bring-any-unique-value/">VideoGamer</a> <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/podcasts/new-videogamer-podcast-3-marvel-rivals-interview-w-thaddeus-sasser/">podcast</a> prior to Marvel Rivals' release, Sasser said he believed Concord didn't bring anything original to the table which would entice players to jump over from other popular shooters already on the market. "There's a switching cost," the director said. "I've already invested in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, I've got 15 skins for Pharah, I'm not going anywhere."</p>

<p>"As a game developer you're always worried until the audience has responded," the Marvel Rivals director continued, admitting he was cautious about releasing another free-to-play hero shooter into the wild.</p>
<p>"The truth is that I don't think anybody can accurately predict this or the game industry would be radically different today. There's a lot of games that come out that people are like 'it's going to do well' then it flops or people come out and go 'it's going to flop' and it succeeds amazingly. So, I think it's really hard to tell ahead of time and you're always worried about that."</p>
<p>Sasser believes Marvel Rivals has the fact that players can take on the guise of well known superheroes in its favour, and this hook gives people a reason to check out the game.</p>
<p>"I don't know about you, but when I heard the concept of the game I was like 'Oh my God I want to go be Storm in a game', 'I want to go be Doctor Strange in a game'. I want to be those heroes in the game, that sounds awesome," he said.</p><p>"And of course my mind immediately leapt to all the cool possibilities you could have with that. That's what I think will pull people in as well too. If we've done our jobs well, they'll love what they play and they'll want to play some more."</p>
<p>The numbers speak for themselves. At the time of writing, there are still 197,120 Steam players in the game, with a 24 hour concurrent player peak of 441,152. Its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/#app_reviews_hash">Steam reviews</a>, meanwhile, sit with a 'Mostly Positive' average.</p>

            <p>
Xenoblade studio Monolith Soft is now 100 percent owned by Nintendo. 
</p>
<p>
Based in Tokyo, with a second office in Nintendo's home of Kyoto, Monolith Soft has become a key partner studio for the Mario maker over the past two decades, and has provided development support for some of Nintendo's biggest titles, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>.
</p>
<p>
Now, Nintendo has increased its stake in the company to fully own it, after initially purchasing 80 percent of Monolith Soft from Bandai Namco in 2007. Nintendo then increased its stake to 96 percent in 2011, while the company's original owners retained a symbolic four percent stake.

<p>
Nintendo has not officially announced the change, but its 100 percent ownership of the company was recently added to Monolith Soft's website, as spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-now-owns-100-of-monolith-soft/">Automaton</a>.
</p>
<p>
Monolith Soft began its era as a Nintendo-exclusive studio in 2008 with a range of smaller titles, including Wii shooter Disaster: Day of Crisis and RPG Soma Bringer for Nintendo DS.
</p>
<p>
But it was the 2010 launch of Wii RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> which saw Monolith Soft find its new niche. Three sequels have followed, with Wii U game re-release <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-10">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a>: Definitive Edition set to launch on Switch in March 2025.
</p><p>
In the background, Monolith Soft has also provided extra development support to Nintendo's own internal development houses. It has assisted Nintendo with all three <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon">Splatoon</a> titles, the past three Animal Crossing games, and is now a regular co-developer on The Legend of Zelda series, with credits on Skyward Sword, A Link Between Worlds, Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
What could the studio be working on next for Switch 2?

            <p>Employees at FromSoftware owner Kadokawa are reportedly optimistic about a potential buyout from Sony due to frustration with current management.</p>
<p>Kadokawa suffered a ransomware cyberattack earlier this year, but employees were left disappointed by the response from current president and CEO Takeshi Natsuno.</p>
<p>As a result, employees are said to be "thrilled at the prospect of an acquisition by Sony", according to a new report from Japanese outlet <a href="https://bunshun.jp/articles/-/75402">Bunshun</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/kadokawas-employees-are-reportedly-optimistic-about-a-sony-buyout-because-theyre-itching-for-a-change-in-leadership/">Automaton</a>).</p>

</div><figcaption>Is Sony buying FromSoftware's parent company the next big games industry acquisition?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvqusIyhV2M" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"The people around me are thrilled at the prospect of an acquisition by Sony," a veteran Kadokawa employee told Bunshun.</p>
<p>"That's because there's a certain number of employees who are dissatisfied with the Natsuno administration, which didn't even bother to hold a press conference after peoples' personal information was leaked in the cyberattack. They expect that if Sony were to acquire the company, they would get rid of the president first."</p>
<p>The cyberattack against Kadokawa included video streaming platform NicoNico, as well as personal employee information as part of 1.5 terabytes of stolen data.</p>
<p>Former chairman Tsuguhiko Kadokawa - part of the company's founding family - was reportedly "surprised, but appeared positive" about a Sony acquisition, according to a Bunshun source at the company.</p>
<p>Kadokawa himself resigned from the company in October 2022 following allegations of bribing an official of the Tokyo Olympic Games. Kadokawa denied the charges.</p>
<p>Conversely, economic analyst Takahiro Suzuki told Bunshun Kadokawa had little to gain from the acquisition. "Kadokawa will lose its independence, and management will become stricter," he said. "If they want to keep developing their business as freely as they have until now, [the acquisition] would be a bad choice. They'd have to be prepared for publications that don't lead to IP creation being put under scrutiny."</p>
<p>News of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware">Sony possibly acquiring Kadokawa</a> emerged from a Reuters report last month. The following day, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-acknowledges-takeover-interest-from-sony">Kadokawa acknowledged the takeover interest from Sony</a>.</p>
<p>"The Company has received an initial letter of intent to acquire the Company's shares, but no decision has been made at this time," said Kadokawa at the time.</p>
<p>Still, the news has in part led to a <a href="https://x.com/xMBGx/status/1866510846098338042">sharp increase in Sony's stock value in Japan</a>, which is currently the highest since 2000. As the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/sony-group-shares-hit-record-closing-high-3035c869?">Wall Street Journal reported</a>, stock value has been on the rise for the past month following strong financial results from Sony and its profitable game segment.</p>
<p>As for what's next from FromSoftware, president Hidetaki Miyazaki stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-2-is-not-in-development-says-fromsoftwares-miyazaki">a sequel to Elden Ring is not in development</a>, but the company does have multiple projects in the works.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
We already knew <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> was set to receive a couple of "surprises" before the end of the year, thanks to some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-surprises-coming-later-this-year-says-director">previous teasing from its director</a> - and it now appears at least some of those are here, courtesy of a big new update for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-continues-to-attract-record-breaking-numbers-of-players">record-breaking</a> action-RPG.
</p>
<p>
Black Myth's new stuff begins with its Keeper's Shrine challenges, which unlock after completing the game once. These come in two flavours - Return of Rivals and Gauntlet of Legends - both bringing back previously defeated foes for a rematch.
</p>
<p>
Return of Rivals is all about one-on-one fights, with players able to challenge former opponents to a duel across one of three levels of selectable difficulty. Gauntlet of Legends, meanwhile, features a number of returning enemies - some with new moves - battled in succession, with difficulty based around customisable curses. Successfully beating a gauntlet rewards rare treasures, but developer Game Science warns challenges won't be available if their corresponding opponents haven't yet been defeated in the main game.

<p>
Elsewhere in today's update (officially known as 1.0.12.16581, number fans), players can now lay their hands on Journeyer's Charts - featuring landscapes organised "for guidance and marking". Which is to say, maps. Journeyer's Charts are initially unlocked after meeting the Keeper in Black Wind Mountain, and new ones can be purchased for each visited territory at shrines. As Game Science so wonderfully puts it, "Let the chart chart the journeyer's journey."
</p>
<p>
And for players looking to shake up their wardrobe, Black Myth's new update brings four special armour pieces added to celebrate the upcoming Chinese New Year. These can be claimed under "Trailblazer's Gift" at any Keeper's Shrine. 
</p>
<p>
Beyond the big headline additions, Black Myth's 1.0.12.16581 brings a whole host of bug fixes and improvements covering everything from performance and localisation issues to boss tweaks. Oh, and the Black Myth: Wukong Soundtrack Selection has been added to the music library. All this is available on the Epic Games Store right now, with the update slowly rolling out across other platforms - so you might need to wait a little before you can probe its wares. Full patch notes are <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=149">available on Game Science's website</a>.
</p><p>
Black Myth: Wukong's latest update arrives just ahead of this year's The Game Awards, where it's been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-lead-this-years-the-game-award-nominations">nominated across several different categories</a>: best action game, best art direction, best game direction, Player's Voice award, and game of the year. And if you're curious to know how it fares, the show kicks off this Friday, 13th December, at 1am in the UK. Or just go to bed and read about it all on Eurogamer when you're sufficiently ready to start the day.
</p>
<p>
Will The Game Awards also bring a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates">long-awaited Xbox release date</a> for Black Myth: Wukong (or maybe even a surprise drop in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-out-now-on-xbox">similar fashion to Baldur's Gate 3</a>)? All will be revealed soon.
