            <p>Physical games remain vital to Nintendo players and developers should not "underestimate" this, an exec at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> developer CD Projekt has said.</p>
<p>CD Projekt is currently getting ready to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-is-a-switch-2-launch-title">launch Cyberpunk 2077 on the Switch 2</a> and, unlike many games set to be released on Nintendo's new console, on its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> launch Cyberpunk 2077 will offer a physical game cartridge with the actual game on it.</p>
<p>This puts CD Projekt in the relative minority, as many other third party studios are instead favouring 'key cards' for their own Switch 2 releases. These key cards don't actually contain game data, and instead trigger a download from the Nintendo eShop when they are popped into the device.</p>

<p>But while there has been a general lean towards digital media over the past few years, CD Projekt says it has used its learnings from releasing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> on the original Switch when deciding upon a physical Switch 2 release for Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>Having Cyberpunk 2077 as a "cartridge with a plug and play experience" on Switch 2 was "the right thing to do",   CD Projekt's VP of business development Jan Rosner told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/cd-projekt-nintendos-audience-is">The Game Business</a>. The exec noted the original Switch's internal storage was "way lower than it is now", and a "game like The Witcher 3 would take up to 80 percent of your internal memory if you don't have an external memory card".</p>
<p>Nintendo players "are quite receptive" to that "plug and play experience", Rosner furthered, and so CDPR knew having a physical cartridge version of Cyberpunk 2077 for Switch 2 with no download required was "a goal that we wanted to achieve" from early on.</p>
<p>"Nintendo at physical retail is still strong, and retail is, in general, not going anywhere," he said, adding he doesn't see "a reality where we're just having all games digital" for a while yet.</p>
<p>"It's especially important for the Nintendo audience," the exec continued. "We maybe could have got away with [a key card], but is there a point? The right thing to do was to have it out on the cartridge with a plug and play experience."</p>
<p>Rosner advises other studios to "not underestimate the physical edition", saying this form of media is "not going anywhere and Nintendo players are very appreciative of physical editions that are done right".</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>CD Projekt</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the same conversation, Rosner said he believes that we will see "more and more third-party titles on the [Switch 2], which we may not necessarily expect" on the original Switch.</p>
<p>"The previous generation has proven to be so successful, and there [are] so many more players to be reached with that, and I think that the [console's capabilities] will surely allow it," he said.</p>
<p>This seems like a more than reasonable assumption. After all, along with Cyberpunk 2077, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-is-a-switch-2-launch-title">Hazelight's Split Fiction will also be a Switch 2 launch title</a>. Other third party titles also confirmed for the platform include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">Elden Ring</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-is-coming-to-switch-2">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/iois-james-bond-game-confirmed-for-switch-2">IOI's James Bond game</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-is-coming-to-switch-2">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade</a>, although these won't be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-release-date">available on the console's release</a>.</p>
<p>So, with all that said and done, does it seem likely we will also see a Switch 2 version of The Witcher 3 further down the line? Well, the studio is skirting that question for now and earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-the-witcher-3-get-a-switch-2-upgrade-cd-projekt-skirts-issue-for-now-as-its-all-in-on-cyberpunk-2077">CD Projekt told Eurogamer it is "all in on Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition" on Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>"Our relationship with Nintendo goes back to the original Nintendo Switch, where we released The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. We were happy with how that game was received by players so, when we heard about the more powerful Nintendo Switch 2, we immediately thought it would be the perfect platform for Cyberpunk 2077," CD Projekt's gameplay technical design expert Filip Downar told Eurogamer, adding that the studio was "thrilled" to be working with Nintendo again.</p>

            <p>EA won't be raising the price of its games, as the company aims to "deliver incredible quality and exponential value for our playerbase".</p>
<p>During the company's latest earnings call, EA CEO Andrew Wilson responded to a question on whether it would be following the likes of Nintendo and Xbox in raising the price of its new releases this year.</p>
<p>Wilson noted how the "pricing power" of the business is very different today than a decade ago, with physical releases a "significantly smaller" part of the business and a range of price points from free-to-play to deluxe editions "and beyond".</p>

<p>"At the end of the day whether we're doing something that costs a dollar or we're doing something that costs $10 or we're doing something that costs $100, our objective is always to deliver incredible quality and exponential value for our playerbase," said Wilson. "And what we've discovered over the course of time is whether we can marry quality and value together, our business is strong, resilient and continues to grow."</p>
<p>EA CFO Stuart Canfield surmised the company has "no changes in the current strategy at this point".</p>
<p>The company's latest financial report states EA's net bookings for the last financial year totaled $7.355bn. It's essentially flat, with FY24 totalling $7.43bn and FY23 totalling $7.34bn, evidence of the resilience Wilson spoke of.</p>
<p>Interestingly, live services represented 73 percent of total net bookings for the latest financial year. Further, EA's American Football franchise exceeded expectations by reaching over a billion in net bookings, helping EA Sports to its biggest net bookings year ever.</p>
<p>The Sims also had "double digital growth" in the most recent quarter, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-praises-split-fiction-hugely-successful-launch-as-game-passes-another-sales-milestone">Split Fiction has now sold almost 4m units</a> since its release in March.</p>
<p>In short, the company is doing very well. And with the continued success of its annual sports games and high revenue generated from live service games, there's clearly no need to raise the price of its games just yet.</p>
<p>Speaking to wider economic factors, Wilson said: "Even in a world where we may not be immune from a meaningful macro-economic downturn, we do believe that we will be resilient and we do believe that we can grow over the course of time through that."</p>
<p>Nintendo has been criticised by fans for raising the price of its games with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, as its flagship launch game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> will cost £75/$80. The company has since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">stated this is not a new "benchmark"</a> but an example of "variable pricing".</p>
<p>Microsoft, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">raised the price of its Xbox consoles</a>, with some new games rising to $80 by the end of the year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Photos of the upcoming Xbox-branded handheld made by Asus have been spilled online.
</p>
<p>
The images show two versions of the Asus ROG Ally 2, with a a regular white-coloured version as well as a black-coloured variant that includes a dedicated Xbox button.

<p>
As spotted by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-rog-ally-2-and-rog-ally-2-xbox-edition-gaming-handhelds-leaked">Videocardz</a>, this leak comes direct from the US FCC's official certification of the hardware, and appears to be our first look at Microsoft and Asus' "Project Kennan" handheld plans.

<p>
Microsoft is set to officially reveal Project Kennan in the coming months - the company's annual June showcase seems a fair bet - and detail more about the system. 
</p>
<p>
It remains to be seen how powerful the hardware's technical specs are, and to what extent it will be able to play the full Xbox back catalogue.

On the surface, however, the device looks somewhat similar to the Steam Deck and other existing handheld PC hardware. Analogue sticks sit at either side of a screen, with a D-pad on one side and ABXY face buttons on the other. The black-coloured model's small Xbox button can be seen on its upper left side.

            <p>A new video with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> director Naoki Hamaguchi suggests the full <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">FF7</a> remake series is heading to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>At the reveal for Nintendo's new console, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-is-coming-to-switch-2">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade would be released on Switch 2</a>, though there's no release date just yet. However, that's just the first part of the planned trilogy, with Rebirth (part two) already out on PS5 and PC.</p>
<p>The latest Creator's Voice video from Nintendo features Hamaguchi expressing his excitement at developing for a Nintendo console. But what's most interesting are his frequent references not just to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>, but to the whole series.</p>

<p>Discussing the new console's technical specs, Hamaguchi states he felt "it would have enough power to run the Final Fantasy 7 remake series" he's creating. Later, he notes this is his first time creating a game for a Nintendo system, adding: "And the fact that it happens to be the Final Fantasy 7 remake series, considering the original game gave me the opportunity to pursue a career in the games industry, makes me feel like it was fate."</p>
<p>At the end of the video, Hamaguchi gives the closest comment yet to confirmation of the full trilogy coming to Switch 2: "And with the release of the Final Fantasy 7 remake series on Switch 2, it would make me very happy if two generations connect and share a bond over the characters."</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth remains a console exclusive on PS5, but it would appear a port for the Switch 2 could well be in development. Finally, Queen's Blood on the go!</p>
<p>It begs the question though: what about Xbox? And further: what does this mean for part three? Will that also be a timed console exclusive on PlayStation, or can we expect a simultaneous release on other consoles too?</p>
<p>It's all part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Square Enix's multiplatform strategy</a> it began "aggressively pursuing" in 2024 after both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and Final Fantasy 16 failed to meet sales expectations</a>.</p>
<p>And while Final Fantasy 7 is the more popular, could Final Fantasy 16 also be released on Switch 2 in future?</p>
<p>As for part three of the Final Fantasy 7 remake series, series producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-story-completed-producer-very-satisfied-as-development-continues-without-delay">Yoshinori Kitase confirmed at the start of the year its story has been completed</a>. However, it's still unknown when it will be released - and on which platforms.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Q4 marked a strong finish to FY25, with broad-based momentum across the portfolio positioning the business for accelerated growth," said EA CFO Stuart Canfield. "As we enter FY26, we remain focused on disciplined execution as we build toward a slate of groundbreaking upcoming releases."</p>
<p>Soon after EA released its report, Hazelight announced Split Fiction has now sold 4m copies since its debut earlier this year.</p>
<p>"So many of you have picked up Split Fiction already, it’s amazing…" the <a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1919852640189456892">studio wrote on social media</a>. "Seeing the fun you have with our game and the love you show for Mio, Zoe and each other warms our hearts here at Hazelight."</p>
<p>It also made a playful wink wink, nudge nudge remark about "so many hot dogs made", but I won't say any more about that right now... It really is a moment best experienced first hand (wink wink, nudge nudge).</p>

<p>In the first 48 hours of release, Split Fiction sold an impressive 1m units. By the end of its first week, the studio announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">Split Fiction had sold another 1m units</a>.</p>
<p>Not simply content with these figures, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-has-broken-not-one-not-two-but-three-world-records">the game subsequently broke three world records</a>, becoming the most played local co-op video game on Steam, the most sold local co-op video game within 48 hours of release, and most sold local co-op video game within one week of release.</p>
<p>And, it doesn't seem likely Split Fiction will lose any moment any time soon. A film adaptation of Split Fiction is already in the works, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sydney-sweeney-to-star-in-split-fiction-film-written-by-deadpool-wolverine-team">Sydney Sweeney set to both star and produce</a>. The upcoming film is being directed by Jon M Chu, whose previous works include last year's musical hit, Wicked.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-is-a-switch-2-launch-title">Split Fiction will be a Switch 2 launch title</a> when the console releases next month. So, we can pretty much guarantee that the game will sell even more pretty darn soon.</p>
<p>"Fantastic from start to finish, Split Fiction is one of the most inventive and joyful co-op games to date, and a testament to the power of human imagination," Katharine Castle wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">Eurogamer's Split Fiction review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
