            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> fans won't have to worry about a deluge of out-of-place cosmetics and crossover skins, according to head of Respawn and Battlefield Studios Vince Zampelli and general manager Byron Beede.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer, Zampelli discussed the importance of sticking to the core visual identity of Battlefield as far as cosmetics are concerned.</p>
<p>"I think for us, that's what we've been focused on," he said. "We want to be true to Battlefield, we want this fantasy to feel like you'd expect of Battlefield, so that's what we've been focused on."</p>

<p>Beede, who previously led the Call of Duty franchise before jumping over to work as general manager for Battlefield, when asked about the "Fortnitifaction" of modern FPS games, stated: "That's a hard one to answer right? You kinda have to do things to let people differentiate themselves and be unique, so it's how you do that in a way that doesn't go too far. We don't have to worry about that right now."</p>
<p>When Eurogamer followed up by saying there was a distinct difference between different variations of military cosmetics and American Dad characters (as an example), Beede replied "there probably is a difference, yeah". Beede refused to speak on the topic further.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-multiplayer-takes-a-bold-risky-new-direction">having just revealed its multiplayer mode and a global release date</a>, is clearly looking to blast a big hole in the current AAA FPS ecosystem. Whereas other series - like Call of Duty - have been swamped with a deluge of crossover skins and promotional items, there is clearly an appetite for a shooter less eager to throw immersion out the window. Battlefield 6 is positioned to land large on most core FPS platforms. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-is-not-coming-to-the-switch-2-any-time-soon">Not the Switch 2 though, that's safe for now</a>.</p>
<p>Are you happy about this? Do you care at all about cosmetics in games like these? Let us know below.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield]]></content:encoded>
