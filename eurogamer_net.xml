            <p>
Enjoyable picture book adventure The Plucky Squire is adding a Streamlined Mode in response to feedback around the game's difficulty and overly-chatty characters.
</p>
<p>
This option is available now via a free update on PC and is coming soon to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
</p>
<p>
Changes for Streamlined Mode include "trims" to "less necessary dialogue", of which there is plenty. I enjoyed my time with The Plucky Squire, but its dialogue was overly verbose - to the point I ended up speeding through it as much as possible.

<p>
Other alterations will see the game remove or reduce camera hints, tutorial content, and moments where control of the game is taken away from players. 
</p>
<p>
All of these sound like smart changes and, while I doubt I'll go back for a second playthrough, will very likely improve the experiences of anyone still yet to experience The Plucky Squire afresh.
</p>
<p>
"The game is a victim of its own delights, perhaps: there's so much invention here that the repetition stands out all the more," our Christian Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-plucky-squire-review-the-power-of-imagination">Eurogamer's The Plucky Squire review</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"There's also a handful of pacing issues, not least that the game has a habit of interrupting its own flow to explain things. I think this comes from the game having to balance two audiences - kids and adults - but there are still a few too many unskippable conversations when even younger players will want to just get on with things."
</p>
<p>
These issues aside, The Plucky Squire is still one of the most inventive games I've played this year - and now it sounds like it'll be even better. If you get the oppurtunity, do give it try.

            <p>A sequel to party game Golf With Your Friends has been announced, set for release next year.</p>
<p>From Radical Forge and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/team17">Team17</a>, Golf With Your Friends 2 will once again bring crazy golf wackiness, but promises "wild" new mechanics, weather hazards, and a revamped level editor to share courses with friends "and then utterly destroy them with the sneaky hidden hole-in-one setup you built in". Cheeky!</p>
<p>It's set for launch across PC and consoles, though doesn't specify which (could this be coming to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>?). Regardless, cross-platform online multiplayer will be included.</p>

<p>Beyond that, the above teaser doesn't tell us much about what to expect.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3209660/Golf_With_Your_Friends_2/">Steam</a>, though, the game is listed as an early access release for 2025. At 1.0 launch it will feature six courses and new ways to "customise your balls", along with the above mentioned additions.</p>
<p>The previous Golf With Your Friends game was developed by Australian studio Blacklight Interactive, but Team17 has switched to the UK-based Radical Forge for the sequel.</p>
<p>Released in 2020, Golf With Your Friends proved particularly popular during the pandemic and has since received plenty of DLC. It's included on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PS Plus subscription</a>, or is currently on sale on Steam for just three quid.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Ahead of tonight's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-mafia-the-old-country-lead-the-charge-as-more-game-awards-showings-confirmed">promised</a> airing at The Game Awards, a trailer for Mafia: The Old Country - the fourth entry in the more than two-decade-old open-world crime series - has made an appearance online via a YouTube advert. 
</p>
<p>As expected, the trailer brings a first tantalising glimpse at Mafia: The Old Country's 1900s-set Sicilian action. It also provides a release window: summer 2025 for PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p> <div>

Developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hangar13">Hangar 13</a>, which worked on 2106's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mafia-iii">Mafia 3</a>, announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-3-developer-confirms-new-mafia-development">working on a new Mafia game</a> back in 2022 to mark the series' 20th anniversary. At the time its launch was said to still be "a few years away", but the laws of temporal progression being what they are, that point - following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-is-back-and-heading-to-the-old-country-next-year">teaser reveal in August</a> - is nearly here.
</p>
<p>
Mafia: The Old Country does, of course, bring yet another time shift for the series. While its first two games spanned the 1930s, 40s, and 50s between them, and Mafia 3 set its sights on the late 60s, The Old Country - as its name suggests - looks like it'll whisk players back to experience events prior to those games.
</p><p>
More specifically, this fourth outing promises to deliver "gritty mob story set in the brutal underworld of 1900s Sicily", featuring "authentic realism and rich storytelling" in a "dangerous and unforgiving era". And now, thanks to this year's first The Game Awards leak, we now exactly what all that looks like.
</p>
<p>Stay tuned for a full version of the trailer tonight at The Game Awards, which kicks off at 12.30am UK time. Grab a coffee and join us later!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-has-a-canon-mode-story-option-without-narrative-choices<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> will take a fresh approach to how it handles branching story, by offering a mode "that allows a choice-free narrative".
</p>
<p>
Developers behind Shadows revealed the game would feature a "canon mode" via a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/hi_we_are_brooke_charles_jonathan_and_thierry/">reddit</a> Q&amp;A last night, in answer to questions from fans around how the game will balance the ability to make narrative decisions with fans' desire for a single representation of how Shadows' 'historical' narrative plays out.
</p>
<p>
Canon has always been a hot topic among Assassin's Creed fans, partly due to the fact its labyrinthine web of lore is portrayed as a definitive secret history of the real world (albeit one where secret societies, magic artefacts and being able to see enemies through walls are all real), and because you are typically meant to see this history by reliving memories of someone there at the time.
</p>
<p>
Early <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-games-order">Assassin's Creed games</a> leant into this fantasy by rewarding players for perfectly "synchronising" with memories of the past. Later games offered more latitude, however, particularly those developed by Shadows' talented Quebec team, which built up elements of player choice.
</p><p>
In the Victorian London-set <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-syndicate">Assassin's Creed Syndicate</a>, for example, players could choose which of the game's Frye twins to play as in much of the game's story. And in the Ancient Greece-set Assassin's Creed Odyseey, players could pick between brother and sister protagonists Kassandra and Alexios, with the alternate pick becoming an antagonist. 
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed has always found a way to explain these choices in-game, while still supporting the idea that you are playing through someone's memories. 
</p>
<p>
In Odyssey, the sibling protagonists' DNA was deemed identical enough that either choice of main character was possible - though the 'canon' choice was confirmed by developers to have always been Kassandra. And in the Viking era-set <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>, which also offered a limited amount of player choice, its male and female versions of main character Eivor were cleverly explained by a sort-of split personality.
</p>
<p>
"We have added a mode in the game called canon mode that allows a choice-free narrative," Shadows game director Jonathan Dumont wrote. "You will still be able to switch characters in open in this mode."
</p>
<p>
The ability for you to play as either of Shadows' main characters - shinobi Naoe or samurai Yasuke - in the game's open world is similar to you being able to stomp around London as either Frye twin in Syndicate, while each had specific story missions dedicated to one or the other.
</p>
<p>
Apart from choosing your playable character, Shadows will also let you pick between allies to recruit and who to romance, Ubisoft continued.
</p>
<p>
"In Shadows choice takes on many forms," associate narrative director Brooke Davies added, "impacting who we play as, and quest and other gameplay outcomes. 
</p>
<p>
"In terms of the story of our league, we get to explore core themes like community and chosen family through choice since Naoe and Yasuke can choose who to recruit as allies and who to connect with as friends and lovers, either for a short, sweet time or longer term."
</p>
<p>
Whatever your choices, Shadows' story will still finish with a specific ending, Davies continued. 
</p>
<p>
"The story of Shadows culminates in a single, canon ending. That said there are many unique paths leading to this point, and in particular that will determine who is (and isn't) at your side along the way."
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-reflects-on-series-struggle-to-tell-consistent-modern-day-story-after-desmond">Eurogamer heard from Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Cot√© on how the franchise will move forward with a more unified, well-maintained story</a> - and how its modern day portion will now feel more integral after years of being treated like an afterthought. 
</p>
<p>
"There will a be limited modern day story in Shadows that will introduce a broader modern day narrative in the Animus Hub," Dumont added. "We will share more on this later."
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">Assassin's Creed Shadows is now set to launch on 14th February 2025 following its recent delay</a>. Eurogamer previously heard from Cot√© that the game's postponement had been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-necessary-to-change-narrative-of-ubisofts-inconsistency-in-quality">necessary to change the "narrative" of Ubisoft's "inconsistency in quality"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-coaster-2">Planet Coaster 2</a>'s first paid DLC has been released today, along with a major free update to the theme park sim.</p>
<p>The Thrill-Seekers Ride Pack costs ¬£7.99 and adds a number of new dizzying rides and coasters.</p>
<p>Perhaps more thrilling, though, are some highly requested changes arriving in today's major update - the first since the game launched last month, beyond hotfixes.</p>

<p>On PC there are amendments to the controls and UI: the camera can be controlled using arrow keys, new keyboard shortcuts have been implemented, and the camera can be edge scrolled with the mouse, to name a few.</p>
<p>Along with multiple bug fixes, there are other improvements like removing the workshop download limit and increasing the maximum capacity of guests in Sandbox Mode (both PC only changes), as well as a Guest Tolerance filter on the Heatmap mode (which has additional support for colourblind players), the ability to override weather settings, and removing the game logo from queue paths.</p>
<p>Further, there are big changes to the movement and testing of flumes, more dramatic waves in pools, new scenery pieces, and the option to have separate stations for loading and unloading guests from coasters.</p>
<p>Many of these changes were outlined in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2-hotfix-will-make-flumes-more-popular">previous note from developer Frontier</a>. You can read the <a href="https://www.planetcoaster.com/updates/1-0-9">full update notes on the game website</a>.</p>
<p>As for the DLC's new rides, it includes two coasters: Big M's Rides - Ultra Spin and The Vector - LIM Launch Family Coaster.</p>
<p>The former reminds me of The Ride to Happiness at Tomorrowland with its independently spinning ride cars, while the latter is (presumably) a spoof of the Vekoma Family Launch Coaster that made its debut as Big Bear Mountain in Dollywood last year.</p>
<p>There are also three new spinning flat rides - the 540, Strike, and Whirlpool - all of which look absolutely, horrifyingly sick-inducing. I'll stick to the coasters.</p>
<p>"Planet Coaster 2's flexible creation tools are as compulsive as ever, but the fun butts up against an exhausting UI, uninspired management gameplay, and conspicuous content gaps that feel like cynical spaces for DLC," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2-review">Eurogamer Planet Coaster 2 review</a>.</p>
<p>At least Frontier is offering regular updates and, following today's Thrill-Seekers Ride Pack, hopefully more extras are on the way - even if they are paid.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>CD Projekt Red's global PR director Radek Grabowski shared the post, adding: "Some time ago, I asked the Quest Design team at CDPR: 'You liked the Cyberpunk cards in Balatro?

<p>What's more, there's <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1866875675334041783">crossover merch too</a>, available to pre-order from the CD Projekt Red store.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time these two games have collaborated. Back in October, Balatro developer LocalThunk added a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatros-back-with-another-collaboration-card-pack-featuring-the-likes-of-cyberpunk-2077-and-stardew-valley">second Friends of Jimbo Pack</a> featuring joker cameos from popular games: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/slay-the-spire">Slay the Spire</a>, and of course Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>It's a timely addition too, considering Balatro's huge spike in popularity ahead of tonight's The Game Awards. It was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-wont-be-eligible-for-baftas-best-game-award">nominated in next year's BAFTA longlist</a>.</p>

Nintendo is celebrating the 40th anniversary of Tetris by adding the classic Game Boy Color and NES versions to Nintendo Switch Online.
</p>
<p>
Remarkably, this is the first time the NES incarnation of Tetris has been released since 1989, some 35 years ago. (Do you all feel old yet?)
</p>
<p>
Here to make you feel older is legendary Tetris designer and programmer Alexey Pajitnov, who Nintendo has unearthed for the following video.

<p>
"I would like to thank all the fans around the world," Pajitnov said. "You guys are all part of the Tetris legacy for the 40 years, and into the future. 
</p>
<p>
"I hope you enjoy these historical titles from Tetris and Nintendo. Play Tetris, my friends!"
</p>
<p>
If you want to explore the history of Tetris further, you can't go wrong with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atari-50-studios-tetris-forever-interactive-documentary-is-out-in-november">Tetris Forever, a playable, interactive documentary from Digital Eclipse</a> that launched last month for Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation and Xbox.
</p>
<p>
"It's eternal," our Christian Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tetris-forever-review">Eurogamer's Tetris Forever review</a>. "It's the game that someone, something, will be playing somewhere when the sun explodes. It's Tetris."
