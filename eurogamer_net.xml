            <p>
Microsoft has announced its line-up of Xbox Game Pass titles for the beginning of February. 
</p>
<p>
The selection is, as you'd expect, headlined by this month's big <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> arrival Avowed, the fresh role-playing game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> developer Obsidian.
</p>
<p>
But, of course, you'll only get the game on 18th February - its launch date - if you have either PC Game Pass or Game Pass Ultimate.
</p>
<p>
Here's the full line-up of Xbox Game Pass titles for February:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Far Cry: New Dawn - 4th February (Standard, Ultimate, PC)</li>
<li>Another Crab's Treasure - 5th February (Now with Standard)</li>
<li>Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes - 5th February (Now with Standard)</li>
<li>Starfield - 5th February (Now with Standard)</li>
<li>Madden NFL 25 - 6th February (Ultimate, PC)</li>
<li>Kingdom Two Crowns - 13th February (Now with Standard)</li>
<li>Avowed - 18th February (Ultimate, PC)</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you're already on Ultimate or PC Game Pass, your other new additions this month include Far Cry spin-off New Dawn, a follow-up to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-5">Far Cry 5</a>, and the arrival of this year's Madden NFL installment from EA Sports.
</p>
<p>
Subscribers to the newer Standard tier now join Ultimate and PC subscribers in gaining access to Bethesda's space RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>, plus Another Crab's Treasure,  <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-review">Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes</a> and Kingdom: Two Crowns.
</p>
<p>
As ever, whenever Microsoft giveth, it also taketh away. Seven games are set to leave Xbox Game Pass on 15th February, in case you want to give them a quick bash before they go:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A Little to the Left (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Bloodstained Ritual of the Night (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>EA Sports UFC 3 (Console via EA Play)</li>
<li>Indivisible (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Merge and Blade (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Return to Grace (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Tales of Arise (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you want to keep playing these games after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to purchase them. On the plus side, Game Pass subscribers get a 20 percent discount.
</p>

Last week, Microsoft gave us a glimpse at Doom: The Dark Ages, Ninja Gaiden 4 and South of Midnight as part of its Xbox Developer Direct. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-is-positioned-to-save-the-xbox-console-business">It's taken eight years, but could  Game Pass finally be positioned to save the Xbox console business and give Xbox a point?</a>

            <p>
Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has said that fan expectation around <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> isn't the primary cause of Switch 1's plummeting sales.
</p>
<p>
Earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-admits-sales-below-expectations-as-wait-for-switch-2-continues">Nintendo admitted it had failed to hit its own targets for Switch 1</a> over the course of 2024. The company has revised its finacial forecast as console sales dipped by 30 percent, and sales of Switch 1 software also slumped.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to investors following the announcement, Furukawa dismissed the suggestion that anticipation for Switch 2 was to blame. 
</p>
<p>
"We don't think the impact of refraining from purchasing [because of Switch 2] is that great," Furukawa said, as repoted by Japanese newspaper <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250204-KB2S2JK245IALH4D6JO4NVHOZU/">The Sankei Shimbun</a>. "We think it's a solid eighth year, but we haven't reached our target."

<p>
It's fair to suggest that, after eight years, any console maker should expect sales to be in decline - as indeed they have for Switch 1 since the console's sales peak, back in 2022.
</p>
<p>
2024 was also a much quieter year for Switch 1 software releases overall, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> and Mario Party Jamboree selling well but not as strongly as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-bros-wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> back in 2023.
</p><p>
And while the internet may be hanging on Nintendo's every word for news on Switch 2, there's still a large audience of Switch owners who are less engaged with Nintendo's preparations for what's next. Regardless, Nintendo has seen a steeper drop off in Switch 1 sales this year than any previous - and more than the company  had predicted.
</p>
<p>
That said, it's clear Nintendo will continue to push its hugely-successful Switch 1 - for the time being. Furukawa noted the company would continue Switch 1 support "as long as there is demand". 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo has previously said similar ahead of launching new hardware in the past - and it's not a surprise. The company already has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beloved-wii-u-exclusive-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-coming-to-nintendo-switch">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition due in March</a>, before <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> and Pok√©mon Legends Z-A arrive on Switch 1 later this year.
