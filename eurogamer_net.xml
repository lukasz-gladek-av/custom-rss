<p>Amazon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-god-of-war-tv-adaptation-is-officially-go">initially announced its God of War adaptation</a> back in December 2022. Series showrunner, Ronald D. Moore, recently revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-show-retain-the-tone-of-the-2018-reboot-series-but-also-makes-reference-to-older-greek-saga">the adaptation will remain largely faithful to Sony Santa Monica's 2018 game</a>, though it won't be a frame-by-frame remake.</p>
<p>"This world and this universe are really rich, and it's interesting, and it's really been fun to adapt," Moore explained at the time. "It's an adaptation, so it's an adaptation-slash-interpretation as you go into live-action, and it's been really fun to sort of go, 'Wow, there's a lot here we can play with. Okay, we want to keep the story. We want to keep the characters and the spirit of it'. There's all this stuff that you can keep turning to for inspiration."</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer">Moore joined the production almost two years after its was confirmed to be in the works</a> after the series based on Sony Santa Monica's God of War series reportedly had a "do-over" after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-reportedly-starting-from-scratch-as-showrunner-departs">the companies involved decided on a "different creative direction"</a>. Despite the early issues, though, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written">second season has been greenlit at Amazon</a>.</p>

            <p>82 per cent of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s Steam reviews may be positive, but it seems the adoration hasn't been universal, with hundreds of Chinese-speaking players slamming Team Cherry for issues with the sequel's translations.</p>
<p>It's been such a problem, in fact, that even though Silksong's reviews are chiefly either Very or Overwhelming Positive when you isolate by language, Silksong's simplified-Chinese Steam reviews are sitting on an anomalous Mixed rating.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, Team Cherry's Matthew Griffin directly addressed Chinese-speaking players on X/Twitter overnight, acknowledging the issue and confirming "we'll be working to improve the translation over the coming weeks".</p>

<p>"To our Chinese-speaking fans: We appreciate you letting us know about quality issues with the current Simplified Chinese translation of Hollow Knight: Silksong," he wrote (thanks, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-review-bomb-chinese-translation-2000623496">Kotaku</a>). "We'll be working to improve the translation over the coming weeks. Thanks for your feedback and support."</p> <div>

<p>Chinese-speaking players' feedback suggests Hollow Knight: Silksong's translation "<a href="https://x.com/TigerHixTang/status/1963850592595677350">reads like a Wuxia novel</a> instead of conveying the game’s tone", is "<a href="https://x.com/Ricken_62O/status/1963964912688115861">of rather low quality</a>", and "<a href="https://x.com/Xxyciel/status/1963801738340958441">really ruins the game experience</a>…"</p>
<p>Consequently, of the 16,000+ reviews left for Silksong by players categorised as playing in the 'Simplified Chinese' language, just 44 per cent have left a positive review.</p>
<p>For more on Silksong, Bertie spoke to several developers about the impact its low price will have on other indie games in his feature: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-hollow-knight-silksongs-cheap-price-a-problem-for-other-indie-games-devs-and-publishers-weigh-up-its-impact">Is Hollow Knight Silksong's 'cheap' price a problem for other indie games? Devs and publishers weigh up its impact</a>. And interestingly, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-so-popular-even-pirates-are-urging-others-not-to-pirate-the-game">pirating community is actually urging others to buy the game, rather than pirate it</a>.</p>
<p>And in news unlikely to surprise you as we go into the weekend, Hollow Knight: Silksong has already broken its own concurrent record, hitting <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/charts/">562,814 players</a> on Steam.</p>
