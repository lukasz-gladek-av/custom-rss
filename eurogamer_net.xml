ASUS' Xbox-branded ROG Ally - perhaps the closest we'll get to an official Xbox gaming handheld anytime soon, if recent reports are true - launches this October, says a reliable leaker.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, it's claimed ASUS is targeting a 16th October European release date for the Xbox ROG Ally and its beefier-specced sibling, the Xbox ROG Ally X. That's <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-connait-enfin-la-date-exacte-de-sortie-60340">according to Dealab's Billbil-kun</a>, who has a long history of accurate leaks.
</p>
<p>
Both machines were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-xbox-branded-asus-handheld-finally-gets-an-official-reveal">officially unveiled in June</a>, when it was confirmed the Xbox ROG Ally would include an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor alongside 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage, while the Ally X - described as a machine for "the most demanding players" - features an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor and 24GB of high-speed RAM.

<p>
At the time, ASUS would only say the machines were launching this "holiday" across select countries including the UK and US, and other details were limited. However, Billbil-kun recently claimed the Xbox ROG Ally will cost €599 (around £520), while the Xbox ROG Ally X variant is said to be priced at €899 (approximately £780). Pre-orders for both machines will reportedly begin on 20th August, with an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-handheld-consoles-rog-ally-and-ally-x-preorders-open-during-gamescom-report-says">official announcement expected during Microsoft's Gamescom showcase</a>, which begins at 2pm BST on the same day.
</p>
<p>
The Xbox ROG Ally and ROG Ally X, as we learned previously, are both powered by Windows 11, include a full-screen Xbox interface, and feature an aggregated gaming library with access to installed games from a range of PC stores, including Steam, Battle.net, and GOG. And, of course, the machines support Xbox Play Anywhere titles.
</p>
<p>
Xbox boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-discusses-potential-xbox-handheld-plans">long teased Microsoft's plans for an official Xbox gaming handheld</a>, and reports earlier this year suggested the company had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-next-gen-console-reportedly-targeting-2027-with-handheld-device-due-this-year">settled on a multi-pronged strategy</a> that would initially see it partner with a third-party to launch an Xbox-branded portable machine before the end of 2025 while it worked on its own in-house project to release sometime in 2027. However, later reports <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-xbox-handheld-reportedly-sidelined-as-it-focuses-on-third-party-portable-devices">claimed a change in strategy</a>, with Windows Central saying Microsoft's internal handheld project had been "sidelined" in favour of more third-party partnerships, while The Verge went further, calling the project "essentially cancelled".
</p>
<p>
Curiously, however, Xbox president Sarah Bond <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-says-its-working-on-next-gen-xbox-consoles-youll-play-in-your-living-room-and-in-your-hands">recently announced the company was partnering with AMD</a> to "co-engineer silicon across a portfolio of devices including our next-generation Xbox consoles in your living room and in your hands". For now though, the only certainty is ASUS' handhelds, and we should get a confirmed release date very soon.
