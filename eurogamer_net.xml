            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> will be featured at Summer Games Done Quick 2025.</p>
<p>Games Done Quick, for those unaware, is a series of charity video game marathons, which promise "high-level gameplay" from those with a lot more skill and patience than I have. </p>
<p>Summer Games Done Quick 2025 will run from 6th - 13th July, with all donations raised going towards Médecins Sans Frontières / Doctors Without Borders. This organisation provides medical assistance to those affected by conflict, disease outbreaks, and disasters globally. Last year, Summer Games Done Quick raised $2.5m for Doctors Without Borders.</p>

<p>The event will include Knockout Tours in the Nintendo racer. Considering the amount of shortcuts found out in the game's open world, it'll be intriguing to see if world record times will be beaten.</p>
<p>Along with Mario Kart World, Summer Games Done Quick 2025 will also feature the likes of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blue-prince-review">brilliant Blue Prince</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cuphead-review">the tricksy Cuphead</a> and, a personal favourite, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to watch along, the event will be broadcast live via the<a href="https://fiftycc-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2g7C0RRYbXz5GSI3w2-iXbcOi9m9rc6stpVH7h8h_R_yOrZjQlwFToJgnsmVBpefxlbbsJSr0021m9MC7CKUp2Tln3pwXBkA7z3-J-hvBGCM-tOKueTnCZahQyisy9AN_3J4QKB58JZngZpZvO72og27oRMZ6CcTTc_LGZKKyX1mElpL4RZJ55isCWHrClQ"> Games Done Quick Twitch channel</a>.

<p>As for Mario Kart World, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">arrived last month as a launch title for Nintendo Switch 2</a>. If you are still on the fence about taking the latest Mario Kart release out for a spin, be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-review">sure to check out Eurogamer's review</a>. Our Tom was rather taken with World, calling it "entertaining, snackable, fun".</p>
<p>Or, if you are already familiar with the bones of Mario Kart World, but need a little hand to get a bit more out of it (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unlocking-mirror-mode-in-mario-kart-world-is-so-obtuse-even-nintendo-got-the-details-wrong">like unlocking that infamous Mirror Mode</a>, for example), you can check out our guides.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is officially coming to Xbox Series X/S on the 26th August.</p>
<p>This announcement came via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXIFF4D6LOs&amp;ab_channel=HELLDIVERS%E2%84%A22">a Helldivers announcement stream</a>. Arrowhead's hit third-person shooter will have full crossplay with both PC and PlayStation. Those interested can pre-order the game on the Xbox store  for £34.99 now.</p>
<p>It's also the first ever Sony-published game on Xbox platforms, which is certainly a massive milestone in the ongoing rivalry between the two companies (Sony's baseball series MLB The Show is published by MLB on Xbox). <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-remaining-thoughtful-about-how-and-if-it-brings-games-to-additional-platforms">Sony previously expressed interest in bringing its big games to more platforms</a>, with this Helldivers 2 port acting as the first big sign of this shift in strategy.

<p>Said game director Mikael Eriksson on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-xbox-release-date-pre-order/">Xbox Wire</a>: "We know gamers have been asking for this for some time and we are so excited to bring more <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> into our game. We have so much more in store for the future months and years – and the more players we have the more stories we can tell! The fight for Super Earth has only just begun."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-quietly-removes-pc-sale-restrictions-in-dozens-of-countries-for-four-huge-playstation-games">Helldivers 2 only recently had its geographical restrictions lifted on PC</a>, which had previously had people from countries including the Bahamas, Armenia, Burkina Faso and many more unable to play the smash hit. Now, with the game coming to Xbox, it looks like one more massive wall keeping folks apart has crumbled.</p>
<p>Previously, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-roblox-riot-and-now-helldivers-tencent-just-acquired-a-15-stake-in-arrowhead-games">Tencent acquired a 15 percent stake in Arrowhead Games</a> for roughly $80m. A lofty sum for a chunk of what has certainly been a rare gem in the modern live service landscape.</p>
<p>For those who hop into the game on Xbox, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-sees-super-earth-itself-invaded">they'll have missed the Illuminate invasion of Super Earth</a>, as well as the special cape added to the game in memory <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-year-after-that-psn-fiasco-helldivers-2s-long-anticipated-review-bomb-cape-is-finally-here">of the review bomb fiasco</a>. Still, there's surely plenty more surprises yet to come for fresh-faced Xbox players.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-is-coming-to-xbox-series-xs-in-august-as-first-sony-published-game-on-the-platform]]></content:encoded>
