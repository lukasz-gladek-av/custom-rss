It's now been five years since Ubisoft's beleaguered Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake was originally revealed, and a little over a year since the publisher last popped up to remind us all the project was still alive. But here we are again, 12 months on, with another brief update, this time letting fans know the remake remains "deep" in development.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's Sands of Time remake was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-details-whats-new-in-its-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">initially unveiled back in September 2020</a>, when it was expected to arrive in January the following year. However, after its announcement trailer was met with a less than positive reception, Ubisoft kicked off what would prove to be a succession of delays. Eventually, the project moved from its original developers Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai to Ubisoft Montreal, where it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-years-on-ubisofts-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-still-in-the-conception-phase">seemingly rebooted from scratch</a>, and last year brought the news it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-now-targeting-2026-gets-briefest-of-trailers">wouldn't be ready for release until 2026</a>.
</p>
<p>
But while it seemed like Ubisoft might opt for radio silence until its remake was finally ready for its big re-reveal, the publisher has instead shared the <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1934642136500060166">briefest of updates today on social media</a>, a little over a year since its last one. "Yep, we're still deep in the game," it wrote, "exploring, building, and ensuring the sands move with purpose."

"This game is being crafted by a team that truly cares," it continued, "and they're pouring their hearts (and a lot of coffee) into every step. Thank you for sticking with us." And that's pretty much all we're getting for now, aside from an accompanying bit of art showing a glass palace against a pink sky. Ubisoft also pointed fans in the direction of series spin-off The Rogue Prince of Persia, from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a> studio Evil Empire, which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-finally-leaving-early-access">set to leave early access this August</a>.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's Sands of Time remake woes have continued to a tumultuous few years for the publisher, which has faced tumbling share prices and a number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">high-profile flops</a> in recent times, resulting in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suffers-third-round-of-job-losses-this-year">string of layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff">studio closures</a>. As part of its attempts to right the ship, Ubisoft announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-new-business-for-assassins-creed-and-other-big-ips-with-116bn-tencent-investment">launching a new subsidiary dedicated to its big three IPs</a> - Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry - earlier this year. With those game under a new banner, Ubisoft itself will concentrate on a number of key areas, including "nurturing the development of iconic franchises", including - presumably - Prince of Persia.
