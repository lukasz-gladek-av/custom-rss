            <p>Ever since lead <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">Dispatch writer Pierre Shorette went on the record as saying "we definitely cut some sex scenes"</a> and teased that we may "get to see those one day", the game's fanbase has held its breath in bated anticipation. But it's not happening.</p>
<p>I spoke to Shorette and Dispatch game director Nick Herman recently and they told me that while there were once plans for a sex scene involving your chosen love interest in the game, the actual scenes themselves "never tangibly existed". As in, there's nothing to reinstate.</p>
<p>"Let's curb this here, Pierre," said Herman.</p>
<p>Shorette nodded as if in agreement, then said: "The reality is we're definitely going to put those sex scenes in."</p>
<p>"God damnit," said Herman in response.</p>
<p>Shorette laughed; if it wasn't clear, that was a joke.</p>

<p>The duo explained that the problem arose when people found code in Dispatch for an event the team didn't build out. "They could see that we had booleans for 'if someone was going to spend the night' or 'which love interest was going to spend the night'," Herman said. The love interests in the game being Blonde Blazer and Invisigal.</p><p>Shorette continued: "So after the party, that was the point in the story where that would happen." The party occurs in Episode 6, so relatively near the end of the eight-episode season, and it's a wonderful scene - one of my favourites in the game.</p>
<p>It raises the question of why the studio decided against developing the sex scenes any further, and the answer is much simpler than you might think: "Money," Herman and Shorette said almost at exactly the same time.</p>
<p>"It was just money," Herman went on. "That whole scene was like double or triple the length; the whole party was almost an entire episode at Robert's apartment. And scoping: we probably pulled like 80 pages out of this game. It was a lot of writing that had to get cut to be condensed down into something that we could produce.</p>
<blockquote><em>"We probably pulled like 80 pages out of this game"</em></blockquote>
<p>"So just to say it: those scenes were never storyboarded. They didn't go into animation. So people say 'release them': they never tangibly existed."</p>
<p>"Everything that got made, shipped," Shorette added. "We wanted to put it in, we just ran out of money is what it really came down to. So you can blame the video game industry, not us. If people believed in us, we could have made it."</p>

<p>Shorette was referring to the several years of rejection Dispatch faced as AdHoc pitched the game to publishers and tried to get it to release - a twisting, turning saga I've written about in more detail in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-of-dispatch-how-adhoc-rode-rejection-to-huge-success">a Making Of-style Dispatch interview</a>. Now, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-proves-episodic-gaming-is-back-with-a-capital-b-following-latest-player-milestone">the game is a big success, having sold 2m copies and counting</a>.</p><p>A limited budget meant Dispatch also couldn't deliver the breadth of choice some players wanted as far as romance options were concerned. You can't, for example, pursue a romance with any of the characters in the Z-team you lead, which is probably a good thing as far as HR is concerned.</p>
<p>It was while talking about a possible sequel and the expectations players will have for it, and for the characters in it, that Shorette said: "And want to have sex with."</p>
<p>"Good lord," said Herman again in response.</p>
<p>"We should put out a-" Shorette said, before being interrupted by Herman, who added: "-place where everyone can just have sex with everyone."</p>
<p>Shorette continued: "We'll make a Date Everything. But it has to be non-canon because it's so messy - that's the problem. You can't have a Date Everything because we have to take those seriously as relationships, not just treat this as like some fuck party.</p><p>"When you look at the relationships that we had, they're very specific and important to the story in terms of the type of characters they are. Robert is a guy that on the one hand has it together and can be supportive to someone like [Invisigal], but then also needs fucking help, you know? Which is perfect for Blazer.</p>
<p>"Malevola," he added, referencing the tall and muscled red demon woman who wears a tight top and tight denim shorts: "if we threw Malevola in there, everyone would just fuck Malevola. Demon Cindy Crawford. Muscle Mommy. It would be easy mode."</p>
<p>The success and general applause for Dispatch - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-dont-feel-that-games-created-with-only-ai-will-have-soul-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-director-doesnt-think-ai-can-replace-human-creativity-but-the-studio-is-using-it-in-reasonable-ways">former Witcher 3 developer Konrad Tomaszkiewicz said Dispatch was his game of the year</a> - have meant people are now clamouring for a second season of the game. And <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-set-on-season-2-but-has-difficult-second-album-problem">it sounds very much like a Dispatch Season 2 will happen</a>. However, with success comes expectation and, as Shorette said, "A lot of pressure. It'll be about what it's not as much as what it is."</p>

            <p>The oft-delayed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a> is now being planned for a release in several years time, with the latest date simply being "2028".</p>
<p>Ark 2 was announced all the way back in 2020, with a rather unexpected trailer featuring Vin Diesel of The Fast and The Furious fame. So, five years later, and we still don't have a firmer release date beyond that <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/sci-fi-dino-taming-survival-game-ark-2-eyes-a-2028-release-with-a-little-or-a-lot-of-vin-diesel">newly-announced 2028 window</a>.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, developer Studio Wildcard said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-delayed-survival-evolved-official-servers-to-shut-down-later-this-year">Ark 2 had been delayed until the "end of 2024"</a>, having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-survival-evolved-gets-new-cinematic-trailer-with-vin-diesel-coming-2023">once been planned for a 2023 release</a>. It has kept pretty quiet on any actual release date at all since then, though.</p>
<p>As Matt reported last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-scene-setter-and-anime-crossover-expansion-comes-to-ark-survival-ascended-this-december">the upcoming sequel didn't feature in the Ark content roadmap released earlier in the year</a>, which led many to speculate it won't arrive until sometime after December 2026. They were right!</p>
<p>As well as starring in Ark 2, Diesel is also serving as the executive producer on the project, bringing his game development skills to the test. Previous reports said that Diesel has played over 1,000 hours of the original game. Also, did you know his real name is actually Mark Sinclair?!</p>
<p>"Survive the past. Tame the future," reads Ark 2's official blurb. "Suddenly awakened on a primal world filled with dinosaurs and humans struggling for dominance, you must team-up with legendary heroes to confront powerful dark forces.</p>
<p>"Saddle up, and join the definitive next-gen survival experience with Ark 2!"</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Ark-related news, back in the summer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-aquatica-dlc-trailer-slammed-for-its-blatant-use-of-ai-slop">Snail Games' Aquatica expansion for Survival Evolved came under fire after it released a trailer that was clearly made using AI</a>. The video - which is no longer available to view on YouTube - featured footage such as a single person using three hands to hold onto a spear gun, as well as fish phasing in and out of existence, an octopus with the wrong number of tentacles and a human with flippers where there should have been feet.</p>
<p>Soon after this trailer for Ark: Aquatica went live, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-aquatica-developer-shifts-blame-for-disastrous-ai-trailer-onto-marketing-team">Snail Games moved to distance itself from the video</a>, blaming its marketing team.</p>

            <p>Sony and Honda have announced its new car will include PlayStation Remote Play, so passengers can stream PS4 and PS5 games on the go.</p>
<p>The Afeela 1 will be the first car from the joint venture Sony Honda Mobility, established in 2022 to produce electric vehicles. The car will be available in California first in 2026.</p>
<p>PlayStation Remote Play will be integrated into the Afeela In-Vehicle Infotainment system, so you'll need a PS4 or PS5 console at home to make use of the feature.</p>
<p>The vehicles will also feature an integrated display and premium audio system with which to play games. Presumably, you'll need to take your PlayStation controller with you on the road.</p>
<p>Note this use of Remote Play is separate to streaming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PS Plus games</a> via the cloud.</p>
<p>"The introduction of PS Remote Play embodies Afeela's vision for mobility: transforming the traveling space into a captivating and emotional one," said Izumi Kawanishi, representative director, president and COO, Sony Honda Mobility Inc.</p>
<p>"Through this integration, we are elevating the customer's entire travel experience to an unprecedented level of entertainment."</p>
<p>This is by no means the first time we've seen in-vehicle gaming. Back in 2022,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/casual-games-will-be-playable-on-a-bmw-next-year"> BMW announced it would begin offering casual gaming in its cars</a>, controlled using smartphones.</p>
<p>That same year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tesla-rolling-out-steam-integration-in-cars">Tesla announced in-vehicle Steam integration</a>, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tesla-pulls-steam-from-new-vehicles-as-its-new-gaming-computer-is-no-longer-capable-of-playing-steam-games">18 months later it was dropped</a>.</p>
