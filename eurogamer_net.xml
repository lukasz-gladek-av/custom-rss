            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-underground-remaster-hopes-increase-as-iconic-skater-says-hell-campaign-all-i-can<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a>, the skating icon has said he has "aspirations" for further remakes, including one for the popular <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-underground">Tony Hawk's Underground</a>.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://screenrant.com/tony-hawks-underground-remake-campaign/">Screen Rant</a>, Hawk said the decision to continue remaking older games ultimately rested with the company he worked with - that'd be publisher Activision, and ultimately its owner Microsoft - but that he would "campaign all I can".
</p>
<p>
Still, Hawk's wishes appear to hold at least some sway - such as with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bam-margera-officially-returning-to-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">seemingly last-minute restoration of skater Bam Margera to the roster of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a>.
</p>
<p>
"I always have aspirations," Hawk said on the possibility of Underground being remastered next. "It's not up to me generally. I'll campaign all I can, but I'm working with a much bigger company that's a lot smarter than me."
</p>
<p>
Asked if a decision on Underground was too early, before the launch of Pro Skater 3+4, Hawk added: "Yeah, we haven't even released this game."
</p>
<p>
Activision had looked ready not to continue the Tony Hawk's series at all, despite a positive reception to Pro Skater 1+2 when it arrived back in 2020. Its developer, Vicarious Visions, was later shuffled over to become part of Blizzard, and the future of Hawk's skating series put on ice. 
</p>
<p>
But teases from Hawk himself last year of talks between himself and Activision ultimately resulted in a reversal of fortunes. Earlier this year, Activision began teasing a Pro Skater 3+4 remake within Call of Duty, before making the project official on 4th March.
</p>
<p>
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 will launch on 11th July for Nintendo Switch and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S including through Game Pass Ultimate.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s mouse controls will be usable in the console's Home menu.</p>
<p>As shared in the Nintendo Today app, mouse controls won't just be for in-game but for navigating menus - there's a video of it in action too.</p>
<p>What's more, just like in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>, users simply place the Joy-Con 2 sideways on any surface to switch to mouse mode, then pick it up again to revert to the control sticks.</p>

<p>Mouse controls are one of the Switch 2's new innovative features, allowing both Joy-Con 2 to be flipped and moved along any surface - be that your coffee table, your desk, or your thighs.</p>
<p>Nintendo is even releasing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-first-dual-mouse-mode-game-is-wheelchair-basketball-drag-x-drive">dual-mouse mode game in Drag x Drive</a> - it's 3 v 3 wheelchair basketball, though with its awkward controls it feels like more of a tech demo.</p>

<p>Instead, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-is-the-best-example-of-switch-2s-varied-control-capabilities-but-you-might-want-to-work-on-your-thighs">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond feels like the best example of the varied control schemes of the Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>The first-person adventure will allow players to either use traditional stick controls, motion controls, or mouse controls. I tested this out at the Switch 2 reveal event and found the mouse controls surprisingly responsive, though I'm not convinced it will be the best way to play - it depends on the surface area of your thighs.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-edition-upgrade-prices-for-kirby-and-mario-party-cost-more-than-zelda">expanded Mario Party Jamboree on Switch 2</a> will also include new minigames to show off the mouse functionality.</p>
<p>Nintendo's Switch 2 will launch on 5th June, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">Mario Kart World as its big launch game</a>. Nintendo recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-suggestion-that-ai-generated-images-used-in-mario-kart-world">confirmed it does not include AI art</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-reserves-the-right-to-brick-your-console-following-unauthorised-use-in-bid-to-prevent-piracy">Nintendo updated its Account Agreement with a severe warning against "unauthorised use"</a> to prevent piracy.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Careful, Doom fans - details of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> have leaked ahead of its release next week.</p>
<p>As posted to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1kiyzhc/doom_the_dark_ages_screenshot_leak/">Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit</a>, some players have received their discs ahead of the 15th May street date, which means details are popping up all over the place now, including information about the plot, menus, combat, weapons, beastiary, and more.</p>

<p>"Hey dudes, I got lucky and got the [Collector's Edition on] the 8th and just finished this amazing game, what a trip. This will have spoilers, so it's up to you if you want to get spoiled," one player wrote, before individually linking dozens and dozens of screenshots with spoilers a-plenty.</p>
<p>The early shipping has also identified something else, too; it seems as though even with a physical disc, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1kighkz/doom_the_dark_ages_the_entire_game_in_the/">PS5 players have to be connected to the internet and download the entire game to their consoles</a> before they can play.</p>
<p>As reportedly verified by <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/369411/doom-the-dark-ages-z-haczykiem-w-wersji-pudelkowej-na-ps5-uzytkownik-ppe-pl-zdradza-istotny-szczegol.html">ppe.pl</a>, "the disc for Doom: The Dark Ages contains nothing but the data necessary to trigger a download of the game from the internet. This means PS5 owners hoping to step into the Doom Slayer’s boots should be prepared to download over 80 GB - the full size of the game."</p>
<p>"Literal waste of materials," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1kighkz/comment/mrelxmr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">responded</a> one commenter. "This is just profoundly stupid."</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-review">Eurogamer's Doom: the Dark Ages review</a>, Chris D. awarded it four stars out of five, writing: "It's all so simple, so joyously, generously straight ahead. You're a powerful goody, you're surrounded by powerful baddies, and you have to finish them all off. Everyone knows where they stand, and they all seem pretty happy with the roles they're playing. And it's kind of lovely."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Amazon's hit Fallout show will run for five or six seasons.</p>
<p>That's according to actor Aaron Moten, who revealed in an interview at Comic Con Liverpool that when he signed on for the role of Maximus, he was told to expect the show to run for "five, six" seasons in total.</p>

<p>"When I signed on to do the series, we would have a starting point, and they gave me the end point," Moten explained (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-tv-show-six-five-seasons-of-story-planned/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>"That endpoint hasn't changed, but it is season five, season six, type of endpoint. We've always known that we're going to take our time with the development of the characters."</p>
<p>Given Fallout's rich lore across several games, this may not be a complete surprise, but it's good news nonetheless, as it assures Fallout fans that the show was created with longevity in mind.</p>
