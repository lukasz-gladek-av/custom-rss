            <p>
Classic arena shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/unreal-tournament-2004">Unreal Tournament 2004</a> has risen from the grave and is now available to download for free, all thanks to a dedicated group of fans working with developer Epic Games' blessing. And the upshot of all this is the much-loved arena FPS has received its first patch "in over 20 years".
</p>
<p>
When Unreal Tournament 2004 originally launched, Eurogamer branded it the "mother of all first-person shooters", praising its massive map roster, its 32-player Onslaught mode, and the welcome introduction of vehicles. All that was enough to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-ut2004-pc">earn it ye olde 9/10</a>, and plenty of other people loved it too. However, support for Unreal Tournament 2004 officially ended in 2022, when Epic terminated its legacy online services and pulled the game - alongside a number of titles - from digital storefronts.
</p>
<p>
But it turns out the end was not the end. Late last year, fan community OldUnreal announced it was working to revive Unreal Tournament 2004 (the group previously resurrected Unreal and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a> 1999), patch it with bug fixes and quality of life improvements, then release it for free - all with Epic's blessing. And that day has finally arrived, with Unreal Tournament 2004 (as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/unreal-tournament-2004-is-now-available-for-free-thanks-to-its-fan-community-and-theyve-even-updated-the-game-for-modern-pcs-this-is-the-first-public-patch-for-unreal-tournament-2004-in-over-20-years/">PC Gamer</a>) available to download right now.
</p>
<p>
By <a href="https://www.oldunreal.com/downloads/ut2004/full-game-installers/">heading over to the OldUnreal website</a>, interested Windows users can download and run the group's newly released installer. That, in turn, will grab the original Unreal Tournament 2004 disc image from OldUnreal's servers, extract their contents, install the game, and automatically patch it to the latest version. Linux and macOS are <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/FullGameInstallers/releases">pointed toward the group's Github page</a>.
</p><p>
"Please note that this is the first public patch for Unreal Tournament 2004 in over 20 years," project manager (and professor of computer science) Stijn-volckaert writes in the game's <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/UT2004Patches/releases">new patch notes</a>. "We have implemented numerous fixes and improvements, written a new SDL backend for Linux and macOS, and even a new renderer. We have also migrated the entire codebase to modern build systems. Some new bugs may have slipped in!"
</p>
<p>
So there you go! The "mother of all first-person shooters" can now be downloaded and played for free - and what better time to start revisiting some video game classics than right now, when AI companies are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-blames-dwindling-steam-deck-supplies-on-ram-and-storage-shortages-as-ai-driven-demand-further-threatens-games-industry">making it increasingly difficult to buy new hardware</a>?

            <p>Soulframe, the upcoming fantasy action RPG by Digital Extremes, has totally overhauled its progression system as part of the latest Preludes alpha update. Whereas before player progress involved a more traditional skilling system, a more intuitive alternative has been integrated.</p>
<p>This comes in the form of the three in-game Virtues - Courage, Spirit, and Grace - which to put simply represent melee, magic, and ranged respectively. Prior to this update, you could invest points into these Virtues to build towards the kind of playstyle you want.</p>
<p>With the latest update, players can instead see their virtues shift automatically with each level up. In addition, they can equip a 'Virtue Prism' to concentrate on a particular direction for their character, which will result in the virtues shifting manually. In addition, a new armour system attaches virtue scaling to equipment, the idea being a full set of melee armour will work better with more Courage, etc.</p>
<p>Alongside these drastic changes to player progression, more customisation options have been added to the game. These include face, hair, and weapon customisation, all of which can be played with via the Verminia in the Nightfold hub. There are also three new weapons to unlock: the Clivers, Basker's Wrest, and Seathorn.</p><p>Finally, there's a new mission type in which you destroy polluting towers dotted across the map. Also,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-alpha-prelude-access-2025-delay-2026"> if you watched the Tennocon trailer last year</a>, you may remember a big bear boss battle! Beating that now unlocks a more challenging open world bear boss that you can take on for tantalising rewards.</p>
<p>When Soulframe will leave this period of Prelude alpha tests remains a mystery, though it's clear the team at Digital Extremes is cramming as many updates to the game as they can before a big launch event, perhaps a smart move <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframes-leads-dont-know-if-itll-survive-the-brutal-live-service-market-so-theyre-betting-big-on-a-community-first-approach">given how treacherous the live service space is</a>. That being said, players have been able to spend some cash early to support development, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-is-getting-founders-packs">Founders packs offering exclusive cosmetics and more</a>.</p>
