            <p>
Nintendo has announced its next batch of SNES games headed to the Switch Online catalogue - and there's a pretty obvious nod to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> on the list.
</p>
<p>
Four strategy games from Koei all arrive for Switch Online next Friday, 28th March, including two Nobunaga's Ambition titles. 
</p>
<p>
Nobunaga's Ambition lets you compete for control of Japan either as the infamous Oda Nobunaga or his rivals as they attempt to unify the country. This is the same conflict that plays out over the course of Ubisoft's new Feudal Japan-set Assassin's Creed, in which Oda Nobunaga is also a key figure.
</p>
<p>
Coming to Nintendo Switch Online next week are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Nobunaga's Ambition</li>
<li>Nobunaga's Ambition: Lord of Darkness</li>
<li>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 4: Wall of Fire </li>
<li>Uncharted Water: New Horizons</li>
</ul>
<p>
And you can watch footage of all four games in the video below:
</p>
<p>
28th March is also when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-removing-game-from-switch-online-catalogue-in-japan">SNES game Super Soccer will be delisted from Nintendo's Switch Online catalogue</a>, at least in Japan - the first game to disappear from the subscription service.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer previously contacted Nintendo for more information on why the game will be removed, and whether this removal will also take place elsewhere in the world. We're yet to receive any more information there.

            <p>
Ubisoft has announced its first sales milestone for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which launched yesterday and had notched up more than a million players by the afternoon. 
</p>
<p>
It's our first indication of how well the game is performing, as a pivotal title not just for the Assassin's Creed series, but Ubisoft in general - though it is still very early.
</p>
<p>
"It's not even 4pm here in Canada and Assassin's Creed Shadows has already passed 1 million players," stated a message posted to the official <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1902802072640295067">Assassin's Creed social media account</a>. "Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for joining this adventure in Feudal Japan. We are beyond excited to start this journey with you!"

<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows faces some tough comparisons - the series' last large launch Valhalla arrived in late 2020, when many of us were at home - and arrives at a time when Ubisoft is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-considering-fresh-business-to-own-assassins-creed-and-other-big-franchises-co-owned-by-others-like-tencent">reportedly considering a sale or some other kind of reorganisation to turn around its ailing fortunes</a>.
</p>
<p>
The game was also repeatedly delayed for further polish, following last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> - another key title for Ubisoft, but one <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">which significantly underperformed</a>.
</p>
<p>
How well does Assassin's Creed Shadows have to do for Ubisoft to consider it a success? The publisher has not said. But it's worth considering the scope and scale of the game, the number of Ubisoft studios working on it, and the impact of those delays. 
</p>
<p>
For example, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">Split Fiction notched up 1m sales in just 48 hours last week</a>, but will have cost far less to make and market.
</p>
<p>
An early look at <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3159330/charts/#1w">Steam figures</a> - as the only major platform to share player numbers publicly - shows a peak of 41,412 players overnight. But again, comparisons are difficult - the game is also available on PC via Ubisoft Connect, so this does not paint a full picture. 
</p>
<p>
In other words, it's likely we'll have to wait until after the game's first weekend - and likely more word from Ubisoft itself - before Shadows' early fortunes become clear.
</p>
<p>"Majestic in scope, impressive in detail, Ubisoft's epic adventure honours the beauty of feudal Japan, even if its strongest moments are saved for the personal stories of its two protagonists," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Eurogamer's Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> may have only been released a couple of weeks ago, but there is already a bidding war for the rights to a reported film adaptation.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-video-game-adaptation-1236344367/">Variety</a>, which revealed a film adaptation of Hazelight's latest co-op caper is now in the pipeline. Sources told the publication that media company Story Kitchen - a name you may recognise from our coverage of other video game to screen projects, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toejam-and-earl-film-in-the-works-at-amazon">ToeJam and Earl</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-animated-tv-series-in-the-works">Vampire Survivors</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slime-rancher-movie-rights-acquired-by-production-company-story-kitchen">Slime Rancher</a> - is in the process of assembling the film's cast, writers and director.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Variety stated offers for rights to the Split Fiction film are "coming in from multiple top Hollywood studios", although no names were mentioned in today's report.</p>

<p>This is not the first Hazelight game reportedly getting a film adaptation. In 2022, marital platformer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hazelight-studios-acclaimed-it-takes-two-being-adapted-for-film-and-television">It Takes Two was also said to be making its way to both the big and small screen</a>.</p>
<p>It was later suggested that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-takes-two-movie-enters-development-at-amazon-studios-dwayne-johnson-may-star">Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson was attached to the film project</a>, while Pat Casey and Josh Miller - the writing duo behind dj2's live-action Sonic the Hedgehog movies - were working on the big screen adaptation.</p>
<p>Little has been heard of the project since, and earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-josef-fares-doesnt-know-whats-happening-with-the-it-takes-two-film-adaptation">Hazelight founder Josef Fares told Eurogamer even he didn't know what was happening with the It Takes Two film</a>.</p>

<p>As for Split Fiction, well, it has certainly done well for itself. Along with glowing reviews across the board, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">the game sold 2m copies in the first week of release</a>.</p>
<p>"Fantastic from start to finish, Split Fiction is one of the most inventive and joyful co-op games to date, and a testament to the power of human imagination," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">Eurogamer's five star Split Fiction review</a>.</p>
<p>Also in Split Fiction news, earlier this week two players were invited to Sweden to see Hazelight's next game after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-players-invited-to-see-studios-next-game-after-beating-rock-hard-secret-level">they completed a secret level so challenging that "barely" any members of the studio's own team have managed to complete it</a>. "This is a crazy, crazy achievement," Fares told the skilled duo via a pre-recorded message found at the end of the level.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microsoft seemingly has an update in mind for the Xbox App which will show every game users have installed on their PC. That includes titles on both Steam and Epic Games.</p>
<p>Microsoft inadvertently included a mockup of this  user interface as part of an official blog post titled <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/03/gdc-2025-opening-a-billion-doors-with-xbox/">GDC 2025: Opening a Billion Doors with Xbox</a>. It subsequently removed the image after enquiries were made, but not before eagle-eyed viewers took a copy.</p>
<p>The image itself, which you can see in the header above, showed an Xbox UI displayed on a TV screen, which at cursory glance may seem unextraordinary, however on closer inspection you can see the UI has a clear Steam tab listed along with the likes of Game Pass, Recently Added and Owned. Elsewhere in the image, the same UI with that telling Steam tab label is displayed on tablets and handheld devices.</p>

<p>While only a Steam label is visible on Xbox's mockup, sources tell <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633478/microsoft-xbox-steam-games-support-ui">The Verge</a> Microsoft is working on an Xbox app update that will show <em>every</em> game users have installed on their PCs, so that includes the Epic Games Store even though it is missing from the image.</p>
<p>"I understand Microsoft will label these games accordingly," The Verge's Tom Warren writes, adding this update is still "in the early stages" of development. It may not even ship at all, Warren suggests.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Microsoft for further comment on the leaked UI images.</p>

Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-next-gen-console-reportedly-targeting-2027-with-handheld-device-due-this-year">a much-rumoured handheld Xbox is said to be arriving later this year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
