            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is launching a new Daft Punk Experience, but is adamant the robot rock duo aren't getting back together.</p>
<p>Unlike previous Fortnite concerts - from the likes of Marshmello, Travis Scott, and Ariana Grande - The Daft Punk Experience is instead a "fully interactive playground" in the Discover(y) mode, with multiple rooms in which to enjoy the music and lose yourself to dance.</p>
<p>That includes blasting robots with a soundwave laser in the Robot Rock Arena, remixing songs at Dream Chamber Studios, or making a Lego music video at Around the World. Some form of "afterparty" is also being teased, whatever da funk that might be.</p>
<p>"The band may be no longer, but their music lives on in Fortnite," reads a new blog post on the experience.</p>
<p>And to really hammer it home, the FAQ directly states: "The band is not getting back together". So no, you don't feel it coming - it's the end of the line.</p>
<p>It also states the experience won't feature any new music, as all songs have been previously released. Players will be able to make their own mashups though, but good luck making them harder, better, faster, or stronger.</p>
<p>The experience launches on 27th September at 2pm ET (that's 7pm UK time), but players are advised to join early. It will then be available "for a while" in Discover.</p>
<p>Of course, a Fortnite collaboration wouldn't be complete without a load of stuff to buy, either individually or as part of the Dark Punk Bundle. It includes song emotes, glittery outfits, and some adorable Lego characters so you too can be a Starboy, as well as other Jam Tracks including the duo's collaborations with The Weeknd.</p>

<p>Speaking of Lego, the first ever music-reactive build will be added to Fortnite - it's a lego pyramid that lights up when music is played.</p>
<p>Full details can be found on the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/party-harder-better-faster-stronger-in-fortnite-with-the-daft-punk-experience">Fortnite blog</a>, so you can read up on the experience one more time.</p>
<p>Last week, Epic announced it would be giving Fortnite creators some more digital love by allowing them to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-creators-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items-to-make-more-money-but-are-creative-mode-offerings-like-steal-a-brainrot-what-players-want">sell in-game items on their created islands</a>.</p>

            <p>This year has marked Xbox's "largest investment in Game Pass to date", according to ID@Xbox boss Chris Charla.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-xboxs-increasingly-vital-indie-publishing-operation">Eurogamer</a>, Charla discussed the current state of the subscription service in the face of recent criticism, noting positive sentiment from developers and a desire to return for future projects.</p>
<p>"The majority of partners who've had a game in Game Pass want to bring their future titles to the service," said Charla. "As a result, we've signed deals with more than 150 partners to expand the catalogue. We continue to engage with hundreds of partners each year to review upcoming titles.</p>
<p>"Last year, we worked with over 50 teams to sign their first Game Pass deal. This year marks our largest investment in Game Pass to date, and we remain focused on delivering the most exciting and diverse catalogue in gaming."</p>
<p>Xbox has received criticism for Game Pass in recent months. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arkane-studios-founder-calls-game-pass-unsustainable-model-and-one-which-is-damaging-the-industry">Arkane Studios founder Raphael Colantonio</a> described the service as "an unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade".</p>
<p>In a back and forth on social media on the "cannibalisation" of sales, Larian director of publishing Michael Douse added "smaller teams with new or riskier" games can benefit from Game Pass, but he prefers "Sony's 'lifecycle management'" method of adding games following initial sales.</p><p>Former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden discussed the perceived profitability of Game Pass in a discussion with <a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "There's a lot of debates going on," he said. "Is Game Pass profitable? Is Game Pass not profitable? What does that mean? That's really not the right question to ask anyway.</p>
<p>"You can do all kinds of financial jiggery-pokery for any sort of corporate service to make it look profitable if you wanted to. You take enough costs out and say that's off the balance sheet and, oh look, it's profitable now. The real issue for me on things like Game Pass is, is it healthy for the developer?"</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/football-manager-player-numbers-are-through-the-roof-thanks-to-subscription-platforms-like-game-pass-and-netflix-series-boss-miles-jacobson-explains-how">Football Manager boss Miles Jacobson recently told Eurogamer</a> player numbers for the series have skyrocketed since being added to subscription platforms. </p>
<p>"We built a whole business model around it," he said. "You can't just turn around and do this - this was before we launched on the subscription platforms, we'd been talking about it. And we'd been working out what we were going to do for five years - it was a five-year journey before we went with the first experiment, and then we did another experiment, and then we did another experiment, and then we learned from those experiments, and that's when the full strategy was put in place."</p><p>In a broader interview with Eurogamer on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-xboxs-increasingly-vital-indie-publishing-operation">state of indie games on Xbox</a>, Charla noted the breadth of games showcased by Xbox at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>. "It is just really a recognition by Xbox of the absolute crucial need for diversity in our portfolio," he said.</p>
