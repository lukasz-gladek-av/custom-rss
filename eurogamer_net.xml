            <p>
Our first look at the long-awaited remake of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion comes from a leak of screenshots and details taken from developer Virtuos' website.
</p>
<p>
A remake or remaster of Bethesda's beloved Oblivion has been expected for years, and has been the subject of numerous industry whisperings in recent weeks. Eurogamer understands Bethesda's current plan is to shadow drop the game next week on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including via Xbox Game Pass.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of then, fans on reddit have been poking around Virtuos' website and discovered a number of images that look set to be used imminently, upon the game's announcement. These include screenshots of the game, and comparison images showcasing this new version of Oblivion versus Bethesda's original from 2006. 
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="631"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1jzppz9/oblivion_images_on_virtuos_website/">Oblivion images on Virtuos website</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Taurnil/">u/Taurnil</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/">oblivion</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Eurogamer has corroborated that these files - and there are more here <a href="https://imgur.com/a/oblivion-remake-OUg7kXu">collected on imgur</a> - are currently being hosted on Virtuos' servers (for now). We've also contacted Bethesda for comment.</p>
<p>Word of an Oblivion remake or remaster first popped up back in 2020, via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-bethesda-roadmap-reveals-unannounced-releases-including-dishonored-3">references to the project in a leaked internal Microsoft document</a>. A further leak in 2023, from a former employee of Virtuos, confirmed the game was in development at the studio as a full remake, and was being built using Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2025, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-reportedly-set-for-imminent-reveal">the leaks have come thick and fast</a>, with an imminent reveal expected. Whispers began gathering pack back in January, however, when a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-details-surface-as-leaker-suggests-its-coming-in-june">Virtuos employee updated their LinkedIn profile to mention a not-so-mysterious "unannounced Unreal Engine 5 remake"</a>, with newly reworked stamina, sneaking, blocking, archery and hit reaction systems, as well as a fresh HUD.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Eurogamer's Jim Trinca called on Bethesda to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">"remake Morrowind, not Oblivion, you cowards"</a>. I fear that ship has now sailed.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The long-running Metal Gear in Concert series will finally get a UK premiere on 1st November 2025, at London's Royal Albert Hall.
</p>
<p>
Metal Gear Solid voice talent Stefanie Joosten (Quiet) and Donna Burke (iDroid) will make special guest appearances, while the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra performs excerpts from the series' soundtrack and "iconic songs".
</p>
<p>
If you're a fan of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s stealth action series, you'll be able to listen to tracks such as Encounter and Father and Son, plus songs such as The Best is Yet to Come, Snake Eater and Heavens Divide.
</p>
<p>
For a taster, here's Burke belting out Sins of the Father from the 2020 Metal Gear in Concert performance held in Tokyo. It's stirring stuff.

<p>
Metal Gear in Concert began in Osaka in 2017, and has since been performed most years in Japan. Subsequent performances have been toured internationally to Paris, New York and Los Angeles - but never to the UK, until this year.
</p>
<p>
Tempted? Tickets for the event's matinee (at 2.30pm) and evening (at 7.30pm) performances on 1st November will go on general sale at 10am this Thursday, 17th April via the <a href="https://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/events/2025/metal-gear-in-concert">Royal Albert Hall ticket site</a>. 
</p>
<p>Kojima may have now left the Metal Gear series behind, but he is making a return to its genre for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-making-new-metal-gear-solid-style-game-and-movie-for-playstation">the mysterious upcoming Physint, a fresh action-espionage game and movie</a> set to arrive at some point for PlayStation 5, following the upcoming launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Remember <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a>, Ubisoft's beleaguered pirate adventure? Having been announced in 2017, the game finally released in February of last year after numerous delays and setbacks. However, Skull and Bones failed to make positive waves on its debut, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skull-and-bones-metacritic-user-reviews-open-to-generally-unfavourable-scores">players calling out the underwhelming gameplay and poorly designed end game</a>, among other gripes.</p>
<p>Since its release, Skull and Bones has pretty much fallen off the radar, to be honest. At the time of writing, the game currently boasts <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2853730/charts/">221 players on Steam</a>, and while that is obviously not a complete overview (the game released on other platforms, as well) it still isn't an especially auspicious number .</p>
<p>But despite all this, Ubisoft is still updating Skull and Bones (perhaps tinkering away with the engine and such while it gets ready for the yet-to-be-announced, but much desired and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-reportedly-remaking-rollicking-pirate-adventure-assassins-creed-black-flag">heavily rumoured piratical remake of Assassin's Creed Black Flag</a>).</p>

<p>Last night, Skull and Bones' team released patch notes for the first season of the game's second year, known as Ascent into Chaos. This new season kicks off today, 15th April, and includes things like a new ship (a Schooner), a new status effect (Shell-Shocked), new upgrade tree and a new pet in the form of a tiger cub.</p>
<p>Item Ascension will also arrive this season, with the accompanying lore blurb reading:</p>
<p>"The Indian Ocean is set ablaze by the war between the Megacorporations, with each side looking to gain an advantage over the other by using increasingly powerful weapons. The origins of these ascended weapons remain a mystery, but what is known is that acquiring them may be vital to surviving the coming onslaught."</p>
<p>You will need to have made your way up to Infamy Tier 9 at a minimum to be able to make use of Item Ascension. When you reach this, though, you can expect to recieve some mail which will enable you to begin the Ascension and Modification quest. Once you do that, you will then need to pop over to  the Blacksmith to unlock the Item Ascension feature.</p>
<p>There are three modification grades, Ubisoft explains. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic - General improvements</li>
<li>Advanced - Noteworthy improvements</li>
<li>Special - Powerful improvements with unique properties</li>
</ul>
<p>Modification Slots, meanwhile, are assigned based on the weapon rarity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common - 2 Basic, 1 Advanced, 1 Special</li>
<li>Uncommon - 1 Basic, 1 Advanced, 1 Special</li>
<li>Rare - 2 Basic, 1 Special</li>
<li>Epic - 1 Basic, 1 Advanced</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find full details in <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/skull-and-bones/news-updates/19T7NArKvzO1MofftUXPDi">Ubisoft's Skull and Bones blog post</a>.</p>
<p>In an accompanying Skull and Bones: Year 2 Showcase video, senior community developer Alexis Cretton thanked the game's community, adding Ubisoft was "committed to support Skull and Bones for years ahead".</p>
<p>You can check out the full showcase below.</p>

<p>On its release last year, our Matt complimented Skull and Bones' "beautiful world" and "bombastic ship-to-ship combat". However, he was less enamoured with the game's boring busywork and tedious traversal.</p>
<p>As he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skull-and-bones-review">wrote in Eurogamer's two star Skull and Bones review</a>: "No game, let alone a swashbuckling pirate adventure, should be so consistently dull."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
