            <p>To celebrate the conclusion of the Fallout show's second season, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> has gone free-to-play for a limited time. It also gained a new $30 DLC pack featuring a camo from the series.</p>
<p>The free-to-play period, which has already started and will last until the 5th February for Xbox and PC players (and the 4th February on PlayStation). You'll have access to all the released updates for the game, giving a pretty substantial peek into what Fallout 76 has got going on.</p>
<p>For those jumping in that are super fans of the Amazon show, the NCR power armour is available too! You'll have to bust out the wallet for it though, as it's part of the new Mojave bundle. It contains the power armour, as well as the ranger power armour paint, NCR flag, New Vegas neon sign, Ad Victoriam super sledge, legion legate outfit, and player titles.</p>

<p>That bundle costs $30. Steam reviews for the bundle currently lie at Mostly Positive, but taking a look at the reviews themselves paint a mixed picture.<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/CirillaFionaElenRiannon/recommended/4250650/"> Some have added a phrase from the show</a>: "Never underestimate the power of brand recognition", <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/moonlitfrappe/recommended/4250650/">while others</a> wish they could buy the NCR power armour on its lonesome: "Only bought it for the Ranger armor, should've been in the atomic shop/earned via quest. I'm tired of Fallout being the staple of microtransactions franchise for content."</p><p>Amazon recent went to great lengths to tempt stragglers in to watch the popular Fallout show recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-can-watch-the-first-season-of-amazons-excellent-fallout-adaptation-free-on-youtube-but-act-quickly-as-it-wont-be-there-for-long">by uploading season one to YouTube</a>, though only for a limited time. As for Fallout 76, it recently received its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-76s-new-update-features-walton-goggins-as-the-ghoul-from-amazons-tv-series">Fallout show themed Burning Springs update</a>.</p>

            <p>The Metal Gear Solid series has sold over 65.5m copies worldwide, according to a new business post by Konami.</p>
<p>The post, <a href="https://www.konami.com/corporate/en/business/digitalentertainment.html">published on the official Konami corporate website</a>, breaks down a selection of milestone achievements for its various IPs. The crowning achievement of this breakdown is the Metal Gear Series, which has surpassed 65.5m total worldwide sales. However, other big series from the Japanese games company have also taken centre stage alongside the stealth action series.</p>
<p>These include the Pawafuru Puroyakyu series, which has passed 26.3m sales, YuGiOh games at 32.5m, Momotaro Dentetsu at 19.9m, and Silent Hill which has made it past 14m sales. Of of these stats run up to the end of December 2025.</p>

<p>The page also includes some pretty eye-watering download stats for various mobile and console games. eFootball has apparently surpassed 950m total sales since 1995, and YuGiOh Duel Links is no slouch either, passing 150m downloads since its release in 2016.</p><p>As a page aimed at impressing investors, there are additional interesting tidbits included in paragraphs meant to sell Konami as a forward-thinking company. This includes a descriptor of Konami as "a leading company in esports", thanks to YuGiOh, eFootball, and Pawafuru Puroyakyu.</p>
<p>The company also claims it will: "continue to take on challenges of the latest innovation by utilizing new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), fifth/sixth generation mobile communications (5G/6G), cloud technology, WEB3, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFT</a>, and VR/AR."</p>
<p><a href="https://img.konami.com/ir/en/ir-data/statements/2026/en0129_cf84s6.pdf">Looking at Konami's latest quarterly report</a>, it certainly seems as though the company is doing well. It saw a 16.3 percent increase in income from its digital entertainment sector compared to last year, and a total revenue increase of 13.6 percent.</p>

            <p>The first script for an upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> film adaptation based on Hazelight's game of the same name has been penned.</p>
<p>It was first announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-film-in-the-works-as-bidding-war-for-rights-begins">Split Fiction, which sees two aspiring writers trapped in simulations of their own stories, was going to be getting the movie treatment</a> last year. At this time, sources said media company Story Kitchen - a name you may recognise from our coverage of other video game to screen projects, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toejam-and-earl-film-in-the-works-at-amazon">ToeJam and Earl</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-animated-tv-series-in-the-works">Vampire Survivors</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slime-rancher-movie-rights-acquired-by-production-company-story-kitchen">Slime Rancher</a> - was in the process of assembling the film's cast, writers and director.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Soon after, it was revealed that Euphoria and Eden actor Sydney Sweeney would star in the upcoming film, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sydney-sweeney-to-star-in-split-fiction-film-written-by-deadpool-wolverine-team">Deadpool screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick would handle the script</a>. And, handle the script, they appear to have done.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/DTw4CbhDZZT/">Moviezine</a>, Hazelight studio head Josef Fares said he had seen the first finalised script for the Split Fiction film. "I got the first version of the script today but you know, there's so much talk in Hollywood. I usually say it like this 'I believe it when I see it'," Fares said (translated by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/split-fiction-game-director-exciting-update-sydney-sweeney-movie-3311457/">Dexerto</a>).</p><p>Fares added he had chatted with a "hyped" Sweeney about the project, as well [<strong>NOTE:</strong> Eurogamer commenter @f53b3d06 has said this is a mistranslation by Dexerto. Rather than the actress being 'hyped' for the film, Fares instead said: "It's kind of a done deal that it will star... what's her name, the one that is so hyped/popular... Sydney Sweeney", as he struggled to recall her name at first]. "I've had a meeting with her and she seems super chill," Fares said of the actor.</p>
<p>But, while this may be the case, there is still no word on when we can expect filming for Split Fiction to actually kick off. It could be some time, given how busy Sweeney's schedule is. As well as Split Fiction, the actor is also attached to Colman Domingo's romantic drama Scandalous, which is set to shoot early this year, and a Gundam adaptation. On the other side of the camera, it has been reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-outrun-getting-movie-adaptation-from-michael-bay-and-sydney-sweeney">Sweeney is set to produce an adaptation of OutRun</a>. </p>

<p>Split Fiction isn't the only Hazelight game getting the film treatment. In 2022, marital platformer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hazelight-studios-acclaimed-it-takes-two-being-adapted-for-film-and-television">It Takes Two was also said to be making its way to both the big and small screen</a>.</p>
<p>However, little has been heard of this particular project since, and last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-josef-fares-doesnt-know-whats-happening-with-the-it-takes-two-film-adaptation">Hazelight founder Josef Fares told Eurogamer even he didn't know what was happening with the It Takes Two film</a>.</p>
