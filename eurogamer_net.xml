            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Riot Games has revealed the eighth character for its upcoming 2v2 fighting game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/project-l">2XKO</a>. Vi is punching through to the roster, and will be playable by the public at the Evo fighting game event early next month.</p>
<p>A closed beta for 2XKO has also been announced, starting on the 9th September. All players who have been granted access to previous Alpha Lab tests will automatically be thrown into this closed beta. Not only that, but this closed beta will roll into the games' full release.</p>
<p>With Vi's addition, 2XKO will have eight characters in total. She'll first be playable at Evo, the massive fighting game event taking place early next month. After that, you'll need to get into that closed beta to try her out, or wait until launch.</p>

<p>This reveal also comes with a gameplay trailer for Vi, showing her off in-action. She's looking like an ultra-aggressive brawler with the ability to carry enemies across the screen with relative ease, and pick 'em up off the ground for extended combos. A pure rushdown character!
</p>
<p>As for when the launch will actually be? Well, the game is still aiming for a 2025 release date as far as we know. We also know the team is targeting a 10 champion launch roster. This means, assuming plans are the same, that between today and December, we're still due two more champions reveals.</p>
<p>Vi obviously is a popular champion. Since the release of Arcane and that series' sheer popularity, both Vi and Jinx have proven fan-favourites among the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> community. Vi is also a character early 2XKO fans have speculated about for a while, given her fist-fighting style and her presence on some wall art at the 2XKO development office.</p>
<p>Are you happy with the Vi pick? Let us know down below, as well as who else you'd like to see make their way to 2XKO!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/heads-up-arcane-fans-vi-has-been-revealed-as-2xkos-eighth-fighter-ahead-of-its-final-beta-landing-in-september]]></content:encoded>

DJ Pikachu has been and gone, taking the latest Pok√©mon Direct (or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOvzYU-UIcU">Pok√©mon Presents</a> if you must) with him. And this time around, we got Pok√©news aplenty, with small furry fistfuls of new Z-A details, some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pok√©mon Go</a> updates, a new Pok√©mon puzzler, and more. But if you missed it - or simply need a refresher - you'll find everything announced below.
</p>
<h3>A quick bit on this year's Pok√©mon World Championships</h3>
<p>
First up, a reminder that the Pok√©mon World Championships are coming to Anaheim, California this year. They're running from 15th-17th August, with competitors set to do battle across the likes of Pok√©mon Violet and Scarlet, the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game, Pok√©mon Go, and Pok√©mon Unite. All competitors get a "celebratory" promo card, so hooray. There're <a href="https://champions.pokemon.com/en-us/">more details over on the Pok√©mon website</a>.
</p>
<h3>Here's a look at Pok√©mon Concierge's upcoming new episodes</h3>

<p>
Pok√©mon Concierge - Netflix's gorgeously animated and well-received TV spin-off - is returning to the streaming service with more episodes, and we got an eye-catching trailer to remind us of that. Better yet, there's an air date for the new episodes, which we now know will be available from 4th September.

<p>
Aardman Animation, the studio behind the much-loved Wallace and Gromit series, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-meets-shaun-the-sheep-in-upcoming-aardman-stop-motion-animated-series">working on a new stop-motion Pok√©mon TV show</a>. It promises a unique look at the Pok√©mon world, told from the critters' perspective, all presented using the "signature Aardman sense of character and comedy and craft". It's called Pok√©mon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch and Pichu and - as you can see in its teaser trailer above - looks delightful. This one's due to arrive in 2027.

<h3>A quick peek at Japan's Pok√©Park Kanto theme park attraction</h3>
<p>
Pok√©Park Kanto - the first "permanent outdoor Pok√©mon attraction" - is opening within Japan's Yomiuriland amusement park "soon" and we got a little taste of the activities visitors can enjoy should they find themselves within its walls. It's divided into two area, Sedge Town and the Pok√©mon Forest. In the forest, visitors can see various Pok√©mon interacting with each other, while the town is an area where Pok√©mon and Trainers gather. It's opening in 2026, with tickets set to go on sale later this year.

Over in Pok√©mon Sleep, players can research Raikou, Entei, and Suicune this September, and a new area - Amber Canyon - arrives in November. As for Pok√©mon Unite, Latios joins on 18th July and Latias arrives on 8th August, all to commemorate the games fourth anniversary.

<h3>Pok√©mon Friends revealed and out today</h3>

<p>
And if that's not enough spin-off games to be getting on with, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-friends-is-a-plushie-focused-puzzle-game-and-its-out-now">there's now Pok√©mon Friends</a>, a Pok√©mon-themed mini-game puzzler featuring sliding blocks, rotating tracks, and more. Solving puzzles unlocks digital plushies you can use to decorate your in-game "plush room", and it's available today on Switch, iOS and Android. 
</p>
<h3>Some Pok√©mon Violet and Scarlet news, including more Tera Raids</h3>
<p>
After a quick reminder Pok√©mon Violet and Scarlet now have a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> update improving framerate and resolution, we got the news a fresh Tera Raid battle event starts tomorrow, 23rd July, featuring shiny versions of Wo-Chien, Chien-Pao, Ting-Lu, and Chi-Yu, with each being available for one week starting 23rd July and ending 14th September. However, just completing a battle isn't enough to secure the Pok√©mon - you can only add them to your team after they've been defeated 1m times by the community. Various weekly Pok√©mon Mass Outbreak events are set to run concurrently, and there's also a tracksuit apparel item you can acquire by entering the code STRACKSU1T or VTRACKSU1T into Scarlet and Violet respectively.

<p>
The previously announced Pok√©mon Champions, which lets players battle each other in an arena using new or previous Pok√©mon Partners (you'll need to use Pok√©mon Home in order to access the latter), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-stadium-alike-new-game-pokemon-champions-gets-a-2026-release-date-in-new-action-packed-gameplay-trailer">got another airing during today's showcase</a>, offering a look at battling, the newly revealed training feature, and more. There's still no release date for Pok√©mon Champions yet, but it's coming to Switch, iOS, and Android next year.
</p>
<h3>And lastly, Pok√©mon Z-A returns with fresh details</h3>
<figure>
<p>

<p>
And finally, the big one: Pok√©mon Z-A. GameFreak had plenty to say on its latest mainline Pok√©mon entry - here seen running on Switch 2 - including a look at Lumiose City, its story, Z-A Royale battles, side activities (including character customisation <em>and</em> customisable Furfrous), plus photo mode. You can read more on Z-A's latest showing - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mega-dragonite-debuts-in-fresh-look-at-pokemon-legends-z-a">details on Rogue Mega Evolved Pok√©mon</a> - elsewhere on Eurogamer. If you want to know what Pok√©s will be making an appearance, check out our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-pokemon-legends-z-a-returning">returning Pok√©mon</a> list. It's out 16th October, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-2-bundle-announced">alongside a Switch 2 bundle</a>, and that, I'm afraid, is the end of today's news.

<p>Training Pok√©mon like this appears to cost a type of in-game currency, though how to earn this currency has yet to been revealed in this gameplay presentation.</p>
<p>Pok√©mon Champions was first revealed in February of this year with a cinematic trailer, but this is the first time we've actually seen lenghty gameplay of Pok√©mon Champions in-action. It's safe to say that for those who are competitively minded, this is an exciting title worth looking out for.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-stadium-alike-new-game-pokemon-champions-gets-a-2026-release-date-in-new-action-packed-gameplay-trailer]]></content:encoded>
