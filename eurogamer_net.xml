            <p>Nintendo's 3 v 3 wheelchair basketball game Drag x Drive doesn't appear to have support for local multiplayer.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Nintendo announced a release date for Drag x Drive, and now more details about the upcoming release have come to light via the game's store page on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>'s eShop.</p>
<p>While specific multiplayer modes aren't listed, the page reveals the game will retail for Â£16.99 here in the UK, and support up to 12 players online - online being the key word here. Drag x Drive can only be played by one player per console, meaning split-screen local multiplayer seemingly won't be an option.</p>

<p>This means even if you have an additional pair of Switch 2 Joy Con, you won't be able to participate in a spot of basketball with your friends and family at home. This seems like quite a missed opportunity, if you ask me. Eurogamer has asked Nintendo to comment on Drag x Drive's multiplayer support, and will update when we know more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-first-dual-mouse-mode-game-is-wheelchair-basketball-drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive was first announced back in April</a>, during Nintendo's dedicated Switch 2 Direct. The game will make use of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-good-are-switch-2s-mouse-controls-eurogamers-verdict-from-the-big-reveal-event">Switch 2's mouse functionality</a>, with players using the console's Joy Con to "intuitively steer, speed up, perform tricks and make plays such as dunks".</p>
<p>Drag x Drive is set to arrive on 14th August <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/drag-x-drive-wheels-onto-switch-2-as-an-eshop-exclusive-this-august">as a Switch 2 eShop exclusive</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-game-drag-x-drive-appears-to-not-support-local-multiplayer]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-endgame-gets-better-dune-awakening-vastly-expands-pve-portion-of-the-deep-desert-in-its-new-public-test-server.1228863/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> now has a public test client, which offers players an early peak at upcoming changes coming to the game. One of these is a substantial change to the endgame Deep Desert - a vast expansion to the shielded PvE section.</p>
<p>Right now in the live game, the shielded PvE areas of the mostly-PvP dominated Deep Desert covers zones A and B. However in the Public Test Client version of the game, this has been pushed far out into the sands, covering zones A through half of E.</p>
<p>This comes in reaction to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-early-meta-helicopter-infested-nightmare">community-uproar around the Deep Desert</a>, as a substantial chunk of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-changes-next-update">game's huge playerbase</a>. In response, Funcom ceded ground on its original vision, with creative director Joel Bylos stating: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-studio-is-adding-partial-warfare-endgame-zones-to-address-pve-player-woes">Our goal is not to force PvE players to interact with a PvP system [they] have no interest in</a>."</p>

<p>What this means for the dynamic of the Deep Desert is all of the highest tier resources will still be found in PvP-flagged areas, valuable goodies like titanium and stravidium, will still be risky to farm. However PvE players will now be able to venture out into the Deep Desert, farm large spice blows, and explore a selection of challenging bio labs and crashed ships without worrying about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-early-meta-helicopter-infested-nightmare">swarms of enemy ornithopters</a>.</p>
<p>The spirit of PvP still remains strong in the Deep Desert however, especially where the Landsraad is concerned. House control points, a way of winning the weekly Landsraad, are always PvP zones in the Public Test Client.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-worms-its-way-past-one-million-sales-funcoms-best-performing-game-to-date">Funcom's biggest release in its history</a>, has proven popular yet divisive in its later hours. The developers have also stated they intend to release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-new-maps-hagga-basin">more substantial PvE maps to give those ardent anti-PvPers something to do</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-deep-desert-pve-expansion]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Jack Black will be reprising his role as playable skater Officer Dick in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>. In addition, Black will also be playing Dick's English equivalent, Constable Richard, on the upcoming skater's release.</p>
<p>Officer Dick first popped up as a secret skater back in 1999, with the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a>. The character then appeared in the following two sequels, before he showed up again in the 2020 remake <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</a>, with Black providing vocals.</p>
<p>The Dick we already know is back once again, and will be a playable skater when Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 releases next month. "Richard Ennvee was mocked by other skaters and called a 'poser'. Overtaken by the need for revenge, Dick vowed to one day become what those skaters feared most - the long arm of the law," reads Dick's character bio. </p>

<p>"So we really loved Jack Black's inclusion in the previous iteration ['Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2']. He played a character called Officer Dick, and in the school maps, he was this school security guard who would yell at the skater and try and run them off the grounds," game director Kurt Tillmanns told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/jack-black-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-officer-dick-1236440201/">Variety</a>.</p>
<p>"We just thought that was a really fun, interesting character and kept in this tradition of the celebrity cameo in a Tony Hawk game. We wanted to carry that forward; we were really thankful we reached out to him and he was down to to come back, but we wanted to tell a little bit more of the Officer Dick story."</p>
<p>You can check out a trailer showing both Dick and Richard (who seems to share Black's penchant for kicking his leg up high) in skating action above. Yes, that is Black's English accent you can hear.</p>

            <p>"Square collapsed" after Hironobu Sakaguchi left the company, said Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, adding the "situation at Square was awful after he quit".</p>
<p>Final Fantasy series creator Sakaguchi joined Uematsu on the podcast Nobiyo To Isshoni earlier this month where they discussed their time together at Square working on the series in the 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>Sakaguchi resigned in 2001, before officially leaving Square in 2003 along with other key members of the company, ahead of its merger with rival Enix that same year.</p>

<p>"Square collapsed after Sakaguchi left," said Uematsu on the podcast (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/square-collapsed-after-he-left-final-fantasy-composer-on-how-hironobu-sakaguchis-innate-leadership-skills-held-the-company-together/">Automaton</a>). "To put it simply - he is the big boss. Always has been and always will be."</p>
<p>Uematsu described Square in its formative years as more like a club of university students than a serious company, but Sakaguchi was "able to manage the work even in that kind of environment".</p>
<p>He added: "We didn't even have a proper corporate organisation, yet everybody listened to him. It's a kind of quality you just have to be born with." Uematsu called Sakaguchi "a leader" - he may have been bossy and strict, but he was able to attract the people around him.</p>
<p>Uematsu continued: "Maybe Sakaguchi isn't aware of this, but the situation at Square was awful after he quit.</p>
<p>"He left and the organisation suddenly collapsed. I thought to myself 'Oh no, I should get away from here'."</p> <div>

<p>After directing the first five Final Fantasy games, Sakaguchi moved to a producer role for subsequent games in the series. His final game at Square was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-x-2">Final Fantasy X-2</a>, for which he was executive producer.</p>
<p>Famously, his final years at Square were spent creating the Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within CGI film, which was deemed a financial failure. In 2004 he established his independent studio Mistwalker, which has since released a number of excellent RPGs with a cult following.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-final-fantasy-creator-hironobu-sakaguchis-past-present-and-future-can-be-found-in-fantasian">Sakaguchi discussed with Eurogamer how his most recent game, Fantasian Neo Dimension, is fuelled by nostalgia</a> for his past work.</p>
<p>Though there have been successes in the Final Fantasy series since Sakaguchi's departure - namely MMORPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> - the series has struggled to match the 90s golden era Sakaguchi oversaw.</p>
<p>As for Uematsu, he left <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> in 2004, but has since frequently composed pieces for the Final Fantasy series. Last year, he confirmed he would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-composer-uematsu-returning-for-remake-trilogy-finale">returning for the third part of the Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy</a> with a main theme.</p>
<p>As such, he's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-final-fantasy-composer-nobuo-uematsu-isnt-retiring-from-video-game-music">not retiring from video game music</a> as some had feared, but admitted he is "going to cut back a bit" on video game music work because "the time commitment for composing would be too long".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/square-collapsed-after-final-fantasy-creator-hironobu-sakaguchi-left-says-composer-nobuo-uematsu]]></content:encoded>
