            <p>Players have hit out at The Alters developer 11 Bit Studios after AI prompts were discovered in both subtitles and flavour text in the game, intimating routine use of large language models (LLMs) without disclosure.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618">January 2024</a>, Valve has required games that use pre- or live-generated AI to divulge this as part of the Steam Distribution Agreement. This includes art, code, sound, and more that have been created with the help of AI tools. At the time of writing, The Alters has made no such disclosure.</p>

<p>In one <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vysetron.pixeldie.com/post/3lsc3n4zhfc2k">example</a>, an in-game screen that's presumably there to look all sci-fi-y and scientific begins with: "Sure, here's a revised version focusing purely on scientific and astronomical data".</p>
<p>Another commenter who'd played through with subtitles on Brazilian Portuguese <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/leaitepuc.bsky.social/post/3lsojo3f75c2c">noted</a> "several times the subtitles go crazy", which was later backed up with a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/windblow.org/post/3lsomub3i3k2g">screenshot</a> that evidenced it. The subtitle read: "Sure! The text translated to Brazilian Portuguese is: Every conversation two people can have, right? So we-"</p>

<p>"The game is using AI-generated content without a proper Steam Page disclaimer!" said another player on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1601570/discussions/0/604160267118483770/">Steam</a>. "This is absolutely unacceptable. 11 bit studios has been caught using AI in The Alters without ANY disclaimer on the Steam page.</p>
<p>"Steam requires developers to disclose AI use for a reason. We have the right to know what we're buying. If you're going to use AI to create content, be honest about it instead of trying to hide it."</p>
<p>Not all players have taken umbrage, however.</p>

</span></p><p>"You realise this is tiny text on a background prop, and only exists as a graphic and not as something you're expected to actually read," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1601570/discussions/0/604160267118483770/#c604160267118488209">someone</a> replied. "In the past things like that could have Ipsum etc stuff on it, or random gibberish. This isn't even slightly an issue.</p>
<p>"You may have a point regarding the translations, if those were indeed AI generated. But to use this screenshot as an example of AI generated content is a joke."</p>
<p>Game localisation specialist Lucile Danilov, however, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/luciledanilov_look-i-love-the-alters-its-brilliantly-activity-7344697496150941696-6DpR/">had a different take</a>.</p>
<p>"Look, I love The Alters. It's brilliantly written, and I was planning on leaving it a glowing Steam review once I was done. But this is a disgrace. Seriously, leaving parts of an AI prompt in the lockit?! Talk about spitting in the face of your international audience!</p>
<p>"According to the OP, some parts of the PT-BR translation are also riddled with errors and inaccuracies, which is appalling considering how the whole game revolves around an intricate narrative."</p>
<p>Danilov posited that the mistake was either the work of a "careless translator taking shortcuts", or it was "done by someone on the dev/publisher side who couldn't be arsed sending last-minute missing lines for translation and decided to throw them in a random LLM without oversight".</p>
<p>Handong Ryu, who handled the Korean translation for the game, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7344697496150941696?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7344697496150941696%2C7344781387704483840%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287344781387704483840%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7344697496150941696%29">replied</a>: "I was responsible for translating the vast majority of the Korean version of The Alters. Unfortunately, the same issue exists in the Korean version as well, which makes it more likely that the second scenario you mentioned is closer to the truth. While no AI prompt has been exposed, I can confirm that the same section of the Korean localisation shows clear signs of having been run through an LLM without proper editing.</p>
<p>"There has been significant backlash from the Korean gaming community, and it has been really disheartening to witness, especially since the criticism stems from a part of the game I had no control over."</p>
<p>At the time of writing, 11 Bit has not publicly addressed the allegations or responded to player comments. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jurassic-world-evolution-3-is-ditching-its-ai-generated-art-after-some-initial-feedback">Jurassic Park Evolution 3 removed generative AI for scientists' portraits</a> in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jurassic-world-evolution">Jurassic World Evolution</a> 3, "following some initial feedback".</p>
<p>"There's something startlingly unique about what 11 Bit Studios does in its games, and the moral quandaries it puts us in, and this clone story in The Alters is no exception," Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-alters-review">Eurogamer's The Alters review</a>, awarding it 4 out of 5 stars.</p>
<p>"It takes us to the strange places I hoped it would, and prods and probes and makes me think about what I value in life. It's uneven at times, and some ideas feel underdeveloped, but then, I remember, this merging of ideas is new, and that's what I like so much about it."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a>'s In the Jungle DLC has been delayed to 2026.</p>
<p>We saw our first peek of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-in-the-jungle-announced">In the Jungle at The Game Awards 2024</a>. Described as a new story DLC for the underwater exploration/sushi restaurant management game, the brief teaser confirmed at the time that In the Jungle will launch at some point in late 2025. Sadly, though, that timescale has slipped.</p>
<p>The update was part of a 10-minute video that covered DLC availability, pricing, and confirmed Dave the Diver is now available on the Epic Games Store worldwide. It also revealed a free upgrade for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a> owners was also on the way.</p>

<p>"The upcoming In the Jungle DLC takes place in a brand new region," explained director and head of Mintrocket Studio, Jaeho Hwang, "and we are working hard to make sure it brings fresh excitement to the game." Hwang then shared an all new peek, which you can see at 4m20s in the video above.</p>
<p>"The village here is where they'll be staying during their adventure. And this is a lake at the village. Here we are finally adding freshwater fish to capture and cook, just like many of you've been waiting for. We hope you guys are excited about it.</p>
<p>"One sad news, though. Although we announced it as late 2025, unfortunately, we might need to delay it a little bit to early 2026 to add more exciting content. There are still so many cool ideas that we don't want to miss floating around in the dev team. We'll share more soon and we'll keep you posted on the release date as soon as it's fixed."</p>
<p>Hwang also reflected on the pricing and limited-time exclusivity of the Ichiban's Holidays DLC.</p>
<p>"We know that recently we let some of you down," he admitted. "This kind of approach is sometimes requested when working with large IP holders to help protect the value of their IP. Still, we thought that it would be worth delivering cool new content, so we decided to release the DLC with a six-month time window. However, many players expressed disappointment with some riaising concerns about how it felt like 'FOMO' marketing.</p>
<p>"Although this was not our intention at all, we completely understand that perspective," Hwang added. "We want to apologise to everyone who felt let down."</p>
<p>Hwang said that after passing the feedback back to Sega, the IP holder, the team is now able to extend the DLC's availability. Now, the Ichiban's Holiday DLC will be available on all platforms until the end of not just 2025, but the end of 2026.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Godzilla DLC pack - which was free but only available last year - has also made a comeback. You can grab it right now across all platforms, and it'll stay "free and available" until the end of next year, too.</p>
<p>That's not all, though. Feedback also intimated to the team that the price "felt high for the amount of content provided".</p>
<p>"I admit that we were not thoughtful enough about the pricing," he said. "So we will be providing regular discounts to let you pick it up at a more reasonable price." Right now, at the time of writing, you can pick it up for 50 percent off.</p>
<p>Dave the Diver has previously seen DLC add-ons that add extra cosmetics, a free Dredge collaboration and... Godzilla. We previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-developer-confirms-story-dlc-in-the-works-and-talks-spin-offs-for-each-character">knew that bigger story DLC for Dave the Diver was coming</a> - but not what it was or when it would land.</p>
<p>"Wholesome, harmonious and completely unwilling to settle," is how our Christian Donlan described the game in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-a-dizzying-game-of-many-parts-and-a-journey-into-deep-wonder">Eurogamer's Dave the Diver review</a>, "this is one of the most generous games in years."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-delays-in-the-jungle-dlc-but-sure-knows-how-to-soften-the-blow-with-these-other-announcements]]></content:encoded>
