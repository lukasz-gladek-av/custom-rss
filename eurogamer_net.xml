            <p>Mouse: P.I. For Hire - the attractive black-and-white, vintage Disney-styled shooter - has been delayed. The game had been targeting a late 2025 release but will now arrive early in 2026.</p>
<p>Developer Fumi Games and publisher PlaySide announced the date-change in <a href="https://x.com/mousethegame/status/1980843296315568506">a shared statement on X</a>. A release date was apparently expected in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/galaxies-autumn-2025-showcase-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect">this week's Galaxies Gaming Showcase</a>, on Thursday, so the statement was issued to pre-empt any disappointment.</p>
<p>"Ahead of the reveal, we wanted to let you know that we have made the decision to move the launch of Mouse: P.I. For Hire from 2025 to early 2026," Fumi Games and PlaySide Studios wrote.</p>

<p>Mouse: P.I. For Hire is Polish studio Fumi Games' debut offering, but its art design has already helped it stand out in a couple of high profile showcases - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-june-2025-everything-announced">the 2025 Summer Game Fest Opening Showcase</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-microsofts-xbox-partner-preview-october-2024">the Xbox Partner Preview</a> which aired the other day.</p>
<p>Troy Baker stars as the cigar-munching Detective Peppers in Mouse: P.I. For Hire, and his trigger-happy antics are accompanied by a swinging orchestral score and bobbing, lively cartoon animation. It looks great.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-2">Mortal Kombat 2</a> - the upcoming action movie based on the famous gory video game series - will now be releasing a week earlier than planned. You'll be able to sit down (back) and check it out on the 8th May.</p>
<p>Its original theatrical release was set to be on the 15th. This window was largely uncontested, save for Comedy Poetic License and play adaptation Is God Is. However, by moving up a week, the film moves out of range of The Mandalorian and Grogu, which may very well eat up the nerdy movie crowd on the 22nd May onwards.</p>
<p>Now, in the fight for box office success, all Mortal Kombat 2 has to kontend with is leftovers from the 1st May weekend. That includes The Devil Wears Prada 2 and an animated children's movie called Animal Friends, starring Ryan Reynolds. Not exactly similar audiences, one would assume.</p>

<p>Back in August, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-movie-release-slips-to-2026">the Mortal Kombat 2 movie was pushed back to a 2026 release</a>, forcing fans to edit their kalenders from a jubilant movie moment on the 24th October. The film is being written by Jeremy Slater, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-movie-sequel-on-the-way-with-a-script-from-the-writer-of-moon-knight">the writer behind the critically acclaimed Moon Knight series</a>. The film stars <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-movie-reveals-best-look-yet-at-karl-urbans-johnny-cage">Karl Urban as Johnny Cage</a>, coming off a very successful role in The Boys as Billy Butcher. He was also Judge Dredd in the brilliant Dredd movie which more of you should have watched back in the day, I was too young at the time and wasn't allowed.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/save-your-gbp16-the-mortal-kombat-movie-is-boring">Former Eurogamer editor-in-chief Wesley Yin Poole found the Mortal Kombat movie (2021) boring</a>. He wrote: "There's just enough low-rent entertainment to prevent the Mortal Kombat movie from being a complete disaster, but it's tough to recommend when it costs £16 to rent online. A tenner straight to Blu-ray feels like a better fit."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> is a "good game" but it failed to match the Fallout and Elder Scrolls games because of its use of procedural generation and the fact "space is inherently boring".</p>
<p>That's according to former Starfield systems designer Bruce Nesmith, who discussed the game with <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/starfield-designer-says-sci-fi-rpg-still-a-great-game-but-procedural-generation-stopped-fallout-elder-scrolls/">FRVR</a>.</p>
<p>Starfield was Bethesda's first new series in over 25 years, following its work on Fallout and Elder Scrolls, but its critical and commercial reception was below expectations of the beloved studio.</p>

<p>"I think it's a good game," said Nesmith. "I don't think it's in the same calibre as the other two, you know, Fallout or Skyrim, or Elder Scrolls rather, but I think it's a good game. I worked on it, I'm proud of the work I did. I'm proud of the work that the people I knew did on it. I think they made a great game."</p>
<p>As such, Nesmith believes Starfield "would have been received differently" had it been released by a different company without the same expectations.</p>
<p>He "leans towards procedural generation" as the game's biggest problem, which was used to generate the various extraneous planets players can explore.</p>
<p>"I'm an enormous space fan, I'm an amateur astronomer, I'm up on all that stuff, a lot of the work I did on Starfield was on the astronomical data," said Nesmith, "but space is inherently boring. It's literally described as nothingness. So moving throughout that isn't where the excitement is, in my opinion.</p><p>"But when the planets start to feel very samey and you don't start to feel the excitement on the planets, that's to me where it falls apart," he continued. "I was also disappointed when, pretty much, the only serious enemy you fought were people… there's lots of cool alien creatures, but they're like the wolves in Skyrim. They're just there, they don't contribute, you don't have the variety of serious opponents that are story generators."</p>
<p>In the same podcast, as Eurogamer previously reported, Nesmith stated he's "eternally shocked" at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skyrims-lead-designer-eternally-shocked-at-games-popularity-but-its-open-world-is-like-nothing-else">continued popularity of Skyrim</a>, on which he was lead designer.</p>
<p>"I think Skyrim did the open world in a way that nobody had ever done before and very few people have really tried to do since," he said. "And one of those things that we accepted, which a lot of developers struggle to accept, is that this means you're going to have quirkiness. You're going to have weird stuff happen. And if you say that's okay, you can get this diamond."</p>
<p>Last month Bethesda marked the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-marks-two-year-anniversary-with-a-secret-message">two year anniversary of Starfield with a secret message</a> on social media, with fans speculating about further DLC.</p>
<p>Bethesda has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-teases-starfield-space-travel-update-after-datamined-leak">teased a forthcoming update to add an overhauled "cruise mode"</a> to space travel, following a datamined leak.</p>
<p>What's still expected is a release of Starfield on PS5, which could give it a new lease of life.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> studio Pocketpair won't be publishing games with AI, Web3, or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a> in them, because the company "doesn't believe in it".</p>
<p>After the success of Palworld, Pocketpair launched a publishing arm earlier this year. Communications director and publishing manager John Buckley spoke to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-don-t-believe-in-it-palworld-maker-pocketpair-wont-be-publishing-games-that-use-generative-ai">Game Developer</a> at Gamescom Asia about the use of controversial technology.</p>
<p>"People are going to say I'm lying, but these are just the hard facts," he said. "We don't believe in it. We're very upfront about it. If you're big on AI stuff or your game is Web3 or uses NFTs, there are lots of publishers out there [who'll talk to you], but we're not the right partner for that."</p>

<p>Pocketpair has been falsely accused of using AI in its games, particularly due to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-fans-hit-back-at-palworlds-lazy-pal-designs">perceived similarity between its Pal monsters and the pocket monsters of Pokémon</a>.</p>
<p>Buckley admitted it's hard to quash such rumours, despite the company's stance against the technology.</p>
<p>Recently, Pocketpair was accused on social media of using machine translation tools to localise Palworld for a handful of countries. Buckley said this was incorrect and based on an incomplete list of credits, but sometimes it's best to ignore social media noise.</p>
<p>"You know, I can't just come out and start fighting with these people [who make the AI accusations] because that just fuels what's going on," said Buckley.</p>
<p>"[Regarding the translation accusation], one of their biggest pieces of 'evidence' was that because we hadn't published the individual names of the translators it must be AI. Well, no, this is just poor Japanese culture in general. A lot of Japanese games, the credits will say localisation was handled by a company.</p>
<p>"I'm not saying [that it is] right. It's unfortunate. We don't like it as much as anybody else. But it's how a lot of these companies want to operate."</p>
<p>Following the accusations, Pocketpair acquired individual names from the localisation company used and updated the credits accordingly.</p>
<p>"A lot of the people in that thread said 'we appreciate you taking the time' but of course there are still some people in that thread who say 'it's not enough, it's AI'," said Buckley. "That's when I feel there's nothing more we can do here. I can say 'it's not, we made it' and they can say 'it is, you didn't make it' and what are we going to do? Just go back and forth forever."</p>
<p>AI is an ongoing hot topic in the industry - according to a report from Japan's Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association, organiser of the Tokyo Games Show, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI in development</a>.</p>
<p>Pocketpair published <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-newbon-and-ben-starr-lead-surgent-studios-new-live-action-psychological-horror-blurring-film-and-game-boundaries">Dead Take from Tales of Kenzer developer Surgent Studios</a>, which was released in the summer.</p>
<p>Now it's looking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pocketpair-to-fix-jank-in-hugely-successful-pokemon-alike-palworld-as-it-pushes-past-nintendos-controversial-lawsuit-towards-full-10-release-in-2026">fix "jank" in Palworld as it pushes towards a full 1.0 release</a> in 2026, in the wake of an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-says-pokemon-lawsuit-will-prompt-more-disappointing-changes-as-it-continues-to-dispute-claims">ongoing lawsuit with Nintendo</a>.</p>
