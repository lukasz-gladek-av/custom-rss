            <p>Some upcoming skins for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> which initially had edgy skull masks appear to have been drastically changed to look a bit more realistic, judging by community findings.</p>
<p>These skins, <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1x4zaBaEKK/?spm_id_from=333.1387.collection.video_card.click">which you can see in their original glory on Bilibili</a>, are a mix between standard military face paints donning stylised combat gear and straight up My Chemical Romance vibe skull masks over military headgear. Those latter skins drawing the ire of a portion of the Battlefield 6 playerbase, especially those who want the game to stay grounded.</p>
<p>"They're all garbage. I just want new playable content, new mechanics and equipment, more vehicle customization, and a customizable class ability system like in BF4," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r2slm0/comment/o4z2kj1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">wrote user Kejdurapa on the Battlefield Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>However, luckily for those with a similar taste to the pro-realism Battlefield crowd, additional screenshots released in the following days <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r6727r/most_of_upcoming_skins_have_changed/">appear to show these same skins toned down in edginess drastically</a>. This either indicates an overhauled version of these same skins, or perhaps an alternative version for those same skins.</p><p>As you can imagine, those previously aggravated Battlefield enjoyers are now very pleased indeed. "That's more like it, not the clown show that was in season 1," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r6727r/comment/o5o0ewb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">wrote Ali-S earlier today</a>. Their sentiment was shared by one eaeb4, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r6727r/comment/o5o1jg0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">who wrote</a>: "This is a big improvement across the board. Some people might like some of the skull mask designs but we don't need it on every other skin.</p>
<p>You may be thinking, who cares, right? A few skins look to have been changed in a live service shooter. Well, it's worth noting that Battlefield 6 was sold to players on the back of its realistic approach, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-live-action-trailer-is-its-biggest-jab-at-call-of-duty-yet-makes-a-point-out-of-blowing-up-zac-efron">making direct comparisons to its major competitor Call of Duty and its wackier approach to modern military warfare</a>.</p>
<p>This was true even in pre-release interviews. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield">Lead developers told Eurogamer the game would</a> "stray true to Battlefield" when asked about its approach to cosmetics, indicating a desire to keep things away from the wilder fantasies created elsewhere. These skull masks, as well as some prior DLC released in Battlefield 6, have strained such statements.</p>
<p>Whether things like these skull-faced cosmetics will be buried forever, or if a hint of the absurd will continue to creep into Battlefield 6, is a question for the future. What isn't a question is where the Eurogamer Battlefield 6 review is - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">it's right here</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> has slowly but steadily become one of 2026's open world games to watch out for, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/visually-impressive-open-world-fantasy-adventure-crimson-desert-goes-gold-locks-march-launch">with a March release date now locked</a>, lots of people are seriously starting to consider making a trip to Pywel soon. At the same time, veterans might have reservations about jumping in at launch based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-desert-online">Black Desert Online</a>'s MTX-heavy model.</p>
<p>Of course, large numbers of microtransactions and optional cosmetics are to be expected any time a game's model is free-to-play, and Pearl Abyss' PR and marketing director Will Powers reminded everyone of that during his appearance in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR9QMXJuGx4">episode 457 of the Dropped Frames</a> podcast (hat tip to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/that-is-the-transaction-crimson-desert-wont-have-microtransactions-says-pearl-abyss-because-the-promising-open-world-game-is-a-premium-experience/">GamesRadar</a>): "It's a monetization model: if you do free-to-play, then you need to make up the revenue in a different way." Easy to understand if you've been playing video games in the last 20 years or so, but we all know we often need to make things as clear as possible.</p>
<p>You can't blame veterans for thinking even a strictly single-player game like Crimson Desert (which did start off as an online project) could be filled with microtransactions à la Assassin's Creed though. After all, it'd be easy for Pearl Abyss to pull the trigger on those if the game is a massive success, as we know for a fact players typically like putting more money into the experiences they greatly enjoy.</p>
<p>Powers shot such thoughts and comments down quickly: "This is made to be a premium experience that you buy and enjoy the world, and not something for microtransactions." Here's where we underline such decisions are above his pay grade and anything could happen post-launch, but it seems that's where Pearl Abyss officially stands right now. If you're picking up Crimson Desert, you're getting a traditional, fully featured open-world adventure with no cosmetics or mounts earned via MTX. "This is a premium experience. That is the transaction. Like, full stop."</p><p>That said, <a href="https://crimsondesert.pearlabyss.com/en-US/Main">Crimson Desert has three different editions</a> (both digital and physical) up for pre-order at the time of writing, each of which with extra items and cosmetics, so you're definitely missing out on some stuff if you simply pick up the cheaper version. <a href="https://x.com/WillJPowers/status/2023218876105072790?s=20">Powers has acknowledged those</a> on X/Twitter though: "The overall point is that we're not holding back content to sell separately."</p>
<p>In any case, I doubt anyone was fearing Crimson Desert could be short on content, as every piece of footage from the game we've seen suggests <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4euv-AX4E">it's trying to do <em>almost </em>everything</a> the devs came up with during the concept and planning stage. Will it pay off? It won't be long before we find out, as the game launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and even Mac on 19th March.</p>
