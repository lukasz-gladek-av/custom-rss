<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s eagerly awaited Patch 8 is now live on PS5 - which has seemingly left developer Larian Studios a little perplexed, seeing as it definitely shouldn't be.
</p>
<p>
Patch 8, officially Baldur's Gate 3's final content update, isn't due to arrive until Larian has held its upcoming closed stress test. As such, Baldur's Gate 3 players on PlayStation 5 were more than a little surprised to see the game update to version 1.800.00 earlier today - and it turns out the studio was equally caught offguard by this turn of events.
</p>
<p>"No, the Patch 8 stress test hasn't yet begun," it confirmed in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/larianstudios.com/post/3lgqbpk3knc26">quietly exasperated post on Bluesky</a>. "Yes, PS5 players do currently have access to Patch 8. While we work with our partners to understand what's going on, please note that any new saves made while on Patch 8 will not be compatible with Patch 7... How's your Monday going?".

<p>
Patch 8 might be Baldur's Gate 3's final major content update, but it's still a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-is-getting-new-subclasses-cross-play-and-more-next-year">big one</a>, introducing 12 new sub-classes, cross-play, new camera features, and more. Given its scope, Larian previously explained it would be holding a pre-launch stress test in order to "help us catch things before they can become an issue once a patch has been released."
</p><p>
As such, Patch 8's premature launch on PlayStation 5 clearly isn't an ideal situation, saddling players with a version of the game that isn't yet ready for release, while putting the studio in a potentially tricky situation - seeing as reverting Baldur's Gate 3 to an earlier version could leave PS5 players with non-functional saves. We've asked Larian for comment.
</p>
<p>
Despite today's Patch 8 snafu, Baldur's Gate 3's stress test - which doesn't yet have a start date - is still on the horizon, and registrations <a href="https://larian.com/stress-test-register">remain open</a>. And for those players on other platforms who don't yet have access, there's always <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-gives-baldurs-gate-3s-withers-a-pair-of-big-naturals-to-celebrate-100m-mod-downloads">Withers "big naturals"</a> to keep them amused.
