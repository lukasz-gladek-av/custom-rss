<p>"Taking this additional time will allow us to add more polish, and make sure we give you the best possible experience, and one that lives up to our vision," Skydance Games wrote.</p>
<p>"We have some exciting things in store and look forward to sharing more soon."</p>
<p>The game was originally set for this year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-release-window-narrowed-down-by-black-panther-himself">Black Panther actor Khary Payton suggesting the studio was aiming for a Christmas release</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-jaw-dropping-look-at-amy-hennigs-new-captain-america-and-black-panther-game">story trailer for Marvel 1943</a> from March 2024 gave us a look at the game in action, as shown at the State of Unreal livestream. "Working with the MetaHuman process, we have been able to honour our amazing actors' performances and faithfully transform them into equally powerful digital performances," Hennig said at the time of the new technology.</p>
<p>Then fresh details emerged at the end of last year, alongside a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-details-and-first-look-at-wakanda-revealed-by-writer-amy-hennig">look at this game's version of Wakanda</a>.</p>
<p>"[The setting] led us to do a bunch of interesting things," said Hennig, "one of which was to not only tell a story with a young Steve Rogers who's still trying to find his feet, as opposed to the more seasoned guy that we've seen in a lot of the films. It also let us introduce a new Black Panther of 1943."</p>
<p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra follows in the foosteps of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, which was recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">delayed from this year into next</a>. So far, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-announced">Sony's Ghost of Yōtei</a> appears to be the biggest release at the end of the year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
A week after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair removed the ability for players to glide using Pals in response to Nintendo's ongoing lawsuit, a modder has restored the feature on PC. That's as Pocketpair confirms Palworld's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/terraria">Terraria</a> collaboration will launch this "summer".
</p>
<p>
Pocketpair <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-says-pokemon-lawsuit-will-prompt-more-disappointing-changes-as-it-continues-to-dispute-claims">confirmed it had removed Pal-based gliding from Palworld</a> earlier this month, saying it had been forced to make "yet another compromise" due to Nintendo's ongoing patent infringement claim. Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">launched legal action against the studio last September</a>, saying it was seeking "an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages on the grounds that Palworld... infringes multiple patent rights".
</p>
<p>
Several patents - which Nintendo and The Pokémon Company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/exceedingly-plausible-nintendo-crafted-patent-claims-to-specifically-target-palworld-says-ip-expert">seemingly filed onto pre-existing "parent" patents</a> <em>after</em> the release of Palworld - lie at the heart of the case, all relating to specific gameplay mechanics. These include the ability to capture digital creatures by throwing a catching item and the ability to subsequently ride on them.
</p>
<p>
First signs Pocketpair might be forced to capitulate to Nintendo arrived last December, when the developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">axed the ability to catch Pals by throwing Pokéball-style Pal Spheres</a> in a small update. Then, the ability to glide using Pals was removed earlier this month, with the studio saying the changes - which instead added gliders as a useable inventory item - were "necessary in order to prevent further disruptions" to development.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, one modder has moved to reinstate the gliding feature on PC. As spotted by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/palworld/palworld-mod-brings-back-gliding-feature-removed-by-nintendo-lawsuit-3194320/">Dexerto</a>, Primarinabee's Glider Restoration mod is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/palworld/mods/2454?tab=description">now available via Nexus Mods</a> and specifically designed "for those of you who love flying with your pals." Primarinabee says the mod "uses sleight of hand to reverse the sleight-of-hand 'removal' of gliding pals," but notes player will still  need a glider in their inventory to make it work. "It's not <em>quite</em> perfect," they add, "but it basically reverses Patch 0.5.5 without requiring you to forego future game updates".
</p>
<p>
Despite Nintendo's lawsuit, early access development of Palworld continues, and Pocketpair has now revealed its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-announces-major-update-terraria-crossover-despite-ongoing-legal-issues">previously announced Terraria collaboration</a> will launch for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC this "summer". Dubbed Tides of Terraria, it'll enable players to "catch, train, fight, and work" monsters from developer Re-Logic's hugely popular sandbox action-adventure "just like Pals". Pocketpair is also promising non-Terraria-themed additions in the update, including new Pals and new islands, with more to be shared "over the next few weeks".
