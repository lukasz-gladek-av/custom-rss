            <p>
The Rogue Prince of Persia will receive an enormous new update, Second Act, next week on 21st November, that looks like it'll function as something of a full relaunch. 
</p>
<p>
This roguelite take on Ubisoft's historical action series from some of the developers behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a> arrived in early access back in May this year to a warm reception.
</p>
<p>
Now, developer Evil Empire is adding the game's biggest update yet, which will revamp the game's visuals and double the game's size. You can take a look at the changes in the new Second Act trailer below:

<p>
Writing on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2717880/view/4508758658863071521">Steam</a>, Evil Empire describe the update as a "glow-up" for the game, with additional detail and tweaked colour palettes. Most notably, the Prince is no longer purple
</p>
<p>
"This change was made as the purple tone just didn't fit with the new direction," Evil Empire wrote. "We find that the art direction is now a much better fit with the game's genre, setting/story and the Prince of Persia series as a whole." Which is fair, as the Prince is not purple anywhere else.
</p>
<p>
Other content added in the Second Act update includes more biomes, bosses, a fresh story act and additional quality of life improvements such as multiple save slots.
</p>
<p>
"I think it works because the game has a charismatic star," Chris Donlan wrote of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-definitely-still-room-for-the-rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia upon its early access launch</a>. "Not charismatic in what he says, perhaps, but in what he does and how he moves. I just love to watch him run."

            <p>
The Anti-Defamation League has accused Valve of "allowing the proliferation of hate", after publishing a report finding over 1.8m instances of extremist or hateful content - including Nazi imagery and support for foreign terrorist organisations - on Steam.
</p>
<p>
The Anti-Defamation League - which describes itself as the "leading anti-hate organisation in the world" - shared its findings in a <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/report/steam-powered-hate-top-gaming-site-rife-extremism-antisemitism">report published on its website</a>, after conducting an "unprecedented, platform-wide" analysis of Steam. This is said to have spanned over 458m user profiles, 152m profile and group avatar images, plus more than 610m comments on user profiles and groups, with the ADL's Centre on Extremism saying it ultimately identified 1.83m unique pieces of extremist or hateful content.
</p>
<p>
Examples given include explicitly antisemitic symbols and copypasta, white supremacist copypasta, Nazi imagery - such as the swastika or Totenkopf - plus "tens of thousands of instances of users expressing support for foreign terrorist organisations like Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Hamas and others". The ADL also claimed to have found 184,622 keywords on Steam used in an extremist or hateful context - including "1488", "shekel", and "white power" - adding that 1.5m unique users and 73,824 groups had shared at least one example of potentially extremist or hateful content.
</p>
<p>
The organisation went onto claim Steam has no public-facing content policies specifically linked to hate or extremism. However, a quick search reveals Valve's <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding#5">developer</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/0/4337599680247610574/">community</a> guidelines do, in fact, explicitly prohibit hate speech, specifically "speech that promotes hatred, violence or discrimination against groups of people based on ethnicity, religion, gender, age, disability or sexual orientation".
</p><p>
That, then, raises questions around Valve's enforcement of its policies, as the ADL highlighted elsewhere in its report: "The fact that extremist and hateful content is relatively easy to locate on Steam, raises questions regarding the efficacy of Steam's moderation efforts." It noted, for instance, that while Valve deploys filters and other forms of automated content moderation on user summaries and comments, these do not apply to all user-generated fields - and filters can manually be disabled. Additionally, the ADL called Steam's keyword detection "easy to evade", noting altered words and ASCII art can be used to circumvent Valve's moderation tools.
</p>
<p>
"While Steam appears to be technically capable of moderating extremist and hateful content on its platform," the ADL continued, "the spread of extremist content on the platform is due in part to Valve's highly permissive approach to content policy. In rare notable cases, Steam has selectively removed extremist content, largely based around extremist groups publicised in reporting or in response to governmental pressure. However, this has been largely ad hoc, with Valve failing to systematically address the issue of extremism and hate on the platform."
</p>
<p>
"Valve needs to make significant changes to their approach to platform governance," the ADL concluded, "both in terms of policy and practice to address the ways in which hate and extremism have proliferated on the Steam platform." It finished by urging Valve to adopt policies prohibiting extremism and hate, to audit and "Red Team" content moderation practices to close loopholes, and to engage with civil society, academics, and researchers. More, including recommendations for policymakers, can be found in the <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/report/steam-powered-hate-top-gaming-site-rife-extremism-antisemitism">full report</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Major gaming companies are selling their wares on a platform that is not addressing users' support of extremists and allowing the proliferation of hate," Daniel Kelley, director of strategy and operations at ADL's Centre for Technology &amp; Society, added in an interview <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-14/white-supremacist-nazi-content-spread-on-steam-gaming-platform?srnd=undefined">shared by Bloomberg</a>. This, he continued, "increases the likelihood that someone will travel all the way down the rabbit hole." Eurogamer has asked Valve for comment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-update-teases-surprising-bonus-cameo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Hit PlayStation platformer Astro Bot looks set to add another game cameo to its ranks. 
</p>
<p>
Eagle-eyed Astro Bot fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gqsy21/a_new_thirdparty_character_credit_was_added_to/">reddit</a> have spotted a fresh tweak to the game's credits as of its latest patch, which now reference the inclusion of content from Tomba! Special Edition.
</p>
<p>
There's no sign of Tomba himself or the series' pig villains in Astro Bot yet, but its credits already point to the game getting further updates in the future with other extra characters.
</p>
<p>
This year's Tomba! Special Edition updated the 1997 classic PS1 platform adventure, originally published by PlayStation, for a fresh audience on PS5. It's been more than two decades since Tomba! 2 arrived to middling sales, but the franchise has continued to develop a cult following since.
</p><p>
Other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-credits-hint-at-unseen-cameos-potentially-in-forthcoming-free-dlc">mentions in Astro Bot credits already mention a range of franchises yet to appear </a>, including Ubisoft series such as Assassin's Creed, Rayman and Beyond Good &amp; Evil, plus <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/team17">Team17</a>'s Worms and Croc: Legend of the Gobbos - which, like Tomba, also got a remaster this year.
</p>
<p>Still other characters have been glipmsed in concept art, but haven't yet appeared in the game - including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fat-princess">Fat Princess</a>, and Sweet Tooth from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/twisted-metal">Twisted Metal</a>.</p>

</span></p><p>Astro Bot received a warm reception from critics and fans alike when the dinky platformer dropped on PS5 back in September. Since then, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-console-sales-top-65m-as-astro-bot-sells-15m-copies-in-first-month">more than 1.5m copies</a> have been sold.</p>
<p>
"Sony's glossy mascot gets an outing filled with imagination and loving craft," Chris Donlan wrote, awarding it top marks in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-review">Eurogamer's Astro Bot review</a>.
