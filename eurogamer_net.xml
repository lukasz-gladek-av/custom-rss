            <p>Microsoft is laying off three percent of its workforce across the business - potentially including its gaming division.</p>
<p>The news comes from a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-cutting-3percent-of-workers-across-the-software-company.html">CNBC</a> report, following Microsoft's latest financial report from the end of April where it announced an 18 percent year-on-year increase in net income - plus a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-hardware-revenue-continues-to-tumble-but-gaming-revenue-is-up-microsoft-reports">five percent increase in gaming revenue</a> specifically.</p>
<p>"We continue to implement organisational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace," a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC.</p>
<p>Back in June last year, Microsoft had 228,000 employees, meaning that a three percent drop would amount to approximately 6840 people - though of course employee numbers may have fluctuated, especially following other rounds of layoffs.</p>
<p>As such, this would be the largest round of cuts since the company laid off 10,000 employees in January 2023. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a>, The Coalition, and 343 Industries were all affected.</p>
<p>Since then, Microsoft has continued to lay off staff. In January 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">1900 people from across Microsoft's video game teams were laid off</a>, with a further <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">650 staff laid off in September</a>.</p>
<p>Already this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reportedly-makes-small-number-of-layoffs-across-divisions-including-gaming">Microsoft laid off a "small" number of employees back in January</a>. While these cuts were performance-based, this new round of cuts are not related to performance, the Microsoft spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Microsoft for further comment on whether Xbox Studios are impacted.</p>
<p>At the start of the month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">Microsoft confirmed it would be raising the price of its Xbox console across the world</a>, with some new games costing $80.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5s-best-selling-games-last-month-were-all-from-xbox">Microsoft-published games even dominated the download charts on rival console, Sony's PS5</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It's all go on the Illuminate front in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, with the co-op sci-fi shooter's powerful third faction having now set a course for Super Earth - and it's bringing "new terrors" along too.
</p>
<p>
All this arrives as part of Helldivers 2's latest update which - in lore terms at least - sees the squid-like Iluminate emerging from the Meridian singularity in order to bring the never-ending fight for Democracy to Super Earth itself.
</p>
<p>
In more specific terms, that means a wave of brand-new Illuminate enemies. There's the Stingray - jetfighters that unleash devastating strafing runs from above - and the Crescent Overseer, which "has the ability to lay barrages on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> in cover".

<p>
Worse still are the Fleshmob; failed Illuminate experiments assembled from Voteless parts and let loose on the battlefield. Developer Arrowhead is also teasing "even larger ships", but is leaving players to discover these on their own.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, Arrowhead has introduced a new load-out customisation  feature it says will work with "the bulk of" Helldivers 2's weapon offerings. "Most primary weapons now have levels that are achievable by completing missions," it <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/13/helldivers-2-illuminate-set-sights-on-super-earth-new-enemy-types-deployed/?sf277258176=1">explains on the PlayStation Blog</a>, "which then in turn unlock new attachments obtainable through Requisition."
</p>
<p>
Players can also unlock patterns and apply them to their weapons, and a variety of patterns tied to previous Warbonds - specifically Viper Commandos, Freedom's Flame, Chemical Agents, and Truth Enforcers Warbonds - will be made available on 15th May. That's the same day the new Masters of Ceremony Warbond arrives.
</p>
<p>
And finally for Helldivers 2's latest update, item rotation has been removed from the Superstore, meaning players can purchase any item they want anytime they want, no waiting required. It launches today on PS5 and PC.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has a distinctive French style from its Montpellier-based developer Sandfall Interactive, but originally it was very different.</p>
<p>Fans have uncovered a trailer from an early version of the game <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RecordThisForFree/comments/g5a6e8/game_ambitious_aa_game_project_looking_for_3/">posted on reddit</a> by director Guillaume Broche in a bid to find voice actors. The post, from five years ago, describes the project as an "ambitious AA game" and "3D modern take on the JRPG genre with western style characters". It had a planned release on PC and "possibly" PS4 and Xbox One.</p>
<p>The post includes a link to a draft trailer that's since been shared elsewhere. The game was originally called We Lost, and shows a steampunk town, fantastical boss battles, and even a sci-fi section.</p>

<p>It's likely much of the trailer is using placeholder assets, but it at least gives a glimpse into the development process. What's more, turn-based battles seem to have always been part of the project, as do the names of characters Lune and Maelle.</p>
<p>Further, lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen has detailed how the game's setting was completely different in its early phases.</p>
<p>"The gameplay would have been similar," she told <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-writer-reveals-game-almost-had-zombies/">The Gamer</a>, "but the story was completely different. It was set in a steampunk Victorian England with zombies, aliens, and various things."</p>
<p>A call with potential investors inspired Broche to "think bigger", Svedberg-Yen added, which prompted a complete re-think of the narrative. It was ultimately inspired by a painting Broche admired and a short story Svedberg-Yen was working on, which revolved around an artist entering her own canvases.</p>

</span></p><p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 certainly succeeds in part due to its French authenticity - from its fashion sense, to its jokey references to baguettes and mimes. Even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-calls-clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-shining-example-of-french-audacity">French President Macron has taken note</a>, calling the game a "shining example of French audacity".</p>
<p>"Outside the core plot, there's a wonderful silliness - and self-deprecation - to Clair Obscur that, together with its outstanding art direction and unique battle mechanics, ensure the game is distinct," I wrote in Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
