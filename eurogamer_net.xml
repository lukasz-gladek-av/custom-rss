            <p>SAG-AFTRA, the US actors' union, has signed an agreement with AI service Ethovox in a continued bid to safeguard performers.</p>
<p>The service offers a "fully-authenticated foundational AI model for voice" that provides the basis for digital replicas. With this new agreement, SAG-AFTRA aims to ensure performers are protected and will be compensated fairly for their work.</p>
<p>Video game performers from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">SAG-AFTRA union are currently on strike</a> following a dispute over the use of AI in game development. As the union's chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland explained, SAG-AFTRA aims to recognise AI companies to ensure protection for its performers.</p>

<p>"What will safeguard voice actors' livelihoods in the AI age is more contractual protection, not less," said Crabtree-Ireland. "That's why SAG-AFTRA will continue to recognize AI  companies, like Ethovox, that agree with our union's AI guidelines. Not everyone will want to work with an AI company, and that's understandable. But for those who intend to utilise the opportunities AI offers, it's important that agreements require companies to secure informed consent, and provide fair compensation. Without informed consent and fair compensation, this new era will become a 'Wild West' of AI misuse and exploitation."</p>
<p>Ethovox was co-founded by BAFTA award-winning actor Cissy Jones, known for her roles in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/firewatch">Firewatch</a> as well as voicing characters in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, and more.</p>
<p>"Ethovox is the only voice AI company owned and managed by voice actors, and we are pleased to be partnering with SAG-AFTRA on building a foundational voice AI model that prioritises the interests of voice actors," she said. "AI should be a choice. For that reason, we have reached out to the voice actor community throughout this process. Ethovox will continue to do so as we demonstrate that artists can, and should, be compensated for contributing to ethical AI development while also maintaining consent and control over their voice data."</p>
<p>Voice actors have overall been sceptical of AI usage. Last month, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> and Metal Gear Solid actor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-is-a-hammer-that-can-smash-your-skin-and-destroy-who-you-are-says-jennifer-hale-following-sag-aftra-strikes">Jennifer Hale described AI</a> as a hammer that can "smash your skin and destroy who you are".</p>

This is partly due to the restrictive nature of UK industrial relations legislation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/indiana-jones-great-circle-runs-at-60-fps-on-xbox-series-x-s-interview">Windows Central</a>, creative director Axel Torvenius touched on the game's technical performance.</p>
<p>"It might be that we will release even more details in terms of specifics, technical details, as we get closer to launch, once we see all the telemetry on performance," the developer began. "But what I can tell you is that the ambition is that the game runs at 60fps on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, and that, you know, it shouldn't be compromised in the visuals or the experience of the product."</p>

<p>Torvenius said the Indiana Jones and the Great Circle team want the experience to feel "cohesive" for players, meaning the game should run "smoothly at 60" across both Xbox Series X and Series S.</p>
<p>The Series S console has tripped up developers in the past. Earlier this year, the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> admitted that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-on-xbox-series-s-will-be-a-challenge-developer-says">getting the game ready for Microsoft's lower-powered Xbox Series S would be a "challenge"</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-out-now-on-xbox">Baldur's Gate 3 famously released several months later on Xbox</a> due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-dev-says-xbox-version-still-coming-but-compromises-may-have-to-be-made">difficulties with split screen co-op</a> on the Series S console.</p><p>Things are looking up for Series S owners, however. Recently, the Stalker 2 team said it hopes to <a href="https://www.vg247.com/stalker-2-xbox-series-s-pc">provide a performance mode at 60fps</a> at some point for its upcoming release on the Series S console. While it hasn't promised anything at this time, developer GSC said: "We think it's possible."</p>

<p>"I think it's going to be something truly special and I can't wait to play more of it.

            <p>A second crack at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> isn't something EA is looking into at the current time.</p>
<p>EA's CEO Andrew Wilson chatted to investors last night, during the company's quarterly earnings call. Here, Wilson was asked about the company's live-service efforts, and the next season of Respawn's shooter, Apex Legends.</p>
<p>The EA exec said the "level of innovation and creativity has to continue to scale with the community over time" in order to "maintain growth, and not just maintain size". He noted Apex is in "an incredibly good position" within the live-service market, with a "strong brand, a really strong mechanic, and a very committed global community".</p>

<p>EA understands a "need for meaningful systematic innovation that fundamentally changes the way the game plays", the exec continued, stating the development team is actively working on realising this. When further asked if EA and Respawn would consider an "Apex 2.0" or "a whole studs-up rebuild", Wilson said current trends show a second go at something typically doesn't perform as well as the original.</p><p>Said Wilson: "Typically, what we have seen in the context of live service-driven games at scale is, the 'version two' thing has almost never been as successful as the 'version one' thing. And so actually the objective right now is to ensure that we are continuing to support the global player base that we have, and deliver them new, innovative, creative content on a season-by-season basis, as well as build these other things, but build them in a way that players do not have to give up the progress that they've made or the investment that they've put into the existing ecosystem.</p>
<p>"Anytime we cause a global player community to have to choose between the investments they've made to date and future innovation and creativity, that's never a good place to put our community in."</p>
<p>Wilson said EA and Repsawn's objective is to "continue to innovate in the core experience [as shown in Apex Legend's seasons], and then build additional opportunities for engagement in different modalities of play beyond what the current core mechanic delivers". The exec said the team believed it "can do those two things together", and it doesn't "have to separate the experience in order to do so".</p>
<p>Wilson's comments bring to mind Blizzard's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> series. Despite huge popularity for the original, the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-the-moment-overwatch-1-died-forever">pulled Overwatch as it was out of service</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/so-far-overwatch-2-is-a-clever-but-underwhelming-free-to-play-compromise">replaced it with the free-to-play Overwatch 2</a>.</p>
<p>On its release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-apologises-still-working-on-overwatch-2-launch-woes">Overwatch 2 users were left unable to play for long periods</a>, stuck in queues, left without access to previously-unlocked characters and items, or locked out of the game entirely by the requirement to log-in using their mobile phones.</p><p>This year, things remain lukewarm for the rejigged shooter, and in February <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> announced plans to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-is-revitalising-the-overwatch-2-experience">make "major changes" to Overwatch 2</a> as part of a "revitalisation" of the shooter that hoped to "make PvP gameplay more rewarding and fun", as well as "provide greater transparency for players in-game". In May, the developer announced plans to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-pve-mode-dropped-after-just-three-months">remove the Hero Mastery Gauntles PvE mode from the game three months after it launched</a> as it hadn't "resonated with players".</p>

<p>The company also announced its life-sim game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-gained-15m-new-players-in-the-past-year-despite-being-over-a-decade-old">The Sims 4 has managed to gain over 15m new players this year alone</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ubisoft has released its first-ever blockchain game, the tactical <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFT</a> battler Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-first-ever-blockchain-game">company announced the game last June</a> after years of dabbling in blockchain, but has only now quietly launched it.</p>
<p>The game is on PC and free to start, though players can purchase figurines with which to battle using either in-game gold or cryptocurrency. These figurines are NFTs and can be bought on the <a href="https://championstactics.ubisoft.com/marketplace?sort=price_desc">game's marketplace</a> from anywhere between $7 to $64,000 (almost £50k).</p>

<p>It appears to be possible to play the game without purchasing figurines, though those willing to pay the extortionate prices will surely have more success in battles.</p>
<p>Battles themselves are turn-based affairs against other players with squads of three figurines.</p>
<p>Francois Bodson, studio director at Ubisoft Paris, told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-just-quietly-launched-a-full-blown-nft-game">IGN</a> the game "offers deep strategic gameplay featuring unique in-game assets and several exciting innovations", comparing it to a physical trading card game.</p>
<p>Here's the statement in full: "The team inside the Ubisoft Paris studio developing Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles partnered with Ubisoft’s Strategic Innovation Lab and Oasys to ensure that our use of blockchain was done in service of delivering new and innovative gaming experiences for our players. Our shared goal is to explore new ways to play alongside bringing more value to players based on empowerment and ownership. Champions Tactics offers deep strategic gameplay featuring unique in-game assets and several exciting innovations. These include millions of procedurally generated figurines, each with distinct stats, assets shaped directly by players' choices, and an open marketplace letting players compose their teams on a peer-to-peer basis - much like a physical trading card game. For months, we have collaborated closely with our community through events and beta phases to build and refine Champions Tactics. We’re excited to keep expanding and enhancing the experience together."</p>
<p>Ubisoft did not comment on the game's Adults Only rating, presumably for its blockchain basis and use of cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Back in December 2021, Ubisoft launched its own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-quartz-is-an-energy-efficient-nft-platform-for-aaa-games">NFT platform called Quartz</a>, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-ghost-recon">Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon</a> Breakpoint as the first game to offer a beta trial. It did not fare well, appearing to have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-appears-to-have-sold-a-grand-total-of-15-nfts">initially only sold 15 NFTs</a>.</p>
<p>Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-nft-bosses-say-players-just-dont-get-it">Ubisoft's NFT bosses stated in an interview afterwards</a> that players just "don't get it".</p>
<p>It's interesting, therefore, for Ubisoft to have still released this project, considering other developers have slowly backpedalled on their enthusiasm for cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>That includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-seemingly-backtracks-from-earlier-nft-enthusiasm">EA boss Andrew Wilson</a>, after describing NFTs as "an important part of… the future of our industry".</p>
<p>"I believe that collectability will continue to be an important part of our industry and the games and experiences that we offer our players," he later said during an earnings call in February 2022.</p>
<p>"Whether that's part of the NFT and the blockchain? Well, that remains to be seen. And I think the way we think about it, is we want to deliver the best possible player experience we can. And so we're going to - we will evaluate that over time. But right now, it's not something that we're driving audience."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
