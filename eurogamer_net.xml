            <p>Workers at ZeniMax Online Studios have voted to unionise.</p>
<p>The ZOS United-CWA union, as part of the Communications Workers of America, has been recognised by parent company, Microsoft, "signalling a significant victory for workers' rights in the industry".</p>

<p>The union said that together, workers will be able to collectively push for "real improvements to the workplace", including "job security amid record layoffs, protections against AI, better pay, and benefits".</p>
<p>461 members have joined, including web developers, designers, engineers, and graphic artists.</p>
<p>The decision to unionise comes after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hundreds-of-zenimax-workers-strike-over-microsoft-outsourcing-remote-work-policies">hundreds of staff at ZeniMax went on strike last month</a> in protest at parent company Microsoft outsourcing work without bargaining with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) union.</p>

</span></p><p>"I'm excited to finally see workers have a say in the workplace. Other employers have made a choice to undermine and attack workers who want to collectively improve their working conditions," said ZOS United-CWA member Billy Eichner.</p>
<p>"However, with a union at ZeniMax, we can build a community where we have each other's backs. We already work together to make great games. Why not work together to make a great workplace?"</p>
<p>"Today, I'm intensely proud of my coworkers at ZeniMax Online Studios who are joining thousands of video game workers exercising their power to bring more stability to the industry," added member John Hartzell. "Regardless of your studio, your title, or where you're from, unions work to benefit us all."</p>
<p>After months of industrial action, SAG-AFTRA - the US actors' union - recently signed an agreement with AI service Ethovox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/actors-union-sag-aftras-agreement-with-ai-service-aims-to-safeguard-performers">in a continued bid to safeguard performers</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>No, your ears were not deceiving you. That was definitely Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle popping up at the end of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">Witcher 4's reveal trailer last night</a>, and yes, the white-haired monster hunter will absolutely feature in some way in the upcoming game.</p>
<p>While many had assumed as much -  let's be honest, it is hard to miss the gravelling tones of Cockle's Geralt - developer CD Projekt has now officially confirmed what we all thought.</p>

<p>"Geralt will appear in the game," the Witcher 4 team told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/geralt-is-in-the-witcher-4-and-that-is-indeed-doug-cockles-voice-in-the-trailer-cd-projekt-confirms">IGN</a>. However, it refrained from giving much more away. "We don't want to spoil his role precisely," CD Projekt closed. "You'll have to wait to learn more for now."</p><p>Cockle actually let slip <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-voice-actor-confirms-he-will-be-part-of-the-witcher-4">Geralt was going to have some part in the upcoming Witcher game</a>, which will instead star Ciri in the lead role, back in August. However, the actor had since tried to backtrack on these comments a tad, admitting he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doug-cockle-got-slapped-by-cd-projekt-for-saying-geralt-is-in-the-witcher-4-but-not-as-the-main-character">"got slapped" by CD Projekt for what he said</a>.</p>
<p>"I don't actually know if that's true now because they came back and they went, 'We haven't put anything out there, don't say anything'," Cockle shared during a recent interview at MCM Comic Con Birmingham.</p>
<p>He went on to state: "The truth is I can't answer the question because I've signed an NDA. So even if I did know, I'd have to lie to you."</p>

<p>According to anonymous sources who didn't want to be identified for fear of reprisal, staff were called to a video conference meeting on Monday, where the cuts were announced. Impacted colleagues were then invited to a separate call during which they were asked to choose between job hunting support or being placed on a recall list as and when the studio would pick up more work. The studio did stress, however, that this was unlikely to happen before 2026.</p>
<p>Colleagues impacted by the cuts told the news site they felt "stressed and depressed", especially to those with "families who are affected by this announcement and who are preparing to celebrate Christmas".</p>
<p>The redundancies were announced on the same day it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deathstroke-kicks-off-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-final-announced-season">confirmed that the beleagued Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League would see no further new content beyond its fourth post-launch season</a>, which is now officially its last.</p>

The move accompanies the cancellation or downsizing of several projects, with the studio blaming "external market pressures".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc">blog post</a> discussing Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth's PC debut, Square Enix confirmed the team was "working hard to optimise the game for Steam Deck".
