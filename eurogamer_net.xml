            <p>Bungie's all-new IP, codenamed Gummy Bears, is a team-based competitive MOBA that has now been handed over to a brand-new PlayStation studio.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/exclusive-details-bungie-moba-smash-bros-gummybears/">The Game Post</a>, which said that about 40 Bungie developers are working with the new studio to expand the "vibrant and colourful" Super Smash Bros-esque game to "attract a younger audience" and diversify both its portfolio and audience. According to sources, it's been in development for around three years and is getting "overwhelmingly positive feedback".</p>

<p>There's more, too. The report hints that "multiple" anonymous sources claim Gummy Bears' players "won't have traditional health bars" but instead use a "percentage-based damage system where characters are knocked back further based on how much damage" they take or inflict.</p>
<p>We're told it'll be a "lo-fi and cosy" competitive PvP team-based game with the fundamentals of a MOBA and splashes of Smash Bros.</p>
<p>There'll be several modes and three class types, including Support, Attack, and Defense. Interestingly, players will also be able to "hang out with friends in-between matches and express <em>their</em> identities in the game".</p>
<p>We've reached out to PlayStation for comment about both the game itself and the mysterious new studio developing it - we'll let you know as/when it comes back to us.</p>
<p>Presumably it won't be adapted from the '80s Disney cartoon of the same name pictured above... but we'll see, I guess?!</p>
<p>As for Bungie itself? Almost exactly a year since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-reportedly-delays-destiny-2s-final-shape-expansion-and-marathon">it was reported</a> Bungie had delayed its sci-fi extraction shooter Marathon into 2025, the studio released a gameplay-free developer update saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-says-marathon-on-track-but-a-little-early-to-show-in-first-developer-update">the game is "on track", albeit a "little early to show"</a> - and that it'll "reveal a lot more" later this year.</p>
<p>The update marked the first promotional push from Bungie after it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">laid off 220 staff</a> - roughly 17 percent of its workforce - in July 2024.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Skyscraper-sized reptile king Godzilla will soon be unleashed on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s battle royale map, as a quick snippet of gameplay footage released today shows. 
</p>
<p>
We've known since December that Godzilla was set to take a starring role this season - a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-6-leaks-point-to-godzilla-crossover">smaller-sized version is also coming as a skin, as part of the current battle pass</a>. But this is the first time we've seen him actually stomping around the map in actual gameplay. 
</p>
<p>
It looks as if ol' Godzilla will be a giant roaming boss - similar to last year's climactic Doctor Doom fight, where all players banded together to take down the Marvel villain. Quite how it'll work here remains to be seen.

And in other Fortnite news, developer Epic Games has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-hatsune-miku-crossover-coming-leaks-suggest">now made its crossover with Hatsune Miku official</a>. The virtual popstar icon will front the next season of the game's musical Fortnite Festival mode.
</p>
<p>
The next Music Pass will include a Fortnite crossover version of Hatsune Miku, including a variant style themed to look like the game's Brite Bomber fan favourite skin, plus various themed virtual instruments and other accessories. A classic Hatsune Miku skin will also be available to buy separately.

As announced last week, the new Fortnite Festival season will additionally add local co-op play on PlayStation and Xbox, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-festival-is-getting-local-co-op-support-rekindling-memories-of-rock-band">recreating the feel of those classic Rock Band and Guitar Hero sessions</a> (albeit with fewer plastic add-ons).

            <p>Alarmo - Nintendo's bespoke alarm clock, which offers users the chance to wake up with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-alarmo-clock-costs-90-now-available-to-switch-online-subscribers">collection of noises from games like Mario and Zelda</a> - was set for a general public release this January. However, that is no longer happening.</p>
<p>In a post on social media, Nintendo revealed Alarmo will remain a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-just-unveiled-an-alarm-clock-that-plays-mario-coin-noises-when-you-roll-over">timed exclusive for those Nintendo Switch Online members</a> until "early" March.</p>
<p>"After that, it will be available to buy from selected retailers in certain countries," a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-europe">Nintendo of Europe</a> X post reads. "Thank you for your understanding."</p>

<p>The company did not elaborate on which certain countries it was referring to. At the time of writing, a similar post has <strong>not </strong>been published on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a>'s X feed.</p>
<p>Word of today's Alarmo delay follows news in December that the gizmo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-no-longer-publicly-launching-99-alarmo-clock-in-japan-this-january">would not be released publicly in Japan during the originally planned timeframe</a>. Writing last month, Nintendo blamed its "production and inventory situation" for this decision.</p>

<p>Alarmo retails for £90 here in the UK, but is it worth it?</p>
<p>"As it is, it feels like Alarmo has untapped potential and too high a price tag as a result. I understand the attraction of keeping things simple, and I can also understand a need to be cautious around what an internet-connected device tracks in people's bedrooms," our Tom wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-alarmo-review-marios-charm-cant-justify-alarm-clocks-90-price-tag">Eurogamer's Alarmo review</a>.</p><p>"But, for now, Alarmo costing £90 makes it hard to recommend. Its motion detector is fun, and I do love that Nintendo still has the capacity to surprise with something like this (especially as the world waits for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>). But for a company dedicated to making such compelling games, this is a device which forces you to come up with your own."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
