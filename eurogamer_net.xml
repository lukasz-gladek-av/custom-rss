            <p>The Outlast Trials Season 4, Project Diarchy, is now available, ushering in 2 new MK-Challenges, a reworked Rebirth system, new cosmetics, and an all-new Shopping Mall map in which new prime assets Otto and Arora Kress will terrorise you. Lovely.</p>
<p>Conjoined at birth, the Kress Twins "have a set of eyes both fore and aft". Able to spot a victim from any angle, you'll either have to stop them with a thrown vile of noxious poison, or "split them in two with their buzzsaw". Double lovely.</p>

<p>You can also expect a new trial - Kill the Politician - and the complementary MK Challenge, which sees you guarding them "door to door". There's also Sentence The Prosecuted in which you'll have to decipher the charges, pin them to the defendant, and "make sure that it sticks". Which probably means exactly what it says on the tin.</p>
<p>As for the Rebirth rework?</p>
<p>"After careful consideration, Easterman is reopening the Rebirth to all reagents who deserve it," Red Barrels writes. "Rebirth now offers two options: The original Rebirth for solo players. The new Rebirth, called Communal Rebirth, which is designed for teams."</p>
<p>Communal Rebirth drops the players in a random Trial with 3 unique variators - Mirror, Rebirth, and Classified. Rebirth now requires each member of a group to have 100 Rebirth Tokens. It is now possible to stack up to 1000 Rebirth Tokens, which is just as well, because Rebirth Token rewards for completing Trials have also been revisited, and you'll now get 5 Rebirth Tokens per Trial, and 3 Rebirth Tokens per MK-Challenge.</p>
<p>The original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outlast">Outlast</a> launched back in 2013, casting players as journalist Miles Upshur as he investigated the notorious Mount Massive Asylum. Its terrifying (and often quite grim) blend of first-person night-vision exploration and frantic chase thrills quickly attracted fans, leading to a story expansion the following year and a full-blown sequel in 2017.</p>
<p>This second outing - which saw players investigating a murder in the Arizona desert - ramped up the violence and strenuous pursuit sequences to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outlast-2-review">slightly less positive reception</a>, but it still did well enough that Red Barrels was able to launch a third game, co-operative multplayer survival horror <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outlast-trials">The Outlast Trials</a>, into early access in 2023.</p>
<p>"The Outlast Trials is excessive and frantically enjoyable - but can occasionally tip over into frustration more than fear," I wrote when I reviewed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outlast-trials-review-a-unique-obscene-spin-on-the-horror-staple">The Outlast Trials</a> back when it was released in early access, awarding it three out of five stars.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outlast-horror-series-is-getting-a-movie-adaptation">Lionsgate recently announced it's working on a film version of developer Red Barrels' survival horror series, Outlast</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outlast-trials-season-4-is-here-heres-whats-new]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Krafton said it "look[s] forward to defending itself in court" after Unknown Worlds' former leadership confirmed they would be suing the publisher after they were suddenly ousted and replaced earlier this month.</p>

<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> became the unexpected focus of industry drama last week when Krafton <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-leadership-replaced-by-krafton-despite-looming-early-access">announced it was 'replacing' three key members of Unknown Worlds' leadership team</a> - including studio founder and original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> director Charlie Cleveland - with Steve Papoutsis, CEO of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> studio Striking Distance. At the time, Krafton insisted it had "sought to keep the... co-founders and original creators of the Subnautica series involved in the game's development", despite their departure.</p>
<p>Fan pushback was swift, and the situation only grew murkier after Bloomberg reported Cleveland, as well as Unknown Worlds' chief executive officer Ted Gill and special projects director Max McGuire, had all been "pushed out" amid Krafton's sudden decision to shift Subnautica 2's early access launch from its announced "2025" window into 2026. It was also claimed the move - which Unknown Worlds' ousted leadership reportedly did not support - would mean the studio was unlikely to meet the revenue targets that would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-delayed-by-publisher-krafton-just-months-before-alleged-250m-payout-to-developers">unlock a promised $250m bonus for the development team</a>. Shortly thereafter, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-drama-escalates-ousted-developers-launch-legal-action-as-krafton-accuses-them-of-abandoning-project">Unknown Worlds' ousted leaders announced legal action against Krafton</a>.</p>
<p>"Krafton's decisions were made to ensure Subnautica 2 is the best possible game and lives up to fan expectations. Releasing the game prematurely with insufficient content, falling short of what fans expect in a sequel, would have both disappointed the players - who are at the heart of everything Krafton does - and damaged the reputations of both the Subnautica and Unknown Worlds brands," a Krafton spokesperson told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/krafton-responds-to-subnautica-founders-lawsuit-we-look-forward-to-defending-ourselves-in-court/">VGC</a>.</p>
<p>"While we are disappointed that Charlie, Max, and Ted have filed a lawsuit seeking a huge payout, we look forward to defending ourselves in court. In the meantime, Krafton remains focused on what matters: delivering the best possible game as quickly as possible to Subnautica’s fans."</p>
<p>All this comes after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-latest-subnautica-2-twist-krafton-confirms-this-leaked-internal-review-document-is-real">mysterious leak of an internal Krafton review document</a> last weekend, claiming Subnautica 2's planned early access release lacked "the freshness and volume expected of a sequel", and fell "short of meeting... high expectations". Almost immediately after, Krafton took the unusual step of announcing, unprompted, that the document was real, claiming that doing so would "minimise speculation and ensure accurate communication with players".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/kraftons-ready-to-take-on-subnauticas-creators-in-court]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ubisoft's own shareholders have directly challenged the publisher to respond to the huge swell of support behind Stop Killing Games – a consumer movement generated by Ubisoft's decision to take <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">The Crew offline last year</a>.</p>
<p>Stop Killing Games was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-aims-to-mount-political-and-legal-challenges-to-games-going-offline">launched last April by Accursed Farms YouTuber Ross Scott</a>, calling upon video game fans around the world to petition their local governments regarding the increasingly common occurrence of purchased games becoming unplayable due to publisher actions.</p>

<p>The games preservation movement was motivated by Ubisoft's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">shut down open-world racer The Crew's servers last March</a>, preventing access to both its multiplayer and single-player content due to its always-online nature. More controversy followed shortly after, when the publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown">began revoking customers' licenses to the game,</a> permanently removing it from their libraries and preventing hopes of resurrecting it through private servers.</p>
<p>"Regarding the petition, we operate in a market," Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said, as noted by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-ceo-ghost-recon-assassins-creed-shadows-valorant-annual-report">Game File</a> (paywalled) and spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/ubisoft-ceo-addresses-stop-killing-games-after-overseeing-the-deaths-of-the-crew-and-xdefiant-support-for-all-games-cannot-last-forever/">GamesRadar+</a>. "And, whenever we release a game, we provide a lot of support for that game. We also provide a lot of services to make sure that the game is accessible and remains playable 24/7."</p>
<p>Guillemot suggests the publisher already provides "information regarding the game and how long the game can be played", and pointed out it also adds an "online connection required" warning to the front of its boxed products as well as explain that the company can "cancel access to one or more specific online features upon a 30-day prior notice" in the fine print.</p>
<p>Guillemot also told shareholders it offered "a one-Euro fee proposed to all buyers of the game. For just one Euro they got to buy the next version." As Game File points out, this appears to be in reference to a sale last year that briefly sold <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-crew-2">The Crew 2</a> for $1/€1.</p>
<p>"This kind of issue is not specific to Ubisoft," Guillemot added. "All video game publishers are faced with that issue. You provide a service, but nothing is written in stone, and at some point, the service may be discontinued. Nothing is eternal. And we are doing our best to make sure that things go well for all players and buyers, because obviously, support for all games cannot last forever."</p>
<p>"The lifespan of a piece of software, whenever there's a service component, eventually services may be discontinued, because eventually the software may become obsolete over time," Guillemot concluded. "A lot of tools become obsolete 10 or 15 years down the line. They're no longer available. And that is why we release a new version. And so we have version two and then version three. But clearly this is a far-reaching issue, and we're working on it."</p>
<p>Gulliemot's response, however, feels a tad simplistic, as never-ending access to a game isn't what the Stop Killing Games movement is actually asking for.</p>
<p>"We are in favor of publishers ending support for a game whenever they choose," the FAQs <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/faq">explain</a>. "What we are asking for is that they implement an end-of-life plan to modify or patch the game so that it can run on customer systems with no further support from the company being necessary. We agree that it is unrealistic to expect companies to support games indefinitely and do not advocate for that in any way. Additionally, there are already real-world examples of publishers ending support for online-only games in a responsible way, such as: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gran-turismo-sport">Gran Turismo Sport</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/knockout-city">Knockout City</a>."</p>
<p>As Matt recently summarised for us, the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">consumer-driven initiative</a> is demanding games publishers leave their titles in a playable state once support is terminated, and it's already surpassed 1m signatures. Last week, EU industry body Video Games Europe - which represents the likes of Ubisoft, Take-Two, Warner Bros., Riot Games, Activision Blizzard, Microsoft, and Nintendo - weighed in, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-stop-killing-games-momentum-continues-top-eu-politician-offers-support-a-game-once-sold-belongs-to-the-customer">insisting the initiative's proposals would make games "prohibitively expensive to create".</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Stop Killing Games' <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074">official UK petition</a> has surpassed over 150K signatures, meaning it must now be considered for debate in parliament, despite the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/favourite-game-no-longer-playable-uk-government-says-it-wont-tighten-rules-to-punish-publishers-who-switch-off-servers">government's earlier response</a> that it had "no plans to amend UK consumer law on disabling video games".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-own-shareholders-demand-response-to-the-stop-killing-games-consumer-movement]]></content:encoded>
