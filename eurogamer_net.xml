            <p>Atari has shared a sneak peek at its upcoming "iconic" handheld console, Gamestation Go.</p>
<p>Whilst the company has given very little in terms of detail, it does reveal the handheld's final look with the accompanying text: "An icon, reimagined".</p>

<p>The teaser shows off the console's button layout, and it all looks very much what you'd expect from a handheld console released in 2025. But it also confirms the system will come with both a paddle and a Trak-Ball, plus a number keypad on the right-hand side.</p>

<p>That's it, though - we don't get a release date or anything else concrete, but with CES 2025 just around the corner commencing 7th January, hopefully we'll discover some of the finer details next week.</p>
<p>On the plus side, we also had a cheeky glimpse of My Arcade, which will hopefully include some Intellivision goodies after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atari-buys-intellivision-brand-ending-longest-running-console-war">Atari purchased the brand last year</a>, ending what Atari claims to be the "longest-running console war in history".</p>
<p>Atari's home consoles went head-to-head with Mattel's Intellivision in the late 1970s and 1980s, long before Nintendo and Sega competed in the 1990s. Intellivision even enlisted actor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYLly625cXE">George Plimpton for an infamous series of adverts</a> comparing the two consoles.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> studio Arrowhead has shared a number of former pitches, including a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-fox">Star Fox</a>-style game based within the Helldivers universe.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/pilestedt/status/1874226763913715938">In a New Year's post on X</a>, Arrowhead CCO and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> creative director, Johan Pilestedt, asked players to share their "expectations and desires for what the next Arrowhead game will be", hinting that he was "working on the high concept" to the studio's next release.</p>

<p>Responding to comments from the community, Pilestedt then opened up about a number of "high concept" pitches previously considered, including the Star Fox-esque game tentatively called "Eagles of Democracy".</p>
<p>"We made a prototype in unreal," Pilestedt <a href="https://x.com/Yurka_Shaman/status/1874267225554903448">added</a>. "It would basically try to capture Starfox. So arcade... but still simulated.</p>
<p>"The title was 'Eagles of Democracy'."</p>

<p>Pilestedt also shared that the team had previously worked on a concept for a top-down reimagining of the 1990 arcade game, Smash TV, too:</p>

<p>"Smash TV is a top-down reimagining of the classic arcade game of 1990," the pitch began which was reportedly written around 12 years ago. "The game pits up to four contestants in a violent game show set in the distant future of 1999. The game focuses on the source inspiration for Smash TV to create a game filled with brutal action, death traps, and gladiator-inspired game shows.</p>
<p>"The game plays homage to 80s action movies such as The Running Man, Total Recall, RoboCop, and Escape from New York, tying everything together with cheesy music, 'cool' visual effects and over-the-top storytelling."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developers-respond-to-criticism-of-killzone-2-crossover-cost">Arrowhead recently responded to criticism from players of the high cost of its Killzone 2 crossover</a>, eventually deciding to gift all players the planned second set of the collaboration items for free.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
