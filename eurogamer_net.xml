            <p>A voice actor from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> has been recast due to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA actors' union strike, causing others to come out in support.</p>
<p>John Patneaude was the voice of Kinich in the free-to-play adventure from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hoyoverse">HoYoVerse</a>, but in a statement shared on social media they revealed they have been recast due to the strike over AI protections.</p>
<p>"I've been withholding voice-over services during the SAG-AFTRA Interactive Strike because Hoyo/Cognosphere wouldn't offer AI protections in the form of a SAG Interim Agreement," they said. "They'd kept my character's dialogue silent for months, all the while I had made the difficult decision to continue not going in until an interim agreement was signed and this ultimately was why I was recast."</p>

<p>They continued: "Now obviously, a recast is not what I wanted. I'd hoped that any progress behind the scenes would be made and I could come back safely, or that if recast auditions went out my colleagues wouldn't read for them. Unfortunately, I was wrong."</p>
<p>Patneaude described Genshin Impact as a "comfort game during the early parts of the pandemic" and called the role a "dream".</p>
<p>"I would and can return if Hoyo invites me back and signs an interim," they concluded. "I stand by my choices regardless of the outcome. Also, the strike is still ongoing - please don't believe disinformation on the internet."</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal">actors' union stated the strike would continue due to "alarming loopholes" allowing for "AI abuse"</a>. Negotiators on behalf of the bargaining video game companies, meanwhile, stated "meaningful progress" had been made.</p>
<p>Following Patneaude's recasting, other voice actors from Genshin Impact have come out in support.</p>
<p>Paimon voice actor Corina Boettger has been particularly vocal, <a href="https://x.com/thebirdzulu/status/1904948378838167802">stating on social media</a>: "There is a HUGE difference when you take the role of an actor who is striking for AI protections. You are no castmate of mine."</p>
<p>Replying to a response asking what to do in Hoyo's shoes, Boettger said: "I would sign the SAG interim agreement so that all my actors can have AI protections and then they could come back right away to voice these characters with no gap."</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/khoidaooo/status/1904969482675884332">Albedo actor Khoi Dao</a> said: "Any video game can bring back their FULL voice cast IMMEDIATELY during the strike, once they agree to enforceable AI protections via a SAG interim agreement, and the game CAN still keep its non-union actors after doing so.</p>
<p>"This is not a union actor vs non-union actor conflict. The goal of the strike is to ensure that this craft isn't lost to AI. We've got a common goal, which is why so many NU actors are holding the line alongside their U cast mates, despite having no obligation to do so."</p>
<p>The news follows a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-zenless-zone-zero-actors-lose-jobs-over-ai-dispute-without-notice-finding-out-alongside-players">similar situation with HoYoVerse's other game, Zenless Zone Zero</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, both Emeri Chase and Nicholas Thurkettle were recast due to the ongoing strike, and only found out once the game's latest patch went live.</p>
<p>Recording studio Sound Cadence Studios responded to the news at the time, stating: "Every contract at our studio features explicit AI protections, regardless of union status. Much of our staff are actors themselves, and could not in good conscience offer other performers work we would not be willing to take."</p>
<p>It added: "We respect the decisions of all actors in navigating the ongoing strike, and fully support SAG-AFTRA in its AI negotiations."</p>
<p>HoYoVerse itself is yet to publicly comment. Eurogamer has contacted the company for a statement.</p>
<p>For more on why the strike remains ongoing, check out our<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why"> interview with Mass Effect's Jennifer Hale</a>, who described AI as "an existential issue for all of us".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Join us today to watch the Nintendo Direct, live at 2pm UK time (that's 7am PT, or 10am ET for those of you watching in America).</p>
<p>As a reminder, this Direct is focused solely on the original Nintendo Switch. So don't expect any <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> news - that's being saved for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-direct-time-where-to-watch">next week's Direct on 2nd April</a> instead.</p>
<p>What can we expect? Will those rumoured Zelda remakes make an appearance? Will we see <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> as a cross-gen game? Or, dare I say it, Silksong?</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> has today added its latest booster pack, Shining Revelry, and alongside it a new card only obtainable by purchasing with real money.</p>
<p>The new booster pack adds a further 72 cards to be collected, as well as a fresh set of Deck Missions and Themed Collections.</p>
<p>Yet in the store is a new bundle under the Premium section, which includes a unique promo Mewtwo EX card. The bundle costs £18.49.</p>

<p>The bundle also includes a Shiny Mewtwo coin, playmat, and card sleeve, as well as a Shiny Radiance frame and cover, plus a bunch of gold.</p>
<p>Still, this is the first time a card has been locked behind a bundle rather than being obtainable the usual way by opening booster packs.</p>

<p>For those looking to complete their deck, you'll need to cough up the £18.49 for the privilege - at least for now. Perhaps the promo card will be introduced elsewhere in the future.</p>
<p>Another bundle has also been added for the same price, though this does not include a unique card. Instead it has accessories designed around Sinnoh region champion Cynthia.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the update has altered the Wonder Pick animation - it's now much quicker, perhaps to stop players guessing their order.</p>
<p>Shining Revelry, as the name suggests, adds a number of shiny Pokémon to the digital card collecting game, including a black Charizard, golden Lucario, and pink squirrel Pachirisu.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-next-booster-pack-adds-shiny-pokemon">Ranked Matches will also join with this booster pack</a>, with the first in-game session beginning tomorrow, Friday 28th March.</p>
<p>Later this year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-overhauls-trading-following-player-backlash">trading feature will be overhauled following a backlash from players</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It's been exactly ten years since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars of Eternity</a> thundered out into the world, and developer Obsidian Entertainment is celebrating the occasion with a new patch and the announcement it'll be adding turn-based combat to the acclaimed old-school RPG.
</p>
<p>
"Coming later this year," the studio wrote in a <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134573-patch-138087535-is-live/">post on its forums</a>, "Watchers will be able to help us test a brand-new feature: turn-based combat. We're excited to explore this new way to experience encounters in Pillars of Eternity, and your feedback will help shape its future." Obsidian says more details on how to participate in the test will be shared "in the near future".
</p>
<p>
That does suggest it could be a while before Pillars of Eternity's turn-based combat mode is ready for its full release, meaning players will just have to make do with classic real-time with pause battling until then. But the wait will hopefully worth it - turn-based combat worked well enough when it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pillars-of-eternity-2-deadfire-getting-a-full-on-turn-based-mode-this-week">introduced to Pillars of Eternity 2 as part of a post-launch update back in 2019</a>, so it should be a welcome addition to the original Pillars of Eternity too.

<p>
In the more immediate term, Obsidian isn't letting today's 10-year anniversary go by without something tangible for fans. It's also released a brand-new Pillars of Eternity update - officially titled Patch 1.3.8.0.87535 - promising a "wide range of fixes and improvements across visuals, combat, quests, and more" that the studio says should make the experience "a little smoother". You'll find the full patch notes at the end of this story.
</p>
<p>
"It's an RPG with design firmly rooted in nostalgia, but one that absolutely doesn't rely on it to be enjoyable today," Eurogamer contributor Richard Cobbett <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pillars-of-eternity-review">said of Pillars of Eternity in his Recommended review</a> ten years ago. "Instead, it's both a great reminder of why those games worked so well, and a brand new adventure well worth the hours upon hours (upon hours upon hours) that it takes to pick away at its secrets and its world."
