            <p>Now <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-snap">Marvel Snap</a> is up and running again after its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-snap-gets-surprise-us-suspension-as-stateside-tiktok-ban-takes-effect">surprise downtime last weekend</a>, Second Dinner has outlined what US players can expect in their "welcome back packages and compensation".</p>
<p>In a lengthy statement posted to social media, the studio said it could not "thank [players] enough" for their patience and support.</p>

<p>By way of a thank you - and an apology for the unexpected downtime - Second Dinner said it realised "many of you missed out on time-based content, rewards, and missions" during the outage, acknowledging the disruption was "more than just an unfortunate blip", and now the game was back online, it was now ready to make it up to its stateside players.</p>
<p>In recognition that the downtime "impacting" everyone, not just those in the US, Second Dinner also revealed <em>all</em> players will get an "additional bonus" for their support, too.</p> <div>

            <p>
There was a brief moment back in 2021 when it seemed like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone might finally be done with his mega-popular farm-life sim - until, that is, update 1.6 was suddenly announced and rapidly took on a life of its own. And now Barone has admitted it's unlikely he'll ever 'definitively close the book' on its development, saying (probably not entirely seriously) he might still be adding things "50 years from now".
</p>
<p>
Stardew Valley was an immediate hit when it released back in 2016, selling over 400K copies in just two weeks. Nearly nine years later, that number has reached the 41m mark, and Barone, somewhat remarkably, has continued to expand the game - most recently in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-16-update-is-finally-here-with-some-impressively-lengthy-patch-notes">last year's 1.6 update</a>, which was originally supposed to be relatively modest in scope when it was announced in 2022, but grew increasingly ambitious as time went on.
</p>
<p>
That's despite Barone having seemingly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-doesnt-know-if-there-will-be-another-update-focused-on-next-game">drawn a line under Stardew Valley's development</a> a year earlier, when he confirmed he'd be focusing his attention on a new game - later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">revealed to be Haunted Chocolatier</a>. But while Barone has now resumed development of his second title following a pause for Stardew Valley's 1.6 update, he's admitted he doesn't think he'll ever necessarily be done with his farming game.
</p>

<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/24/g-s1-44510/the-legacy-and-future-of-the-farming-game-stardew-valley">NPR</a>, Barone revealed that even though he's now been working on Stardew Valley for more than 12 years, "I don't want to definitively say that the book is ever closed, because I think I will always have a desire to come back and maybe add a thing or two. You know, maybe even 50 years from now, I might add something." 
</p><p>
That doesn't mean Barone doesn't see a natural end point for the title, however. "I think a game can have too much content," he explained. "And I ultimately want Stardew Valley to be the best game it can be. So if I feel like it's starting to become kind of overwhelmed with content to the point where it's detrimental to the game's entertainment factor, I would stop."
</p>
<p>
And for the time being, at least, it does appear Barone has taken a step back from Stardew Valley following the rather lengthy two-year development of its 1.6 update. As he revealed in December last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-confirms-hes-back-working-on-next-project-haunted-chocolatier">work has now resumed on Haunted Chocolatier</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Even though Haunted Chocolatier has only been revealed publicly to a tiny degree," he said at the time, "in my own private world it's a special place, and I'm very attached to the characters, themes, and ideas." It does, however, sounds like its release is still some way off, with Baron explaining, "It's going to be a lot of work still, but it's okay, I'm addicted to the grind."
