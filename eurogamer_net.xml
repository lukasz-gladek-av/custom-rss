            <p>YouTube has denied Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm's appeal to monetise his channel for a further 60 days.</p>
<p>Addressing his audience in a livestream in a clip shared to X/Twitter, Beahm revealed YouTube had deferred his appeal "for another 60 days" after which he'd be eligible to re-apply.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Beahm cannot draw any revenue from subscriptions or advertisements on his channel, which has 4.5m subscribers.</p>

<p>"Actually Champs - unfortunately, they pushed it back another 60 days," Beahm said. "Believe it or not, they waited 'til the very last second last night to tell us, uh, 'we're going to, uh, extend, just for another 60 days, and then you'll be eligible to re-apply, and we'll review the application'.</p>
<p>"But you know what, though, Champs? Okay. Then let's just wait another 60 days."</p>
<p>He then said he had something "something much, much bigger" in the works - "one of the biggest opportunity to date" - but didn't elaborate (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/dr-disrespect-guy-beahm-twitch-youtube-streamer-appeal-request-video-monetisation-denied/">TheGamer</a>).</p> <div>

<p>Back in June, Beahm <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">admitted to conduct</a> that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate" with a minor back in June, after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>'s former account director of strategic partnerships, Cody Conners, <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676">claimed</a> an unnamed person had been banned from the streaming platform "because [he] got caught sexting a minor". Those allegations were later directly linked to Beahm.</p><p>Since that admission, Robert Bowling - who co-founded developer Midnight Society with Beahm - <a href="https://x.com/fourzerotwo/status/1805671144412049732">distanced himself</a> from the streamer, and many long-running partners have <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dr-disrespects-sponsors-and-partners-are-responding-to-twitch-ban-allegations-updated">terminated their agreements</a>. But now, after a period away from the spotlight, an agitated Beahm returned in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkaSTVagsgo">combative YouTube stream</a> in which he repeatedly accused Conners and "so-called journalists" of a "planned and coordinated attack". All this, Beahm admitted, came ahead of a 25th September "opportunity" to reapply for partnership on YouTube and re-monetise his channel… which we now know has been denied.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a> 1999 will release in December.</p>
<p>Whilst developer Digital Extremes' latest livestream stopped short of confirming a precise release date, at least we now know which of the two months left in 2024 will debut Warframe's highly anticipated throwback update.</p>

<p>"Our biggest update of the 20th century arrives this December when Warframe: 1999 launches on all platforms!" the studio said, before inviting players to "get your account ready" for launch day… whenever that may be.</p>
<p>For anyone struggling to wait that long, don't forget that a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.warframe.com%2Fget-ready">playable demo</a> is still available.</p>
<p>"Get a feel for Arthur's Weaponry and turbo-charged Atomicycle as you battle Scaldra through the streets of Hӧllvania," DE teases. "December just can't come soon enough…"</p>
<p>As our resident Warframe expert Matt summarised for us recently, we've known 1999 was likely to be an "odd 'un" ever since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframes-next-big-expansion-whispers-in-the-walls-gets-weird-with-necramechs-and-retro-earth-tech">tease at last year's TennoCon</a>.</p>
<p>As TennoCon 2024 revealed earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframes-1999-expansion-has-a-shopping-mall-romance-system-and-you-even-get-to-fight-a-boyband">it's really set in 1999 (New Year's Eve, to be exact)</a> and no, this isn't quite the Earth we know - but it's close enough, full of extremely familiar era-appropriate artefacts that feel gleefully incongruous within Warframe's wider world. And that starts with 1999's new hub area: an abandoned 90s shopping mall full of artificial palm trees, arcade machines, and screens belching out cheesy infomercials.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
