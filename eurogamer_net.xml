            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> has now sold a staggering 210m copies, publisher Take-Two announced this evening in its latest financial results. 
</p>
<p>
The new total means Rockstar's wildly-successful game has shifted another 5m copies over the last three months of 2024, up until 31st December. 
</p>
<p>
There's a fresh lifetime total for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, also. It now stands at 70m copies sold, up three million units on last quarter - which would be jaw-droppingly impressive in comparison to pretty much any other game out there, other than GTA 5.
</p>
<p>
New content is still being pumped out for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a>, such as December 2024's Agents of Sabotage update, and the multiplayer portion of Rockstar's aging game continues to be one of Take-Two's biggest earners. 
</p>
<p>
This year will see GTA 5 mark its 12th anniversary on sale (it originally launched in September 2013 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360). Red Dead Redemption 2, meanwhile, will turn seven in October.
</p>
<p>
It's around then that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">Take-Two has said GTA 6 will finally arrive</a> - during its launch window which has now been re-confirmed for sometime this autumn. 
</p>
<p>
"There's always a risk of slippage and I think as soon as you say words like absolutely, you jinx things," Take-Two boss <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">Strauss Zelnick told IGN</a> this evening, when asked about the likelihood of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> not making its current launch window. "We feel really good about it."
</p>
<p>
It's a busy year for Take-Two in general, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> 7 on 11th February, Mafia: The Old Country in the summer, GTA 6 in autumn and Borderlands 4 before the year's end.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> has had a bit of a bumpy start on PC, but with a couple of emergency hot fixes now under its belt, developer Insomniac, alongside porting partner Nixxes, has released its first major patch - targeting reports of crashing, among other things.
</p>
<p>
Marvel's Spider-Man 2 made its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-2-recommended-specs-and-pc-features-detailed">long-awaited PC debut</a> last Thursday, but reports from frustrated players soon surfaced, highlighting significant crashing issues, bugs, and poor optimisation. It didn't take long for the game to amass a "mixed" rating on Steam as complaints continued piling in, and Insomniac <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-2-steam-hotfix-hopes-to-address-pc-ports-stability-woes">responded quickly with a series of hot fixes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, the studio has released its first full patch for Spider-Man 2, primarily targeting "several crash fixes based on feedback from [players] and our crash reporting system." There's more beyond that, however, with update v1.205.0.0 also implementing a backup system for autosaves, fixing a number of visual bugs related to DLSS Ray Reconstruction and raytracing, and addressing a range of UI related bugs.

<p>
Menu toggles have also been introduced for Film Style Animation and Comic SFX, and there are interface improvements intended to simplify starting New Game+. 
</p>
<p>
Insomniac acknowledges not all reported issues have been addressed in its first patch, but says it's "committed to improving your experience and [will] continue to work on regular updates with more bug fixes, improvements and performance optimisations."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell had good things to say about Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on PlayStation 5, calling it "simple, familiar, and occasionally cluttered [but] still brilliant fun" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-review-1">his four star review</a>. Hopefully, Insomniac and Nixxes can resolve the PC version's current issues and give the game the port it deserves. For now, though, you'll find full patch notes below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Various crash fixes based on player feedback and data from our crash reporting system.</li>
<li>Improvements to crash reporting with screenshot support.</li>
<li>Film Style Animation and Comic SFX can now be toggled via Settings &gt; Game &gt; Camera.*</li>
<li>User interface improvements to simplify starting a New Game+</li>
<li>Implemented autosave backups. At key points in the story the game will create a backup of the autosave slot.</li>
<li>Added mouse scrolling to the manual load/save menu.</li>
<li>Various improvements and bug fixes to the user interface.</li>
<li>Reduced noise in character hair when using DLSS Ray Reconstruction.</li>
<li>Enemies webbed to surfaces no longer have a black background when using ray-traced shadows and ray-traced ambient occlusion.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug related to ray-traced reflections that could cause pixelation artefacts along water edges.</li>
<li>Settings for Subtitle Text Size, Closed Caption Text Size, Icon and Prompt Size and Audio Listening Mode are no longer synchronized between different devices.**</li>
</ul>
<p><em>*These options become available after obtaining the Across the Spider-Verse Suit. ** As a result of this change, these settings will be reset to their defaults after you install this update.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>' hugely anticipated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is still on track to launch this "fall" publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> has reiterated, despite persistent rumblings of a delay.
</p>
<p>
Take-Two recommitted to its release window as part of its <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/4d81f3f6-cf24-44fa-892b-8ace44767349">Q3 FY 2025 earnings report</a>, writing, "This calendar year is shaping up to be one of the strongest ever for [the company], as we plan to launch <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> 7 on 11th February, Mafia: The Old Country in the summer, Grand Theft Auto 6 in the Fall, and Borderlands 4."
</p>
<p>
Take-Two <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">announced an autumn 2025 release target</a> for GTA 6 last May, narrowing down what had previously only been a 2025 window at the time of the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-first-trailer-released-early">first trailer reveal</a>. However, rumours of a possible delay have continued to dog the game since then.

<p>
A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-release-may-slip-to-2026-as-development-has-reportedly-fallen-behind">report last March</a> suggested Rockstar had originally been targeting a "spring" 2025 release but that development had "fallen behind". An autumn launch was said to be more likely - just as 2K later announced - but it was claimed a 2026 release could happen as "fallback plan".
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-recommits-to-autumn-2025-launch-following-delay-rumour">later called the rumours unfounded</a>, and Take-Two has continued to stand by its autumn launch window, even if it still hasn't quite got as far as revealing the release date the entire games industry is waiting for.</p>
<p>
Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has acknowledged the mounting anticipation around GTA6 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">in an interview with IGN</a>. "I think the game is eagerly anticipated both internally and externally," he said. "We know that Rockstar seeks perfection. I never claim success before it occurs. I'm fond of saying arrogance is the enemy of continued success, so we're all running scared and looking over our shoulders and we know that the competition is not asleep. Our whole organisation is super excited."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
