            <p>
IGN Live will return this June for a second year, with plans for an even bigger physical event in Los Angeles during the summer's annual game announcement season.
</p>
<p>
Held once again at LA's Magic Box downtown event space, IGN Live (organised by Eurogamer's parent company, IGN Entertainment) will feature various hands-on oppurtunities, plus a stage with fresh reveals and trailers, interviews and celebrity panels.
</p>
<p>
Last year, IGN Live welcomed Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> to the stage, and featured over 100 gaming stations. The plans for this year's edition are even bigger, organisers have said.
</p>
<p>
For those across the pond, more details on dates and tickets, when announced, will be available at <a href="http://ign.com/live">IGN.com/live</a>. Alternatively, you'll be able to follow the biggest announcements live online.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/e3-is-officially-dead">E3 might be dead and buried</a>, but the beginning of June remains a time we're all glued to the internet to find out what's next from the games industry.
</p>
<p>
Expect the usual glut of publisher shows around the same time, including the regular conferences from Microsoft, Sony, Ubisoft and more - and hopefully more from Nintendo as it gets ready to launch <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>.

            <p>
More than 110 former Metro series developers have come together as a new studio, known as Reburn, and its first project - La Quimera - is sci-fi shooter set in Latin America that's being co-written by Drive director Nicolas Winding Refn.
</p>
<p>
The specifics of the announcement have lead to some confusion as talk of rebranding has gone around, but Reburn essentially appears to Metro developer sub-studio 4A Games Ukraine breaking away from 4A Games' Malta-based headquarters to do its own thing. As for the 4A Games that remains, it continues to work on a new IP and the next Metro project.
</p>
<p>
Reburn, though, consists of over 110 former Metro developers, including gameplay designers, artists, sound engineers, and programmers - all led by former 4A Games Ukraine CEO Dmytro Lymar. And its debut project is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/">sci-fi FPS La Quimera</a>, promising "familiar tense gunplay and intimate storytelling" in a futuristic Latin American megalopolis and lush jungle setting.

<p>
La Quimera sees players - either going it solo or co-operatively with up to two friends - stepping into the customisable exosuit of a down-on-their-luck PMC soldier battling against rival factions. There's talk of "unique and highly detailed environments, characters and weapons", as players experience a world and narrative written and created by Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive, Only God Forgives, The Neon Demon) and E.J.A. Warren.
</p>
<p>
You can get a taste of that in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u_qFKhoB8c&amp;t=57s">La Quimera's announcement trailer</a> above. But Reburn - which also has a presence in Cyprus alongside its Ukraine and remote teams - says it'll share more on the PC game, alongside additional "supporting visuals", in the coming months.
