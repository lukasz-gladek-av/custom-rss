            <p>
The games industry has been wracked by layoffs in the last few years, but over half of all layoffs have been in California, with North America overall the worst hit region.
</p>
<p>
That's according to Amir Satvat, who spoke to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/over-50-of-the-job-cuts-in-video">The Game Business</a> on the topic. Satvar was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-first-game-changers-recipient-responds-to-hateful-and-disturbing-comments-accusing-him-of-fraud">first recipient of the Game Changers award</a> at The Game Awards 2024 for his work assisting laid-off employees across the industry.
</p>
<p>
"Over 70 percent, and in some years 75 percent, of the layoffs have been in North America," said Satvat. "North America used to have 30 percent, 35 percent, 40 percent of the open roles, and that number is now down to 25 percent."
</p>
<p>
Globally, employment in the games industry has increased since before the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, though that depends on region. While Asia has seen an increase in jobs, North America has seen its workforce in AAA studios cut by 15 to 20 percent.
</p>
<p>
"And here's another stat," added Satvat, "over 50 percent of the cuts globally have been in California. California AAA is like the epicentre of the difficulty.
</p>
<p>
"There is opportunity, but it may be that if you want to stay in the industry, being open to going to some of these places like China, like Japan, not forever, but for some amount of time, that's going to become a larger part of the equation."
</p>
<p>
The most <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">high profile layoffs recently were from Microsoft back in June</a>, which included the cancellation of Perfect Dark from the California-based The Initiative, though developers were affected on both sides of the pond.
</p>
<p>
So far this year, an <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">estimated 4400 people</a> have been laid off globally in the games industry.

            <p>Many of us have a few things to say about the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a>'s controversial game key cards, which don't actually contain game data, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-dont-like-nintendos-controversial-game-key-cards-you-can-now-let-the-company-know-directly">instead trigger a download from the Nintendo eShop when they are popped into the device</a>. However, developer Rob Bantin, who is an audio architect on Ubisoft's game engine Snowdrop, has revealed why the studio opted for key cards when it came to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-lands-september-switch-2-release-date">Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cubusaddendum.bsky.social/post/3lxzukm3glk2e">reply to Digital Foundry's John Linneman</a> about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>' use of key cards and whether or not cost was a factor, Bantin explained that full-fat cards "simply didn't give the performance we needed at the quality target we were going for".</p>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Bantin noted the Snowdrop engine "relies heavily on disk streaming for its open world environments", adding they "don't recall the cost of the cards ever entering the discussion - probably because it was moot".</p>
<p>The developer said had Star Wars Outlaws been designed for Nintendo's Switch 2 console from the beginning, things may have been different. "As it was, we'd build a game around the SSDs of the initial target platforms, and then the Switch 2 came along a while later," Bantin said.</p>
<p>"In this case I think our leadership made the right call."</p>

<p>Many third party developers have also opted for key cards for their own Switch 2 release. One high profile outlier was CDPR, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-developer-comments-on-switch-2-key-cards-says-having-proper-cartridge-with-a-plug-and-play-experience-is-right-thing-to-do">released Cyberpunk 2077 as a physical game cartridge with the actual game on it</a>. Last month, it was revealed that out of all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s Switch 2 sales in June, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-three-quarters-of-cyberpunk-2077s-nintendo-switch-2-sales-were-physical">over 75 percent were physical</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a> co-founder Nigel Lowrie believes that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> could potentially be the first "AAAAA game".</p>
<p>Lowrie <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hollow-knight-silksong-is-this-years-gta-6-and-whether-a-juggernaut-stomping-on-your-release-date-really-matters">spoke with IGN</a> on the topic of video game delays in the wake of massive releases like GTA 6 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Yet even as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksongs-release-date-causes-delays-for-more-games-than-you-might-think">games shifted release due to Silksong</a>, Lowrie stated GTA 6 will be an industry-shaking event on a bigger scale.</p>
<p>"There are AAA games and then there's AAAA games and I'd argue that Grand Theft Auto is potentially the AAAAA game," stated Lowrie. "It's just bigger than anything else both in the scope and scale of the game and the kind of cultural impact that it has and the attention it demands."</p>

<p>Adam Lieb - CEO of video game marketing platform Gamesight - echoed similar sentiments in the piece, noting: "I would say that GTA for the last year and a half has been a part of almost every conversation around launch dates I have heard."</p><p>Lowrie is correct, of course. GTA 6 is positioned to be a truly monumental release, one that threatens to overshadow not just other games coming out in 2026 but prior releases throughout the history of the industry. The term AAAAA is apt to describe such a monster, though given <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-says-70-skull-and-bones-is-a-quadruple-a-live-service-game">gaming's official first quadruple A game</a> Skull &amp; Bones was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skull-and-bones-review">truly a game like no other</a>, GTA 6 has a big task ahead of it.</p>

<p>Barone's name was spotted in Silksong's credits, which you can access from the Extras part of the main menu.

<p>But! Neither Mereidos nor Barone will confirm who Barone voices in Silksong. Medeiros said Barone would rather not say so as not to spoil anything. Barone could potentially be any of the weird and wonderful characters you bump into along the way.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has already surpassed half a million concurrent players on Steam mere hours after its launch.
</p>
<p>
After years of hype, Team Cherry's bug-filled Metroidvania finally released yesterday. On Steam, Silksong was the most wishlisted game on the charts and that's now converted to a huge number of players.
</p>
<p>
At the time of writing, Silksong has an all-time peak of 535,213 players. That's already the eighteenth highest all-time peak of concurrent players ever, beaten only by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> in terms of games released this year.

<p>
And that player count will only increase over the weekend once more players download the game and get stuck in.
</p>
<p>
What's more, this is just Steam. Silksong is also available across both Switch consoles, PlayStation, and Xbox, as well as on Xbox Game Pass, so there are plenty more people playing the game across all platforms.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-causes-server-chaos-on-xbox-steam-and-nintendo-as-platforms-grind-to-a-halt">surge of players downloading Silksong immediately caused server chaos across almost every platform</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's clear Silksong is proving to be an exceedingly popular release - but does it live up to the hype? We'll have a full review in the near future.
