            <p>
The launch of Doom: The Dark Ages is just a few months away, according to a release date which has popped up online ahead of tomorrow's Xbox Developer Direct.
</p>
<p>
id Software's legendary series is set to return on 15th May, according to a now-pulled article published by French website Gamekult and hastily spotted by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-releasing-on-may-15-2025.1088169/">ResetEra</a>.
</p>
<p>
Doom: The Dark Ages will be one of the stars of this week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-announces-xbox-developer-direct">Xbox Developer Direct, which airs at 6pm UK time tomorrow</a>. Presumably this is where we'll see that date made official.

            <p>PlayStation Plus will lose a number of games next month, including some lengthy RPGs, so now is your last chance to play.</p>
<p>First up is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a>: Spacer's Choice Edition. Not to be confused with Outer Wilds, this is Obsidian's comedy space adventure that was optimised for PS5 in 2023. A sequel is still on the horizon.</p>
<p>Secondly, a bunch of the Tales Of games will be leaving the subscription service, including the most recent Tales of Arise.</p>

Perhaps that's to focus on the recently released Tales of Graces f Remastered.</p>
<p>Another Bandai Namco game is leaving too: anime Soulslike <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/scarlet-nexus">Scarlet Nexus</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s ill-fated online shooter Outriders and Gearbox's outlandish FPS Bulletstorm will also be leaving PS Plus.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> has announced another wave of price hikes across its various membership tiers - including a Premium subscription bump to $25 a month, among other things - but, for the time being at least, most European countries won't be affected by the charges.
</p>
<p>
The news comes as Netflix <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/FINAL-Q4-24-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">celebrates its biggest quarterly subscriber increase in history</a>, with 19m new customers having joined the streaming service in its most recent fourth quarter - something it attributes to a combination of live sports and original programming, including the second season of Squid Game, which has already amassed more than 165.7m views.
</p>
<p>
Amid all this, Netflix says it's expecting to generate higher than forecast revenue in 2025 - and that will, in part, be fuelled by a fresh round of price increases. These are specifically targeting the US, Canada, Portugal, and Argentina, coming into effect today.
</p>

<p>
"As we continue to invest in programming and deliver more value for our members," the streaming service wrote in its message to shareholders, "we will occasionally ask our members to pay a little more so that we can re-invest to further improve Netflix."
</p><p>
To that end, prices are rising across "most" plans. Netflix's ad-supported tier is increasing from $6.99 USD to $7.99 a month, while its standard ad-free subscription is getting a bump from $15.49 to $17.99 per month. And as for the streaming service's premium tier - currently the only way to watch its content in 4K - that'll rise from $22.99 to $24.99 a month.
</p>
<p>
For now, there's no word of price increases beyond the four currently announced countries, but - based on Netflix's previous behaviour - there's a fair chance it won't be too long before they come into effect across additional territories too.
