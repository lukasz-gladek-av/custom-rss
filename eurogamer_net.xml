            <p>Competitive ITV show Hell's Kitchen is now blowing up as an experience in Roblox, with a cartoony version of Gordon Ramsay at the fore.</p>
<p>Since its debut last month, ITV's first-ever Roblox experience has had over 20m visits from aspiring chefs, and boasts 450k daily active users happy to have the show's celebrity chef express disdain at their dishes.</p>
<p>As with Hell's Kitchen on telly, those who participate in the official Roblox experience will be popped onto either the Red or the Blue team. And, while I haven't seen word that Ramsay will call users an "Idiot Sandwich", his Roblox counterpart still shares his disappointment if food isn't up to snuff.</p>

<p>Towards the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-adding-further-parental-controls-as-its-belated-push-to-improve-child-safety-continues">Roblox announced further tools designed to improve the safety of its young audience</a>. These tools included the ability for parents to remotely manage their child's account, view their child's friends list and limit the amount of time made available to play.</p><p>This move followed frequent criticism that the platform was not doing enough to ensure the safety of its audience, which is predominantly children. In July of last year, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">Roblox itself had reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation in 2023</a>, and that more than two dozen people had been arrested for abusing minors following contact in-game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Origin, EA's universally-disliked PC storefront and launcher launched <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reveals-steam-rival-origin">back in 2011</a>, will finally shut down this year, on 17th April.
</p>
<p>
EA has, of course, long since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-ditching-origin-brand-with-new-ea-desktop-app-as-part-of-ongoing-rebranding-efforts">replaced Origin with the EA App</a>, which isn't much better. 
</p>
<p>
From mid-April, any PC users still using Origin will need to switch in order to continue accessing their library of games and gameplay data.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/ea/ea-app/update-operating-system-for-ea-app/">statement</a> on EA's support website, the publisher states that it is finally killing off Origin as "Microsoft has stopped supporting 32-bit software". 
</p>
<p>
"If you use Origin, you need to upgrade to the EA app, which requires a 64-bit version of Windows," EA notes.
</p>
<p>
If you have a relatively new PC with a 64-bit version of Windows, downloading the EA App now and ensuring your game saves are ported over is probably a good idea. 
</p>
<p>
Cloud saves should carry across automatically, though games without cloud support will need manual save migration. 
</p>
<p>
Don't have a 64-bit PC? Then it's bad news. "To run a 64-bit version of Windows, make sure your PC has a 64-bit-capable processor," EA helpfully states. "If your PC doesn’t have one, you'll need to use a newer computer to play your games on the EA app."
</p>
<p>
EA typically <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-ea-is-returning-to-steam">also now launches its PC games on Steam</a>, of course, including last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a>.

            <p>An MMO based on Sony's Horizon IP has reportedly been cancelled.</p>
<p>We first got wind of a Horizon MMO in 2022, when a report stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-mmo-reportedly-in-the-pipeline">project was in the works at Guild Wars' NCSoft</a>. At this time, a source familiar with both Sony and NCsoft said the two companies had "tentatively agreed to pursue a business partnership in which [NCsoft] will create new games using Sony's promising game IP".</p>
<p>A year later in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-report-of-horizon-mmo-ncsoft-and-sony-announce-strategic-partnership">Sony and NCsoft publicly announced a strategic partnership</a>, designed to "expand beyond console and broaden PlayStation's reach to a wider audience". While neither company referenced Horizon as part of the announcement, it was widely believed the series was a key part of the collaboration.</p>

And now, it appears the MMO has been cancelled before it was even officially announced.</p><p>A report by Korean publication <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025011314314667267">MTN</a> (via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-horizon-mmo-developed-by-ncsoft-has-reportedly-been-cancelled.1087482/">ResetEra</a>) states work on Project H and a number of other projects has ceased following a "feasibility review" at NCSoft. "Among them, 'H' and 'J' have already disappeared from the company's organisational chart," reads a translation of the report.</p>
<p>The Horizon MMO was reportedly set for a release on PC and mobile. Eurogamer has reached out to NCSoft and Sony with regards to today's report.</p>

            <p>
Nintendo has become the latest company to pull its advertising from a major Japanese broadcaster, after reports of a sex scandal involving the former frontman of a popular boyband and a female employee.
</p>
<p>
The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> maker is currently in the midst of an advertising campaign for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>, and had been subject to calls from fans to join a growing boycott of the high-profile Tokyo-based Fuji Television, <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUF214EX0R20C25A1000000/?n_cid=SNSTW001&amp;n_tw=1737435375">Nikkei</a> reports (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-suspends-commercials-on-major-japanese-tv-network-amidst-sex-scandal/">Automaton</a>).
</p>
<p>
Fuji TV has been accused of setting up a June 2023 meeting under false pretenses between an unnamed female employee and Masahiro Nakai, a prominent actor and former lead of boyband SMAP.

<p>
It is alleged that Fuji TV falsely told its employee that she would meet Nakai at a company dinner alongside other attendees. In reality, the female presenter found herself meeting Nakai alone, and she was sexually assaulted.
</p>
<p>
According to Japanese newspaper reports, Nakai subsequently paid the woman 90m yen (around £470k) in an out of court settlement, which became public knowledge last month. Nakai has since issued an acknowledgement of "shortcomings".
</p>
<p>
For its part, Fuji TV has denied it deliberately set up the meeting, and begun an internal investigation to address concerns of a culture where male celebrities were given access to its female employees.
</p>
<p>
The channel will now replace regular TV advertising with public service announcements from non-profit organisations.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-snap">Marvel Snap</a> is back online, following its unexpected ban in the US.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-snap-gets-surprise-us-suspension-as-stateside-tiktok-ban-takes-effect">digital collectible card game was banned in the US alongside TikTok</a>, due to its publisher Nuverse being owned by TikTok owner ByteDance.</p>
<p>At this time, developer Second Dinner said the ban was every bit as much a "surprise" to the Marvel Snap team as it was to players, too. It went on to state it would do everything it could to get the game back up and running as quickly as possible. Second Dinner has now achieved this, and Marvel Snap is back online in the US.</p>

</figure>
<p>The developer is now "working to bring more services in-house and partner with a new publisher" to ensure this kind of surprise ban does not happen again.</p>
<p>Calling this move the "start of a new era" for the card game, the Marvel Snap team acknowledged players may have "more questions than answers". However, it assured its followers on social media that it would keep them updated with more details on the matter "as soon as possible".</p>
<p>There are still some remaining issues following Marvel Snap's suspension. Replying to users on X, Second Dinner said it is still working on restoring the game's App Store availability, adding this "may take some time".</p>
<p>It additionally noted "in-app purchases remain unavailable but the team is working on it". In the meantime, it said web shop purchases are all in working order, so players can go there for now.</p>

<p>Our Donlan was especially taken with Marvel Snap on its debut, praising the game for giving him some welcome moments to pause and reflect.</p>
<p>"Whenever I lose a game - and I lose all the time - I get to spend a pleasant few moments working out what went wrong, picking over my deck, and swapping cards in and out. There's a reward for being bad at the game.

            <p>Former Rare artist Kevin Bayliss has responded to Donkey Kong's redesign seen in the Mario Kart segment of the Switch 2 announcement.</p>
<p>As fans quickly spotted, the gorilla has received a bit of a redesign for the next karting game. He now looks closer to his film design and the retro design by Shigehisa Nakaue, with a cuter looking face.</p>
<p>Bayliss, who redesigned Donkey Kong for the SNES game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a>, responded to a fan video spoofing the new look.</p>
