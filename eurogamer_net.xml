The Elder Scrolls, Fallout and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> developer Bethesda has wished veteran voice actor Wes Johnson a speedy recovery, after he was hospitalised last week in a serious condition.
</p>
<p>
Johnson has regularly voiced characters in Bethesda's games for more than 20 years, and appeared in every major project from the studio since 2002's The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind.
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media, Bethesda <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1884001161667346927">said</a> Johnson was "not only an incredibly talented and instrumental part of our games, but also one of our dearest friends".
</p>
<p>
Johnson is currently in intensive care after being found unresponsive in his hotel room last week. The actor had travelled to host an Alzheimer's charity event in Atlanta but failed to attend - at which point the alarm was raised. 
</p>
<p>
The actor's condition was made public via a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/unleash-the-fury-for-the-love-of-wes-johnson">GoFundMe</a> page which has currently raised $140k (£112k), and which it says will go to Johnson's family and help cover medical expenses. 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Wes is not only an incredibly talented and instrumental part of our games, but also one of our dearest friends.</p><p>We wish him well and hope for an easy recovery. <a href="https://t.co/80sWYCv1ji">https://t.co/80sWYCv1ji</a></p></div>— Bethesda Game Studios (@BethesdaStudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1884001161667346927?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
Johnson plays Sheogorath in The Elder Scrolls series, Fawkes in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> and Ron Hope in Starfield, among dozens of other parts.
</p>
<p>
Outside of video games, Johnson has also made appearances in TV series such as The Wire and Veep, and is the announcer for NHL team Washington Capitals.
</p>
<p>"The Washington Capitals express our heartfelt thoughts and send our best wishes to our beloved public address announcer, Wes Johnson," a statement from the team reads. "We kindly ask everyone to keep Wes in your thoughts and to respect the family's privacy as they navigate this challenging time and focus on Wes' wellbeing."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It looks like Level 5's forthcoming Fantasy Life RPG is headed to PlayStation as well as Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is set for release on Switch in April this year, following multiple delays.</p>
<p>The series has not been released on PlayStation before but, as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:f6jharuhwg5szxe22rfijybf/post/3lgq2tvakj22s">Gematsu</a> spotted, a PlayStation Store page was accidentally published last night and then taken down.</p>

<p>The store listing had both PS4 and PS5 as platforms, with a release date of 23rd April.</p>
<p>Its quick removal certainly seems to back up its legitimacy, though a PlayStation release has not been officially announced.</p>

It's unclear when a firm release date for either platform will be revealed.</p>
<p>The latest in the life sim series was first announced during a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-1">Nintendo Direct in February 2023</a>. No specific reason was given for its delay last year.</p>
<p>Players will take on multiple roles to rebuild their fantasy island, with a time travelling twist too - as the name suggests.</p>
<p>At the same Direct, Level 5 also announced its next Professor Layton game for the Switch, though this is currently set for a 2025 release without an exact date.</p>
<p>Could either of these games be also releasing on Nintendo's newly-revealed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> console?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</p>
<p>Attendees are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-hands-on-registration-now-open-in-europe-and-youll-get-up-to-four-hours-play-time">expected to get around four hours with Switch 2</a> - and presumably will be able to try the new Mario Kart.</p>

<p>Helldivers 2 released early last year, but as Pilestedt noted in a social media post, he's been "living it since early 2016", while development of the first game began in 2013.</p>
<p>"11 years of working 'around the clock' on the same IP has made me set aside family, friends and my lovely wife... and myself," he wrote.</p>

<p>Of course, support on Helldivers 2 will continue while he's away, considering it's proven such a success - it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-performed-well-ahead-of-expectations-and-topped-more-than-8m-sales">topped 8m sales in March</a> and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-is-now-playstations-biggest-steam-launch-ever">PlayStation's biggest ever launch on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Arrowhead did recently come under fire, however, for the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developers-respond-to-criticism-of-killzone-2-crossover-cost"> high cost of its Killzone 2 collaboration</a>, which the studio then gifted to players for free.</p>
<p>"When I'm back - I will start working on the next Arrowhead game," Pilestedt added. That will likely be a long way off, but it's exciting to consider what could be next for the studio.</p>

            <p>
Dauntless and Fae Farm developer Phoenix Labs has announced another round of layoffs - its fourth since May 2023 - this time affecting the "majority" of staff at the studio.
</p>
<p>
Phoenix Labs enjoyed early success with its first game, free-to-play Monster-Hunter-like Dauntless, and the studio released its second title, Fae Farm, in 2023. However, the developer has faced multiple rounds of layoffs since its acquisition by blockchain company Forte Labs in 2023, starting with job cuts impacting 9 percent of its workforce in May that year. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fae-farm-developer-phoenix-labs-lays-off-34-staff">further 34 layoffs followed seven months later</a>, with an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fae-farm-developer-phoenix-labs-lays-off-staff-and-cancels-projects-in-significant-restructure">additional 140 jobs being cut</a> last May. And, unfortunately for employees, layoffs have continued into 2025.
</p>
<p>"Today is another difficult day at Phoenix Labs," the developer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/phoenix-labs_activity-7289705935696969728-PaIL">wrote in a message posted to LinkedIn</a> on Monday. "We have made the tough decision to part ways with the majority of the studio as part of unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations."

<p>
We recognise and deeply appreciate the contributions of every individual impacted," it continued. "Their talent, dedication, and creativity have left an indelible mark on our company and our games... To our industry peers, we encourage you to reach out to these exceptional individuals - they are some of the best in the business."
</p>
<p>
As for Dauntless and Fae Farm, the studio says it'll share more on their fate "in the coming weeks", but notes its current focus is on "supporting those affected through this transition."
</p>
<p>
Phoenix Labs' announcement follows a devastating 2024 for the games industry - in which around 13000 employees are believed to have lost their jobs - and continues a January dogged by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reportedly-makes-small-number-of-layoffs-across-divisions-including-gaming">further layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-weeks-into-2025-three-studios-are-already-closing-down">studio closures</a>. Ubisoft, for instance, announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff">cutting 185 jobs</a> this week, while Jar of Sparks - the studio founded by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> head of design Jerry Hook - confirmed it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">laid off "all" its team</a> earlier this month. Last year, Chris Dring shared his thoughts with Eurogamer on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">why these layoffs are happening</a>.

In just eight days time, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> turns 25 - and EA is reportedly poised to re-release <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims">The Sims 1</a> &amp; 2 this week as part of the series' quarter-century celebrations. 
</p>
<p>
The Sims 1 &amp; 2 have, of course, long been unavailable in an official capacity, with the 25-year-old original never getting a digital release and its sequel's short-lived Ultimate Collection being yanked from Origin in 2018. That could be about to change, however. Kotaku, citing a "source familiar" with EA's plans, <a href="https://kotaku.com/sims-1-2-remaster-pc-buy-ea-maxis-steam-1851748658">reports</a> re-releases of The Sims 1 &amp; 2 will launch on PC later this week, with all their original expansions included. It's "unclear" if a console release is also coming.
</p>
<p>
Lending further credence to Kotaku's report are the handful of conspicuous teases EA has been sharing to coincide with the start of The Sims' Nostalgia Now week, which runs from 27th-31st January. The series' official website, for instance, now <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/the-sims">features</a> a character from the original The Sims surrounded by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-2">The Sims 2</a>'s radial menu.

<p>
Similarly, the publisher has <a href="https://x.com/TheSims/status/1879218365430182064">posted</a> a short animation - accompanied by the phrase "BRB" - on social media. It features The Sims' iconic spinning Plumbob - initially surrounded by The Sims 2's radial menu, then superimposed on coloured squares reminiscent of The Sims 1's box art. 
</p><p>
Interestingly, the video then transitions to a scene resembling <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-3">The Sims 3</a>'s loading screen. Kotaku's report doesn't mention the series' third outing, but fans were slightly stunned earlier this month when, with zero explanation or fanfare, it received its first (still mysterious) update in 15 years. If this means EA has been quietly tinkering under the hood to implement some much-needed stability and compatibility fixes, there'll be a lot of happy Sims players.
</p>
<p>
All of which is to say it could be an  exciting few days for The Sims fans, and that's before EA's big birthday blowout next week. Things kick off with a 25-hour livestream celebration of the series next Tuesday, 4th February, coinciding with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-marking-series-25th-anniversary-with-huge-free-update-adding-70-new-items">release a "huge" free 25th anniversary update for The Sims 4</a>, adding 70+ new items, a new limited-time event, and more.
