            <p>A new report from People Make Games has detailed disturbing allegations of abuse towards employees at Indonesian studio Brandoville, a company used for art and animation support in games such as Age of Empires 4 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.</p>
<p>In 2021, People Make Games <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm7KUE1Kwts">reported on crunch culture and the industry's reliance on outsourcing</a> to external developers in order to meet deadlines. Brandoville Studios was one such developer. Little has changed in the industry since that report, but Brandoville's closure a few months ago has lead its employees to now share further stories of their experiences at the studio.</p>
<p>At the centre of this report is Christa Sydney, who worked at the company from 2019 until 2024 and says she was subjected to mental and physical abuse by commissioner Kwan Cherry Lai, wife of Brandoville CEO Ken Lai, who ran day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>The full report can be watched in the below video, though please note it contains some incredibly harrowing content and footage.</p>

<p>Sydney describes how Cherry Lai took her under her wing following a dispute early in her career, but how this led to toxic abuse. Initially, Lai imposed a strict working schedule on employees and would purposefully divide employees through gossip and demeaning words, Sydney said.</p>
<p>Sydney was actually part of People Make Games' previous report, but says she was later forced by Lai to film a statement in support of Brandoville against her will. Other employees felt she was being brainwashed, it's reported.</p>
<p>Sydney now says she was then continuously abused by Lai, including during a work trip to the XDS '22 conference where Lai micromanaged her time and only allowed her to sleep for a few minutes over the course of four days leading up to the event. Further abuse included imposing daily Christian worship, forcing Sydney to write lines like a schoolchild, daily check-ins over WhatsApp of her outfits as part of "quality control", and humiliating her in front of colleagues.</p>
<p>Eventually Lai's abuse became physical, forcing Sydney to film herself slapping her face 100 times as punishment, or hitting her head against a door frame until she was concussed before forcing an apology.</p>
<p>Another employee, Caesarion Balthazar, had an arrangement with Lai where she would take part of his salary to assist with his spending habits. This led to her, in Balthazar's words, stealing an amount of money equivalent to a month's salary. Additionally, Balthazar says he was told he owed money for expensive training programmes he hadn't yet taken when he tried to leave the company.</p><p>A third employee, Syifana Afiati, also says she was abused by Lai during her time at Brandoville from 2019 to 2024. Afiati fell pregnant, but was repeatedly overworked by Lai. At one point during the pregnancy Afiati says she was taken to hospital due to an issue, but was still asked to come into the office and work - to which she declined. Afiati's son was born two months prematurely and sadly died four months later in intensive care, however Lai still expected her to work and provided no sympathy or support from the company.</p>
<p>In August 2024, Brandoville Studios went into liquidation, though Cherry and Ken Lai convinced a handful of employees to stay and begin a new company: LaiLai Studios. Sydney was one such employee, but says she was subsequently subjected to direct physical violence from Cherry Lai on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>Sydney eventually escaped and compiled evidence against Lai. Media reports in Indonesia went viral, which finally lead to police investigations. This was required due to the local phrase "no viral, no justice", stemming from mistrust in the police and justice system.</p>
<p>In response to the allegations, Cherry Lai issued a statement to People Make Games, bizarrely stating: "To me my part of the story is not important, as long as my team are good and safe now." However, further discussion was declined.</p><p>Other employees claimed Ken Lai was Cherry's "biggest enabler" and should've done more to stop this abuse. Sydney and others however say they believe Ken is yet another victim of Cherry's abuse and his silence comes from a place of fear.</p>
<p>The report concludes by noting how the treatment of outsourced workers goes largely unnoticed and unremarked upon by the video games industry due to its discomfort discussing outsourced work, despite it being a crucial part of game development. Eurogamer has contacted Microsoft and Ubisoft for comment on their connections to Brandoville.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> developer Rocksteady has quietly suffered another round of layoffs, this time just before the end of 2024.
</p>
<p>
Half a dozen staff impacted by the redundancies have spoken to Eurogamer to confirm the job losses, under condition of anonymity to protect their careers. 
</p>
<p>
Roles impacted include members of Rocksteady's programming and artist teams, as well as more QA staff. 
</p>
<p>
The job losses follow an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms">earlier round of redundancies at Rocksteady that Eurogamer first reported back in September</a>, when the company's QA team was nearly halved in size from 33 to 15 people. One staff member made redundant at the time said they had discovered they'd lost their job in the middle of their paternity leave.

<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Warner Bros. for comment on this latest round of layoffs, but has so far not received a response. The publisher previously did not publicly acknowledge September's layoffs, either.
</p>
<p>
2024 was a difficult year for Rocksteady, as the company continued to support Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League with the remainder of its post-launch content schedule despite low player numbers.
</p>
<p>
Warner Bros. previously said it had lost around $200m (£160m) on the game. Currently, it's unclear what Rocksteady will work on next.
</p>
<p>
In early December, the developer acknowledged <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deathstroke-kicks-off-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-final-announced-season">it would not continue updating Suicide Squad with any new content in 2025</a>, though servers will remain online for the forseeable future.
</p>
<p>
The commercial failure of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has seen staff lose jobs on the other side of the pond, also. December also saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gotham-knights-developer-warner-bros-games-montreal-slashes-99-jobs">job losses at Batman: Arkham Origins and Gotham Knights studio Warner Bros. Games Montreal,</a> where 99 jobs were reportedly eliminated. The majority of these positions are believed to have been supporting Rocksteady with additional content for Suicide Squad.

            <p>Horses - the cursed horror game from Saturnalia developer Santa Ragione and directed by Andrea Lucco Borlera - is still coming, it is just taking a little longer to get out of the gates than first anticipated.</p>
<p>Horses sees players take on the role of a summer worker at a farm. This sounds safe enough, and after all, it's only for two weeks - but there is something much darker and downright unsettling lying beneath the surface.</p>
<p>"Will you survive the summer, or will the farm claim yet another victim? In any case, we're sure your summer working experience will be truly unforgettable..." reads the official blurb.</p>

<p>Horses was initially announced back in 2023, with a suitably unsettling trailer which showed off the game's silent movie-like style and a host of naked humans with horse masks on their heads. At this time, it was slated for a release in 2024 which, obviously, has been missed.</p>
<p>Thankfully though, Horses has not been silently cancelled. Santa Ragione has confirmed to Eurogamer the upcoming game will now be released this year, and a demo is also on the cards.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately we had to delay the game to 2025," studio director Pietro Righi Riva told me. "[We're] not ready to talk about the reasons for the delay yet, but will absolutely keep you posted. By end of Q2 2025 we'll have a date for both the demo and the full release of the game."</p>
<p>So, stay tuned for more information on Horses soon.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-indie-preview-special-edition">Chris had a go with Horses last year</a>, calling it "magnetically sinister" following time with the game.</p>
<p>"It's a simpler thing in practise than some of Santa Ragione's previous games - effectively you are waking up and slowly carrying out simple, if escalating strange tasks each day, like watering plants, feeding the dog, or, erm, burying bodies, as a story takes shape around you - but the magic here is in the atmosphere and tone," he wrote.</p>
<p>"It's also a rare attempt at using actual, suspended meaning in a game. You'll need to bring something of your own to the farmhouse table here, and meet this thing halfway."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
