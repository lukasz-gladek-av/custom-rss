As part of its latest <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/presentations/?presentationtype=webcasts">financial earnings report</a>, developer CD Projekt has shared progress updates on its numerous Witcher and Cyberpunk projects, as well as confirmed a partnership with Saudi-back mobile developer (and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-will-be-sold-to-monopoly-go-maker-scopely-niantic-confirms">new Pok√©mon Go owner</a>) Scopely to create a game.
</p>
<p>
As far as the Scopely project goes, there's not much to report at present. CD Projekt merely confirmed it had "entered into a strategic partnership with Scopely to develop a game set within one of CD Projekt's IPs." And while it seems reasonable to assume that's pointing toward some sort of mobile game set in either The Witcher or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> universes, we won't know for sure until more is revealed.
</p>
<p>
Away from Scopely, CD Projekt also spent some time offering progress updates on the various titles it's previously confirmed to be in development. Work on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> continues apace, for instance, but CD Projekt's other Witcher games have seen some adjustments. Witcher spin-off Project Sirius - which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-spin-off-project-sirius-sounds-like-its-being-rebooted-from-scratch">rebooted several years back</a> - remains in pre-production, and CD Projekt says it's now merged developer The Molasses Flood with the CD Projekt Red team to "ensure even better alignment in the scope and direction of the project".

<p>
Additionally, CD Projekt's Witcher 1 remake, which was announced back in October 2022 as part of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-red-announces-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-future-witcher-projects-outlined">studio's ambitious development roadmap</a>, is still in the concept phase. Furthermore, the studio says that due to "production process dependencies" related to assets and technology, it has decided to "temporarily integrate its development with ongoing work on The Witcher 4". As a result, a "small portion" of developer Fool's Theory is currently supporting the Witcher 4 team, with the aim being to "have the necessary assets, tools, and pipelines ready for more efficient development of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-remake">The Witcher Remake</a>."
</p>
<p>
Moving on from The Witcher, CD Projekt's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiplayer-being-considered-for-cyperpunk-2077-sequel-says-cd-projekt">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a> - currently known as Project Orion - is said to be nearing the end of its concept phase and will be entering pre-production "in the coming weeks". Additionally, development of the studio's new IP, known only as Project Hadar at present, continues. "The vision of Hadar has progressed over the last year, becoming more detailed," CD Projekt explained. "Internal assumptions and ideas have been forged into main pillars that guide us forward [and] the team's focus is on further developing the IP and the game's story, while prototyping some gameplay solutions specific to Hadar."
</p>
<p>
CD Projekt also reiterated it has a number of other undisclosed projects in the works, including another from Fool's Theory, and once again drew attention to its still-mysterious new Netflix Cyberpunk 2077 animation, which is currently "under development".
</p>
<p>
The Witcher 4 did, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">see its long-awaited reveal at the end of last year</a>, with CD Projekt finally confirming Ciri would be the focus this time around - although Geralt of Rivia (once again voiced by Doug Cockle) will also return in some capacity.
