            <p>Gabriel Luna - who plays Joel's brother Tommy in the TV adaptation of The Last of Us - has spoken more about the second season's latest episode, specifically a key change made to Joel's story.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of spoilers for The Last of Us, both the game and the show, below. </strong></p>

<p>The most recent episode of The Last of Us takes place in the frozen and snow-covered wilderness of Jackson County, Wyoming. During the course of the episode, the residential settlement of Jackson is assaulted by a horde of infected, while Joel and Dina - played in the show by Pedro Pascal and Isebela Merced respectively - are on patrol in the surrounding area.</p>
<p>This is a change from The Last of Us Part 2 game, where Joel is on patrol with his brother Tommy, while Dina is on patrol with Ellie. Additionally, the show gives Tommy his own standalone hero moment not seen in the game, as he remains in Jackson and has a rather tense confrontation with a Bloater (among many, <em>many</em> other infected).</p>
<p>While all this is happening in the show, Dina and Joel come across Kaitlyn Dever's Abby, who convinces them to come back to the chalet she and her group are holding up in rather than heading back to Jackson.</p>
<p>In both the game and the show, it is this decision that marks the beginning of the end for Joel, as once his identity is revealed (in the show by Dina calling out to get the attention of her patrol partner, in the game by Tommy introducing them both), Abby kills him in revenge for her father's death at his hands.</p>

<p>Now, reflecting on the tweaks to the source material, Luna says he is glad the show changed Tommy's part in 'outing' Joel to Abby, adding he didn't believe the character would have been "that careless" in reality.</p>
<p>"The truth is, back when we were doing the first season, I talked to [showrunner] Craig [Mazin] and [game creator] Neil [Druckmann] about it. Would Tommy be that careless to reveal Joel's identity? As a seasoned veteran, somebody who had to protect this city and keep it safe, would he be so trusting of strangers? And then to walk into this ambush and be knocked out for that moment, unable to use any of his strength and skills to protect his brother, it always pinged in my mind - I wouldn't say false, but I don't know if Tommy would have been that trusting to walk into that trap," Luna said in conversation with <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a64523873/gabriel-luna-the-last-of-us-season-2-interview/">Esquire</a>.</p>
<p>The actor revealed Mazin, however, already had an idea in mind for the show. "Before the strike, he was starting to break the stories," Luna shared. "He sent me this Bible-long text about where Tommy is and what he's doing instead. And it floored me. I was so excited. I'm getting goose bumps now thinking about it."</p>
<p>Luna added that having Dina present when Joel was killed rather than Tommy serves her story arc in The Last of Us  as well. Dina is "somebody who still loves Joel and sees him as family, and would be devastated when this all goes down", the actor reasoned.</p>

            <p>
The developer behind acclaimed indie role-player Tenderfoot Tactics has removed the game from sale on Xbox, and said the decision was made to support a growing Palestinian-lead boycott of Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
"We have removed Tenderfoot Tactics from sale on Xbox in solidarity with BDS [Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sonofbadru.bsky.social/post/3lngim3mjzc2x">Tenderfoot Tactics developer Badru wrote on social media</a>. "We call on others in our community to do whatever they can to fight this historic injustice. Free Palestine."
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, the Palestinian BDS National Committee added Microsoft to its list of companies flagged as having links to the Israeli military. In Microsoft's case, <a href="https://www.bdsmovement.net/news/boycott-microsofts-xbox">the BDS Movement states</a> that the maker of Windows and Xbox has provided Azure cloud and AI services "central to accelerating Israel's genocide of 2.3 million Palestinians in the illegally occupied Gaza Strip". Eurogamer has contacted Microsoft for comment.
</p>
<p>
The BDS Movement has subsequently issued a call for a boycott of Microsoft products, including Xbox specifically, as a visible way to pressure the company. Its website suggests cancelling your Xbox Game Pass subscription, and avoiding key Microsoft-owned franchises such as Minecraft, Call of Duty and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/candy-crush">Candy Crush</a>.
</p>
<p>
"By boycotting the Xbox brand, we're pressuring Microsoft to end its complicity in Israel's genocide, occupation and apartheid against Palestinians," the BDS Movement states. "Palestinians call on everyone to boycott Microsoft's Xbox and Microsoft gaming products since viable gaming alternatives exist. Genocide is not a game."
</p>
<p>
Other companies listed by the BDS to be boycotted include computer manufacturer HP, and Reebok, which sponsors the Israel Football Association.
</p>

<a href="https://apnews.com/article/microsoft-protest-employees-fired-israel-gaza-50th-anniversary-c5b3715fa1800450b8d0f639b492495e">AP reported earlier this month</a> that Microsoft had swiftly fired two employees who interrupted a presentation on AI held during the company's 50th anniversary celebration to protest links to Israel.

            <p>Skate developer Full Circle has stated its upcoming reboot won't have an offline mode.</p>
<p>This is because "the game and city [known as San Vansterdam] are designed to be a living, breathing massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox", and both are "always online and always evolving".</p>

</figure>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-grind-vol-one">recent column by the developer</a>, Skate players will notice changes to San Vansterdam itself as time goes on, as well as "smaller things, like live events and other in-game activities". And, so the studio can deliver on its vision, Skate will "always require a live connection".</p>
<p>Full Circle says this may not be a surprise to anyone who has been part of Skate's playtest, but it may still be a surprise to those who haven't been partaking. After all, the original games were offline. Then again, the Skate revival will be a free-to-play title on its release, so perhaps some were already expecting an online connection as standard.</p>
<p>In addition to chatting about the lack of an offline mode, the Skate team also addressed the playtest's microtransactions. As reported in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-skate-doesnt-yet-have-a-full-release-date-but-already-has-microtransactions">microtransactions were added during the game's closed alpha test</a>.</p>
<p>"We know that using real money during a playtest is a little unusual, but we think it’s the best way to properly assess and adjust the system before launch," Full Circle said today.</p>
<p>"If you see prices or other things changing over time, please understand that this is normal. And of course, you will receive the amount you spent during playtesting in San Van Bucks (SVB) when we reset for Early Access launch."</p>
<p>As to when we will all be able to get our hands on Skate, Full Circle remains committed to its 2025 early access release window, although it hasn't shared a more specific date as yet.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-later-ea-has-finally-announced-a-new-skate">revival of EA's Skate games was first announced back in 2020</a>. On its eventual release, it will have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-latest-skate-entry-is-live-service-free-to-play-game">cross-play and cross-progression support</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
