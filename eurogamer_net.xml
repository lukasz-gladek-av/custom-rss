            <p>IGN Entertainment (Eurogamer's parent company) has officially announced that IGN Live will run in LA from 7-8 June, 2025.</p>
<p>The fan-focused event, which takes place during summer's video game event season, is being held in downtown Los Angeles at Magic Box @ The Reef. Currently the confirmed list of studios, publishers, and brands includes Netflix, 2K Sports, Lenovo, and Arcade1Up, with more set to be announced soon. IGN Live will feature playable games on PCs, consoles, and handheld devices, plus gameplay and trailer reveals, celebrity panels, merch giveaways, a live DJ and more. It's not just video games, either, with the show aiming to be a celebration of games, movies, TV, comics, collectables and more.</p>
<p>Tickets can be bought now from <a href="http://ign.com/live">IGN</a> at a reduced price compared to buying at the door.</p>
<p>Ticket prices are detailed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early bird, single day tickets: $15 USD</li>
<li>Early bird weekend/VIP tickets: $30</li>
<li>Regular pricing, single day tickets: $25</li>
<li>Regular pricing, weekend/VIP tickets: $40</li>
<li>Single day tickets at the door: $30</li>
<li>Weekend/VIP tickets at the door: $45</li>
</ul>
<p>Act early if you want the cheapest prices, with early bird tickets only available until 30th April. A VIP pass also includes a goodie bag containing exclusive items valued at $40. You can still save money on the door price if you buy tickets online after 30th April.</p>
<p>If you can't make it to LA in June, IGN will be livestreaming the entire weekend event across IGN platforms, including IGN.com, YouTube, Twitch, social channels, and more.</p>
<p>IGN Live 2024 saw a number of big-name guests and reveals including <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-might-debut-an-unnamed-tolkien-character-ign-live-2024">The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power cast</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/phil-spencer-talks-xbox-showcase-studio-closures-xbox-handheld-and-more-ign-live-2024">Xbox’s Phil Spencer</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/assassins-creed-shadows-why-its-the-right-time-for-the-series-to-go-to-japan-ign-live-2024">Ubisoft discussing Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/johnny-rico-recruits-roughnecks-for-starship-troopers-extermination-ign-live-2024">Casper van Dien talking Starship Troopers: Extermination</a>.</p>

<p>Sort-of-E3 replacement, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-dates-confirmed">Summer Game Fest</a>, kicks off on 6th June, and it's fair to expect showcase videos from the major players at around that time, too, with reveals of games due this year and beyond.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Just weeks after a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>-themed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> mod was praised as "amazing" by Larian Studios co-founder Swen Vincke, it's been targeted by lawyers representing Dungeons &amp; Dragons company Wizards of the Coast, and hit with a DMCA takedown.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-baldurs-gate-3-mod-gives-you-another-way-to-romance-sultry-vampire-astarion">Baldur's Village mod released earlier this month</a> after more than a year in development, giving players the chance to explore a new village north of Stardew Valley's Pelican Town that's populated by some "rather unusual" residents. Its Baldur's Gate 3-inspired additions included a romanceable Astarion, alongside a new tavern and more.
</p>
<p>
At the time, its creator, Xun, said the release was just the start, with a storyline for Halsin also planned in addition to more "world-building, background stories, and gameplay". But even this initial version was enough to catch Larian boss Swen Vincke's eye, and he <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1898633725417504953">shared news of its launch on social media</a>, writing, "So much love went into this - amazing work!"

Unfortunately, it seems Dungeons &amp; Dragons license holder Wizards of the Coast was less impressed, and Baldur's Village has now vanished from modding website Nexus Mods after the company's lawyers hit it with a DMCA takedown over the weekend.
</p>
<p>
In a statement <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/wizards-of-the-coast-scores-pr-masterstroke-bullies-bg3-stardew-mod-that-had-swen-vinckes-personal-approval-off-the-internet-with-a-dmca/">provided to PC Gamer</a>, Nexus Mods described Baldur's Village - which <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/30888">remains "under moderation review" on the site</a> at the time of writing - as an "an incredibly creative cross-over to Stardew Valley that the community loves". It optimistically added, "Hopefully, this is an oversight from WotC, who often use external agencies to hunt down violating content, and they will revert their decision. Fingers crossed for Baldur's Village."
</p>
<p>
Larian's Swen Vincke also chimed in to <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1906765058270540219">defend mods such as Baldur's Village on social media</a>. "Free quality fan mods highlighting your characters in other game genres are proof your work resonates and a unique form of word of mouth," he wrote. "IMHO they shouldn't be treated like commercial ventures that infringe on your property. Protecting your IP can be tricky but I do hope this gets settled. There are good ways of dealing with this."
</p>
<p>
Wizards of the Coast and parent company Hasbro have, of course, expressed considerable interest in continuing the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> franchise following the mega-success of Baldur's Gate 3 - despite the fact <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">Larian won't be attached</a> after it instead opted to focus on its own IP.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, Hasbro <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-wants-baldurs-gate-4-but-isnt-in-a-hurry">claimed plenty of other developers are "very interested" in continuing the Baldur's Gate series</a>. "We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that," it explained. "And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that."
