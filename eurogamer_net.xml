            <p>Arc Raiders has once again smashed its own concurrent peak user count on Steam, topping 400,000 for the first time this weekend.</p>
<p>Last week, we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-passes-250000-concurrent-players-on-steam-alone-breaking-records-for-the-extraction-shooter-genre">Arc Raiders had surpassed a peak concurrent player count of 250,000 on Steam just a day after its release</a>, and then again on 1st November when it topped 328,062 simultaneous players, making it the most popular Steam release for a PvP extraction shooter ever.</p>

<p>Now, over the weekend period, Arc Raiders has broken its own record once again, hitting a new high of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">416,517 concurrent users</a> on Steam, making it the fifth biggest game on Steam over the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>Based on data from Alinea Analytics, market analysts believe around 69.2 percent of the game's playerbase is on Steam. That means roughly 30 percent of its playerbase - 17.3 percent on PlayStation, and 13.5 percent on Xbox - are not accounted for in that figure.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-may-have-already-sold-25m-copies-according-to-industry-analyst">As for why Arc Raiders is so popular</a> when other extraction shooters haven't reached such highs in terms of sales or player count? As Connor reported earlier in the week, market analyst Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics believes that "Arc Raiders is great because it focuses on community - NOT because it's an extraction shooter".</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-40-hours-and-counting-arc-raiders-has-me-convinced-extraction-shooters-are-brilliant">Eurogamer's Arc Raiders' preview</a>, we wrote: "Arc Raiders is, simply put, a third-person extraction shooter. It is a factory that mass produces tense moments, by its own nature a source of intense anxiety: high stakes, devastating losses, rapturous victories. Pulling back, it's a game of gradual self-refinement, both of your inventory full of resources and your characters abilities, and likewise your own know-how."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> has struck down co-op survival horror shooter Misery with a DMCA alleging copyright infringement.</p>
<p>After Valve said it had no option but to take down the game before it too was subject to a copyright claim, the Misery team - chiefly consisting of a solo developer called Maewing - <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2119830/announcements/detail/598542531394798467">claimed</a> it was "under attack!", insisting Misery is "a completely different concept, happening in the fictional Republic of Zaslavie, and it has nothing to do" with GSC's Stalker 2.</p>
<p>"It has nothing to do with the Stalker universe, Chernobyl, etc. Misery uses no characters, plot, storyline, assets, monsters, music, code, etc., from their games. It is all either originally created or legally licensed. We also think that this is an abuse of power against small independent developers by a large corporation, and it should not be a thing," the team wrote of its game, which released on Steam on 23rd October.</p>
<p>"We do not pose any threat to GSC or their IP, we do not compete with their games, nor do we use any of their IP. Of course, Misery was inspired by many things, including games, movies, and books, but filing a DMCA strike for that is wrong. We also want to remind GSC that their games draw heavily from Roadside Picnic and the Stalker movie by Tarkovsky, and they do not own the copyright on depressive Soviet-era buildings, playing guitar, vodka, radiation, or abandoned locations, or even the poo."</p>

<p>As a consequence of the claim, the game has disappeared from the Steam storefront.</p>
<p>"We are 100% sure this misunderstanding will be resolved, Misery will be back on Steam very soon, and we will see many amazing updates and new content," the team added. "This is very unfortunate and painful for us, both mentally and financially, but the development continues, all the updates will be delivered on time, and soon we can play Misery again."</p><p>The message from Valve included screenshots comparing Misery to Stalker 2, including side-by-side comparisons of a gloomy, Soviet-era neightbourhood from Stalker: Call of Prypiat and a similar environment in Misery. Another side-by-side comparison shows characters in both games sitting around a fire wearing gas masks, playing guitar.</p>

<p>The team closed on imploring people not to review-bomb GSC, writing: "do not insult them or other people in comments, especially for their nationality! We do not want or support that".</p>
<p>However, in the privacy of its members-only Discord channel, the developer was considerably less polite <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1or39zs/comment/nno4g7j/">and posted a screed of pejorative slurs</a>, prompting a follow-up apology.</p>
<p>"[After the DMCA strike], some people found my old posts and comments that included inappropriate and offensive statements," the developer said (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/stalker-dev-gsc-game-world-dmcad-a-stalker-inspired-indie-off-steam-and-the-devs-are-crying-foul-this-is-an-abuse-of-power-against-small-independent-developers-by-a-large-corporation/">PC Gamer</a>). "Many are rightfully upset, and I completely understand why. First of all, I want to acknowledge and take full responsibility for my past words. What I wrote was immature, thoughtless, and wrong. It does not represent who I am today or what I believe in, and I deeply regret posting it.</p><p>"I do not support any form of extremism, violence, or discrimination against any group of people. I truly value and respect our players and friends from all countries and backgrounds. As for the DMCA strike we will handle it calmly and professionally. There is no basis for it, and I believe Valve will review the situation fairly."</p>
<p>Since then, Reddit investigators believe they've <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1or39zs/comment/nnu3vzk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">found unsubstantiated evidence that assets from Stalker 2 were indeed used to create Misery</a>, which may be why GSC has cracked down particularly on this developer and not other copycat titles. Others purport it may be because the developer, and seemingly some elements of the game's fanbase, allegedly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1or7deo/few_screenshots_from_the_misery_discord/?share_id=4SZ6WdPDMY2KDFHNmrF88&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">supports</a> Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-reportedly-target-of-russian-disinformation-campaign-claiming-its-used-to-draft-players-into-ukraine-war">GSC is a Ukranian studio</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-roadmap-for-2025-includes-a-life-updates-and-an-upgrade-to-a-new-version-of-unreal-engine-5">GSC Game World announced its plans for updates to Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl for the remainder of 2025</a>. Big ticket updates include tweaks and changes to the A-Life system, Unreal Engine 5 performance gains, and new night vision devices to play with.</p>

<p>That may not sound like a big deal for most players - there's no danger of it happening to me - but the cap also apparently applies when there's a double XP weekend, with one player reporting you can "hit that cap in just 4-5 hours of playing".</p><p>"In a $70 'AAA' game not a mobile free2play title you're being told how much fun you're allowed to have per day," wrote one player.

<p>"Players deserve to know this before buying. Stop pretending this is fine just because it's Battlefield."</p>
<p>"I got 200k XP for a single win in RedSec yesterday, the game was 21 minutes long," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oqzchg/comment/nnmn21y/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">added</a> another player.

<p>Not everyone's outraged, however.</p>

<p>Even those who wouldn't hit the cap do agree with the spirit of the complaint, though.</p>
<p>"I won’t hit an exp cap either because I can only put myself thru 2hrs max. But I agree with OP, a game that I pay $70 for I should be allowed to grind until my mouse/controller falls apart if I want to," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oqzchg/comment/nnmnd5d/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">opined</a> someone else.</p><p>Yesterday, we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bots-are-returning-to-battlefield-6s-conquest-breakthrough-and-rush-modes">Battlefield 6 was "reintroducing bots to verified experiences"</a>. Bots were originally removed as part of efforts to "support healthier matchmaking", but they've now been returned to Conquest, Breakthrough, and Rush, with up to 12 popping up in each game mode. Challenges will "remain completable" with bots.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-challenges-are-being-made-far-easier-following-intense-community-feedback">EA and Battlefield Studios made sweeping changes to challenges</a>, reducing the required milestones for class assignments, weapon assignments, gameplay and mastery assignments, and more. And last weekend, Battlefield 6 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-makes-temporary-adjustments-to-xp-earned-in-strikepoint-mode-to-maintain-fair-and-consistent-progression">"made some temporary adjustments" to XP</a> earned in Strikepoint as it works on "a longer-term solution". It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-drops-a-new-relaxed-way-to-earn-xp-without-the-intensity-of-a-full-pvp-lobby">introduced a new "relaxed way" to play "while still earning progression and completing challenges"</a>.</p>

            <p>FromSoftware hasn't finished with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> or spin-off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a> just yet.</p>
<p>That's according to parent company Kadokawa, which revealed in its latest financials that with Elden Ring Nightreign "performing well beyond initial expectations", we can expect new DLC by the end of this financial year, which is the end of March 2026.</p>

<p>"We are aiming for further sales growth for Elden Ring Nightreign, original Elden Ring, and its DLC," the company <a href="https://group.kadokawa.co.jp/global/information/">added</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-performed-well-beyond-initial-expectations-fromsoftware-parent-company-says-and-dlc-could-take-it-even-further/">GamesRadar+</a>).</p>
<p>"We have multiple game titles in the development pipeline. FromSoftware is currently developing Elden Ring Nightreign DLC (planned for release in FY2025) Elden Ring Tarnished Edition (planned for release in 2026 for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>), and The Duskbloods (planned for release in 2026)."</p><p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-elden-ring-tarnished-edition-delayed-to-2026-to-allow-time-for-performance-adjustments">FromSoftware pushed back the release of the highly anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 port of Elden Ring</a> to "allow time for performance adjustments". In a brief statement, the developer apologised for the delay, but said it was "wholeheartedly [working] toward release", which is now expected sometime in 2026. Sadly, a firmer release window was not been provided.</p>
