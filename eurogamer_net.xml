            <p>
Everwild's executive producer has a new role at Xbox, following the cancellation of Rare's long-in-development project.
</p>
<p>
Amidst layoffs at Microsoft in July, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's fantasy adventure Everwild was cancelled</a> and a number of employees at the British studio lost their jobs.
</p>
<p>
Now, as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/rare-veteran-lands-new-role-at-xbox-game-studios-after-everwild-cancellation/">VGC</a>, the game's executive producer Louise O'Connor has moved to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> as its chief of staff, following 25 years at Rare.

<p>
The move comes almost a year after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rare-boss-craig-duncan-becomes-new-head-of-xbox-game-studios">former head of Rare Craig Duncan became head of Xbox Game Studios</a>, after Alan Hartman retired.
</p>
<p>
O'Connor first worked at Rare on Conker's Bad Fur Day for the N64. She later worked at the studio as head of animation and its incubation director, responsible for innovation.
</p>
<p>
Everwild was first revealed in 2019 as the next big project from Rare. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-new-everwild-trailer">surfaced again in 2020 with a trailer</a> (above) featuring gorgeous environments and creatures, but little was seen aftewards until its cancellation.
</p>
<p>
Notably, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-and-banjo-kazooie-director-gregg-mayles-reportedly-leaving-rare-after-35-years">Rare veteran Gregg Mayles also left the studio</a> in the wake of the Microsoft layoffs, after 35 years.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> creator Mike Booth has announced he is working on a new four-player co-op shooter.</p>
<p>In a post shared on reddit over the weekend, Booth said the upcoming game will be "built on the foundations of what made [Left 4 Dead] special", though he stopped short of giving his new project a name or indeed any concept art.</p>
<p>However, in the words of the developer, "if you enjoyed the teamwork, tension, and replayability of my past games, you'll probably find this one interesting".</p>

<p>Booth added this shooter will expand on the co-op gameplay formula in "ways I've wanted to explore for a long time". Curious.</p>
<p>Booth currently works for Bad Robot Games, which is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jj-abrams-production-company-bad-robot-now-has-a-games-division">subdivision of JJ Abrams' film and TV production company announced in 2018</a>. In his reddit post, Booth said the team is still in the "early stages" of the shooter's development. There are, however, going to be playtests for a limited number of participants.

            <p>
Lego is set to release a collection of Pokémon-themed sets next year, which will reportedly be among the most expensive to date.
</p>
<p>
The collection was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-pokemon-announced-coming-2026">officially revealed by Lego in March this year</a>, with an intended release in 2026. Now, in a post on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1n47qnb/pokemon_72153_piece_count_price_source_reddit/">Legoleak reddit page</a>, it's reported the sets will arrive on general sale on 1st March (with a 27th February release for Insiders).
</p>
<p>
What's more, the biggest of the three sets will be 6838 pieces and cost a whopping $649.99. The remaining two sets will be $59.99 for a 587 piece set, and $199.99 for a 2050 piece set.

<p>
It's unknown exactly what these sets will be, but if these prices and piece counts are correct, it suggests this won't be a simple Pikachu minifigure. Perhaps we'll see a single large character design, like the Bowser set? Or a huge gym or town display?
</p>
<p>
For reference, The Mighty Bowser set is £229.99 for 2807 pieces, while the Lord of the Rings Barad-dûr set is £399.99 for 5471 pieces, and the Zelda Great Deku Tree is £259.99 for 2500 pieces.
</p>
<p>
Lego and Nintendo have seen big success with their <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-super-mario-kart-sets-will-be-ready-to-race-in-2025">Mario</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-lego-set-officially-revealed-by-nintendo">Zelda</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kk-slider-coming-to-new-lego-animal-crossing-sets">Animal Crossing</a> sets. Clearly they're expecting the Pokémon sets to be even more popular.

            <p>The first season of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s acclaimed anime spin-off Edgerunners is getting a physical Blu-ray release.</p>
<p>As shared by Crunchyroll, the anime box set is available to pre-order now, with an expected shipping date of 23rd October. It will retail in the US for $123.98 (I have not been able to find a UK specific release, though, with the current retail listing being region A).</p>

<p>For your money, you will receive (obviously) the entire first series, which is 10 episodes, across three discs. It also includes a storyboard booklet from director Hiroyuki Imaishi, a "special" booklet, three animation cel sheets and a two year anniversary poster (see image below).</p>
<p>"In a world of neon and the cybernetically enhanced, can David climb up from a lowly bourgie to become an edgerunning legend?" asks the official blurb. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-edgerunners-shows-cd-projekts-cyberpunk-is-still-worth-fighting-for">Eurogamer's former editor-in-chief Wesley Yin-Poole called the Cyberpunk anime "fantastic"</a> when he watched it back in 2022.</p>
<p>If this all sounds like your thing, you can <a href="https://store.crunchyroll.com/products/cyberpunk-edgerunners--complete-series--bluray-850077050015.html">find the Crunchyroll sales page here</a>.</p>

<p>A second season of Edgerunners is now in the works at Netflix. It will comprise 10 episodes, and feature a standalone story within the world of Cyberpunk 2077. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/when-people-are-sad-im-a-bit-happy-cyberpunk-edgerunners-season-two-is-going-to-be-sadder-bloodier-and-darker">Edgerunners' writer and producer said he doesn't want to write a jolly story for the series</a>, because "when people are sad", it makes him "a bit happy".</p>
