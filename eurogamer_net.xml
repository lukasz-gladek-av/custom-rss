            <p>2XKO is out properly on PC and consoles, bringing with it a slew of new features and Caitlyn as its 12th fighter. However, inquisitive players quickly found a fun easter egg tied to Caitlyn that significantly changes the character's appearance in game.</p>
<p>By holding down both special buttons during the loading screen before a match, players who have chosen Caitlyn as one of their two fighters will be able to remove the hat present on her default costume. With that, her iconic top hate is gone, replaced with absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>This is not the first time such an easter egg has been included in 2XKO. When the season 0 Arcane skins were added to the game last year, players discovered that very specific button combinations prior to a match could remove the mask from Ekko's Arcane skin, pull down Jinx's hood, or remove Vi's jacket.</p>

</figure>
<p>This is a style of secret with a rich history in fighting games, with games including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-v">Street Fighter V</a> offering similar easter eggs on specific costumes. What's great about Caitlyn's secret costume alteration is that, unlike the Arcane skins, you don't need to spend a dime to use it yourself.</p><p>If you're curious about 2XKO and want to learn more about it, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2xko-review">why not read Eurogamer's 2XKO review</a>! In it, the game is described as: "2XKO is a tag fighter like no other, with a bold aesthetic and superbly crafted core gameplay experience. Beloved <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> characters are revitalised in a new light in a truly stunning free-to-play experience."</p>

            <p>The sixth episode of Fallout season two has just aired on Prime, and with it given viewers and fans a fun cameo to look out for.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of spoilers for Fallout season two below.</strong></p>

<p>Just a week or so on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-veteran-ron-perlman-says-he-was-paid-40-dollars-and-a-sandwich-for-his-voiceover-work-in-the-original-game">Ron Perlman's revelation that he was paid "$40 and a sandwich" for his first Fallout gig in the 90s</a> - which saw him narrating the RPG complete with his iconic "War. War never changes" line - the actor has now popped up in the TV series, decades later.</p>
<p>Perlman plays the part of a Fallout Super Mutant in the show, who liberates Walton Goggins' Ghoul from that pole he was impaled on at the end of last week's episode (I am still wincing from that scene).</p>
<p>In the show's Fallout, Perlman's Super Mutant again mentions "war", telling the Ghoul there is one coming, and so "we need you healthy". He then helps sort out that whopping great hole in the Ghoul's abdomen.</p>
<p>"They call us abominations, but they created our kind," Perlman's character tells the Ghoul as he heals. 'They', of course, refers to Fallout's nefarious Enclave, which seems to have its fingers in the Vault-Tec pie. "Ghouls, mutants, we're kin," Perlman's Super Mutant continues, "and we should unite against our common enemy."</p><p>Perlman's Super Mutant is putting together an army against the "people who set all this in motion", but what that could actually mean for the rest of Fallout season two remains to be seen, as no sooner than we get a glimpse of Perlman's mutilated face, he bops the Ghoul over the head to keep his location a secret. Hmmm, curious!</p>

<p>There are still two more episodes of Fallout season two left to go, and things are heating up in the wasteland. Along with returning faces like Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-goes-full-new-vegas-with-a-new-trailer-showing-a-deathclaw-the-kings-and-macaulay-culkin">Macaulay Culkin and Kumail Nanjiani have also joined the show for season two</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, filming for the third season of Fallout <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">is expected to begin this May</a>. Don't expect to see a similar Perlman cameo from Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a>, though. "They've offered me a whole bunch, even in season one," Howard said last month, explaining he was "going to be in the sort of Dr. Strangelove Vault-Tec room, where they're talking [about] all the experiments, and some other things."</p>

<p>However, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallouts-todd-howard-has-no-interest-in-becoming-bethesdas-version-of-marvel-cameo-king-stan-lee">studio head thinks he is best placed "behind the camera" rather than in front of it</a>.</p>

            <p>Much has been written over the years on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-ii">Dark Souls 2</a>'s quality and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/souls-week-dark-souls-2-is-the-best-dark-souls-game-that-isnt-dark-souls-or-dark-souls-3">whether it reached the heights of its relatives</a>. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't really matter, as the sequel has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/335300/charts/#max">consistently attracted players over the years</a> and with two different versions of the same gruelling action-RPG adventure.</p>
<p>Those who really enjoyed FromSoftware's Miyazaki-less entry have also tried to celebrate it with yearly 'Return to Drangleic' community events, and now we know when 2026's is going to happen thanks to Reddit's most active Dark Souls communities.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/1qgmvjq/return_to_drangleic_2026/">r/darksouls</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkSouls2/comments/1q6ueqo/return_to_drangleic_2026/">r/DarkSouls2</a>, different users started to promote the two weeks-ish period starting on 26th February and ending on 13th March. Some say it's starting a day later, but it's all agreed upon otherwise. Chances are the servers across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC will be seeing an uptick before then, as the game has never gone inactive. Still, you should expect to see more jolly cooperation (and heinous invasions) happening around that time.</p>
<p>As explained by the vets on the relevant subreddits, the 'Return to Drangleic' events are the perfect opportunities for newcomers to jump in too, as getting through Dark Souls 2's worst areas is far easier with seasoned adventurers by your side. The second instalment is often described as the trilogy's most brutal and unforgiving, with enemy placement being troll-y at times and key mechanics like its take on humanity and max HP being a bit annoying. Most players agree it's the entry with the most interesting approach to covenants and PvP on the other hand.</p><p>As a reminder, the original PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of Dark Souls 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-souls-2-ps3-xbox-360-servers-to-shut-down">went offline a few years ago</a>, so you'll need to own the Scholar of the First Sin edition to join the fun; same story on PC. We know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-video-games-2026-releases#section-2">February</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-video-games-2026-releases#section-3">March</a> are looking stacked when it comes to all-new game releases, but it's never a bad time to mess around in the Dark Souls games.</p>
<p>By the way, 2026 will mark <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>'s 10th anniversary, and the rumour mill has been saying for a while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dark-souls-3-remaster-is-in-development-its-claimed/">a remaster could be happening</a> to celebrate the occasion. The ride never ends.</p>
