            <p>It has been six years and a bit since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> was first announced, and ever since then we have been seeking out any crumb of information about the upcoming game.</p>
<p>And yet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-gets-surprise-sequel-for-switch-and-pc">since that now slightly hazy day of February 2019</a>, developer Team Cherry has kept release details under relative wraps (although in January, the team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-progressing-and-will-release-says-team-cherry">did try and assure us that Silksong is "real, progressing and will release"</a>).</p>
<p>But, when will it be released, Team Cherry? When? You tell me it is real, but where is the proof? I need hard evidence, Cherry! (Ok, I am jesting slightly here.) But, while I may need further reassurance, Microsoft is clearly still confident the game will eventually show up, namechecking it as part of a new <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/18/idxbox-developers-finding-success-with-xbox/">post</a> about its ID@Xbox program.</p>

<p>"Looking ahead, our lineup is incredible with upcoming games," Xbox writes, before highlighting titles such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/belle-epoque-rpg-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gets-april-release-date">which is slated for an April release</a>) and Control multiplayer spin-off FBC: Firebreak from Remedy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-control-developer-remedy-reveals-first-ever-multiplayer-game">FBC: Firebreak was announced in October last year</a>, and has a release window of 2025.</p>
<p>And as well as those? "Of course Hollow Knight: Silksong too!" Microsoft states.</p>
<p>Does this mean Hollow Knight: Silksong may be releasing soon? Ahh, alas, I doubt its inclusion in Xbox's post really means anything more than Microsoft is having a playful joke with those of us who are wanting to hear more. But then again, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-moments-set-to-shape-video-games-in-2025"><em>maybe </em>2025 will finally be the year Silksong flies onto platforms</a>.

            <p>Developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> has deployed another rather chunky patch for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>.</p>
<p>On the game's initial launch last year, Stalker 2 was criticised for its performance issues. However, in an interview with Eurogamer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delaying-stalker-2-again-not-an-option-studio-says-team-worked-until-it-was-broken-by-marathon-development">GSC Game World's CEO Ievgen Grygorovych said delaying the game was not an option</a>. "You're so tired that you would just die if you say let's run an additional marathon," Grygorovych said at the time. </p>

<p>The team has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyls-second-major-patch-adds-1700-improvements-and-fixes">remained committed to sorting the game's various niggles</a> and what not since then, with two already sizeable patches already out there, and this most recent update is a continuation of that. </p>
<p>Patch 1.3, as it is known, comes with "over 1200 changes and improvements" to all aspects of the game, including performance, combat and more.</p>
<p>With this patch in play, Stalker 2 players will notice multiple new death screens which "vary based on the cause of the death", as well as improved facial animations, a new night music theme for Slag Heap and a new type of a visual anomaly.</p>
<p>On the combat side of things, GSC has made mutant movements during combat smoother and improved the reaction of NPCs to the sound of footsteps.</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/en/news/patch-1-3">full patch notes via the Stalker 2 website here</a>.</p>
