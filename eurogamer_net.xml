            <p>Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida has called NieR: Automata the "game that changed everything", as it was responsible for reviving the Japanese games industry on its release.</p>
<p>Speaking to Japanese outlet <a href="https://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/series/rt/2001799.html">AV Watch</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-he-was-ordered-not-to-worry-about-overseas-reviews-by-games-producer/">Automaton</a>), Yoshida discussed how during the PS3 era, sales of Japanese games had declined and increasingly studios there were chasing "overseas tastes".</p>
<p>That changed with NieR: Automata in 2017, released for the PS4. "I think <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/yoko-taro">Yoko Taro</a> created it without paying any mind at all to making it sell overseas, but it was a tremendous success," said Yoshida.</p>

<p>The game proved Japanese studios could find success by creating Japanese-style games. "With NieR, everyone realised this," said Yoshida. "That it wasn't just something they could do, but something they had to do."</p>
<p>As such, Japanese studios strove to "create based on their own culture and what they knew", realising this was the appeal of their work overseas.</p>
<p>"I think that the Japanese game industry revived after NieR, so much so that you could talk about pre-NieR and post-NieR eras. Simply put, I think that was the title that made everyone want to pursue Japanese-style games," said Yoshida.</p>
<p>NieR creator Yoko Taro himself responded on social media, thanking Yoshida for the praise but crediting producer Yosuke Saito, who "ordered" him to make a game "that targets the Japanese market, without worrying about overseas reviews".</p>
<p>"Or, to put it more precisely," said Taro, "I remember being told something like 'Yoko, you can't make games for overseas, so (at least) try to make it for Japan'."</p> <div>

<p>Saito then replied: "What I said at the time went more like this: Since we're Japanese people, there's no need for us to go out of our way to cater to people overseas. Surely, we'll be able to attract at least a million players among all the people out there who genuinely want to play a Japanese game made by a Japanese person (the one and only Yoko Taro)."</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nier-developers-join-forces-for-new-project-that-might-be-nier-it-might-not-be-nier">Saito teased a possible new NieR project</a> alongside Taro, though nothing further has been said since. "I've been talking about wanting to do something with Yoko and Okabe for some time now," he said at the time. "I'll have something a bit more put-together to say in the not-too-distant future, so please stay tuned. It might be NieR, it might not be NieR. [Laughs] That's about all I can say for now."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-is-superior-to-nier-automata-says-yoko-taro">Taro also compared NieR: Automata to Stellar Blade</a>, stating: "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> is a really amazing game. I'd say that it's much better than NieR:Automata."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The official landing page for Ghost of Yōtei got a little update yesterday, with some new information on Sucker Punch's upcoming game tucked in there.</p>
<p>Straight off the bat, along with some more story details, the developer has remained committed to its 2025 release window on PS5. There had been some speculation the studio and PlayStation may nudge it back a touch to make way for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be">a game many expect will dominate the gaming landscape when it releases this autumn</a> (unless it gets delayed).</p>
<p>In terms of story, while we knew Ghost of Yōtei's protagonist Atsu had a revenge mission of some kind, we now have a little more background as to why.</p>

<p>Here's what the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/ghost-of-yotei/">updated Ghost of Yōtei synopsis reads</a>:</p>
<p>"300 years after the events of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, a new warrior – Atsu – rises from the ashes of her homestead.</p>
<p>"Filled with fury and determination, Atsu will hunt down those responsible for the death of her family and exact her revenge. Every odd job and bounty will provide the coin she needs for her journey. But how she fights, survives, and evolves the legend of the Ghost, will be up to you."</p>
<p>Along with the fact we now know Atsu is seeking revenge for her ravaged home and family life, that mention of "every odd job and bounty" has also sparked some intrigue. It sounds like Ghost of Yōtei may include a bounty mechanic, and perhaps have some kind of in-game economy, which would spice up the game's world a touch.</p>
<p>The developer previously said it was going to ensure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-follow-up-will-have-a-less-repetitive-open-world">Ghost of Yōtei had a less repetitive open world compared to its predecessor</a>, with criticisms for Ghost of Tsushima often directed at its somewhat repetitive activities.</p>
<p>Back in October, Sucker Punch's creative director Jason Connell said: "One challenge that comes with making an open-world game is the repetitive nature of doing the same thing over again. We wanted to balance against that and find unique experiences."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reveals-ghost-of-yotei-the-follow-up-to-ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Yōtei was first unveiled at a PlayStation State of Play last year</a>.</p>
<p>"To create something fresh but familiar, we looked beyond Jin Sakai’s story and the island of Tsushima, and shifted our focus to the idea of the Ghost instead," wrote Sucker Punch communications manager Andrew Goldfarb at the time. "At Sucker Punch we love origin stories, and we wanted to explore what it could mean to have a new hero wearing a Ghost mask, and uncovering a new legend.</p>
<p>"This led us to Ghost of Yōtei: a new protagonist, a new story to unfold, and a new region of Japan to explore."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
