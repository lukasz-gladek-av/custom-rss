            <p>Four and a half years after it was announced, EA's free-to-play skate sim, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skate">Skate</a>, is finally ready for playtesting on consoles.</p>
<p>Early adopters who signed up to Skate's early access Insider programme are now receiving invitations to get involved in the playtest and "help shape the future of the game".</p>

<p>Worry not if you've yet to be selected - the team is "invit[ing] new players who are registered as we go" and still actively recruiting testers, so if you'd like to give it a go, head on over to the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/insider-playtest-registration">official website</a> and express your interest.</p><div>

<p>When developer Full Circle <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-latest-skate-entry-is-live-service-free-to-play-game">first began sharing details</a> of its new Skate project - which is officially known as Skate, rather than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skate-4">Skate 4</a> - back in 2022, the studio explained it wasn't "a sequel", nor "a remake, a reboot, [or] a prequel". Instead, it was described as an "authentic evolution" of the series intended to reflect "where skateboarding and gaming is in the real world".</p>
<p>Skate will be available on PlayStation, Xbox, PC (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-stake-is-coming-to-pc-via-steam">including Steam</a>), and mobile devices when it releases in early access later this year - some 15 years after the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skate-3">Skate 3</a>. It will also boast <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-latest-skate-entry-is-live-service-free-to-play-game">cross-play and cross-progression support</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
