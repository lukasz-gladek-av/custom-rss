            <p>A new Plants vs Zombies game is reportedly seeing some movement behind the scene, with a potential release date coming up this year. Plants vs Zombies Reloaded (or Replanted, if the report is to be believed), is said to be a remake of the original game, which may be sprouting up this October.
</p>
<p>This information comes <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/une-version-revisitee-de-plants-vs-zombies-en-approche-on-vous-revele-tout-ce-que-lon-sait-60272">courtesy of Dealabs</a>, a website known for its history of leaks that have largely proven correct. 
</p>
<p>According to the publication, Plants vs Zombies Replanted will launch on 23rd October. Dealabs claims the game will be revealed within the month, and sell for â‚¬19.99 across PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>Plants vs Zombies 'Reloaded' was previously registered as a trademark in Brazil, <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1902169093538521453?">as spotted by Gematsu in March</a>, but according to Dealabs the developers at PopCap want to dub it something a bit more in-line with what the series is about. Thus: Replanted. 
</p>
<p>Plants vs Zombies has proven exceptionally popular over the years. The original game was an instant classic, winning over huge numbers of people with its quirky take on the tower defence genre. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/plants-vs-zombies-review">In the original 2009 Eurogamer review</a> (good times), Christian Donlan stated the game was: "An effortlessly streamlined take on tower defence games, enemies march across the screen from right to left, sticking to polite rows, and it's up to the player to place the various weapons required to slow their progress and finish them off."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/plants-vs-zombies-reloaded-release-date-rumoured-for-october-launch]]></content:encoded>
