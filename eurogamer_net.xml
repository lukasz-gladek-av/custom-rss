            <p>Valve has removed a game from its British Steam storefront following a request from the UK's counter-terrorism unit.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1714420/Fursan_alAqsa_The_Knights_of_the_AlAqsa_Mosque/">The FPS/TPS Fursan al-Aqsa: The Knights of the Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> - which describes itself as "address[ing] the Israel x Palestine conflict from a Palestinian perspective" - was removed when Steam contacted developer Nidal Nijm to inform him it had "received a request from authorities in the UK to block the game and have applied such country restrictions".</p>
<p>In an email to the Brazillian developer, Steam allegedly said: "We've received a request from authorities in the UK to block the game and have applied such country restrictions". When the developer reportedly asked if there was "a specific reason" for the UK ban and said "my game is not too much different than any other shooter game on Steam, like Call of Duty", he was told:</p>
<p>"We were contacted by the Counter Terrorism Command of the United Kingdom, specifically the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU). As with any authority for a region the [sic] oversees and governs what content can be made available, we have to comply with their requests."</p><p>In an email to <a href="https://www.404media.co/steam-removes-oct-7-game-at-request-of-uk-counter-terrorism-unit/">404</a>, a counter-terrorism spokesperson said: "The CTIRU works closely with a range of technology, social media and online service providers, but we do not comment on specific content or any communication we may have with specific platforms or providers."</p>
<p>"The region lock of my game in the UK was clearly due to political reasons," Nijm wrote in a statement to the same publication.</p>
<p>"I do not blame Valve nor Steam, the blame is on the UK government and authorities that are pissed off by a video game," Nijm said. "On their flawed logic, the most recent Call of Duty <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> should be banned as well. As you play as an American soldier and go to Iraq to kill Iraqi people. What I can say is that we see clearly the double standards."</p>
<p>The game - which was updated to include the 7th October attack given it released in April 2022 - calls itself "the Palestinian <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> on steroids" and the "most BASED game of all times". It has already been banned in Germany and Australia for not going through the countries' respective classification boards.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1714420/Fursan_alAqsa_The_Knights_of_the_AlAqsa_Mosque/">The game</a> is still available to buy online outside of the UK, including the US. In the UK, however, the Steam page simply throws up an "Oops, sorry!" message, saying, "this item is currently unavailable in your region".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"From Tokyo 2099 to the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda, and to Hydra Charteris Base and Klyntar, Galacta has assembled more heroes to take on the ultimate challenge," NetEase teases. "Who will you choose as your main to save the Multiverse on December 6th?"</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals is an upcoming free-to-play, team-based PVP shooter for PC with the backing of Chinese publishing giant NetEase.</p>
<p>Described as a "thrilling, fast-paced, cooperative gameplay experience", Marvel Rivals pits teams of six against each other as they fight it out over a variety of destructible environments with characters from across the Marvel universe. Head of Marvel Games Jay Ong said Marvel Rivals is one of the team's "most ambitious game development projects", and one the developer has "poured [its] heart and soul into".</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals finally releases in full on 6th December 2024.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-tos-contains-a-non-disparagement-clause-to-prevent-players-giving-negative-reviews">NetEase was forced to apologise earlier this year</a> when players and content creators hit back at Marvel Rivals for a playtest terms of service contract that prohibited players from making "statements that are detrimental to the reputation of the game".</p>
<p>In a statement posted in Discord shortly after the contract began to make headlines, the Marvel Rivals Content Creator Team said it "sincerely apologised" for the "miscommunication and your unpleasant experiences".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A teaser for an unreleased Lego James Bond game has leaked online.</p>
<p>Whilst there's very little information accompanying the leak - apparently, it just popped up on Iinterni Gamer's Discord server at 2 am one day - it appears that at one stage, TT Games was considering a blocktastic bonanza based on Bond.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the trailer is still live, and several mirrors have been uploaded - you can check it out below:</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="484"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/1h0jkr3/unreleased_james_bond_trailer_for_lego_dimensions/">Unreleased James Bond trailer for LEGO Dimensions (direct reupload because YouTube blocked it)</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kecskecske6/">u/kecskecske6</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/">legogaming</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>"This trailer got leaked surprisingly on my Discord server, and it's an official trailer cause literally everything that appears looks exactly as the previous trailer but with final designs. Possibly its [sic] on reddit but [I don't know] really," wrote the uploader in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkSR8L8Gjwc">YouTube description</a>.</p><p>Rather than being based on one particular Bond or movie, the teaser features a number of iconic portrayals and films, including Live and Let Die and A View to a Kill. For the full-minute-long run-time, a disclaimer states: "Confidential (TT Games Studio) - Not for distribution. R&amp;D content only - not representative of any final products".</p>
<p>LEGOGameMuseum has added a little more <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/1h0jkr3/comment/lz7rgrl/">context</a> on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/1h0jkr3/unreleased_james_bond_trailer_for_lego_dimensions/">r/legogaming subreddit</a>, too.</p>

</span></p><p>"This wasn't actually for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-dimensions">Lego Dimensions</a> year 3 [as described in the reddit thread], it was produced as a pitch for The Lego Group to convince them to give the okay for a full game, it was made during the last year Dimensions was being worked on when TT knew Dimensions wouldn't get a third year of content," they said.</p>
<p>"Once again, TLG decided Bond wasn't suitable, and vetoed the project. I think this has been found in the data of a Dimensions build, which is where the confusion is coming from."</p>
<p>"This was around 2016, and LEGO specifically were not happy with the violence and sexual innuendo," they added in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/1h0jkr3/comment/lz97qu1/">follow-up comment</a>.</p>
<p>"Characters called Pussy Galore and Plenty O'Tool wouldn't really work in a family-friendly Lego game. Although I'm sure TT could make it work. TLG these days seems more willing to try different things in games, so it could potentially be revisited, the biggest barrier for TT would be WB forcing them to stick to owned IP."</p><p>If you want to expand your IRL Lego collection, you're in luck - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/physical-lego-horizon-adventures-set-sees-aloy-taking-on-a-bricky-shell-walker-and-sawtooth">Lego has just unveiled a new Horizon set</a>. Following on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-forbidden-west-tallneck-lego-revealed">the majestic Tallneck model</a>, Lego and Guerrilla are once again joining forces and releasing a set inspired by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-teases-new-horizon-themed-set-on-the-way">teased a couple of weeks ago</a>, this set is known as <a href="https://zdcs.link/ak7EBn">Aloy and Varl vs. Shell-Walker and Sawtooth</a>, and it comprises much of what you would expect, given the name.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
