            <p>Last night, Warner Bros shocked the industry when it was announced the closure of three studios, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">including Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor's Monolith Productions</a>. Founded in the 1990s and part of Warner Bros since 2004, the studio was best known for Shadow of Mordor and its follow-up Shadow of War, which both used the studio's patented Nemesis system.
</p>
<p>The Nemesis system, for those unfamiliar, is a clever in-game mechanic which tracks a player's actions to create enemies that feel capable of remembering past encounters. In the studio's Middle-earth games, this allowed foes to rise through the ranks and enact revenge.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monolith-is-making-a-wonder-woman-game">Nemesis system was set to be utilised again in Monolith's Wonder Woman game</a>, though that project has now been cancelled alongside the studio's sudden closure - leaving the Nemesis system seemingly now lying unused, and protected by Warner Bros due to its successful patent application.</p>

</figure>
<p>The patent itself - <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160279522A1/en">which you can view here</a> - was originally filed back in 2016, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-is-trying-to-patent-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordors-nemesis-system">before it was granted in 2021</a>. It is dubbed "Nemesis characters, nemesis forts, social vendettas and followers in computer games". As it stands, the patent has an expiration date of 11th August, 2036.</p>
<p>So, even though Monolith is getting shut down, Warner Bros will be able to retain the patent for the Nemesis system for another 11 years, should it keep up the patent's associated fees.</p>
<p>Many are upset that this may well mean the death of the Nemesis system. "They really patented the Nemesis System only to do absolutely nothing with it," <a href="https://x.com/MarsSuccessor/status/1894469391846105516">wrote one social media user</a>. "RIP the Nemesis system, I guess," added <a href="https://x.com/Cade_Onder/status/1894486393952317771">video game journalist Cade Onder</a>. </p>
<p>"Monolith literally created a one-of-a-kind system that procedurally generated a complete hierarchy of unique enemies that interacted with the player and itself in the Nemesis System," <a href="https://x.com/counterscottGO/status/1894467261261389908">another wrote</a>. "WB took that from them, patented it, and then closed their studio. Fuck them."</p>

<p>Needless to say, the news of Monolith's closure last night, along with the closure of Player First Games and Warner Bros Games San Diego, has been met with sadness across the industry.</p>
<p>Comic book writer Gail Simone, who was serving as a consultant on Monolith's Wonder Woman title, said the game was both "gorgeous and expansive".</p>
<p>"It was beautiful to look at. I am not going to give details for a number of reasons, but every effort was made to make this not just a great game, but a great WONDER WOMAN game," Simone wrote on social media, calling the project a "showpiece epic". The consultant added the team wanted to "make the best game ever", however "sometimes, you give your all and it doesn’t work out".</p>

<p>The cancellation of Wonder Woman comes amid an extremely rocky period for Warner Bros' games division, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gotham-knights-latest-patch-adds-a-tough-new-15-floor-heroic-assault-raid">Warner Bros Montreal's Gotham Knights</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-final-chapter-brings-game-to-a-cheap-end">Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-director-in-deep-mourning-following-last-weeks-shutdown-news">IP-heavy party brawler MultiVersus</a>, and last year's Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions all failing to make an impact with consumers.</p>
<p>Last month, Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment president <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-departs-following-rocky-period-for-publisher">David Haddad announced he was stepping down after 12 years in the role</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/edge-of-eternity-studio-announces-jrpg-follow-up-with-xenoblade-and-chrono-trigger-talent<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
The French developer behind million-selling indie role-player Edge of Eternity has announced a fresh follow-up, Edge of Memories.
</p>
<p>
This new game - a blend of JRPG mechanics and French animation - is set in the same world, and will launch this autumn for PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
</p>
<p>
Once again, the Montpellier-based Studio Midgar has recruited JRPG veterans to join the game's development, with Edge of Eternity featuring an expanded roster. This includes Nier writer Sawako Natori and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-10">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a> character designer Raita Kazama.

</figure>
<p>
For the game's music, some of which you can hear in the game's reveal trailer above, Studio Midgar has called in Nier and Nier Automata singer Emi Evans, as well as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> and Xenogears composer Yasunori Mitsuda, plus <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-3">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a> composer Mariam Abounnasr.
</p>
<p>
Edge of Memories is being designed as an action RPG, with real-time combat focused on chaining combos across the game's plague-ridden new continent of Avaris. Today's teaser ends with the game's main character looking like she can draw power from the plague too - intriguing!
</p>
<p>The game's Kickstarter-funded predecessor Edge of Eternity launched on PC back in 2021 to a decent if not overly-enamoured response. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indie-jrpg-edge-of-eternity-headed-to-consoles-next-year">console version turned up in 2022</a>, including a cloud version for Switch. I wonder if we'll see <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> port announced down the line?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The next booster pack for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> has leaked.</p>
<p>As spotted by CentroLeaks, a video of the new pack was uploaded early to the Pokémon TikTok channel.</p>
<p>The new pack (<strong>spoiler warning!</strong>) will be called Triumphant Light and focus on the Mythical Pokémon Arceus.</p>

<p>As tomorrow, 27th January, is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-presents-broadcast-announced-for-next-week">Pokémon Presents stream</a>, presumably we'll find out more about the Triumphant Light booster pack then.

            <p>
If your Sims 4 nights have been lacking a certain criminal <em>frisson</em> for the last 11 years, things are about to get a whole lot more exciting. Over a decade after its release, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> has finally added the series' iconic burglar as part of its latest free update.
</p>
<p>
The burglar was, of course, a perpetual looming menace across the first three Sims games, threatening to slip onto your lot in the dead of night - accompanied by a dramatic musical sting - in order to steal your valuables and scarper. Assuming the police didn't get there first.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately for fans of late night thievery and stripy knitwear, burglars didn't make the cut when The Sims 4 launched in 2014. But now, more than a decade of nocturnal peace is set to be shattered as the series <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-marking-series-25th-anniversary-with-huge-free-update-adding-70-new-items">celebrates its 25th anniversary</a>.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/sims-4-burglar.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/burglar-dev-diary">detailed in EA's announcement</a>, The Sims 4's burglar - now named Robin Banks - behaves similarly to her earlier counterparts. She'll sneak into homes after dark when residents are asleep, shoving items into her sack before making her escape. Her stealing spree can potentially be stopped, however, if Sims call the police before she flees into the night.
</p>
<p>
The purchasable burglar alarm is back too, guaranteeing the police will arrive in time to make an arrest - and providing other safeguards if Sims are handy enough to install them. A suitably equipped alarm can, for instance, zap a passing burglar, causing her to drop her stolen goods. Additionally, bold (and ideally gym-fit) Sims can take Robin on in a one-on-one fight.

<p>
EA says it's added a total of 37 player-directed interactions and 50 unique reactions relating to the burglar across The Sims 4's base game and 17 different packs. Depending what expansions you own, dogs can chase burglars out of the house, werewolves can intimidate them into leaving, spellcasters can deter them with magic, and Servos can zap them into place. Scientists, meanwhile, can immobilise them with a Freeze Ray, and vampires might have a late night snack.
</p>
<p>
If all that sounds a bit much, EA notes burglar visits will be rare by default. However, those wanting to increase the frequency of break-ins can activate the Heist Havoc Lot Challenge, causing burglars to turn up more often and potentially making alarms go on the blink.
</p>
<p>
The burglar is available now as part of The Sims 4's latest free base game update. This paves the way for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4s-next-expansion-lets-you-run-your-own-pet-cafe-laundrette-or-tattoo-parlour">upcoming Businesses &amp; Hobbies Expansion Pack</a> - letting players run everything from a pet cafe to a tattoo parlour - which launches next Thursday, 6th March.
</p>
<p>
All this comes as The Sims series celebrates its quarter-century anniversary with a range of events, including (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-1-and-2-patch-fixes-numerous-issues-following-farcical-re-release">somewhat wobbly</a>) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-1-2-re-releases-are-out-now-and-you-can-get-both-for-25">remasters of The Sims and The Sims 2</a>.
