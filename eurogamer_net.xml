            <p>
Parents shouldn't let their children play Roblox if they are worried about their kids' safety in-game, Roblox boss Dave Baszucki has said.
</p>
<p>
Roblox, the gaming and social platform with 80 million daily users, has frequently been criticised for its lax player safety - particularly as the bulk of its audience is under 18. 
</p>
<p>
"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox," <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yrjkl7dd6o">Baszucki told BBC News in a new interview</a>. "That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-adding-further-parental-controls-as-its-belated-push-to-improve-child-safety-continues">Roblox made a flurry of changes in late 2024 designed to improve child safety</a> with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-announces-policy-changes-for-pre-teen-users-amid-ongoing-accusations-of-child-safety-failures">the addition of basic parental control features</a>, such as the ability to set playtime limits, remotely manage a child's account and view a child's friend list.
</p>
<p>
Parental access is now required for children to access some in-game chat features, and children under 13 have been blocked from social hangout games due to "user behaviour that can potentially pose a risk". 
</p>
<p>
The changes came a month after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/damning-roblox-report-claims-company-inflates-player-numbers-to-investors-by-as-much-as-42">a damning report was published detailing the ongoing safety issues for children in-game</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-exploiting-young-game-developers-new-investigation-reports">had been regularly highlighted for years</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many," Baszucki told BBC News today. 
</p>
<p>
"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">In 2013, Roblox reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation to US authorities</a>, and responded to over 1300 requests from authorities for detail on predatory players. Over the last six years, at least two dozen people have been arrested in the US for abusing victims met via Roblox.
</p>
<p>
During the interview, BBC News showed Baszucki evidence of how easy it was to still set up accounts to chat between a user who was a minor and adults, as well as the titles of Roblox experiences recommended to an account of an 11-year-old, including "Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP" and "Special Forces Simulator".
</p>
<p>
"One thing that's really important for the way we do things here, is it's not just on the title of the experience, it's literally on the content of the experience as well," Baszucki said in response.
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-shares-drop-by-20-as-platform-misses-target-active-users">Roblox shares dropped by 20 percent</a> after the platform's reported daily active users fell short of expectations, something the company blamed on a recent ban of the platform in Türkiye over child safety concerns.

Ubisoft has some good news for Steam Deck owners looking to sink into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> later this month: after previously saying the game wouldn't be compatible with Valve's gaming handheld, it's now done a bit of a U-turn.
</p>
<p>
Back in February, as part of a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4XbPPtFyQEtIMWrA9xVDmZ/assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa">lengthy tech Q&amp;A</a>, Ubisoft revealed Assassin's Creed Shadows would "not be compatible with Steam Deck [at launch], due to the fact it is below our minimum specs for PC." That, then, suggested it wasn't just a case of Shadows failing to tick some boxes to pass Valve's verification process, but rather that it simply wouldn't run well at all.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, with Assassin's Creed Shadows' release just weeks away, Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1j9og39/assassins_creed_shadows_we_are_happy_to_say_that/">shared an update for Steam Deck users</a> - confirming Valve's device will, in fact, be supported at launch. The publisher didn't explain what had led to the change, but presumably - hopefully - it's managed to eke out a few performance gains in the time since its original announcement.

<p>
Ubisoft adds it's still awaiting the results of Valve's verification process, so doesn't currently know which of Steam Deck's compatibility classifications Assassin's Creed Shadows will receive (Valve <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/verified">grades games</a> as either Verified, Playable, Unsupported, or Unknown on the device) . "More info to come soon," its message concludes.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (including Steam Deck!) on 20th March, and will also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-details-ps5-pro-enhancements-including-extended-raytracing">receive a range of PS5 Pro enhancements</a>. And if you're looking for more granular release information, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-global-launch-times-detailed-pre-load-live-now-on-xbox">global launch times have also been revealed.</a> As for the game itself, it's "shaping up to be one of the most promising [series entries] so far", as Eurogamer's Katharine Castle <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">wrote earlier this year</a>.

            <p>
Bethesda's long-rumoured The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake is reportedly due to be formally unveiled very soon, with signs pointing to a possible release before June.
</p>
<p>
Word of an Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake first surfaced in 2023, when a former employee of Chinese studio Virtuos posted to Reddit claiming it was in the works. And while references to an Oblivion <em>remaster</em> were later spotted in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-bethesda-roadmap-reveals-unannounced-releases-including-dishonored-3">leaked internal Microsoft document from 2020</a>, more talk of a remake emerged earlier this year - again from a former Virtuous employee.
</p>
<p>
But despite all this chatter, Bethesda's lips have remained firmly sealed. That might be about to change, however, according to multiple reports. NatetheHate - an insider with a strong track record of accurate Microsoft leaks - took to social media to <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1899604247978840406">say they expect an official announcement</a> "either this month or next month."

<p>
Additionally, they offered a revised release window, having previously claimed the Oblivion remake would launch this June. "[It's] likely to be sooner than the original June target," they wrote, "but still working to get details on an updated release date." Lending further credence to NatetheHate's claims, VGC says it's <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bethesdas-oblivion-unreal-engine-5-remake-could-be-releasing-sooner-than-you-think/">corroborated the report</a> with its own sources, adding it's heard the game may even release as early as next month.
</p>
<p>
As to what players can expect, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-details-surface-as-leaker-suggests-its-coming-in-june">most recent Virtuous leak</a> called it a"fully remade" version of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, developed in Unreal 5. It's also said to features various system overhauls, including reworked stamina, sneaking, blocking, archery, hit reaction, and HUD. And with Oblivion's birthday looming - it originally released on 20th March 2006 - now seem like a good moment for Bethesda to finally revel its hand.

            <p>
There's a lot of buzz around <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">Inzoi</a>, the upcoming Sims-like from developer Krafton - partly because it's a promising new contender in a genre that's so far been dominated by a single series, and partly because it's a bit of a looker. And if you were wondering exactly what sort of PC you'll be needing in order to crank Inzoi up to the max, those details have now been revealed - alongside a video showing how the game'll look at different tiers.
</p>
<p>
Inzoi (or InZOI as Krafton would have it) is described as "complete community simulation" where "every character [acts] on their free will". It promises to give players the tools to "alter any aspect of their world to create unique stories and experiences", alongside the likes of jobs and "deep relationships through interactions". It's also leaning hard on the customisation side of things, showcasing remarkably detailed characters and elaborate homes.
</p>
<p>
Inevitably, its Unreal Engine 5 powered reality - which takes a far more photorealistic approach compared to something like The Sims - isn't going to run on any old potato. And Krafton has now revealed exactly what hardware players will need to have stuffed inside their gaming PCs if they want to play Inzoi at either Minimum, Medium, Recommended, or High settings without risking the chance of a weird smell and/or small house fire.
</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>
In fact, Krafton's gone a little further than that, <a href="https://playinzoi.com/en/news/8303">providing eight different preset options</a> giving players an easy way to choose between better graphics or better performance across its four hardware tiers. Even more handily, all this is accompanied by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFzk45yOjkY">video demonstrating the impact these various setting will have on the game</a>. And while the differences are certainly evident, Inzoi still looks to put on a decent show on lower-end hardware.

<p>
Inzoi initially comes to PC as an early access release - it'll be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/">available on Steam from 28th March</a> - and Krafton says it'll "continue working on optimisations to improve performance while finding ways to lower system requirements without compromising overall quality." 
</p>
<p>
"Our team is committed to enhancing the Inzoi experience for creators," it concludes. "We truly appreciate your patience and continued support, and we look forward to seeing you in early access." Oh, and in case you were wondering, yes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/want-to-know-what-inzois-woohoo-equivalent-will-be-like">Inzoi <em>does</em> have its own form of WooHoo</a>.
