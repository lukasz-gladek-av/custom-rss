            <p>Geralt, the hero of The Witcher series of games, nearly had a considerably different face. He actually did, briefly, but the game's community disliked it so much CD Projekt Red panicked and changed it back.</p>
<p>The problem? Anatomical correctness. The community didn't think Geralt was alien-looking or ugly enough.</p>
<p>The year was 2010 and CD Projekt Red was ready to debut its brand new Witcher game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings">The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</a>, to the world. A couple of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-unveils-the-witcher-2">leaked videos preceded the formal announcement</a> but when a clutch of screenshots was eventually released, it debuted a different looking Geralt to the one people were used to from The Witcher 1.</p>
<p>Whereas Geralt had previously had the proportions of a triangle, roughly, which angled to a point on his nose and didn't seem to involve a chin of any kind, he now had much easier-on-the-eye proportions and looked like an actual person. He was even, dare I say it, handsome. It simply wouldn't do.</p>
<p>Some of this was to be expected. The transition from Witcher 1 to Witcher 2 included a transition for the game's engine, moving from BioWare's Aurora engine, which once powered <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/neverwinter-nights">Neverwinter Nights</a>, to CD Projekt Red's internally made engine Redengine. A facial design that worked well in one engine wouldn't necessarily work in both.</p>

<p>"The problem was that The Witcher 1 was heavily stylised," CD Projekt Red art director Pawel Mielniczuk explained to me. "From an art point of view, it was a much simpler visual fidelity than was in The Witcher 2 and Witcher 3. It was based on this Aurora engine from Neverwinter Nights - low poly, you know - so the character looks great there but the face of Geralt in The Witcher 1 wasn't very anatomically correct. It was making a good impression.</p>
<p>"When we got to The Witcher 2, we had a better engine - larger budgets for polygons, more artists to sculpt nice faces, and we actually got better at making characters, already being a studio that released one game. And Geralt's [existing] face just did not match the style of the rest of the characters," he said. "It was not realistic human proportions."</p>
<p>The solution was clear: redesign Geralt's face. "Let's make Geralt from scratch - nobody will notice that," Mielniczuk said, and laughed at the memory. "So we made it at the very beginning of The Witcher 2 production and we released it with this first bunch of screenshots to see what the response was, and the response was horrible! Our community just smashed us on the forums - there were almost riots there."</p>

<p>Sadly I can't find those riots on those company forums now; 15 years of chatter has buried it. But Mielniczuk told me the comments there were to the effect of: "True Geralt: he's supposed to be ugly and inhuman!" CD Projekt Red backtracked as a result of the backlash, and it would take a further two years of tinkering, and testing and re-evaluating, to get Geralt's look right for the game. "And was a hybrid of The Witcher 1 Geralt and a real human," Mielniczuk said.</p>
<p>By the time <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> development came around, in around 2011-2012, the opportunity once again presented itself to tinker with Geralt's face, but this time the studio resisted. "With The Witcher 3, we actually used exactly the same model from Witcher 2, added more polygons, updated textures, but we did not touch it," Mielniczuk said.</p>

<p>That's not to say Mielniczuk didn't want to alter Geralt's face for the third game. He was the lead character artist on The Witcher 3. He hand-sculpted both Ciri and Yennefer's face, and he could see glaring issues with Geralt's. "If you look at the profile of Geralt: he has this incredible profile but the tip of his nose is a completely straight line from his forehead, kind of Greek proportions, and it was not fitting his face, so we wanted to fix that. But we did not," he said. "We made a decision, 'Okay, that's Geralt, he's recognisable, people are loving our character. We pass. We cannot make this mistake once again.'"</p>
<p>Which brings us around to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>, which is now in full production and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-of-town-that-was-definitely-doug-cockles-white-haired-monster-hunter-in-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer">we know will include Geralt to some degree</a>. The new game will also move the series to a new engine, Unreal Engine 5, so once again there's an opportunity for a Geralt-face redesign. Will CD Projekt Red take it?</p>

<p>"It's such a grounded character right now I would really not dare to touch it," Mielniczuk said. "And in general, it's a very successful character because his face is recognisable, probably also because of these features of inhuman proportions in the upper part of the body. So no, I wouldn't update anything, just textures, normal maps, adding more details on the face, make it realistic through the surfaces, but not through the anatomy and proportions."</p>
<p>But there is one thing that might tempt Mielniczuk to update Geralt's face, or rather one person, and that's Henry Cavill, the former star of The Witcher Netflix TV show. Mielniczuk is a big fan of his. "Henry was just perfect," he said. Then he added, laughing: "If I would do something to the face, I would be easily convinced to scan Henry and put him in The Witcher 4!"</p>
<p>I spoke to Pawel Mielniczuk as part of a series of interviews <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-worked-in-the-witcher-3-and-what-didnt-looking-back-on-a-landmark-rpg-with-cd-projekt-red">looking back on The Witcher 3, a decade on, through the eyes of the people who made it</a>.
