            <p>Chinese-speaking users accounted for 50 percent of Steam's playerbase last month.</p>
<p>Valve has released its latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/">Steam Hardware and Software Survey</a>, which revealed a 20.88 percent increase in Simplified Chinese-speaking users in February 2025, making up half of the entire userbase.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/steam-saw-chinese-users-spike-and-exceed-50-of-worldwide-playerbase-in-february-2025/">Automaton</a> noted, February usually brings an increase of Chinese users to Steam as it coincides with Chinese New Year holidays. However, this year's increase was significantly higher than usual - 2024 saw an equivalent increase of 7.26 percent.</p>

<p>English-speaking users are the next highest, accounting for an almost 24 percent proportion of the userbase. Similarly, the Christmas season usually results in a spike in proportion.</p>
<p>The success of Game Science's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> is likely a contributing factor to this increase in Chinese users. While its player numbers have dwindled since launch, it remains a huge success story and has the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-already-steams-most-played-single-player-game-of-all-time">second highest all-time concurrent player count on the platform</a>.</p>
<p>Another factor could be the demo for Mecha Break, a multiplayer mech shooter from Chinese developer Amazing Seasun Games that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfestmostplayed_feb_2025">dominated Steam Next Fest</a> - it reached a <a href="https://x.com/MechaBREAK/status/1897105111476003317">peak player count of over 300,000</a>.</p>
<p>Other contributing factors could be the ongoing success of NetEase's Marvel Rivals that saw its new season launch in this period, as well as the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> at the very end of the month that saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-propels-steam-to-highest-ever-player-count">Steam reach its highest ever concurrent player count</a>.</p>
<p>What's more, this upward trend in Chinese-speaking users is likely to continue. If Mecha Break's demo is anything to go by, its full release later this year will be huge.</p>
<p>Then there's the likes of the PlayStation-published Chinese action game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-soul-aside-launches-in-2025-nine-years-after-devil-may-cry-and-final-fantasy-15-inspired-action-games-reveal">Lost Soul Aside</a>, as well as another Chinese action game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-fresh-look-at-chinese-fantasy-soulslike-wuchang-fallen-feathers">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a> (not to be confused with Wukong), while the free-to-play <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fragpunk-console-launch-delayed-as-neteases-shooter-hits-pc-this-week">FragPunk</a> follows Marvel Rivals as NetEase's next big shooter.</p>
<p>It's clear that Chinese studios are thriving, and that's resulting in a surge of Steam users in the country.</p>
<p>Yet political relations between China and the US are causing friction in the industry. NetEase laid off a number of Marvel Rivals developers from its US team despite the game's success. Reportedly, further downsizing is yet to come, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">NetEase has denied such allegations</a>.</p>
<p>At the start of the year, Chinese conglomerate <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-labels-tencent-as-a-chinese-military-company">Tencent was labelled a military company by the US</a> - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-threatens-legal-proceedings-if-us-doesnt-overturn-decision-to-label-it-as-a-chinese-military-company">company threatened legal proceedings in response</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo has added two more Game Boy titles to its Switch Online subscription catalogue - and you can play them right now. 
</p>
<p>
1994 classic Donkey Kong is the star of the show here - the highly-regarded puzzle platformer that serves as a continuation of the classic DK arcade game, with elements of Donkey Kong Jr, and also the subsequent Mario vs Donkey Kong titles.
</p>
<p>
If you've never played it before, there's a fun surprise after the first four levels - which are the ones found in the original Donkey Kong arcade cabinet. It's safe to say the game is bigger than just those.

<p>
Also available today is Mario's Picross - which is, as you'd expect, Picross puzzles to colour in based on Mario and Mushroom Kingdom designs. Originally released for Game Boy in 1995, this was one of the earliest Picross games, and the first to the west.

            <p>
Frogwares' <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2?ref=checkout_rewards_page">Kickstarter campaign for The Sinking City 2</a> is now live, and has smashed through its crowdfunding target in less than a day - raising over £140K at the time or writing.
</p>
<p>
As part of its crowdfunding drive, Frogwares has shared new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sinking-city-2">The Sinking City 2</a> details - confirming the Lovecratian sequel to be a standalone story featuring new characters and locations. It's once again set in 1920s America, but instead of revisting Oakmont, players'll this time be exploring the flooded streets and crumbling buildings of Arkham itself.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sinking-city-2-will-pivot-to-a-horror-focus">previously revealed</a>, The Sinking City 2 - which is Frogwares' first Unreal Engine 5 game - marks a shift away from the deduction focus of its predecessor. It's a sequel firmly in survival horror territory, with combat and exploration said to be the core mechanics this time around - which is perhaps a gamble given combat has historically been Frogawares' achilles heel.

<p>
Investigation work <em>does</em> return, but now it's described as an "optional yet highly useful tool", that'll help players uncover secrets, gameplay bonuses, and lore. The Sinking City 2 is also set to feature a smaller map - explorable both on foot and by boat - that's aiming to provide a "better flow and concentration of things to discover".
</p>
<p>
You'll find a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2?ref=checkout_rewards_page">few more details on The Sinking City 2's Kickstarter page</a>, and there's a look at some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtyEOb2IBZQ">pre-alpha gameplay</a> in the trailer above.
</p>
<p>
Frogwares is aiming to release The Sinking City 2 on  PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S later this year. And if you want to get involved with its crowdfunding campaign - which it says will help "essentially guarantee our team the time and resources needed to explore" new features - there's still 29 days left before things come to a close.
</p>
<p>
The Ukraine-based Frogwares successfully took a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frogwares-remaking-sherlock-holmes-and-cthulhu-crossover-the-awakened">similar crowdfunding approach with 2023's Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened,</a> as  it continued to adjust to life during Russia's ongoing invasion. "This financial safety net proved invaluable to us," the studio writes in its latest Kickstarter campaign, "so we need to do the same now with The Sinking City 2 as this game is vastly bigger and more complex."
