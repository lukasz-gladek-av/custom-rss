            <p>
Cast your mind back, and you might recall <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a>'s eventual, near-decade-long journey to release. Well, a former exec overseeing the project has now spoken a little more on its troubled development, claiming its scrapped first iteration would have "killed the franchise".
</p>
<p>
Dead Island 2 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-2-announced">initially announced back in 2014</a>, with the expectation it would launch the following year. However, delays ensued and 2015 brought the news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-2-is-no-longer-being-made-by-yager">developer Yager had departed the project</a>, with studio boss Timo Ullmann saying its vision for the project "fell out of alignment" with publisher Deep Silver. Development then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-2-sumo-digital-sonic-racing">shifted to Sumo Digital</a> and finally to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/dambusterstudios">Dambuster Studios</a>, which released Dead Island 2 to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-2-review-its-still-2011-in-los-angeles">solid critical reception</a> in 2023.
</p>
<p>
Now though, as <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/it-would-have-killed-the-franchise-insights-into-the-scrapped-2014-version-of-dead-island-2">reported by GamesIndustry.biz</a>, former Deep Silver head of communications Martin Wein has shed a little more light on Dead Island 2's troubled journey during a panel at Develop:Brighton. Asked for an example of when marketing or player research had helped get a development team back on track after it had veered away from a design vision, Wein specifically cited Dead Island 2, highlighting it as an instance of when he and his team had caused an "eight-year product delay".
</p>
<p>
As recounted by Wein, Deep Silver had a "major milestone with the [then] development studio" shortly after its 2014 E3 reveal. "And boy, that game sucked... It had nothing to do with what [made] the original Dead Island [...] really fun. So we commissioned a play test and got horrific feedback." Wein later told GamesIndustry. biz, "the developer wanted to pursue their vision rather than follow player feedback", and when the game remained the same at the next milestone, the decision was made to find a new studio.
</p>
<p>
"Sometimes you have to make hard decisions," Wein continued during his panel appearance. "Because we could have, at that point, put out a shit game. It might have made some money, but it would have killed the franchise... I think at that point Deep Silver did the right thing, and Dead Island 2 was a commercial success in the end. Because they took that step, and they said that we need to make a game that fits for the player."
</p>
<p>
All of which resolves at least some of the early mystery around Dead Island 2's troubles. As to its quiet time at Sumo Digital, Wein shared nothing on that period of its development - but its strange saga did at least have a happy ending. When Dead Island 2 finally released in 2023, some nine years after its announcement, the gory zombie sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-2-shifts-1m-copies-in-its-first-weekend-of-release">successfully shifted 1m units in its first weekend of sales</a>, and was loitering somewhere around the 4m mark by February this year. Hopefully a third entry, should it ever happen, will have a smoother road to release.

        <p>It's "all about efficiency and profits".</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/candy-crush">Candy Crush</a> developer King is reportedly replacing laid off staff with AI tools they helped to build.</p>
<p>At the start of the month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">Microsoft announced around 9000 employees would be laid off</a>. This included roughly 200 staff from King.</p>
<p>Now, in a report from <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/">MobileGamer.biz</a>, sources stated they've spent the last few years building and training AI tools, which will now be replacing them.</p>
<p>"Most of level design has been wiped, which is crazy since they've spent months building tools to craft levels quicker," said one source from the company. "Now those AI tools are basically replacing the teams. Similarly the copywriting team is completely removing people since we now have AI tools that those individuals have been creating."</p>
<p>They added replacing people with AI tools was "absolutely disgusting", but the focus is "all about efficiency and profits even though the company is doing great overall".</p>
<p>"If we're introducing more feedback loops then it's crazy to remove the developers themselves, we need more hands and less leadership," they said.</p>
<p>Further, some programmers have been laid off for "arbitrary reasons", said the source, claiming staff may have been removed after expressing "dissatisfaction with the company or processes".</p>
<p>Another source described King's HR department as "an absolute shitshow and has been for years", adding it's an "extreme example of an HR department whose role it is to protect the company, not the staff".</p>
<p>Back at the Game Developer Conference in May 2023, King's chief technology officer Steve Collins described to Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-games-industrys-response-to-ai-reverence-and-rage">the ambition for King to pivot to an "AI-first company"</a>, after it acquired Swedish AI company Peltarion in 2022.</p>
<p>AI is a "tool" that's "in the hands of our level designers and our level testers, so they use that to augment what they're able to do in those spaces," said Collins. When asked if this might mean a shift from human workers to a reliance on AI, Collins replied: "I think we still have a large number of human beings, that's the thing! What we're trying to do is: how do we scale? How do we scale or create thousands of new levels?"</p>
<p>Discussing further, Collins added: "The reality is, this sort of technology can be leveraged. What it does is, it can move people up the stack, it can move people to the point where they're being more creative, they have more agency to bring to the content creation pipeline or whatever."</p>
<p>Now, it appears to have moved people out of the company.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Microsoft for comment on this report and the claims staff will be replaced by AI.</p>
<p>ZeniMax Online Studios was also impacted by layoffs at Microsoft. Now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenimax-online-studios-union-speaks-out-on-microsoft-layoffs-states-those-impacted-will-depart-with-dignity">its union has spoken out</a>, stating those impacted will "depart with dignity".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/candy-crush-developer-king-reportedly-replacing-laid-off-staff-with-ai-tools-they-helped-to-build]]></content:encoded>
