            <p>
In The Valley of the Gods, the promising but now permanently "on hold" adventure from the team behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/firewatch">Firewatch</a>, had some eye-popping water technology. 
</p>
<p>
Matthew Wilde, who worked on Firewatch at Campo Santo before the team was absorbed into Valve six years ago, has now <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skilful.bsky.social/post/3lakopz32k22x">shared</a> a fresh look at In The Valley of the Gods on social media, showing what could have been. 
</p>
<p>
"I do often tend to work on liquidy things," Wilde wrote. "This was the water test we did at Campo Santo pre Valve move." 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Matthew Wilde, the Valve developer behind the water shader for Counter-Strike 2, has shared a rare gameplay footage. It shows the water technology that was tested for In The Valley of Gods before Valve acquired the company Campo Santo. Team shelved the game not so long after… <a href="https://t.co/wIs6Im8KYx">pic.twitter.com/wIs6Im8KYx</a></p>— ‎Gabe Follower (@gabefollower) <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1855941378301141312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 11, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
There is, sadly, absolutely no suggestion we'll see In the Valley of the Gods anytime soon. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firewatch-review">Firewatch was excellent</a>, and Campo Santo's follow-up - which would have followed a budding filmmaker as she explored 1920s Egypt in search of archeological secrets - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firewatch-developer-reveals-next-game-in-the-valley-of-the-gods">looked hugely promising</a>. 
</p>
<p>
But, in 2019, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-acquires-firewatch-developer-campo-santo">Valve and the potential to work on Half-Life: Alyx came calling</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firewatch-devs-egyptian-adventure-in-the-valley-of-gods-officially-on-hold-at-valve">In The Valley of the Gods was later confirmed to have been shelved indefinitely</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Wilde's reference to working on "liquidy things" is a reference to some of his other work since, such as the impressive water shader technology in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a> that lets you slosh around bottles of beer, as well as the water technology in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>. 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Spent a good chunk of lock-down doing this important work. Boozy liquid shader, now available in the latest update for Half-Life: Alyx <a href="https://t.co/Iw9h98pmEg">pic.twitter.com/Iw9h98pmEg</a></p>— Matthew Wilde (@skilful) <a href="https://twitter.com/skilful/status/1265875309980643329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2020</a></blockquote></div>

What's next for Wilde and his former Campo Santo colleagues? Well, there's rumblings that there's more from Valve's most famous series on the horizon. Is it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer">finally time for Half-Life 3</a>?

We probably won't flag up when every single game's soundtrack comes to Nintendo Music, but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wii-sports">Wii Sports</a> is a bit of a favourite round these parts. 
</p>
<p>
So yes, 30 music tracks from Nintendo's seminal Wii launch title are now part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-music-app-sees-mario-maker-take-on-spotify-and-youtube-playlists">Nintendo Music</a>, the company's new soundtrack app which launched last month, as a fresh perk for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. 
</p>
<p>
More than 82 million people owned a copy of Wii Sports and millions more - friends, siblings, grandparents - played its simple but brilliant motion-controlled takes on tennis, golf and bowling. Also baseball and boxing, but they weren't as good.

<p>
These tunes are ingrained in my memory from countless evening sessions playing nine holes of Wii Golf at uni or short matches of Wii Tennis on breaks in the staff room at my student job. There's something about Wii Sports which still stands unmatched - I still dig out the original Wii Sports to play in multiplayer sessions today.
</p><p>
Here's the full list of Wii Sports tracks now included in Nintendo Music. Altogether, these only amount to 18 minutes of music, but many of these classics can be extended to versions lasting up to 60 minutes each for your continued audio pleasure.
