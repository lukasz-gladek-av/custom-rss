Nintendo will sell the upcoming paid version of its smartphone Animal Crossing app for £18 ($20) after the closure of its current free-to-play edition next month.
</p>
<p>
However, to start with, an introductory offer will see <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-pocket-camp">Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</a> Complete sold for half price - £9 ($10) - for its first two months.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-is-closing-down-but-a-premium-version-with-no-in-app-purchases-is-on-the-way">Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp's current free-to-play version shuts down on 28th November</a>, Nintendo announced this summer, after seven years of cosy campsite building and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animal-crossing-pocket-camps-latest-event-left-fans-in-despair">the selling of now-removed grubby gacha-style loot boxes</a>, in-game currency and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-details-animal-crossing-pocket-camps-two-new-subscription-plans">various subscriptions</a>.

<p>
Nintendo will launch Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete shortly afterwards, on 3rd December, which offers no in-game purchases and the ability to play offline. Its half-price launch offer will run until 31st January next year.
</p>
<p>
In a press release on the new version, Nintendo states that players will be able to "retain access to a majority of the items and events" from Pocket Camp's free-to-play version, with account progress transferrable - though only until 2nd June 2025. 
</p><p>
Leaf Tickets, Tom Nook's favourite currency for selling you premium items, the Pocket Camp Club subscription service and the ability to play with friends via online communication (such as selling items via a market box, and exchanging gifts) are all being discontinued.
</p>
<p>
New features for the Complete version include the fresh Whistle Pass location, where "friends and neighbours can enjoy activities including in-game live music performances". Huh! Is KK Slider going to introduce Eminem and Snoop Dogg, a la <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>? It seems unlikely.
</p>
<p>
Events with Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete will rotate on a four-year cycle, Nintendo said in a detailed video on the new version, above, meaning anyone hoping to collect all the app's stuff will be kept busy until 2028. With a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> version of Animal Crossing still likely years away - are you tempted to give Pocket Camp Complete a go?
</p>
<p>Philippa Warr recently recounted her own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-totally-reasonable-reaction-to-nintendos-email-about-the-end-of-animal-crossing-pocket-camp">totally reasonable reaction to Nintendo's email about the end of Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</a>, as a long-term fan who kept at the game for years longer than me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outlast-trials">The Outlast Trials</a> developer Red Barrels has shared an updated roadmap following a <a href="https://redbarrelsgames.com/news/an-important-message-from-the-red-barrels-team/">"cyber incident"</a> that caused a "significant "hit" on production. It confirms a new lobby game, a fresh MK-Challenge, and a new Geister event are all on the way.</p>
<p>The team said it was "working hard" to deliver "fresh content" to keep Murkoff fans happy throughout the holidays, but stopped short of sharing a definitive release date for the second major update to the chaotic cooperative horror. The last one dropped in July, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outlast-trials-newest-villain-is-a-freakish-big-baby-obsessed-with-his-pacifier">introducing new enemy Franco "II Bambino" Barbi</a>.</p>

<p>To tide us over, Red Barrels says The Outlast Trials Geister event will once again come to the Sinyala facility later this week - expect a "new unexpected twist!" - whilst Season 2's new map, catalogue, MK-Challenges, Rig, enemy NPC, and storylines will follow, along with a new festive event, Winter Kills.</p>

</span></p><p>"Following the recent cyber incident, our team has been focused on developing Season 2, the new features that will come with it, as well as some new aspects of the game coming next year," the team explained.</p>
<p>"We genuinely appreciate our community's patience and understanding during this challenging time. We’re working hard to deliver fresh content for everyone to enjoy throughout the holidays!"</p>
<p>Red Barrels says the security issue it encountered earlier this month has been investigated, and the exploit "contained". It says no players' data has been impacted by the event, but acknowledged that its internal IT systems were compromised and a third-party had accessed "some of its data".</p><p>"The Outlast Trials is excessive and frantically enjoyable - but can occasionally tip over into frustration more than fear," I wrote when I reviewed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outlast-trials-review-a-unique-obscene-spin-on-the-horror-staple">The Outlast Trials</a> back when it was released in early access last year, awarding it three out of five stars.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Dont Nod's studio creative director has hit out at "hateful" comments about Deck Nine's take on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> franchise.</p>
<p>Talking on X/Twitter, Michel Koch said that whilst he hadn't played the game yet and "have no idea where [Deck Nine] are taking the story", "nothing justifies hating on people".</p>

<p>"Since the release of [<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>] I've seen a lot of tension and hateful messages against Deck Nine devs," Koch said.</p> <div>

<p>"I didn't play the game yet, and I have no idea where they are taking the story. But what I know is that nothing justifies hating on people for how they wrote their game!</p>
<p>"You can be disappointed, you can want other narratives for those characters you love, or different stories… but ultimately creation is hard and very subjective and if [Double Exposure's] story does not please you, it does not erase what you imagined."</p>
<p>When challenged by someone insisting it should be okay for players to feedback "healthy criticism", Koch agreed that whilst "constructive criticism and civil disagreement is good", he was specifically "talking of violent messages and harassment I've seen".</p>
