            <p>In November last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-is-officially-getting-a-tv-adaptation-at-amazon">Amazon officially announced a Mass Effect TV show</a> is in development. Now, voice actor Jennifer Hale told Eurogamer she'd love to be part of it and believes the original cast should be involved too.</p>
<p>"You will always get a yes vote from me on Shepard coming back in any form," said Hale. "That was such a gift, and it's a gift I will always be extremely joyful to receive."</p>
<p>Of course, developing such a choice-driven narrative into a singular TV series would have consequences. For starters, would Shepard be male or female?</p>

<p>"I never suppose to tell creators what to do," said Hale. "The only thing I must say about that TV series is I want to play! Any capacity, I will be there with bells on!"</p>
<p>Hale confirmed she'd prefer FemShep to be canon in the show (obviously!), but she's also keen for the rest of the game's cast to join in some capacity.</p>
<p>"I think they'd be really smart to pull as much of the original cast into the show in cameos and Easter eggs and recurring and regular [roles] as possible," she said. "I think that would be an absolutely genius move."</p><p>She continued: "The voice acting community are some of the most brilliant performers I've ever met… they're the most gifted, hard working, adept, skilled people I've ever met in my life in the acting field. So I'm ready for the smart production company that stops overlooking that gold mine. I fully volunteer to be on the show."</p>
<p>What's more, there's a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> game in development that's set to continue the story of the original trilogy, with at least <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-development-proceeding-very-well-as-bioware-issues-fresh-tease">one fan-favourite character returning</a>. But would Hale like to see Shepard also return?</p>
<p>"I have no idea [what to expect]," she said, "except I'd love to be there. That's all I'm gonna say. Hey, team, hey, team, wherever you are in any capacity, I'd love to be there!"</p>
<p>Over the weekend, BioWare project director Michael Gamble responded to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-fans-think-this-official-image-hints-that-paragonrenegade-system-is-absolutely-returning">discussion of the Paragon/Renegade morality system</a>, with many fans speculating it will return in the next game.</p>
<p>For more from Jennifer Hale, Eurogamer discussed with her the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why">SAG-AFTRA strike and risk of AI to performers</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> creator Ken Levine wanted developer Irrational Games to continue, and didn't expect publisher Take-Two to shut it down.</p>
<p>In 2014 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ken-levine-steps-away-from-bioshock-to-create-something-new">Levine announced he was "winding down" the studio</a> to focus on a "different kind of game", meaning all but 15 Irrational employees were laid off.</p>
<p>Now, in an interview with Edge Magazine (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/bioshock-infinite-may-not-have-been-the-thing-i-wanted-but-that-doesnt-necessarily-mean-it-wasnt-the-thing-the-audience-wanted-ken-levine-talks-edge-through-his-collected-works/">GamesRadar</a>), Levine has stated his intention was for Irrational to continue but the decision to close was "made at a corporate level".</p>

<p>Levine discussed his time at Irrational following the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a> and how this led to him parting ways with the studio.</p>
<p>"The closure of Irrational was complicated," he said. "I felt out of my depth in the role. You're this creative person, and all of a sudden, as your vision increases of what you want to do, you have to become a manager, in a way that you don't necessarily have any training or skill in. My mental health was a mess during Infinite. I was stressed out, a lot of personal things were going on in my life at the time, and then my parents both died. I just couldn't do it any more, and I didn't think I had the team's confidence."</p>
<p>That's when he left, leaving the studio in the hands of Take-Two.</p>
<p>"So my intention was to go and say, 'Look, I just need to go start a new thing, and Irrational should continue'," he said. "That's why I didn't maintain the name Irrational. I thought they were going to continue. But it wasn't my company - I sold the company, so I worked for Take-Two, and the studio was theirs.</p><p>"The decision was made at a corporate level that they didn't think they should continue with the studio as a going concern. My feeling was that it probably would have made sense. Take-Two did a BioShock remaster - that would have been a good title for Irrational to get their head around, build a new creative director structure, and then build off of that once they had the confidence to do the next BioShock game. I don't think I was in any state to be a good leader for the team."</p>
<p>Levine described trying to make the studio closure "the least painful layoff we could possibly do", but he didn't feel comfortable leading the team when his next project would have a long period of research and development. "The problem is - and you see this problem with big studios - what do you do with 300 people when you're going to have a multiple-year R&amp;D project?" he said.</p>
<p>Still, a "good chunk" of laid off developers returned to work on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-bioshock-developer-ramping-up">yet-to-be-revealed next BioShock game</a>.</p>
<p>Levine, meanwhile, will this year release Judas with his new studio Ghost Story Games, which he previously described as being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-finally-explains-judas-narrative-lego-concept">built from "narrative Lego"</a>.</p>
<p>Levine also discussed with Edge the development of BioShock Infinite, which he pushed to make more action-oriented. That led to the Sky-Lines - something he would have developed further in a potential sequel.</p>
<p>"The problem was that the Sky-Lines were so expensive to build that we couldn't build enough space to support the feature," he said. "The team did a great job of bringing that feature to life - there was just not enough of it in the game for it to really land.</p><p>"If we had done a sequel to Infinite, I think I would have spent more time on that. That thing was built on Unreal Engine 3, which is not an outdoor engine. Sky-Lines were a lot of spit and chewing gum and prayers. Players would be surprised how much of games are put together with spit and chewing gum - even the best ones that have worked really well."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levines-judas-glimpsed-again">Judas was last seen at Sony's PlayStation State of Play this time last year</a> and is yet to receive a firm release date beyond 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Disastrous fires burning across multiple districts of Los Angeles have shut down production across Hollywood, impacting the filming of Fallout season 2 and a raft of other projects.
</p>
<p>
Five people have so far been confirmed to have died and more than 130,000 have been evacuated as the city's worst ever wildfires continue to spread.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c5y81zyp1ext">BBC News</a> reported today that the famous Sunset Boulevard now lies "in ruins", as flames approach the city's iconic Hollywood sign.
</p>
<p>
Last night, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/la-fires-halt-production-fallout-greys-anatomy-1236269978/">Variety</a> reported on the impact of the fires on LA's production industry, with all major studios suspending work. 
</p>
<p>
Amazon's Fallout season 2 had been due to film within the Santa Clarita area this week.
</p>
<p>
NBCUniversal, CBS, Disney and Warner Bros. have also shut down their studios, impacting the filming of other shows such as Hacks, Ted, Suits: LA, NCIS, Grey's Anatomy and the Jimmy Kimmel Live show.
</p>
<p>
While in most cases there is no immediate threat to the studios themselves, the LA Fire Department has revoked all filming permits due to air quality being deemed dangerous to health, and the need to keep roads open for emergency vehicles. 
</p>
<p>
This week's disaster has prompted criticism of LA's mayor Karen Bass, who recent cut the city's fire department budget, and renewed calls for a greater focus on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-were-turning-our-attention-to-gaming-and-the-climate-crisis">impacts of climate change</a>.
</p>
<p>
Production on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-filming-begins-a-lot-sooner-than-expected">Fallout's second season began in November</a>, and was due to resume this week after a filming break over Christmas. 
</p>
<p>
Fallout's first season was a huge hit when it aired last year, with more than 65 million viewers in its first 16 days - Amazon's second-biggest launch ever, behind The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. A week after its debut, Amazon quickly announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">the series would return for more episodes</a>.

            <p>
The ongoing deluge of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> leaks continues today with purported retail listings for Switch 2 MicroSD Express cards, a report that Nintendo's new console won't be compatible with the Switch 1 dock, and speculation over the new handheld's mysterious optical sensor.
</p>
<p>
Let's begin with those MicroSD Express listings, which look to be have been spotted by a GameStop employee and posted to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1hx0wge/switch_2_skus_found_in_system_today/">reddit</a>. These include Switch 2-branded MicroSD Express card variants in the already-existing <a href="https://zdcs.link/QORwmO">256GB</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5YLvk">512GB</a> sizes, which sell for around £40 and £50 respectively. 
</p>
<p>
SD Express is a newer standard for SD cards with much faster transfer speeds, enabling performance not dissimilar to SSDs. If the Switch 2 is indeed adopting this standard, it'll be interesting to see how the console performs with multiplatform games versus current gen consoles with SSD memory.
</p>
<p>
Moving on to word of compatibility with the Switch 1 dock, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-didnt-expect-this-much-media-attention-we-saw-genkis-ces-nintendo-switch-2-mockup-heres-what-they-had-to-say">IGN</a> has been told by Switch 2 accessories manufacturer Genki that Nintendo's new console won't fit the older base.
</p>
<p>
While the Switch 2 itself can physically fit within the Switch 1 dock, "indentations" in its design have been added to ensure users don't actually plug it in. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">The Verge</a> has been told by Genki CEO Eddie Tsai that the Switch 2's mysterious new optical sensor - located on its Joy-Con - could offer mouse-like functionality when paired with another attachment. The concept sounds similar to Lenovo's Legion Go handheld, which also features Joy-Con like controllers.
</p>
<p>
When paired with a base, the Legion Go controllers can stand upright and act like a vertically-aligned mouse - almost akin to a joystick. 
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>The Lenovo Legion Go, with vertical Joy-Con-style controller, right. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Lenovo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Nintendo has so far kept schtum on all of its Switch 2 plans, other than stating the new console will be backwards compatible with Switch 1 games and will be fully unveiled before 31st March. 
</p>
<p>
The company has not responded to comment on the now-rampant Switch 2 leaks - many of which have been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-leaks-turn-into-deluge-as-dummy-units-shown-at-ces">fuelled by third-party accessory manufacturers who claim to have access to the console's final design</a>.

            <p>Marvel Rivals Season 1 launches later this week and will bring significant balance changes.</p>
<p>The online hero shooter has been in Season 0 since its release last month, and despite a perceived dominance of certain characters, NetEase's analysis reveals "significant shifts in team compositions" and "a vibrant diversity of lineups".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250108/41548_1205103.html">patch notes</a> continue: "However, as the skill level escalates, compositions centered around double shields and ranged have displayed considerable prowess. Despite this, players have continuously honed and experimented with new compositions and strategies, further enriching the battlefield."</p>

<p>As such, Season 1 will bring various balance changes to ensure a "richer, more engaging, and diverse" experience, although there will be no extensive changes to Team-Up abilities - redesigns and adjustments will arrive in Season 2.</p>
<p>The new season brings nerfs to some particularly dominant characters: Hulk's Indestructible Guard shield value has been reduced; Hawkeye's medium-long range damage has been decreased; and Hela has had her base health reduced.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, Black Widow has been buffed with increased range of her ultimate ability, Namor's egg-throwing will be more accurate, and Storm has received an overall increase to her damage capability.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, NetEase has released a <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/heroes_data/">Hero Hot List</a> to show the most frequently chosen heroes across PC and console in both Quickplay and Competitive modes.</p>
<p>In Quickplay, Jeff the Land Shark tops both lists surprising nobody - he was even the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-winter-celebration-features-splatoon-esque-arcade-mode-starring-jeff-the-land-shark">star of a Splatoon-style arcade mode over Christmas</a>.</p>
<p>In Competitive mode, Luna Snow is top for PC players while Cloak &amp; Dagger is top for console players. Black Widow and Storm are the least popular, hence the incoming buffs.</p>
<p>Season 1 will be released on Friday, 10th January.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-fantastic-four-arrive-in-marvel-rivals-this-week-as-part-of-vampiric-first-season">new season will bring the Fantastic Four as playable heroes</a>, although players are concerned the design of the Invisible Woman (Sue Storm) is too similar to Dagger, making them hard to tell apart in the heat of battle. Skins will likely be used to make them stand out.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> has submitted a lengthy defence in response to lawsuits filed last year in which the families of those killed in the 2022 Uvalde school shooting accused the publisher of "grooming" the 18-year-old perpetrator through Call of Dury.
</p>
<p>
19 children and two teachers were killed in the attack on Robb Elementary School in May 2022, while 17 others were injured. Families of those killed during the tragedy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uvalde-school-shooting-victims-sue-activision-claiming-its-the-most-prolific-marketer-of-weapons-in-the-us">later filed lawsuits in Texas and California</a> against Activision (after it emerged the shooter had played Call of Duty), alongside Instagram owner Meta and gun manufacturer Daniel Defense.
</p>
<p>
"This three-headed monster," the lawsuit alleged, "knowingly exposed [the perpetrator] to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as a tool to solve his problems and trained him to use it." At the time of last May's filing, Activision called the shooting "horrendous and heartbreaking", but noted "millions of people around the world enjoy video games without turning to horrific acts".
</p>
<p>
Now though, as reported by journalist Stephen Totilo in his <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">Game File newsletter</a>, Activision has formally submitted its initial defence, spanning nearly 150 pages of legal documentation filed last December. In a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/813228593/Activision-s-direct-legal-reply-to-the-Uvalde-families-lawsuit-via-Game-File">six-page direct response to the California lawsuit</a>, the publisher has denied "each and every allegation contained in the Complaint", claiming, among other things, a lack of causation between Call of Duty and the shooting. Totilo notes the publisher has also asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit on the basis of California's anti-SLAPP laws, which are designed to prevent the abuse of the legal system against a defendant's free speech.
</p><p>
"Call of Duty tells complex stories that explore the real-world combat scenarios that soldiers face in modern warfare," Activision wrote in a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/813227428/Activision-s-defense-in-Call-of-Duty-Uvalde-lawsuit-via-Game-File">separate 35-page filing</a>. "There can be no doubt Call of Duty is expressive and fully protected by the First Amendment... By bringing a laundry list of causes of action against Activision premised on allegedly dangerous 'hyper-realistic content' in the Call of Duty video games played by the perpetrator who committed heinous acts of violence, the Complaint runs headfirst into this overriding constitutional principle."
</p>
<p>
Activision's submissions also include a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/813230017/Declaration-of-Matthew-Thomas-Payne-in-Mata-et-al-vs-Meta-Activision-Microsoft-via-Game-File">35-page declaration from Notre Dame media studies professor Matthew Thomas Payne</a>, arguing the Call of Duty series "flows from the same military realism tradition that has been explored for decades in critically acclaimed war movies and television shows" - and is thus far from the "training camp for mass shooters" in which "teenage boys learn to kill with frightening skill and ease" described in the Uvalde families' lawsuit.
</p>
<p>
The publisher's defence is also supported by a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/813229303/Call-of-Duty-s-chief-Patrick-Kelly-s-declaration-for-Mata-vs-Activision-via-Game-File">38-page submission from Call of Duty head of creative Patrick Kelly</a>, which goes into significant detail regarding the design and creation of the series. This is the same document that revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-cost-an-eye-popping-700m-to-make">Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War's eye-popping $700m budget</a>, and includes a wealth of information Activision's lawyers could potentially use to counter the various claims made in the Uvalde families' legal filing.
</p>
<p>
For instance, while the claimant's suit alleges the Uvalde shooter learned about the gun he used from the loading screen of 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Kelly highlights two key points. Firstly, he says the generic assault rifle depicted in the image had been deliberately anonymised to ensure it did not feature identifiers that could link it to any particular firearm manufacturer. Secondly, he notes that by the time the perpetrator played the game in November 2021, the loading screen had been changed and would likely not have been seen.
</p><p>
There's plenty more detail in Activision's submitted documentation, and Totilo has a <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/activision-uvalde-call-of-duty-defense">considerably expanded breakdown of the publisher's arguments</a> in his paywalled newsletter. The Uvalde families have until late February to respond to Activision's filings, and the publisher can then reply in April. As Totilo notes, if the case goes to trial, it likely won't be for a long time.
