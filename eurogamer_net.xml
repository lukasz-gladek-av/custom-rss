            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has agreed to halt all promotion and public testing of Light of Motiram - the post-apocalyptic open-world survival game Sony previously accused of being a "slavish clone" of PlayStation's Horizon series in a lawsuit - as the two companies battle it out in court.
</p>
<p>
Light of Motiram, developed by Tencent's Polaris Quest studio, emerged at the end of last year, and its accompanying images - featuring mechanised animal-like creatures and very Aloy like key character art - immediately <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-open-world-survival-game-looks-like-a-blatant-horizon-rip-off-with-added-palworld-elements">drew comparisons with Horizon</a>. And Sony agreed, mounting legal action against Tencent, who it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">accused of copyright and trademark infringement</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since then, we've had a bit of back-and-forth - Tencent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-responds-to-sony-lawsuit-against-slavish-horizon-clone-stating-its-claims-of-originality-are-startling">accused Sony</a> of seeking an "impermissible monopoly on genre conventions", a claim Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-fires-back-at-tencents-nonsense-defence-for-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">called "nonsense"</a> - and Tencent even went as far as to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-quietly-updates-slavish-horizon-clone-light-of-motirams-steam-page">quietly update Light of Motiram's Steam page</a> to tone down the more "egregious" Horizon similarities. But the lawsuit rumbles on.

<p>
Sony wants the court to block Light of Motiram from sale when its legal hearing gets underway next year, but in the interim Tencent has agreed to keep the game out of the spotlight. As <a href="https://thegamepost.com/tencent-promote-light-of-motiram-run-public-tests-sony-horizon-lawsuit-2026-hearing/">reported by TheGamePost</a>, Tencent this week submitted a new California court filing agreeing there will be "no new promotion or public testing of Light of Motiram" while Sony's injunction request is being argued. This is part of a deal in which Sony will give Tencent more time to respond to its injunction motion.
</p><p>
"SIE requested, and the Tencent Entities agreed, that (a) the extended briefing schedule and later requested hearing date will not be used to argue that SIE delayed in seeking a preliminary injunction," the filing reads, "(b) there will be no new promotion or public testing of Light of Motiram during the pendency of the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, (c) the Light of Motiram release will not be moved up to before Q4 2027, and (d) the Tencent Entities will not seek expedited discovery in connection with the Motion for Preliminary injunction".
</p>
<p>
TheGamePost notes Sony and Tencent have jointly requested the court hearings - covering both Sony's injunction request and Tencent's motion to dismiss the lawsuit - be moved to the same day in January next year.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has received both netcode and hit registration improvements ahead of the Winter Offensive update, which is set to go live on the 9th December.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1996248184381641171?s=20">Announced in a Battlefield Comms post</a>, the developers have stated that work continues to enhance both components of online play. This is especially noteworthy as issues surrounding both online netcode and hit registration have been points of frustration for some players since launch.</p>
<p>"We are continuing to build on our work to make hit registration feel consistent, reliable, and predictable during every engagement," the post states. "With this update, we have improved how bullet trajectories are aligned in fast-paced situations, including cases where shots were fired while transitioning into a zoom. These improvements correct inconsistencies that could affect hit registration and the readability of where your shots were landing. We have also made updates to better handle high-density combat scenarios to ensure bullets register more reliably when multiple players are fighting in close proximity."</p>

</figure>
<p>In addition, the new Battlefield 6 update has included additional gameplay adjustments to better the overall experience of getting into a firefight. The post elaborates: "In parallel, we have tightened the clarity of damage feedback so that health UI changes and damage cues feel more immediate and easier to understand during combat. While this is separate from Netcode itself, improving how damage is presented plays a key role in making hit registration feel responsive and intuitive.
</p><p>"Lastly, we have resolved an issue where clients could briefly display certain pieces of geometry as intact even though they had already been destroyed on the server. Fixing this eliminates cases where incoming damage could appear to pass through walls."</p>
<p>Other improvements include a general tweak to soldier visibility. There have also been adjustments to various weapons including changes to weapon-handling, first shot accuracy and more. Certain game modes include Rush and Breakthrough have also been altered to improve the attacker flow, aiming to stop oversaturation when it comes to defending objectives.</p>
<p>Finally, the post pledges further improvements to "clarity, responsiveness, and fairness in combat". So it seems as though this continued string of gameplay shifts from EA and Battlefield Studios won't be stopping anytime soon.</p>
<p>This update comes shortly after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-was-cheater-free-in-roughly-98-of-games-after-launch">EA revealed that close to 98 percent of games post-launch were cheater free</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-flounders-battlefield-6-free-for-a-week">a week-long free-to-play offering that allowed folks to try the military FPS out without breaking the bank</a>.</p>

            <p>Amazon's upcoming live-action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> from Pheobe Waller-Bridge will interconnect with the video games, rather than being a standalone story with its own continuity in the vein of the Angelina Jolie films.</p>
<p>This latest nugget of Tomb Raider-laced information comes from Story Kitchen, a production company tied to the series.</p>
<!-- code from Primis - Eurogamer.net - eurogamer.net -->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>As shared on the <a href="https://www.story-kitchen.com/projects/tombraider">company's website</a>, and spotted by social media account <a href="https://x.com/infinityTRaider">Infinity Tomb Raider</a>, the deal between Story Kitchen and Amazon MGM studios "will reinvent the franchise on a massive scale, interconnecting a new live-action television series and video games into a unified storytelling universe".</p>
<p>Along with the show, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-games-working-with-crystal-dynamics-on-next-tomb-raider">Amazon's game department is also assisting on the next mainline Tomb Raider entry with developer Crystal Dynamics</a>. Story Kitchen's wording here could therefore suggest that whichever comes first - the show or the game - will perhaps lead into the other somehow, or at least drop some clues at what Tomb Raider fans can perhaps expect from the franchise's future.</p><p>It will also be interesting to see how Amazon's interconnecting of the games will differ from what Netflix did with its own Tomb Raider animated series, The Legend of Lara Croft. This series took place after the events of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>, and included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-netflix-series-ptsd-focus-was-something-game-writers-werent-allowed-to-explore-rhianna-pratchett-says">brief  flashbacks to Lara's time on Yamatai from the 2013 reboot</a>. Meanwhile, both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-animated-tomb-raider-series-is-returning-for-season-2-and-laras-teaming-up-with-an-old-pal">Jonah and Sam from this trilogy of games make an appearance in Netflix's Tomb Raider animated series</a>.</p>
<p>However, other than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-has-found-its-lara-croft">Sophie Turner as Lara Croft</a>, we are yet to find out which other characters from the Tomb Raider series more generally will be popping up in Amazon's live-action adventure. Will Turner's Lara also meet those from earlier games such as Jonah? Or even someone like Werner Von Croy, Lara's former mentor who popped up in the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-last-revelation">Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation</a>? </p>
<p>The wording from Story Kitchen doesn't make it totally clear which games, past or future, it will be unifying. It's unclear if the company is referring to Amazon and Crystal Dynamics' new game in the franchise, or if it will be canon with previous games in the series.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-from-phoebe-waller-bridge-adds-another-major-cast-member">actor Martin Bobb-Semple was cast in Amazon's live-action Tomb Raider series</a>, but as who remains to be seen (though, some have speculated he will play tech-expert Zip).</p>
<p>Hopefully, we will hear more information about Amazon's Tomb Raider series and game soon!</p>

            <p>Antireal, the artist at the heart of a plagiarism scandal involving Bungie's upcoming extraction shooter Marathon, has posted a statement on social media indicating the saga has come to a close.</p>
<p>Taking to Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1995907613004018047?s=20">Antireal posted the following tweet</a>: "The Marathon art issue has been resolved with Bungie and Sony Interactive Entertainment to my satisfaction." There has been no follow-up by Antireal elaborating on the situation, nor has any statement been released <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame">on the official Marathon social media account</a>.</p>
<p>This appears to be the end of Marathon's plagiarism woes. Some, responding to Antireal's statement, are speculating that it was made as part of a deal between Antireal and Bungie / Sony. However, this has not been verified.</p>

<p>For those unaware, <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923067988871147605">Antireal first posted a lengthy breakdown</a> of where their art appeared in Marathon's first public Closed Beta back in May of this year. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">Following this, Bungie announced an investigation into the matter</a>, eventually admitting that yes, Antireal's art had been used during the development of Marathon. Following this controversy as well as the mixed reception to its initial beta, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">morale at Bungie was reportedly in freefall</a>, though it is worth noting vast changes have been made to the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-troubled-extraction-shooter-marathon-still-aiming-for-release-by-march-2026">in the run up to its release in March, 2026</a>.</p><p>Marathon's cinematic short director also chipped in last month, stating in now-deleted social media posts that the plagiarism scandal was "blown out of proportion". He also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-not-ai-oscar-winning-marathon-cinematic-short-director-hits-back-at-online-accusations">pushed back passionately against claims that AI was used in the creation of the frankly fantastic looking cinematic he directed</a>.</p>

            <p>
Saturnalia developer Santa Ragione's first-person narrative horror Horses has received a last-minute ban from the Epic Games Store. Epic was one of several storefronts confirmed to have approved a build for release when news of Horses' ban from Steam emerged, but it has now reversed its decision, citing what Santa Ragione calls "broad and demonstrably incorrect claims".
</p>
<p>
Horses unfolds across 14 days on a farm where humans are held captive as "horses", using the imagery to explore what Santa Ragione describes as "the burden of familial trauma and puritan values, the dynamics of totalitarian power, and the ethics of personal responsibility". Last week, the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">revealed Steam had refused to distribute Horses</a> - citing concerns around an early, unfinished build, and declining to reappraise the game once it was finished. Despite Valve's rejection, Horses was approved for distribution on all other major PC storefronts, but Epic has now made an eleventh hour reversal.

<p>
In an <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html#Q17">FAQ discussing the U-turn</a> on its website, Santa Ragione says it received notification from Epic 24 hours before Horses' release, the storefront explaining it would no longer distribute the game after its "review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines". Epic's email specifically referenced its policies around "inappropriate content" and "hateful or abusive content" - saying Horses contravenes guidelines prohibiting content that "promotes abuse and animal abuse", that "contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behaviour or [that is] not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated". On this latter point, Epic said it had filled out an IARC Questionnaire based on the content it reviewed, receiving an Adult Only (AO) rating - a rating category it does not distribute on its storefront.
</p><p>
Epic noted Santa Ragione had several options, including updating Horses to ensure compliance and resubmitting it for review. However, the studio says Epic did not specifically highlight the content it had found objectionable, nor would it have been possible to make significant changes so close to launch.
</p>
<p>
Instead, Santa Ragione chose to immediately appeal Epic's decision, addressing each of the storefront's concerns. It noted the "four brief" sex scenes featured in Horses - two occurring "mainly off camera" - are censored using pixellation, use "stylised and unrealistic" animations, and do not involve involve genitalia. As to Epic's other point, Santa Ragione stressed Horses "does not promote abuse (including animal abuse)" and is rather a "strong critique of violence and abuse in general." It also reiterated that its own IARC submission - filed "more than five weeks" before release - resulted in PEGI 18 and ESRB M ratings, as displayed on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horses-004d87">Epic's Horses page</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Santa Ragione says it then received an automated response from Epic 12 hours later rejecting its appeal, with the storefront insisting it had determined its original decision was "appropriately applied and will remain in place". It remains unclear what prompted Epic's apparent decision to instigate a last-minute re-review of Horses; Santa Ragione insists the storefront had received and reviewed a build two months ago, with its final achievements-ready build being approved for release 18 days prior to launch. Eurogamer has contacted Epic for comment on the story.
</p>
<p>
Horses continues to be available via <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses">GOG</a> and <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses">Itch.io</a>, where it costs £4.99/$4.99. Epic's decision has temporarily impacted its availability on Humble, but Santa Ragione says it's received confirmation from Humble that it will still be distributing the game - although a build is yet to go live.
</p><p>If you're curious about Horses itself, I reviewed it earlier this week ahead of launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-review">awarding it four out of five stars</a> and calling it a "rallying cry against hypocrisy, institutional or otherwise, and one that feels particularly potent right now, as puritanism and anti-intellectualism continue to exert themselves".
