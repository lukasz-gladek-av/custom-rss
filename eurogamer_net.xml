            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> has released the first major patch for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>, which addresses over 1800 issues and fixes to the game's A-Life.</p>
<p>What's more, the game has now recouped its investment and has turned a profit, according to the studio's owner Maxim Krippa in an interview with <a href="https://forbes.ua/news/gsc-game-prodali-dostatnyu-kilkist-kopiy-stalker-2-shchob-vivesti-proekt-u-pributok-investor-krippa-18122024-25653">Forbes</a>. Krippa also confirmed at least two expansions and multiplayer are planned, with no further details provided.</p>
<p>The developer notes Patch 1.1 is "huge" so will take some time to download. It includes A-Life fixes and AI improvements, balance adjustments, crash fixes and performance optimisations, issues with specific story missions, and more.</p>

<p>A-Life is the game's system to ensure NPCs appear natural. An <a href="https://support.stalker2.com/hc/en-us/articles/27929320406929-Beginner-s-Guide-FAQs#h_01JCJMM3744R2TV14ME0PT3RAK">FAQ</a> from the studio reads: "The A-Life 2.0 system is responsible for ensuring that the Zone lives its own life regardless of your actions. The game world around you is changing all the time. Mutants, stalkers, bandits, and other inhabitants of the Zone move around, hunt, fight among themselves for lairs and territories, or join groups."</p><p>The system was criticised by players for feeling too scripted and not organic enough. A number of fixes have now been implemented, increasing the rate players will encounter roaming NPCs, improving the navigation of NPCs, enhancing their motivation to expand territory and actively attack, and other changes.</p>
<p>Further small AI improvements have been made to both NPCs and enemies.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, several missions have received increased rewards, an infinite money exploit has been fixed, performance has been improved in largely populated areas, and plenty more.</p>
<p>Check out a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525329871842312365">Steam notice for the full patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>"Thank you very much for your support and feedback," the notes read. "We will continue working on the game, listening to your comments and reviews to investigate all possible issues and solve them as soon as possible."</p>
<p>At its launch in November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Stalker 2</a> was criticised for its performance issues.</p>
<p>However, in an interview with Eurogamer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delaying-stalker-2-again-not-an-option-studio-says-team-worked-until-it-was-broken-by-marathon-development">GSC Game World's CEO Ievgen Grygorovych said delaying the game was not an option</a>.</p>
<p>"You're so tired that you would just die if you say let's run an additional marathon," said Grygorovych. "We didn't have a chance to say let's do it more. We just had a chance of 'let's do until this moment - the release date - as much as we can'."</p><p>Creative director Mariia Grygorovych also acknowledged issues with the game at launch. "It's not perfect, we need to fix everything, it has some problems," she said. "But it's a game! It's a game with soul, with feelings there, with love there. Even the problems, you can't fix them if you don't have a game."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The CEO of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> studio Arrowhead has responded to criticism from players of the high cost of its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killzone-2">Killzone 2</a> crossover.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-receives-first-ever-crossover-with-killzone-2-cosmetics">crossover with Sony's Killzone 2</a>, revealed yesterday, adds a number of themed items and cosmetics to the in-game store and is the first of its kind for the game. However, players have criticised their cost.</p>
<p>Usually, extra content is unlocked through a Warbond costing 1000 Super Credits (£7.99), which includes multiple weapons, armours, and cosmetic items. The Killzone 2 items are instead available to purchase separately, with all six items totalling 1,975 Super Credits - so two batches of 1000 Super Credits totalling £15.98, essentially doubling the price.</p>

<p>Separately, the StA-52 assault rifle costs 615 Super Credits (the most expensive item) and the AC-1 Dutiful armour costs 500 Super Credits.</p>
<p>Players have since responded negatively on the game's Discord server and reddit, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgyz51/615_sc_for_a_primary_weapon_is_straight_up/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one reddit user posting</a> "615 SC for a primary weapon is straight up ridiculous".</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt responded to a player on X who said the price "definitely felt steep".</p>
<p>"Sorry you felt the price was steep, we are looking at all feedback," Pilestedt replied. "The reason we changed it from a Warbond was actually because there were concerns that having a higher priced Warbond would carry negative sentiment."</p> <div>

<p>Over on Discord, Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani responded (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-players-rip-into-arrowhead-for-straight-up-ridiculous-killzone-crossover-prices-ceo-defends-the-choice-the-more-of-this-we-sell-the-more-illuminate-type-stuff-we-can-keep-dropping-for-free/">PC Gamer</a>). "Hey, quick comment on the Helghast stuff. Firstly, this is our first collaboration so we'll be figuring it out as we go along. Let us know what you'd like to see in the future," he said. "Secondly it's optional. The more of this we sell, the more Illuminate-type stuff we can keep dropping for free."</p>
<p>He later added: "This was my way of saying that the better the game does the more stuff we can do."</p>
<p>Further, Jorjani noted while Arrowhead is partnered with Sony, pricing was the studio's decision. "This one is on us," he wrote.</p>

</span></p><p>As stated in the crossover announcement, the collaboration marks the start of a new five day rotation length in the store.</p>
<p>"Right now, many of you feel the items are in rotation for too short a time, and that you sometimes miss out on that killer look you had your eyes on," Arrowhead said. "At the same time, the more things we add to the store the longer it takes to come back into rotation."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Crush 40 musician and Sonic songwriter Johnny Gioeli is suing Sega of America over ownership of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-sa2-dc">Sonic Adventure 2</a> theme song Live and Learn.</p>
<p>Gioeli has claimed Sega only has rights to the lyrics of the song and not the "master recording and musical composition", the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/806228650/Live-and-Learn-lawsuit-via-Polygon">lawsuit</a> reads (as shared by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/498953/sonic-music-live-and-learn-copyright-lawsuit-crush-40-sega">Polygon</a>), but "unbeknownst" to the songwriter Sega has "exploited and licensed" the song to "at least 25 video games, television shows, live performances/events, and films".</p>
<p>Live and Learn features heavily in the latest film, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>, though Gioeli previously confirmed to <a href="https://aftermath.site/sonic-movie-live-and-learn">Aftermath</a> a deal was signed for its use with Paramount.</p>

<p>In the lawsuit, Gioeli claims he was paid $3000 to write lyrics for an as-yet-untitled song to be included in Sonic Adventure 2. He then "ended up arranging, producing, recording, and performing vocals on Live and Learn, which was produced out of his home studio in California using his own equipment without the supervision, control, or involvement" of Sega.</p>
<p>Further, Sega's assertion it owns full control over the master recording and music composition is "without basis" as there is no agreement in place with Gioeli to transfer rights beyond the lyrics.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Gioeli has "maintained his songwriting registration" for the song for over 20 years. The songwriter holds the <a href="https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/36292721">copyright</a> for Live and Learn, where he's listed as having authorship over the music and lyrics. The date of this registration is 2024.</p><p>Gioeli does admit the "composition is likely jointly owned", the lawsuit reads, and is therefore seeking a Court decision to determine the ownership of the song. The writer is also seeking $500,000 in damages, and a further $500,000 in restitution.</p>
<p>Gioeli has worked with Sega composer Jun Senoue on multiple Sonic soundtracks, together writing and performing under the name Sons of Angels, which was later changed to Crush 40.</p>
<p>While his work on Live and Learn was "expressly limited in scope to lyrics" as per his agreement with Sega, Gioeli received demos of instrumental portions from Senoue and a back and forth ensued with Gioeli's input.</p>
<p>Gioeli "controlled and oversaw the recording process, produced the recording, directed the arrangement and of the song, directed the recording process for other musicians, and recorded and performed the vocals", the lawsuit reads.</p>
<p>Gioeli worked with Sega for over 20 years, from 1998's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-adventure">Sonic Adventure</a> to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-sonic-racing">Team Sonic Racing</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-sonic-at-olympic-games-tokyo-2020">Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>However, the lawsuit states he was made aware by a fan of Crush 40 that Live and Learn was present in other well-known games, including the likes of Sonic Generations, multiple Yakuza games, multiple Super Smash Bros. games, and the recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>.</p><p>"I have no comment other than my desire to maintain the preservation of a long standing beautiful relationship with Sega," Gioeli told Polygon. "I do not want fans to draw conclusions or be disrupted from the beautiful memories we have made collectively with this music. I believe and hope we will come to a peaceful settlement that will be fair and just."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Sega for further comment.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-review">Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film</a> releases this week, capping off Sega's Year of Shadow.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
