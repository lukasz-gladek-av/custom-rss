        <p>But mysterious mobile game is apparently not.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Back in 2020, streaming giant Netflix announced a partnership with Ubisoft to create streaming "content" based on Assassin's Creed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-announces-assassins-creed-live-action-series">including at least one live-action TV series</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Five years and several <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-games-order">Assassin's Creed games</a> later, however, and we're yet to see Netflix's TV project materialise.
</p>
<p>
Has the project been quietly canned? Not so, according to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/i/160364118/item-what-about-netflixs-assassins-creed">Game File</a>, which reported that the series is still in "active" development as part of an article featuring a chat with Netflix's gaming boss Alain Tascan.
</p>
<p>
Few details have ever been announced on the Netflix Assassin's Creed series, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-assassins-creed-adaptation-loses-die-hard-writer-jeb-stuart">Die Hard writer Jeb Stuart was briefly attached</a> for a period. 
</p>
<p>
A mysterious <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/assassins-creed-mobile-game?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">Assassin's Creed mobile game announced by Netflix and Ubisoft in 2022</a> - of which we knew nothing at all - is no longer in development, Tascan appeared to suggest.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first Assassin's Creed Netflix project to fall by the wayside. An <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-anime-announced-by-netflix-castlevania-creator">Assassin's Creed anime was announced by Netflix in 2017</a> from Adi Shankar, creator of the popular Castlevania  animated series. However, the project ultimately failed to materialise.
</p>
<p>
Last month, speaking at GDC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-games-boss-says-consoles-not-the-future-as-streamer-looks-to-phone-controlled-party-games">Tascan said he believed consoles were not the future as the streamer looks to phone-controlled party games</a>. "Are eight year-olds and ten year-olds dreaming of owning a PlayStation 6?" he wondered.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/atomfall-release-breaks-records-for-sniper-elite-studio-though-i-thought-wed-have-drunk-more-tea<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Developer Rebellion is celebrating its "most successful launch" ever with the release of Atomfall, a game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atomfall-let-me-bash-a-mans-head-in-with-a-cricket-bat-while-he-was-having-a-wee-and-i-think-i-love-it">our Ian showered in praise</a> after it allowed him to bash a man over the head with a cricket bat as he (the man, not Ian) was having a wee against a wall.</p>
<p>The studio announced its pseudo-apocalyptic survival game - set in the rather splendid ol' chap that is 1950s rural England - had already reached 1.5 million players since its debut at the end of March.</p>
<p>"A pleasure having you observe Protocol in Wyndham," the Atomfall developer celebrated on social media.</p>

<p>Along with this impressive player milestone, Rebellion has also shared some thoroughly British Atomfall statistics.</p>
<p>Among us, we have managed to devour 4m pasties, and savour 300,000 cups of tea, which, honestly, seems quite low to me, given I probably drink that in about a week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there have been 3.7m kills with a cricket bat (and only 1m of those were Ian). Lastly, want to know how many players killed the scientist right at the start of Atomfall? That's 316,000 of us.</p>

<p>Atomfall released last week across PC, PlayStation and Xbox. It is also available on both  Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, likely bolstering its popularity.</p>
<p>If you haven't played Atomfall for yourself yet, but are curious about it all, you can check out our review. "If you can get over a difficult start and fancy a lean take on the survival genre, Atomfall delivers an intriguing tale worth discovering," Tom Orry wrote, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atomfall-review">awarding the game three Eurogamer stars</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-final-switch-2-tease-shows-mysterious-c-button<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>'s most mysterious button has been teased by Nintendo, ahead of the new console's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">full unveiling in just a few hours</a>.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo has, to date, avoided speficially highlighting the mysterious "C" button located on the Switch 2's right-hand Joy-Con. Indeed, when the Switch 2 was first revealed, the button's face was left completely blank. An <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-mysterious-c-button-finally-confirmed">image posted to Nintendo Today last week did however finally show the button's lettering</a>, if you squint.
</p>
<p>
Now, it seems, we will finally find out its true purpose. A new video <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">posted to the Nintendo Today app</a> promoting this afternoon's Nintendo Direct focuses fully on that C button, and shows it being pressed. A little jingle plays. But what just happened?
</p>
<p>
Fan theories point to this being some kind of capture or social button, allowing you to more easily share gameplay or discuss what you're currently playing with others. Could this be a feature similar to the Wii U's much-missed Miiverse, perhaps?
</p>

Yesterday, Nintendo teased another new Switch 2 hardware feature - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-mouse-functionality-all-but-confirmed-thanks-to-latest-console-teaser">the mouse-like controls of the console's fresh Joy-Con</a>. 
</p>
<p>
We now have only a few hours until Switch 2's secrets are revealed. Be sure to join us at 2pm UK time later today, 2nd April 2025, for the main event.
</p>
<p>
Alongside a full demo of the Switch 2's hardware, Nintendo is expected to unveil the key games which it will launch its new console with, most notably including its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">new Switch 2 Mario Kart</a> glimpsed earlier this year. 
</p>
<p>
We're also expecting to finally hear word of the Switch 2's launch date and price, with a release expected around June - after the culmination of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-switch-2-public-hands-on-tour">Nintendo's public Switch 2 hands-on tour</a>.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> might be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-finally-adds-the-series-iconic-burglar-and-it-only-took-11-years">tootling along merrily</a>, but it's now over 10 years old and fans are getting increasingly impatient for clarity on what's next for the franchise - particularly given EA's somewhat confounding communications on the matter. Amid all this, extensive footage of EA's new The Sims "game concept" have now surfaced online, fuelling all sorts of disappointment as fans ponder a reality where the future of The Sims is, in fact, just a tacky looking mobile game.
</p>
<p>
To recap, EA first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-gives-super-early-look-at-next-generation-sims-game-project-rene">began discussing its "next generation" Sims game</a>, codenamed Project Rene, back in 2022. This, many assumed, would be <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-5">The Sims 5</a> - until, that is, EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-5-not-happening-as-ea-moves-beyond-linear-sequential-sims-releases">announced Project Rene wasn't The Sims 5</a>, that The Sims 5 wasn't happening, and that whatever Project Rene was would instead co-exist alongside The Sims 4. It also teased a bunch of "cosy games, social and collaborative based gameplay, [and] mobile narrative games" coming under The Sims banner, before revealing Project Rene (whatever it was) would begin playtesting soon.
</p>
<p>
In the six months since then, playtest footage has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1frtd5c/new_project_rene_formerly_the_sims_5_screenshots/">sporadically leaked online</a>, leaving fans largely unimpressed. And it seems unlikely the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8IPPtMzVBE">sudden influx of new gameplay footage</a> (as flagged by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-sims/another-disappointing-looking-project-rene-leak-makes-me-wish-ea-would-finally-step-in-and-say-anything-at-all-to-sims-fans/">PC Gamer</a>) will change that, given the bland visuals, endless reward-incentivised to-do lists, and front-and-centre currency focus feels more like a free-to-play mobile wallet squeezer than a truly "next-generation" The Sims game.

<p>
EA describes the playtest - officially titled <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.gp.lifegame&amp;hl=en">City Life Game With Friends over on Google Play</a> - as "small parts of a larger game concept". And the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8IPPtMzVBE">newly</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXD7u0miBKA">shared</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pMyt1ioAs">footage</a> focuses on the same multiplayer-enabled plaza location we've <a href="https://streamable.com/guwvh2">seen in numerous leaks before</a>, only now festooned with even more garish free-to-play style window dressing as players stroll around, strike up conversations, and hand out a few muffins. It's not especially inspiring stuff - and given EA's refusal to clarify the nature of the project, it's unclear how horrified fans should actually be.
</p>
<p>
All this, of course, comes as developer Krafton's highly anticipated The Sims competitor <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">InZoi</a> launches into Steam early access. And while I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-25-years-of-the-sims-could-inzoi-be-about-to-steal-its-crown">wasn't particulary impressed with InZoi</a> during my time with it last month, it's unlikely anyone's going to be dazzled by anything resembling EA's City Life Game with Friends when Krafton's game is around.
