            <p>The soundtrack for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> includes only 10 tracks from the original two games, after Tony Hawk himself wanted to emphasise music discovery.</p>
<p>The full soundtrack was <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/uk/en/blog/2025/06/tony-hawk-pro-skater-three-four-full-soundtrack">revealed at the start of June</a> by publisher Activision, but ahead of the game's full release this week, reviews have criticised changes to the soundtrack and its lack of songs from the original games.</p>
<p>Out of the 69 songs across both Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4, only 10 from the original games have been included. Instead, in some instances, a different song from the same artist has been used - the remainder are new to the series.</p>

<p>Those 10 returning songs are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Faction - Skate &amp; Destroy</li>
<li>Gang Starr - Mass Appeal</li>
<li>JFA - Beach Blanket Bongout</li>
<li>RUN-D.M.C. - My Adidas</li>
<li>Motörhead - Ace of Spades</li>
<li>Del the Funky Homosapien - If You Must</li>
<li>AFI - The Boy Who Destroyed the World</li>
<li>Adolescents - Amoeba</li>
<li>CKY - 96 Quite Bitter Beings</li>
<li>Bodyjar - Not the Same</li>
</ol>
<p>One major reason for not including certain songs may be licensing issues.</p>
<p>However, in the same blog post revealing the soundtrack, Christopher Wilson, VP of production at Activision Publishing stated: "We wanted to keep the feel of the original games but also introduce new artists and songs."</p>
<p>He added: "Throughout the project, Tony added tracks and suggested using different songs from artists that were featured on the original games.</p>
<p>"The soundtrack is meant to be a love letter to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> franchise, skateboarding in general, and be an opportunity to showcase music that falls outside of the mainstream."</p>
<p>Wilson's comments <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-was-tony-hawks-choice-to-pick-some-different-songs-by-the-same-artists-in-pro-skater-34-remake">mirror those of Hawk himself</a>, who previously stated on an Instagram post it was his choice "to pick some different songs by the same artists featured in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">THPS3</a>+4 OST".</p>
<p>"I'm hoping that discovery is half the fun, and a big reason that these soundtracks resonated in the first place," he said. "So listen and enjoy the ride."</p>
<p>Still, the soundtracks to all the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games are iconic, reflecting the musical tastes of the early 00s. The changes have left some fans disappointed, in response to reviews by critics.</p>
<p>Also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-reportedly-intervened-to-get-bam-margera-in-pro-skater-3-4-remake-after-activision-said-no">returning for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is skater Bam Margera</a>, after Hawk intervened.</p>
<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be released on 11th July across Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS4, PS5, Switch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, and PC (Steam, Battle.net, Microsoft).

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> is ready to stick a rusty knife into its distended fleshsack of horror IP collaborations yet again, this time resulting in The Walking Dead splattering wetly onto its gore-soaked floor. We already knew the collaboration was coming, of course, but with its public test build now live, developer Behaviour Interactive has finally detailed exactly what's involved.
</p>
<p>
Dead by Daylight's The Walking Dead collaboration introduces two new survivors, bringing three new perks apiece: Rick Grimes - the man with more hat than personality (until he gave away his hat) - and formidable zombie slayer (plus pointy sword fan) Michonne Grimes.
</p>
<p>
Rick comes with the Apocalyptic Ingenuity perk, which enables him to turn broken pallets into fragile pallets after interacting with a certain number of chests, plus the Come and Get Me perk, which causes Rick to scream, alerting the killer to his aura, but prevents injured or dying survivors from leaving scratch marks or blood trails within a certain radius. Additionally, there's the Toughen Up teamwork perk, which reduces Rick's grunts of pain, scratch marks, and pools of blood when another survivor pallet-stuns or blinds the killer while he's injured.

<p>
As for Michonne, her Conviction perk lets her recover immediately after healing a survivor while downed, but Broken is then applied, downing her again after a certain length of time. Last Stand, meanwhile, is a once-per-trial perk that lets Michonne fast-vault and stun the killer after she's been in its terror radius for a set amount of time. As for her Throw Down teamwork perk, it gives Endurance to other survivors and lets them see the killer's aura briefly when she pallet-stun or blinds the killer. You'll find a few more specifics - alongside details of other updates and enhancements - in Behaviour Interactive's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/381210/view/538857783458533234?l=english">9.1.0 patch notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Dead by Daylight's The Walking Dead collaboration - which arrives sandwiched between its previously announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-celebrates-ninth-anniversary-with-five-nights-at-freddys-and-the-witcher-collaborations">Five Nights at Freddy's and The Witcher collaborations</a> - can be played right now via the game's public test build on PC, but Behaviour notes Michonne Grimes won't be included due to "known technical issues". Expect these to be resolved, the studio says, in time for update 9.1.0's full release across all platforms on 29th July. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q9aM9Ch97U8">La jiggy jar jar doo</a>.

            <p>Former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> game director Vinit Agarwal has announced he is off to Japan to start his own studio.</p>
<p>Agarwal was at Naughty Dog for a decade, before he departed the company in January of this year. During his time at the studio, he worked on both the Uncharted and The Last of Us series. Most recently, he was director of Naughty Dog's cancelled standalone The Last of Us online multiplayer.</p>

<p>Sharing a "couple of life updates" on <a href="https://x.com/vinixkun/status/1942603344746537024">social media last night</a>, Agarwal said: "Moving to Japan tomorrow. Also forming a game studio - more on that soon!"</p>
<p>While the developer did not share any further specifics on exactly what he will be working on when his new studio takes shape, in an <a href="https://x.com/vinixkun/status/1930309271683772464">earlier exchange on social media</a> Agarwal said he would continue to make multiplayer games following The Last of Us online's cancellation, as that is what he is "passionate about".</p>
<p>Naughty Dog's multiplayer game was initially planned to be part of The Last of Us Part 2, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-confirms-the-last-of-us-2-wont-have-multiplayer-after-all">in 2019 the studio announced its sequel would release as a solo experience</a>, with a multiplayer aspect planned to arrive at a later date. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-says-the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-needs-more-time">following word the studio needed more time on the project</a>, Naughty Dog ultimately <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">cancelled The Last of Us' online multiplayer release in 2023</a>. At this time, the developer said it didn't want to become a "solely live service games studio".</p>
<p>Agarwal subsequently announced he was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vinit-agarwal-47b3213_todays-my-last-day-naughty-dog-grateful-activity-7283634874274476032-KhfY/">leaving Naughty Dog in January of this year</a>. Sharing an update on LinkedIn, Agarwal said he was grateful for his decade at the studio, but the time had come for a "new adventure" and to make "something of [his] own". The former studio director then thanked his colleagues and mentors, namechecking Robert Cogburn, Erin Daly, Bruce Straley, Neil Druckmann and Evan Wells. Of those named, only Druckmann remains at Naughty Dog now.</p>

<p>Druckmann himself is currently working on Naughty Dog's all new game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation">recently stepped back from The Last of Us TV adaptation to focus on the studio</a>.

<p>Earlier this year, the star of Naughty Dog's upcoming game said she'd received preparation for the role - and specifically the online reaction to it - from Druckmann himself, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-online-backlash-prompted-naughty-dogs-next-star-to-get-bootcamp-ing-from-neil-druckmann">following the online abuse previously kicked up around The Last of Us Part 2</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/former-uncharted-and-the-last-of-us-game-designer-starting-new-studio]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you're a fan of football games, you'll know they're likely a familiar affair at this point. A continuous river of annual releases, slight upgrades, and the prioritisation of simulating a real game of footy over anything too drastic. This might even be a bit of a stretch, with the majority of football fans starting and ending with EA Sports FC.</p>
<p>Enter Rematch, which has proven <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-kicks-off-first-week-with-impressive-sales-and-player-milestones">exceptionally popular</a> since its release last month. The game managed to find a gap between the big-budget defenders and snuck in a shot on goal. CEO of developer Sloclap, Pierre Tarno, told Eurogamer that this current sports game ecosystem offered the perfect opportunity to tap into a vast community.</p>

<p>Although it turns out, not necessarily football fans! Eurogamer is home to some big fans of Sloclap's moreish sports game, but even we can't deny that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/for-the-love-of-ibrahimovic-rematch-players-learn-to-pass-before-i-become-the-very-thing-i-hate">Rematch players are sometimes infuriating</a>, which now is a lot easier to understand. Tarno claims: "There was a space, clearly. I do think however that our fans go further than those of sports games. In fact, we see via data, currently the core audience of Rematch lean towards those who play online competitive games rather than those who are fans of football."</p>
<p>This is true of the developers themselves, too. It may surprise you that even the developers at Slapclap aren't a collective of football fanatics. Tarno would go on to explain: "Loads of people in the team don't really care about football at all. But quite early on in the project, team mates who weren't super convinced by it - [after] when we ran internal tournaments - told me 'I get it now. I don't give a s**t about football, but this really struck something in me.' The dynamics, the team play, I think those are what make it interesting for players even if they don't like or play football games."</p>
<p>Tarno's reasoning for why the Rematch community has broken out this way is a simple one: "First of all I think it's something that's going to evolve. I think the main reason is the main portion of our untapped audience are players who are not as savvy about games, are perhaps not hardcore gamers, and are as such less aware of new releases. They may not inform themselves as much as core gamers who follow the news, monitor new releases, and will jump on games as they come out."</p>
<p>It's this ocean of sports fans that Slowclap aims to dive into through Rematch. Doing so, however, will take time: "They play FIFA, but they don't read Eurogamer. Maybe they play FIFA <em>and</em> Call of Duty! But they're just waiting for their annual release. To reach them it's about word of mouth, continuing to communicate, and keep rolling out updates."</p>
<p>As with all competitive games, the play styles in fashion change over time, new players become more familiar with the mechanics and a more established audience is cemented for the longhaul. Maybe, if we get our wish, goalies will stop trying to flick the ball over their head from inside their own area. We can hope.</p>
