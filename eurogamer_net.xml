            <p>Nintendo's average annual salary may have dropped by 2.3 percent in 2024, but it's still the second-highest-paying company in western Japan.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-average-annual-salary-decreased-in-2024-but-ranked-second-highest-in-japanese-regional-ranking/">Automaton</a>, the business journal <a href="https://diamond.jp/articles/-/357677">Diamond Online</a> detailed salary information for firms based in Japan's Kansai region (sans Osaka), revealing Nintendo employees take home an average salary of ¥9.627m - that's around $61,500 or £50,800.</p>

<p>Nintendo took second place after semiconductor manufacturer Screen Holdings, which had an average salary of ¥10.248m ($65.5K / £53.7K).</p>
<p>Diamond Online hypothesises that Nintendo's average earnings have fallen due to the drop in net sales and operating profit - down 5.5 and 14.9 per cent, respectively - in 2023.</p>
<p>By the end of the 2024 fiscal year in March 2024, however, sales were up 4.4 percent, and operating profit had bounced back by 4.9 per cent, intimating the average salary will possibly increase for Nintendo employees by the end of this financial year.</p>
<p>Nintendo is the only video game company to have been included in the list.</p>
