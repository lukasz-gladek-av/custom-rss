            <p>Here we go: Capcom has finally released an official trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> 4 Title Update 4, which is due to launch for the game on 16th December. But, as exciting as the new content is - featuring returning Elder Dragon, Gogmazios - most players are more interested in another tease of information Capcom has given over the past 24 hours: an optimisation roadmap for the game's performance on PC. This was all revealed during a special showcase Capcom <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-capcom-schedules-new-monster-hunter-wilds-presentation-as-its-director-begs-players-to-return-to-the-game">announced last week</a>, which was paired with comments from the game's director asking us all to please "pick up the game again".</p>

<p>The roadmap is segmented into three portions: improvements that will arrive next week as part of Title Update 4, then more planned improvements in January 2026, followed by further optimisation in February 2026. These updates were promised <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-asks-pc-monster-hunter-wilds-players-to-wait-until-title-update-4-this-winter-for-cpu-and-gpu-related-optimizations">as far back as August this year</a>.</p>
<p>The first update promises to fix CPU/GPU optimisation, targeting processing improvements applicable to all platforms. This means Capcom has updated elements such as frame processing, collision detection, and how many effects are shown on-screen at once. The developer hopes to lower CPU/GPU load by "reducing unnecessary processes", and will implement over 100 improvements to make the game run a bit better. This will target consoles and PC versions of the game.</p><p>Then, in January, we're getting a bit more - and I think this is where the most notable difference from all the updates is going to land. Here, Capcom will introduce "new graphics and CPU settings, as well as new presets, providing additional options to reduce processing load". This will include improving the shader compilation process (which seems to be at the heart of the game's performance woes for many PC players) and improving VRAM usage, too. The devs are also working on a way to improve streaming for the high-resolution texture pack here: another apparent bottleneck for PC players, specifically.</p>
<p>Finally, in February, more general optimisation will be complimented with the addition of level-of-detail quality levels to the polygon mesh on 3D models. To put it simply, this will also help reduce GPU load. This is also PC-only.</p>

<p>That all sounds good, right? Yes. But of course, players aren't happy. "They're even drip feeding optimization lmao," <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1pjshc0/tu4_optimization_roadmap/">writes one redditor</a>. "Damn now imagine the game was optimised at launch, I might've played more than 30 hours before never touching it again," says another. "It looks like they pushed out the things that might actually make a difference until the January patch. I don't get why they're not focusing on the impactful items first. We don't even have monster LOD until February? That should have been in at launch!" claims a third.</p><p>They all have a point, to be fair. These issues have plagued the game since Monster Hunter Wilds launched in February 2025, and whilst Capcom has acknowledged them, the publisher has been slow on pushing out updates that addressed player concerns. This has led to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">review bombing</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-scuppered-by-high-cost-of-ps5-says-capcom-president">less than stellar sales</a> for the game outside its launch window, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-5-monster-hunter-wilds-capcom-latest-financial-quarter">falls in Capcom's share price</a>.</p>
<p>The Monster Hunter audience is also concerned that an upcoming expansion (similar to Monster Hunter World's Iceborne, or Rise's Sunbreak) is going to undo all this hard work and revert the optimisation to launch window levels. There's precedent with this: something similar happened with Iceborne, after all.</p>
<p>There's a decent game inside all of these performance issues, so I'm hoping these updates will sort the bulk of the problem for a PC audience that feels it's been largely left behind thanks to ongoing issues with Capcom's RE Engine. But, a whole year after the game's launch, will this be too late to tempt some people back? We'll find out in a few months.</p>

            <p>So, it turns out that Arrowhead actually has a prototype for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> rogue-lite mode kicking about, and I really want to give it a shot!</p>
<p>This news comes from the studio's CCO Johan Pilestedt, who casually shared the titbit on social media last night like it was nothing.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p><a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/with_replies">Pilestedt</a> was responding to a Helldivers 2 player, who said they had an idea that would mix things up in Arrowhead's space shooter, which came to them during Into the Gloom. The player in question said they were keen to see "some sort of roguelike/endless mode where we fight waves and waves or keep completing objectives on the same map", which does sound like fun.</p>
<p>To this, Pilestedt replied: "Hey! We have a prototype of a rogue-lite mode." Huh?!</p>
<p>And that's not all. Not only does Arrowhead have that prototype knocking around the studio, this mode apparently also "changes the game fundamentally". The studio exec didn't elaborate on this specific point further than that, but did previously state he was with some other team members to talk about the game's "next four arcs". So, could this rogue-lite mode be the focus of one of these future arcs? </p><p>In a subsequent post, Pilestedt said the team is now "in a better technical space" than it once was, so these arcs should come a little quicker than previous ones. He also would really "love a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> Super Destroyer Lego set" at some point, saying this would be a childhood dream come true".</p>
<p>To be honest, that does sound like a pretty great idea for a Lego set.</p>

<p>Away from the game itself, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-announced-helldivers-movie-director-may-not-be-a-gamer-but-he-has-worked-on-multiple-fast-furious-films">a Helldivers 2 film is also in the works</a>, from Fast &amp; Furious director Justin Lin. Earlier this month, Arrowhead's CEO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-trust-justin-arrowhead-ceo-responds-to-helldivers-2-community-asking-for-film-director-to-play-the-game">Shams Jorjani told fans calling for the director to at least play the game before directing the film to pipe down</a>, saying: "I trust Justin."</p>

            <p>Just a day after more N64 classics were announced for Nintendo Switch Online, another game has been added immediately to the GameCube catalogue on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>: Wario World.</p>
<p>Developed by Treasure, the Japanese developer known for Gunstar Heroes and N64 shooter Sin &amp; Punishment, Wario World was not only the first home console Wario game (the previous games were released for handhelds), it was the first 3D Wario platformer.</p>
<p>It was released back in 2003, which was the same year as the first WarioWare game - and ever since, Wario has been mostly relegated to microgame star. So give this GameCube classic some love and maybe Nintendo will consider a new Wario platformer in future.</p>

<p>Wario World joins a whole host of previous Wario games available on the subscription service, including Wario Land 3 for Game Boy and Wario Land 4 for Game Boy Advance.</p>
<p>Still, Wario World is an intriguing choice of inclusion, not least because it wasn't the console's most successful game. The game wasn't included in the initial announcement of GameCube games coming to Switch 2. The most recent of these was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gamecube-cosy-horror-luigis-mansion-comes-to-switch-2-in-time-for-halloween">Luigi's Mansion, the GameCube launch game that arrived back in October</a>.</p>
<p>The remaining games previously announced but not yet available are: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fire-emblem-path-radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a>, Pokémon XD Gale of Darkness, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-colosseum">Pokémon Colosseum</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Nintendo announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-classic-n64-platformers-join-nintendo-switch-online-later-this-month">two Ubisoft N64 platformers would arrive on the service later this month</a>: Rayman 2 and Tonic Trouble.</p>
