            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> who spawn into maps late actually tend to profit more economically, according to a recent interview with design lead Virgil Watkins.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/that-really-sucks-arc-raiders-lead-responds-to-complaints-about-late-spawns-says-late-joiners-are-important-and-profit-way-more-but-embark-knows-its-annoying-to-have-no-time-for-objectives/">Published by GamesRadar</a>, the matter on delayed spawns was addressed head on, as well as whether or not it's good for the players who find themselves a bit late to the party. It turns out, based on the data Embark Studios can see, these players actually tend to extract with more cash in their pockets.</p>
<p>"But similar to the perception of free kits versus what they do, the perception around late joining and what it affords you has been quite interesting. Players are like, 'The loot's all gone,' or whatever else. But players who late join economically profit way more than people who aren't," Watkins said. "The session, when they are fresh, does eventually get quieter, and very often they come across the remnants of fights or can maybe take out bigger drones or hit high-ticket areas more readily than other players. So that's been a very interesting thing to look at."</p>

<p>Watkins elaborated, stating that the purpose of late spawns was to make sure that maps weren't largely barren of players after around 10 minutes, keeping games fresh throughout the entirety of the game. The team had hoped that players entering a match late would be happy to pivot to alternative goals if they didn't have time to achieve what they initially wanted.</p><p>However, in limited-time events or locked rooms, Embark does acknowledge that a genuine sense of frustration is present. Watkins would confirm that the matter of late spawns is being looked into, to try and find a balance between keeping maps populated and removing that feeling of missing out on stuff at no fault of your own.</p>
<p>"With things like trials, where that is the only objective, then fine, that's kind of off the table and that really sucks, because that was the time you had set aside for it. I think trying to do more on that side of things is where I want to look next. Coming in with a dedicated purpose and that's been undercut by the late join is where I'd want to remove the pain point first."</p>

            <p>Fallout games are enjoying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-new-vegas-player-numbers-skyrocket-thanks-to-the-unavoidable-impact-of-fallout-season-2">yet another surge in popularity</a> following the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-streaming-ratings-down">Season 2</a> of the TV show. At the same time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-76-gets-another-hefty-patch-complete-with-ghoulish-fixes-and-quest-improvements">Fallout 76 continues to evolve</a> as it approaches its eighth anniversary (haters in shambles). Diehard fans can't wait to learn about the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/locked-fallout-tv-show-countdown-timer-coincides-with-season-2-finale-but-fans-are-hoping-it-also-signals-a-fallout-3-or-new-vegas-remaster-shadowdrop">long-rumoured remasters</a> of 3 and Vegas, though.</p>
<p>After the massive success of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> in 2025, everyone's assuming those are happening sooner rather than later, but no one wants a rush job, so we'll patiently wait for news. That's also giving both fans and renowned Fallout modders plenty of time to discuss what they'd like to see in potential remasters and what their plans would be. After all, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a>' games are traditionally enduring thanks to the community.</p>
<p>Many of those mods are remarkably ambitious, so it makes sense the people behind them are keeping close tabs on the latest regarding those remasters. Now, via <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2026/01/19/161756.html">Game*Spark</a> (hat tip to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/creators-of-beloved-fallout-mod-no-interest-remasters/">Insider Gaming</a>), we've learned about an important comment posted on the <a href="https://taleoftwowastelands.com/">Tale of Two Wastelands</a> mod's Discord by the creators on 16th January.</p>
<p>"For anyone wondering, if 3 and NV get the remaster treatment, the team will NOT be pursuing this for TTW. It would be a mammoth effort and would require an entire rebuild of the project," developer <a href="https://fallout.wiki/wiki/Mod:Kazopert">Kazopert</a> announced.</p>
<p>Though the news might be disappointing to hardcore Fallout fans wishing for extensive mod support of remastered Bethesda games, it's easy to understand why modders who already poured their hearts, souls, and time into massive efforts are passing on "round two" before such re-releases are even confirmed.</p><p>To this day, Tale of Two Wastelands remains one of the greatest <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> mods released, as it seamlessly puts the 2008 and 2010 RPGs under a single roof, canon timeline be damned. It's a mod I heartily recommend if you're more of a veteran looking to spice things up, especially after the show's efforts to tie lore from different games together.</p>
<p>For now, we highly recommend focusing on the series' present and near future. Later this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a> will be making its debut on Nintendo hardware with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-announces-fallout-4-anniversary-edition-confirms-nintendo-switch-2-version-for-2026">an ambitious Switch 2 port of 2025's Anniversary Edition</a>, so that's neat.</p>
