            <p>
Everybody loves palpating their turnips; just look at the success of Stardew Valley and its ilk for proof of that. But it turns out people <em>really</em> love some vegetable action, if the staggering success of Roblox game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grow-a-garden">Grow a Garden</a> is any indication, given it's seemingly smashed through <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s previous gargantuan record for most players at the same time.
</p>
<p>
Let's break out some numbers. According to <a href="https://romonitorstats.com/experience/126884695634066/">third-party monitoring tools</a>, Grow a Garden - the specifics of which we'll get to shortly - soared past 16m concurrent players this weekend on Roblox (16,411,769 to be exact). By way of comparison, Fortnite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-showstopping-marvel-finale-drops-a-huge-cliffhanger">announced record-breaking concurrents of 15.3m players</a> during its Marvel season finale event back in Covid-era 2020.
</p>
<p>
So what, you may be wondering, has garnered all this attention? Grow a Garden is, according to its <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/126884695634066/Grow-a-Garden">official description</a> from developer The Garden Game, very much what it sounds like. It's a game of buying seeds, shoving them in the ground, then waiting for your blueberries, coconuts, daffodils etc. to grow - which they'll happily do whether you're in-game or offline.
</p>
<p>
After that, you can sell your massive produce for profit, purchasing more seeds or temporary boosts you'll need to slowly craft in real-time, then start the whole cycle over again. Frankly, absolutely nothing about it sounds like the sort of thing that might capture the imagination of 16m players all at once, but then I'm not a 13-year-old looking to do something mindless online with my friends after school. Also, there're <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-grow-a-garden-pets-eggs-how-to-get">Grow a Garden pets</a>, so maybe that's the appeal.
</p>
<p>
As to how Grow a Garden's impressive 16m concurrent users stacks up with other games, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> currently holds the Steam record for most concurrent players, coming in at a comparatively paltry 3.3m, while it's nearest rival, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, barely squeaks over the 2.4m player threshold. In fact, Steam itself recently saw a concurrent high of 40m players, so Grow a Garden's 16m looks positively gargantuan given we're talking about a single game.
</p>
<p>
Whether all those players <em>should</em> be playing Roblox is another matter entirely, of course, given the game continues to be embroiled in controversy amid ongoing accusations of child safety failures. Developer Roblox Corporation last year announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-announces-policy-changes-for-pre-teen-users-amid-ongoing-accusations-of-child-safety-failures">sweep of policy changes</a> - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-adding-further-parental-controls-as-its-belated-push-to-improve-child-safety-continues">updated parental controls</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-banning-social-hangouts-for-kids-under-13-due-to-user-behaviour-that-can-potentially-pose-a-risk">banning of social hangouts</a> for children under 13 - in a belated effort to improve things. Currently, Roblox Corporation is being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-under-investigation-by-the-us-securities-and-exchange-commission">investigated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission</a>, possibly due to reports it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/damning-roblox-report-claims-company-inflates-player-numbers-to-investors-by-as-much-as-42">previously misled investors by inflating player numbers</a>, although the reason hasn't been made public.

            <p>Today's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> patch has removed the ability to damage other players in PvP by ramming them with your vehicle, killing the popular PvP tactic.</p>
<p>Tactic is perhaps too strong a word. Hordes of players in Dune: Awakening's Deep Desert end game zone were tracking solos down in orniphopters. If they found them in an orniphopter of their own, they'd shoot them down with missiles.</p>
<p>The real problem emerged if they were on foot. Prior to the patch, if you were hit by a orniphopter you'd be knocked down into a revive state. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-is-being-dominated-by-one-busted-technique-crushing-people-with-helicopters">These pilots then waited for you to self-revive, then crushed you again</a>, leading to a loop of roadkillification.</p>

<p>This trend didn't go down particularly well, with creative director Joel Bylos popping onto Reddit to say the team were working on a fix. This appears to be that fix, and it's going down well among the community. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lebm3l/comment/myggtgi/?context=3">Ciyeelo on Reddit</a> responded with: "Thank fucking god because so-called beta testers Guild with ðŸ¤“ 10k hours of game play was abusing this Day 3 of the early release."</p>
<p>Others still desired additional changes. A popular sentiment is that the vehicles themselves should take damage when taking major bumps. As Illustrious-Hawk-898 puts it: "Being able to ride a buggy off the rim of the Hagga Rift to the bottom, and not taking damage; or flying a thopter into a wall at 160km are some of the most immersion breaking aspects of this game".</p>
<p>So what does this mean for the future of Dune: Awakening? Well, big groups of orniphopter gangs will likely still remain a powerful threat. Even if they can't ram you, five of them rushing you all at once is a little insurmountable. However this change should allow players to line up shots with Lasguns and Rocket Launchers a little easier, especially once more players get their hands on the tier six materials required to create them.</p>
<p>These twists and turns are to be expected in a large PvP setting like the one present in Dune: Awakening's end game. If it sounds like something you're interested in, why not check out Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-review">Dune: Awakening review</a>! It covers the end game, describing it as a "weekly political boxing match that I've found endlessly captivating".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
