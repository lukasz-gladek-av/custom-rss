            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is officially coming to Xbox Series X/S on the 26th August.</p>
<p>This announcement came via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXIFF4D6LOs&amp;ab_channel=HELLDIVERS%E2%84%A22">a Helldivers announcement stream</a>. Arrowhead's hit third-person shooter will have full crossplay with both PC and PlayStation. Those interested can pre-order the game on the Xbox store  for £34.99 now.</p>
<p>It's also the first ever Sony-published game on Xbox platforms, which is certainly a massive milestone in the ongoing rivalry between the two companies (Sony's baseball series MLB The Show is published by MLB on Xbox). <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-remaining-thoughtful-about-how-and-if-it-brings-games-to-additional-platforms">Sony previously expressed interest in bringing its big games to more platforms</a>, with this Helldivers 2 port acting as the first big sign of this shift in strategy.

<p>Said game director Mikael Eriksson on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-xbox-release-date-pre-order/">Xbox Wire</a>: "We know gamers have been asking for this for some time and we are so excited to bring more <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> into our game. We have so much more in store for the future months and years – and the more players we have the more stories we can tell! The fight for Super Earth has only just begun."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-quietly-removes-pc-sale-restrictions-in-dozens-of-countries-for-four-huge-playstation-games">Helldivers 2 only recently had its geographical restrictions lifted on PC</a>, which had previously had people from countries including the Bahamas, Armenia, Burkina Faso and many more unable to play the smash hit. Now, with the game coming to Xbox, it looks like one more massive wall keeping folks apart has crumbled.</p>
<p>Previously, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-roblox-riot-and-now-helldivers-tencent-just-acquired-a-15-stake-in-arrowhead-games">Tencent acquired a 15 percent stake in Arrowhead Games</a> for roughly $80m. A lofty sum for a chunk of what has certainly been a rare gem in the modern live service landscape.</p>
<p>For those who hop into the game on Xbox, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-sees-super-earth-itself-invaded">they'll have missed the Illuminate invasion of Super Earth</a>, as well as the special cape added to the game in memory <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-year-after-that-psn-fiasco-helldivers-2s-long-anticipated-review-bomb-cape-is-finally-here">of the review bomb fiasco</a>. Still, there's surely plenty more surprises yet to come for fresh-faced Xbox players.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-is-coming-to-xbox-series-xs-in-august-as-first-sony-published-game-on-the-platform]]></content:encoded>

            <p>EA's executive leadership has reportedly set a goal of 100 million players for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">the upcoming Battlefield game</a>, which "very few" developers believe is achievable.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/behind-the-next-battlefield-game-culture-clash-crunch-and-colossal-stakes/">This comes from a tell-all report from Ars Technica</a>, which explores the game's many ambitions and problems through information gathered from anonymous sources. In this article, battle royale modes in competitor titles like Call of Duty inspired this <em>optimistic </em>figure.</p>
<p>"Obviously, Battlefield has never achieved those numbers before," stated one source, while another said: "It's important to understand that over about that same period, 2042 has only gotten 22 million."</p>

<p>For reference, Call of Duty Warzone reached 100 million players back in April 2021 <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2021/04/Incredible-Warzone-and-Game-Sales-Milestones">per an official blog post</a>. Warzone originally came out in March 2020, so it took roughly a year for the biggest FPS IP out there to hit that figure. In 2018, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-fortnite-triggered-an-unwinnable-war-between-parents-and-their-boys-11545397200?mod=e2tw">a Fortnite interview in the Wall Street Journal</a> revealed the game had over 200 million people download and play the industry defining battle royale.</p>
<p>According to the report, those who had worked at DICE for a while were "particularly sceptical", with one source saying: "nothing in the market research or our quality deliverables indicates that we would be anywhere near that."</p>
<p>The article also states Battlefield 5's battle royale mode Firestorm failed to meet expectations, while the aforementioned competitors continued to retain vast playerbases. Nonetheless, it seems that a new attempt at this format is what EA leadership expects will attract much of that 100 million figure. </p>
<p>This new Battlefield is currently undergoing a closed alpha test, though that hasn't stopped leaks from getting out. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-leak-confirms-return-of-fan-favourite-mode">Rush mode has been leaked</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-single-player-campaign-details-leak-online">some single player campaign info</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-most-important-leaks-battlefield-6">a deluge of info on weapons and a battle royale mode</a>. If this next Battlefield can hit the targets set out by EA executives, it'll be the most popular Battlefield game ever by a large margin. Whether it actually can, is something else entirely.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reportedly-expects-battlefield-6-to-have-100-million-players-three-times-more-than-the-series-best-seller]]></content:encoded>
