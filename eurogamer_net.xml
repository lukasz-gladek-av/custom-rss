            <p>If you've been wondering just how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s Secure Boot requirement and anti-cheat system Javelin have been holding up during Battlefield 6's gargantuan open beta test, AC from EA's Anti-Cheat team has revealed that during the Open Beta alone, Javelin has blocked over 300,000 attempted cheat efforts and reviewed 100K+ potential cheaters.</p>
<p>"Your reports help us zero in and lead us to finding up-and-coming cheat communities, reporting one actual cheater often can lead to new detection techniques and help us keep them from impacting your experience," <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/battlefield-6-beta-feedback-en/update-battlefield-6-update-on-secure-boot--cheats/12439803">AC explained in a forum post updated over the weekend</a>. "Anti-Cheat isn't one and done, it's an ever-evolving battlefield, and what has worked for us previously or in different games doesn't always work in all of them."</p>

<p>"Since Open Beta Early Access’s launch, Javelin has prevented 330,000 attempts to cheat or tamper with anti-cheat controls, and [players have] reported 44,000 instances of potential cheaters during day one and another 60,000 so far today," AC added.</p>
<p>"We are already using these with our own Gameplay Integrity team to add and improve our detections for Battlefield 6. They are also working with the Battlefield Positive Play team, to actively remove those reported we confirm to be cheaters."</p>
<p>For those wondering why DICE was requiring Secure Boot in the first place, AC explained that Secure Boot "is not, and was not intended to be a silver bullet".</p>
<p>"Secure Boot is how you're helping us build up our arsenal. It’s another barrier that helps us make it harder for cheat developers to create cheat programs, and makes it easier for us to detect it when they do," AC wrote.</p>
<p>"Secure Boot prevents your machine from running with vulnerable drivers enabled. So if Secure Boot is running and we see those drivers loaded, we know something's a bit off."</p>
<p>Battlefield 6, is set to release on the 10th October. Everyone who requested access to Battlefield 6's Labs tests has been given access to these weekend tests, which - it turns out - is a lot of people. Don't worry if you can't get on this weekend, though; <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1954200952455544937">you can still complete the Weekend 1 challenges next week</a>, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-multiplayer-takes-a-bold-risky-new-direction">Connor's already spent some quality time with the highly-anticipated shooter, writing</a>: "[Playing Battlefield 6] leaves me in a state of cautious optimism. I think the building blocks for a truly fantastic Battlefield game are here with Battlefield 6 - perhaps even an all-time great - but I need to see a little more, need to play a little more. I need to see where the dice fall, whether the gamble of bold gameplay changes land well - where the hivemind of Battlefield's playerbase find new strategies beyond the this-beats-that approach of old, say - or whether they simply muddy an otherwise potentially brilliant experience."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-anti-cheat-system-has-already-prevented-330000-attempts-to-cheat-or-tamper-with-anti-cheat-controls]]></content:encoded>

        <p>But fans say "this offers zero clarity" on the future of the series.</p>

            <p>Microsoft has "assured players that Turn 10 and Playground Games will continue to support Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5".</p>
<p>In the wake of brutal cuts which saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">over 9000 employees laid off from Microsoft last month</a>, including across its gaming divisions, the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">The Initiative's Perfect Dark reboot, and a new ZeniMax MMORPG were all cancelled</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/candy-crush-developer-king-reportedly-replacing-laid-off-staff-with-ai-tools-they-helped-to-build">roughly 200 staff from Candy Crush developer King were laid off</a> and reportedly replaced by the AI tools they helped to build.</p>
<p>At the time, Microsoft told Eurogamer the layoffs were "necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace". A few days later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-motorsport-is-no-more-claims-former-turn-10-employee-following-microsoft-cuts">we reported Forza Motorsport was "no more", according to a former employee at developer Turn 10 Studios</a>, though it was emphasised that the Horizon series will continue.</p>

<p>Now Microsoft has again stressed that support is ongoing, writing on social media: "Dear Forza Community, we know many of you have questions about what’s next for the Forza franchise, and we appreciate the support of our incredible community.</p>
<p>"We wanted to assure players that Turn 10 and Playground Games will continue to support Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5. To start, here’s more info about what’s coming next to Forza Motorsport". The post then linked to a <a href="http://aka.ms/FMUpdate21Tours">webpage</a>.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Dear Forza Community, we know many of you have questions about what’s next for the Forza franchise, and we appreciate the support of our incredible community.

<p>Interestingly, Microsoft didn't outline what's next for the Horizon franchise, only pledged commitment to the latest in the series, Forza Horizon 5. As racing driver and content creator Steve Alvarez Brown, aka SuperGT, <a href="https://x.com/_SuperGT/status/1953515312621449397">pointed</a> out, "this offers zero clarity as to whether Forza Motorsport will continue beyond the current game."</p>
<p>Last month, we learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-forza-horizon-5-is-ps5s-highest-selling-game-of-the-year-so-far-says-analyst">was the highest-selling game on PS5 this year so far, surpassing 3 million copies sold</a>. Though previously an Xbox-exclusive, Forza Horizon 5 released on Sony's rival platform at the end of April.</p>
<p>By comparison, Forza Horizon 5 has been played by more than 45.5 million players across Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, though predominantly via the Game Pass subscription, since its release in 2021. On Steam, it's sold a further 6.5m copies (also since 2021).</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-stresses-it-will-continue-to-support-forza-motorsport-and-horizon-5-despite-cuts-at-studio-turn-10]]></content:encoded>
