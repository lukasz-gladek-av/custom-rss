            <p>Nintendo has announced its Alarmo clock will be available on general sale in Japan in May.</p>
<p>Previously, only Nintendo Switch Online members have been able to order the alarm clock worldwide, though in Japan a lottery system was put in place due to its popularity.</p>
<p>A wider launch of the clock was expected in mid-January, but this was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-hits-snooze-on-alarmos-public-release">later postponed to early March</a> due to stock shortages. The clock will finally be ready for general sale in May - but only in Japan.</p>

<p>Nintendo Japan added an update to its <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/information/2024/1204.html">Alarmo notice</a>, stating the launch date for non-members will be 22nd May 2025, both from the My Nintendo Store and game retailers. Pre-orders will open before this, though a date is unknown.</p>
<p>So far this is only in Japan, but presumably news of a worldwide general release will follow.</p> <div>

<p>First revealed in October, the Alarmo is an interactive alarm clock that responds to your body's movements by playing different sounds based on Nintendo video games.</p>
<p>Indeed, Nintendo has today added classic sound effects from Super Mario Bros. on the NES to the device, available to download for free.</p>

<p>Last month, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-coming-in-june-at-400-former-nintendo-employee-predicts">former Nintendo employee</a> - sales lead in the sales and retail department - suggested the Alarmo release being tied to Nintendo Online accounts may have been an intentional test ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> pre-orders.</p>
<p>Switch 2 is yet to have its release date announced. Perhaps the general sale of Alarmo in May will free up Nintendo's online store for the new console.</p>
<p>"Alarmo's clever motion sensor is the star of the show in this pricey Nintendo-coated lifestyle gadget that otherwise skimps on the fun," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-alarmo-review-marios-charm-cant-justify-alarm-clocks-90-price-tag">Alarmo review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Doom: The Dark Ages serves as a prequel to 2016's Doom and its sequel Doom Eternal, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-is-an-origin-story-for-the-doom-slayers-rage">tells the "epic cinematic origin story of the Doom Slayer's rage"</a>. But, even though it's a prequel, don't expect The Dark Ages to end with the Slayer being popped in a coffin.</p>
<p>As a reminder, 2016's Doom opens with the Slayer lying in a coffin, before he swiftly breaks free from the chains binding him so he can shoot the faces off advancing baddies. It is quite the way to kick things off.</p>
<p>So, if The Dark Ages is going to set us up for Doom 2016, surely we already know how the upcoming game is going to end, right? Wrong!</p>

<p>"I mean, that would end the Dark Ages, the medieval chapter of the Doom saga. This is kind of like the Chronicles of the Slayer," Doom: The Dark Ages game director Hugo Martin told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/doom-the-dark-ages-wont-end-with-the-slayer-in-a-coffin-waiting-for-the-start-of-doom-2016-that-would-mean-that-we-couldnt-tell-any-more-medieval-stories/">PC Gamer</a>, when asked about potentially seeing the Slayer getting locked away.</p>
<p>"So if we took it all the way to that point, then that would mean that we couldn't tell any more medieval stories. And I'm not announcing projects or anything other than to just say it's better to leave it open."</p>
<p>The game director added that the Doom: The Dark Ages team has some DLC planned for the prequel, so again putting the Slayer in a coffin during the main story wouldn't make sense.</p>
<p>"We do have a DLC and things like that, so it won't - I'm not giving away spoilers - but it doesn't end with him [in the coffin]," the developer continued.</p>
<p>"The story is that they collapsed a building on top of him and then put him inside of that sarcophagus that we find him in at the beginning of 2016," said Martin.</p>
<p>"And this game doesn't end that way."</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has today received its latest update, fixing a number of issues.</p>
<p>The update, known as ver.1.000.05.00, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-soon-to-fix-monster-hunter-wilds-issue-where-its-celebrated-food-scenes-arent-showing">was announced last week</a>, and now that it's live Capcom has released a full list of fixes.</p>
<p>Alongside an issue where the game's celebrated food scenes weren't showing, other fixed issues include the Monster Field Guide not being accessible (which is pretty crucial), players falling through the map after the Towards Fervent Fields mission in Chapter 2-1, and issues with screen rendering causing force quits.</p>

<p>A full list of fixes can be found in the <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/support/wilds/en/faq/detail/060">patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>Capcom has also updated its list of known issues. These will presumably be fixed in the next patch, though some of these issues have been on this list for the past couple of patch notes.</p>
<p>The known issues are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A network error occurs when firing an SOS flare right after a quest begins.</li>
<li>Link Members are not prioritized over other players and may not appear in some places including Base Camps.</li>
<li>Palico’s attacks with blunt weapons do not inflict stun and exhaust damages.</li>
<li>Hunter Profile cannot be edited properly on some occasions.</li>
<li>Some side missions cannot be completed under certain situations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Capcom has requested players restart the game and update to the latest version before playing again.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds has proven exceptionally popular since its release at the end of February. While Steam player numbers have taken a dip, its all-time concurrent player count peak was at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">over 1.38 million players during its first weekend</a>. That's the fifth highest peak ever on the platform.</p>
<p>The game sold 8m copies in its first three days on sale to become <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">Capcom's fastest-selling game ever</a>. That number will have risen even further since.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new filing from the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) has confirmed multiple Switch 2 features.</p>
<p>Now we know Amiibo figurines will be supported, as Switch 2 will support NFC - it's in the right Joy-Con, just like the original Switch.</p>
<p>It's also confirmed to have faster Wi-Fi compatibility with support for Wi-Fi 6 networks with up to 80MHz of bandwidth, up from Wi-Fi 5 on the original Switch. However, it doesn't appear to support the more recent Wi-Fi 7 or Wi-Fi 6E.</p>

<p>Further, we already knew Switch 2 would have USB-C ports both on top and at the bottom of the console, but these filings confirm both ports can be used to charge the console.</p>
<p>We also now know the Switch 2's code designation is BEE, with BEE-001 being the model of the console, BEE-012 and 014 being the left and right Joy-Cons, and BEE-053 being the Relay Box.</p>
<p>Similarly, the GameCube had the code DOL (for Dolphin) and the Wii had RVL (for Revolution).</p>
<p>Below are images from the filings (thanks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/625931/nintendo-switch-2-fcc-nfc-wi-fi-6-usb">The Verge</a>).</p>

<p>Little is known about the console so far, beyond its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">reveal back in January</a>, but it's hoped the Direct will provide a wealth of information: from its release date and price, to the launch line-up.
