            <p>The Tomb Raider TV series from Amazon and Phoebe Waller-Bridge looks to no longer be happening.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14569897/Phoebe-Waller-Bridge-gravy-train.html">Daily Mail</a> sources, the project is - much like many animals and people that Lara Croft crosses paths with - "dead". </p>
<p>Meanwhile, when it comes to reports that Game of Thrones' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-thrones-sophie-turner-reportedly-in-talks-to-play-lara-croft-in-amazons-tomb-raider-tv-series">Sophie Turner was set to star as the series' globe-trotting lead</a>, a source said that "this is not going ahead".</p>

<p>The Mail's report comes after <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/jennifer-salke-steps-down-as-head-of-amazon-mgm-studios-segues-to-producing-with-first-look-deal/ar-AA1BNwen?ocid=BingNewsSerp">Jennifer Salke announced she was stepping down as head of Amazon MGM Studios</a> after seven years. Salke was a driving force behind getting Phoebe Waller-Bridge on board with Amazon.</p>
<p>According to an interview with Puck, and reported by <a href="https://screenrant.com/tomb-raider-show-prime-video-phoebe-waller-bridge-no-script-report/">Screen Rant</a>, Waller-Bridge is yet to even produce a script for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a>.</p>
<p>"Tomb Raider, which Waller-Bridge has been working on and which Salke was personally overseeing after announcing a series pickup last May, has now gone through two writers rooms and tens of millions of dollars in development costs," reads the report.</p>
<p>While things aren't looking promising for Amazon's Tomb Raider series, the company is yet to officially announce the project has been scrapped. Eurogamer has contacted the company for more information.</p>

<p>We first got wind of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">Waller-Bridge's Tomb Raider Amazon series in 2023</a>, before it was firmed up further in May last year.</p>
<p>"If I could tell my teenage self that this was happening, I think she'd explode,"  <a href="https://www.tombraider.com/news/movies-and-tv/prime-video-orders-tomb-raider-live-action-series">said Waller-Bridge at that time</a>. "Tomb Raider has been a huge part of my life and I feel incredibly privileged to be bringing it to television with such passionate collaborators. </p>
<p>
"Lara means a lot to me, as she does to many, and I can't wait to go on this adventure. Bats 'n all."

<p>Along with the series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-games-working-with-crystal-dynamics-on-next-tomb-raider">Amazon is also working with Crystal Dynamics on the next Tomb Raider game</a>. Details have remained fairly sparse for the upcoming Tomb Raider since it was announced. In fact, all we really know right now is that it is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-announces-next-tomb-raider-game-made-in-unreal-engine-5">being made in Unreal Engine 5</a> and will have "mind-bending puzzles to solve" and a "wide variety of enemies to face and overcome".</p>
<p>In August last year, Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-huge-huge-task-but-things-are-going-well">development on the upcoming Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon was "going well"</a>, but did not elaborate much further than that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Just in case you were getting anxious about needing a PlayStation Network account to play Marathon - the upcoming reimagined PvP extraction shooter from the Sony-owned Bungie - on PC and Xbox, I have good news - you won't!</p>
<p>In response to a comment shared on Marathon's Discord channel in which one user said they were a tad "spooked" by the idea of having to use a PSN login to play, the Marathon team replied with a clear cut and straight to the point message:</p>
<p>"Marathon will not require a PlayStation Account for players on PC and Xbox."</p>

<p>The conversation around the PlayStation Network - which is an online gaming and media content distribution service - kicked off last year, when Sony announced it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">retroactively making accounts mandatory for Helldivers 2 on PC</a>. At this time, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> publisher said this was all to do with safety and security, adding it was always meant to be a requirement for Helldivers 2 players on PC, but due to issues at launch, linking was made optional for a period of time.</p>
<p>However, the company's decision was met with intense backlash from the community, which included the game getting an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">influx of negative reviews on Steam</a>. Sony ultimately <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">overturned its-then plans to enforce mandatory PSN linking for Helldivers 2 players on PC</a>, and has since softened its PSN stance further afield.</p>
<p>In January of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-pulls-controversial-psn-account-requirements-for-marvels-spider-man-2-and-other-games-on-pc">Sony announced it was going to be removing those mandated PSN account requirements</a> from a number of its PC releases, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarok</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Remastered, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> and The Last of US Part 2 Remastered.</p>
<p>It still wants to give players an incentive to sign up to a PSN account, though. On the PC release of The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered earlier this month, the team at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastereds-pc-specs-and-features-detailed-as-sony-reiterates-no-psn-account-required">Sony used the promise of 50 in-game points to activate bonus features</a>, along with a new Ellie skin featuring<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-hate-directed-at-the-last-of-us-part-2-naughty-dog-boss-says-next-game-about-the-entirely-uncontroversial-topics-of-faith-and-religion"> Jordan A. Mun's jacket from Naughty Dog's upcoming Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> to entice players to login.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, it is unknown if Sony will do something similar to encourage players to use a PSN account while playing Marathon. We have asked PlayStation for a comment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-quietly-removes-explicit-game-featuring-extreme-sexual-violence-from-steam-in-uk<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><strong>Content Warning: This article includes references to extreme sexual violence, please read on at your own discretion. </strong></p>
<p>Valve has removed a Steam game which contained explicit sexual violence from sale in various countries, including the UK, following media attention. </p>
<p>The Steam page for No Mercy described the game as "a 3D choice-driven adult visual novel with a huge focus on incest and male domination". Gameplay footage seen by Eurogamer included non-consensual sex.</p>
<p>When No Mercy first came to our attention, Eurogamer contacted Valve for comment regarding the game's themes and graphic content, and asked why it had been allowed onto the PC storefront, but we did not hear back. Now, Valve has quietly removed No Mercy from sale in the UK and other countries.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, UK technology secretary Peter Kyle berated Valve for allowing No Mercy to be sold. "We expect every one of those [tech] companies to remove content as soon as they possibly can after being made aware of it," Kyle told <a href="https://www.lbc.co.uk/tech/steam-violent-misogyny-video-game-no-mercy/">LBC</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/uk-minister-slams-valve-for-explicit-game-promoting-non-consensual-sexual-contact-and-sexual-violence">GamesIndustry.biz</a>). "That's what the law requires, it is what I require as a secretary of state, and it is certainly how we expect platforms who operate and have the privilege of access to British society, and British economy, to do."</p>
<p>While No Mercy's Steam page did warn that the game included violent, graphic imagery and themes, Valve's storefront allows anyone to view product pages by simply inputting a date of birth via a drop-down menu, with no further checks necessary. </p>
<p>The Game Ratings Authority, which administers the PEGI system in the UK, stated "games on Steam can optionally apply for a PEGI age rating via our classification process", however this is "not mandated by the platform" ahead of a game's release on the storefront.</p>
<p>It added the Games Rating Authority had "not classified this game" prior to its release on Steam, and nor had it been requested to do so since.</p>
<p>In an additional statement shared with GamesIndustry.biz, CEO of Women in Games Dr Marie-Claire Isaaman said the organisation was "appalled by recent reports surrounding a Steam game, which encourages players to 'become every woman's worst nightmare' and 'never take no for an answer'."</p>
<p>Isaaman said the availability of games such as No Mercy on Steam was "utterly unacceptable", as it "sends a clear and distressing message: that violence against women is not only tolerable, but playable".</p>
<p>"That message has no place in our industry, our communities, or our society," Isaaman said.</p>
<p>GamesIndustry.biz has also now reported that No Mercy is unavailable for sale in Australia and Canada.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has again reached out to Valve for comment on No Mercy, asking why it was ever allowed on Steam, and about its subsequent removal from the platform.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-gives-away-free-loading-screen-showing-the-stock-market-crashing-while-the-stock-market-is-crashing<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Log into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> at any point over the next week, and you'll unlock a free in-game loading screen showing the game's stock market crashing. 
</p>
<p>
The well-timed stunt comes as economies around the world react to the ever-changing impact of US tarrifs in real time - though the giveaway is primarily designed to highlight the current storyline in Epic Games' battle royale.
</p>
<p>
Fortnite's giveaway of The Big Dillbits Crash loading screen is live now, and lasts until next Tuesday, 15th April. Maybe everything will be fine by then.
</p>
<p>
The image shows Fletcher Kane, the villain of Fortnite's current season, reacting in shock as his BitCoin-esque virtual currency suddenly collapses, ruining his financial hold over the Fortnite Island. 
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/a29d9e01-c7f3-4b0d-8406-cfcb59020faa.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

</figure>
<p>
Fortnite had raised some fan eyebrows by introducing the concept of a planet-burning virtual currency, DillBits, to its storyline. In-game, players can obtain DillBits by robbing vaults, and spend them in nearby Black Market stores for exotic weaponary. 
</p>
<p>
At first, DillBits were presented as the source of enormous wealth, and were being championed by fan-favourite character Midas - someone able to create unlimited gold simply by touching something with his bare hands. Why would he need more money, though, players wondered?
</p>
<p>
Now, it turns out that DillBits was a deliberate hustle by Midas and company, designed to ruin Fletcher Kane and end his reign over the Island by suckering him into a BitCoin-like scam. Nice.
</p>
<p>
Fortnite seasons are planned months in advance, and Epic Games likely had this loading screen ready to  launch for some time. But the decision to release it to all players now, specifically, feels like a knowing nod about real-world events as well.
</p>
<p>
Back in the real world, the impact of US tarrifs on the global economy is still being felt, particularly by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-orders-in-canada">Nintendo fans in both the US and Canada</a> who are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">still waiting for news on when they will be able to pre-order a Switch 2</a> - and how much Nintendo will now charge.

            <p>Nintendo has confirmed that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> editions of original first-party Switch games will have the full game on the card rather than requiring a download - though that may not be the case for third-party titles.</p>
<p>Since the Switch 2's reveal last week, there's been some confusion about what exactly will be included on physical game cards.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-physical-releases-will-just-have-a-download-key-on-the-card">Nintendo previously stated the console will support both regular game cards and game-key cards</a>, with the latter being a "key" to downloading the full game.

<p>However, further confusion specifically arose around Switch 2 Edition games and whether the card would include both the original game and the upgrade package.</p>
<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.vooks.net/nintendo-confirms-no-download-codes-needed-for-physical-switch-2-edition-games/">Vooks</a>, a Nintendo spokesperson said: "Physical versions of Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games will include the original Nintendo Switch game and its upgrade pack all on the same game card (ie. they are exclusively Nintendo Switch 2 game cards, with no download code)."</p>
<p>They added: "Alternatively, some publishers may release Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games as download codes in physical packaging, with no game card."</p>
<p>This confirms the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> will be complete on the game card. Third-party publishers may still opt for download codes, though.</p>
<p>These Switch 2 Edition games upgrade the originals with new features to make use of the new console's capabilities, be it improved frame rates or camera usage. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-edition-ports-of-og-switch-games-cost-65-in-uk">They will cost £65 here in the UK</a>.</p>
<p>In particular, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-closer-look-at-kirby-and-the-forgotten-lands-remixed-switch-2-worlds">Kirby and the Forgotten Land will include expanded worlds</a>, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> will have mouse control support.</p>
<p>No matter what's on the game card, though, don't lick them - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-games-will-still-taste-so-bad-you-will-want-to-spit-them-out">Nintendo has confirmed the cards still purposefully taste awful</a> to stop players eating them.</p>
