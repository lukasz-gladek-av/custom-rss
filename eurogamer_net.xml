            <p>The Alters - the upcoming survival game from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/this-war-of-mine">This War of Mine</a> team 11 bit Studios - has landed itself a release date.</p>
<p>Described as an "emotional" sci-fi game featuring plenty of cloning action, The Alters plops players into the shoes of simple worker Jan Dolski. However, while on a space mission, things don't exactly go to plan for Jan (poet and didn't know it), and soon this once simple man discovers his very survival depends on clones of himself. These versions of Jan are identical in form and they share some memories, however this clone crew possess different skills and emotions to others. This includes, 11 bit Studios says, emotional baggage.</p>
<p>As to when you can get your hands on The Alters' very personal journey of survival, well that will be 13th June across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. It will also be available on Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass.</p>

<p>Along with this release date news, The Alters team has also shared a new release date trailer, which gives us a look at the game's "unique" biomes and deadly anomalies.</p>
<p>"Levitating rocks and eerie distortions of reality catch your attention immediately, while other singularities remain invisible to the naked eye and require special tools to uncover. In every case, without a careful approach, you risk instant death, radiation-induced injuries, or even the disintegration of time and space itself," reads the blurb, adding the "heightened radioactivity" at nighttime "can eat right through your suit", which doesn't sound pleasant.</p>
<p>"These dangers add yet another layer to the survival experience, turning every expedition into a high-stakes puzzle," the developer states.</p>
<p>You can check out The Alters' release date trailer below.</p>

<p>Our Bertie has already had some time with The Alters. "It's a glimpse of a game that intrigues me but also leaves me slightly confused," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-war-of-mine-devs-clone-survival-game-the-alters-is-a-curious-blend">Eurogamer's The Alters preview from 2023</a>.</p>
<p>"This War of Mine had a much clearer idea - living as a civilian through war - whereas The Alters seems more speculative and fragmented. Is it a mining game? Is it a survival game? Is it a game about clones? I think it's trying to be all three, but I'm not yet convinced it's managed. But like I say, I've only seen a glimpse, and if it turns out to be anything like This War of Mine, I'll be happy."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
