            <p>Guys, it is here. After what feels like days and days (and daaaaays) of page refreshes and thumb twiddling, Nintendo has finally lifted the lid perhaps not fully but some of the way off its much anticipated Switch successor.</p>
<p>Today's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">short trailer for Switch 2</a>, to give it its proper name, is clearly designed to merely whet appetites at this time. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">Nintendo has announced a Direct in April</a>, when we can expect more details on the console, and maybe even what games we can expect to see (in addition to today's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">confirmation a new Mario Kart game is on the cards</a>).</p>
<p>But, while short, this trailer has seemingly confirmed that the Switch 2's Joy-Cons will boast that previously rumoured mouse functionality. At one point during the trailer, two Joy-Cons can be seen being pushed by an invisable force along a flat service, their wrist straps out the back like little mouse tails. Meanwhile, there seems to be some kind of attachment that gives the side of the Joy-Con a smooth edge.</p>

            <p>
As part of its highly anticipated (and heavily leaked) first look at Switch 2, Nintendo has shared another date for the calendar; the company has confirmed it'll be sharing more information on its new console on 2nd April this year.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">finally unveiled Switch 2 today</a> after weeks of leaks - but its announcement, as expected, was light on detail. It gave a first look at the machine itself - a fairly subtle revision of the original Switch's familiar form factor at first glance - plus a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">tease of a new Mario Kart game</a>.
</p>
<p>
It also reiterated Switch 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">will be backward compatible</a>, and is capable of playing both digital and physical Switch games. Beyond that, though, Nintendo is saving the juicier details for a later date. And unfortunately, it's going to be a bit of a wait, with the company confirming it'll hosting a Switch 2 focused Nintendo Direct on 2nd April this year.

<p>
That'll almost certainly be when the company does its proper deep dive into the console's features (Miiverse 2 please Nintendo, and Street Pass 2 while you're at it, thank you), alongside the full run-down of games coming to Switch 2 at launch and beyond. A new Mario Kart seems a certainty for launch at this point, for instance, and a Switch 2 version of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-gets-gorgeous-first-gameplay-trailer-and-its-out-next-year">long-in-development Metroid Prime 4</a> appears likely too. Additionally, previous whispers have suggested a new 3D Mario is coming later this year. April's Direct should also provide pricing details and a proper launch date beyond its current vague release window of "2025".
</p><p>

In addition to April's Direct, Nintendo has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-switch-2-public-hands-on-tour">confirmed it'll be holding a Switch 2 "world tour"</a> event, giving the public an opportunity to go hands-on with the console and, presumably, its launch line-up of games. That's due to run from early April to June, suggesting the console won't release until sometime after. Exciting times!
