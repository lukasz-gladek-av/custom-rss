            <p>
After a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-23-update-is-being-revealed-this-week-and-its-probably-got-something-to-do-with-cars">series of vehicular teases earlier this week</a>, CD Projekt has finally unveiled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s much-anticipated and mildly delayed 2.3 update, which - among other things - introduces self-driving (but sadly not flying) cars to Night City.
</p>
<p>
Cyberpunk's 2.3 update, developed in collaboration with Virtuous (presumably as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-development-has-finally-wound-down-after-three-and-a-half-years">most of CD Projekt is now busy on The Witcher 4</a>), is very much focused on traversal. It introduces four new vehicles - the Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru, Rayfield Caliburn "Mordred", Yaiba ASM-R250 Muramasa, and Chevillon Legatus 450 Aquila - plus several new Side Jobs to acquire them.
</p>
<p>
All these additions (and, indeed, any of your other vehicles), now support a new "autonomous driving feature" CD Projekt is calling AutoDrive. It'll ferry you to your chosen destination without needing to do any of that messy moving-your-hands business, or you can just sit back and enjoy a leisurely cruise around Night City to nowhere in particular if you prefer. And to really make the most of the ensuing sights, there's a cinematic camera for AutoDrive too.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, as of 2.3, Night City residents can - after completing the Don't Lose Your Mind job - summon the services of a self-driving Delamain Cab from the vehicle menu.
</p>
<p>
Also new is the Rayfield's CrystalCoat (and a cracked variant for lower-end vehicles), which you can capture on camera using some of the improvements to Photo Mode. There are 27 new spawnable NPCs, for instance, and outfits for everyone - including V - can be swapped while still in Photo Mode. Then there are new Look-At Camera options, depth of field improvements, new time, weather, and colour balance tabs, plus new stickers, frames, quotes, and overlays.
</p>
<p>
All this - which you can get a taste of in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFLKoZaHak8">today's 2.3 livestream</a> - arrives alongside a heap of fixes and enhancements, as detailed in <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51674/update-2-3-patch-notes">CD Projekt's extensive patch notes</a>. But expect the likes of Variable Refresh Rate support for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, plus support for AMD FSR 3.1 Frame Generation, Intel XeSS 2.0, and HDR10+ Gaming on PC.
</p>
<p>
Cyberpunk 2077's 2.3 update launches for most platforms (including Mac) tomorrow, 17th July. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> owners will need to wait bit, however, as it's hitting the platform "at a later date".
