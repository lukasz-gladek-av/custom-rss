            <p>CD Projekt has teamed up with Microsoft to create some fancy new Witcher 3-themed Xbox controllers to celebrate the game's 10th anniversary - which I really can't quite believe because I personally haven't aged a day.

</p><p>The controllers - officially known as the 'Xbox Wireless Controller - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> 10th Anniversary Special Edition' and the 'Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 - Core The Witcher 3 10th Anniversary Special Edition' - are described as being "tempered and battle-ready", and promise "intricately crafted details".</p>
<p>They feature The Witcher 3's wolf medallion iconography, as well as Glagolitic script. I personally don't know what the script says, but apparently it can be translated and those symbols "are not random". If you work out what it means, please let me know.</p>

<p>Away from the cosmetic sides of things, these chaps also boast all the features you'd expect from an Xbox controller. So, rubberised back grips, remappable controller inputs, Bluetooth support and so on. You can check how they look in the video above.</p>
<p>
They've been created by CD Projekt's own designers, with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/22/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-10th-anniversary-xbox-controllers/">Gabriela Pešková from CD Projekt and Mekias Bekalu from Xbox</a> calling this "such a special moment for both" teams.
</p>
<p>"We explored a lot of directions when creating this controller, but from the beginning we knew we wanted to tell a story," added CD Projekt design lead Joshua Flowers. "We wanted it to feel like something that has been with you on the path, something worn and personal. As we developed concepts, we began crafting the story of this controller - and how it might exist in The Witcher 3's world. This narrative is what we fell in love with. It had to feel like it belonged in The Witcher 3 universe - like it had lived through battles and carried stories of its own."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/accessories/controllers/the-witcher-special-edition-controllers">Xbox Wireless Controller variant is available now for £74.99</a> while the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/accessories/controllers/the-witcher-special-edition-controllers#elite">Xbox Elite Wireless Controller costs £149.99</a>. Both are exclusive to the Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>As for the future of the series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-after-2026-so-could-it-be-a-next-generation-game">The Witcher 4 won't be out until after 2026</a>, but we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">got a first trailer at the end of last year</a>. Earlier this week, Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-actor-celebrates-witcher-4-protagonist-ciri-following-woke-criticism">called out so-called fans as "stupid" for describing The Witcher 4 as "woke"</a> for having Ciri as the protagonist.</p>
