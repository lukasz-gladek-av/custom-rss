            <p>Puzzle &amp; Dragons developer Gung Ho has come under fire from its shareholders, who have complained about the extremely high salary of its president and poor returns on their investments.</p>
<p>Strategic Capital, an investment advisory firm, has submitted a <a href="https://stracap.jp/english/3765-GUNGHO.pdf">report</a> on behalf of company shareholders requesting Gung Ho "up its game" as it highlights a number of issues (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/all-youve-done-is-waste-100-billion-yen-japanese-gacha-game-giant-put-on-blast-by-shareholders-for-milking-same-hit-for-13-years-while-releasing-failures/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>The biggest is the salary of president Kazuki Morishita, who received 340m yen (Â£1.77m) in 2023. That's similar to the total remuneration of Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa (360m yen), and above similar figures at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, Sony, Capcom, Konami, and Bandai Namco.</p>

<p>That's despite Gung Ho relying on mobile gacha game Puzzle &amp; Dragons - its biggest hit - for revenue since its release in 2012, despite its revenue declining since 2014. Indeed, the report states Gung Ho has made less than a 10th of Nintendo's profits, despite their presidents having similar salaries.</p>
<p>While the company has released 20 games since 2012, including based on popular IPs from Disney and Yo-kai Watch, the company has reportedly not been able to shake its dependence on Puzzle &amp; Dragons.</p>
<p>The report estimates Gung Ho has spent over 100bn yen developing new titles, but these have collectively earned less than 10bn yen.</p>

<p>To summarise, then, Gung Ho has a single but gradually fading hit game, has struggled to release another success, and is led by a president taking home an extortionate salary that far exceeds company profits. And now there's friction between company leaders and shareholders.</p>
<p>Gung Ho did see huge success with Puzzle &amp; Dragons, a free-to-play match-three puzzle game that was the first mobile game to gross $1bn in revenue. In Japan, Nintendo even licensed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-licenses-mario-version-of-free-to-play-mobile-money-spinner-puzzle-and-dragons">Mario-themed version of the game for 3DS</a>.</p>
<p>Strategic Capital's report suggests reform by going private and a review of the remuneration system. It also states the company has "excessive" cash reserves, which (unlike Nintendo) is viewed negatively due to low value.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>EA and Maxis have issued a patch for the recently released Legacy editions of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims">The Sims 1</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-2">The Sims 2</a>.</p>
<p>These games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-1-2-re-releases-are-out-now-and-you-can-get-both-for-25">launched on Friday</a>, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-1-2-reportedly-getting-pc-re-releases-this-week">earlier rumours suggested the classic life-sim series was making a trip back to its roots</a>. However, when they launched, many players were met with a number of rather glitchy issues and game crashes. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314060/The_Sims_Legacy_Collection/#app_reviews_hash">Reviews</a> on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314070/The_Sims_2_Legacy_Collection/#app_reviews_hash">Steam</a> called the debut "farcical", "broken" and even a "waste of money", which has to sting. The games currently sit with a Mixed review average.</p>
<p>The team acknowledged the games had issues at the time, stating it would hop to it and sort out some fixes. And, true to its word, it has, sharing a generous set of patch notes for both The Sims 1 and 2 last night.</p>

</figure>
<p>Those who are enjoying the classic Sims game again (or, perhaps even for the first time, she writes suddenly realising there are people out there quite a bit younger than her who may not have been around when these games first came out) should now notice less crashes.</p>
<p>Additionally, players should now be able to click on parts of the neighbourhood they were initially not able to, despite it clearly intended to be doable. The travel screen should also not be quite to "garbled or glitched" now.</p>
<p>You can check out the full patch notes for The Sims Legacy and The Sims 2 Legacy below:</p>
<p><strong>The Sims Fixed Issues: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Alt+Tab or Alt+Enter can sometimes cause a crash</li>
<li>Alt+Enter can sometimes cause the Windows title bar to be hidden</li>
<li>Alt+Enter can sometimes not toggle between full screen and windowed modes</li>
<li>On some systems, The Sims can appear to launch and then immediately exit (no splash screen displayed)</li>
<li>The Sims should now launch in most situations</li>
<li>In some cases where there is an underlying graphics issue, The Sims will display a message</li>
<li>Some players are unable to click on various parts of the neighbourhood map</li>
<li>The travel screen, when traveling between neighbourhoods/worlds, can sometimes appear garbled or glitched</li>
<li>The Sims might crash if you are not on the default neighbourhood, interact with another Sim, and then save</li>
<li>When using Alt+Enter to cycle window and zoom sizes, the HUD could be clipped. At this zoom level, The Sims will now instead clip from the top of the screen.</li>
<li>In some situations in windowed mode the title bar might not be visible</li>
<li>The Family friends counter could sometimes not be visible</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Sims General Notes: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Several players have had problems (e.g. walls, floors, objects not showing up; game not launching; other oddities) that are addressed by updating graphics drivers to the latest versions. Please make sure your drivers are up to date.</li>
<li>The Sims game window is of a fixed size that can't have its basic properties changed after it has launched. Moving the window from a monitor to another with a different, lesser resolution can lead to unexpected results, possibly even crashes. If you want to run The Sims on that second monitor please use the option "-monitor: [open pointy brackets] num [close pointy brackets]" to force it to launch on the other monitor. "0" is your primary monitor, a second monitor is "1" and so on. We are investigating adding this as a menu option in the future.</li>
<li>In some situations, players have noted that music only plays in Live mode. Please check your computer sound options and make sure that everything is properly configured (e.g. on a 5.1 surround system make sure that your center speaker is functioning).</li>
<li>You might be prompted to "Enable the help system" every time you return to a house. This is the game trying to have you complete the tutorial. This will continue to happen until you complete the tutorial.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Sims 2 Fixed Issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Alt-Tab or Alt+Enter can sometimes cause a crash</li>
<li>Some players on EA App received an error message indicating that certain needed files were corrupt</li>
<li>The game would sometimes crash after creating a family</li>
<li>The game sometimes launched at a small resolution (800x600) and then scaled that small format to fill the entire monitor</li>
<li>In certain situations the game will launch and then immediately show a "DirectX" error, requiring use of the "-w" option to work around the problem</li>
<li>Sometimes a Sim (or multiple Sims) would disappear after the player moves to another lot or neighbourhood, or after leaving and rejoining the game despite saving</li>
<li>Sometimes non-adult Sims (children, pets) would disappear</li>
<li>Some interactions that result in a transferable reward (e.g. a dog returns from work) can cause the game to crash</li>
<li>Addressed some infinite loading screen issues</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Sims 2 General Notes: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Several players have had problems that are addressed by updating graphics drivers to the latest versions. Please make sure your drivers are up to date.</li>
<li>Remember that the "boolProp testingCheatsEnabled" cheat will cause the game to periodically show various dialogue boxes with debugging information in them. The cheat is working as expected.</li>
<li>We are investigating an issue where during certain cinematic events (such as Alien Abduction), the Sim can be reset and the event fails. While we are investigating this, you can work around the issue by making certain there are no other Sims on the lot to observe the event.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Sims team is still working on some remaining issues. "Some topics can require an extended investigation on our end, so even though these fixes may be in active review, it's not a guarantee that we'll have an immediate fix for it in the upcoming patch," it wrote in a <a href="https://forums.ea.com/blog/the-sims-game-info-hub-en/the-sims%E2%84%A2-legacy-and-the-sims%E2%84%A2-2-legacy-patch-notes/11861248">post regarding the latest patch</a>.</p>
<p>"Thank you for playing these games that are such a storied part of our history - starting 25 years ago!"</p>
<p>Please excuse me while I go and put in my dentures. </p></div>

            <p>
EA has become one of the first publishers to discuss - in broad terms - its plans for Switch 2, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">now Nintendo has finally lifted the lid on its next console</a>.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to investors last night following the release of its latest financial results, EA boss Andrew Wilson namechecked major franchises the company expected to find a home on Switch 2.
</p>
<p>
"Certainly, our expectation is that products like [EA Sports] FC and Madden and others might find real energy on the platform as they have done in the past," Wilson said. 
</p>

</div><figcaption>Nintendo Switch 2 and Mario Kart 9 have been revealed - but questions remain.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyPgPcxLlIk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
"When you think about something like The Sims and MySims: Cozy Bundle, which performed well ahead of our expectations, 50 percent of all players were new to EA," he continued. "That represents a great opportunity for us."
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 still lacks a release date, but with public hands-on events running in April and May, a summer launch seems likely. 
</p>
<p>
Could Switch 2 launch with the current <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a>? Or might EA decide to hold off until this autumn's next installment?
</p>
<p>
It's easy to see EA releasing existing titles in The Sims series on the new console - perhaps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-1-2-re-releases-are-out-now-and-you-can-get-both-for-25">the new Sims 1+2 Bundle</a>? Could EA also make use of the Switch 2's mysterious mouse pointer functionality also?
</p>
<p>
And how about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>? EA could try and launch that on Switch 2 as a way to boost sales, after previously saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-suggests-dragon-age-the-veilguard-might-have-sold-better-if-it-was-live-service-so-what-does-this-mean-for-mass-effect-5">the game had not met its own expectations</a>.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">there's the next Battlefield</a>. EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-expected-to-release-before-april-2026">still seems unsure exactly when it will land</a> (we may know more after Rockstar decides on a date for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>), but could Switch 2 have the horsepower to run that? It'll be intriguing to find out. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">Nintendo is next set to discuss Switch 2 in April</a>, via a special Nintendo Direct laying out more detail on the upcoming console. We're expecting to hear a launch date and price then - as well as more information on the games we'll all be playing, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">other than the next Mario Kart</a>.
