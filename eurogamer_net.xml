            <p>Ladder launching will soon be removed in an upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> patch, according to lead producer David Sirland.</p>
<p>The act of ladder launching allows players to essentially bounce off Assault Ladders to get a sudden boost of speed up into the air, allowing for unintentional mobility options and alternative angles of attack. It is absolutely a bug and needs to be removed, but on the other hand, it is really fun to do! So you should probably give it a go while you can.</p>
<p>Sirland, asking for general feedback on X following the initial launch of Battlefield 6, outright confirmed this bug in particular will be removed in an upcoming patch. He wrote: "Please keep the feedback coming! With the first weekend for BF6 in the wild, we are bound to have found issues, problems, stuff you like to see change - perhaps even praise? It's still all good, I want to know. And the team is eager to show you how much we care!"</p>

<p>Other suggestions Sirland publicly acknowledged include names for objective points, as well as problems with helicopter spawns. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-issues-fix-for-jump-momentum-bug-and-is-monitoring-breakthrough-player-counts">Quick hotfixes have already been pushed out to fix movement bugs</a>, so it looks as though Battlefield 6 will certainly continue to get improvements in the coming weeks, as the game marches towards its major season one update on the 28th October.</p><p>Assault Ladders it seems are a source of a few headaches, at least as far as bugs are concerned.

It even broke the EA app, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-issues-free-premium-battlefield-6-season-passes-to-ea-app-pre-orderers-frozen-out-of-the-game">forcing the company to hand out free premium battle passes to frozen-out users</a>.</p>

            <p>Banjo-Kazooie director Greg Mayles has confirmed he's now left Rare after 36 years at the British studio.</p>
<p>News broke of his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-and-banjo-kazooie-director-gregg-mayles-reportedly-leaving-rare-after-35-years">departure in the wake of layoffs at Microsoft</a> back in July, but now Mayles himself has announced his departure on social media - fittingly, with a rhyme.</p>
<p>N64 platformer Banjo-Kazooie was known for its script of rhyming couplets, and this charming post references plenty of the games Mayles worked on, from Battletoads and Donkey Kong, to Grabbed by the Ghoulies and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/viva-piata">Viva Piñata</a>.</p>

<p>In total, Mayles worked on almost 30 games for Rare.</p>
<p>While his announcement gives no specific reason for leaving the studio, he was overseeing development on the now-cancelled Everwild, which presumably prompted his departure.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Today was my last day at <a href="https://twitter.com/RareLtd?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RareLtd</a>. Thanks to everyone who played and enjoyed any of the games I helped create while I was there. Also thanks to all the people that worked on the games alongside me. It seemed fitting that I should say farewell with one final rhyme! <a href="https://t.co/X54u8Bc2oI">pic.twitter.com/X54u8Bc2oI</a></p>— Gregg Mayles (@Ghoulyboy) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ghoulyboy/status/1978112736270655778?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>It comes at a rocky time for Rare. Acquired by Microsoft back in 2002, the studio has struggled to reach the same success it had on the N64. Live-service pirate game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, released in 2019, is its biggest recent hit, incidentally directed by Mayles.</p>
<p>Yet in July <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">Microsoft laid off a number of employees across its gaming division</a>. Rare's long-in-development Everwild was cancelled, as was The Initiative's Perfect Dark - a reboot of Rare's shooter series.</p>
<p>Executive producer Louise O'Connor also reportedly left the company alongside Mayles, having joined the studio in 1999 for N64 platformer Conker's Bad Fur Day.</p>
<p>As such, it's now unclear what Rare is working on next beyond continued development on Sea of Thieves. The departure of top developers further puts the studio's future into question.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-screenshots-of-rares-ill-fated-everwild-emerge-thanks-to-artists-portfolio-website">First screenshots of Everwild leaked</a> earlier this week, providing a look at the game's UI. Little was known about the game beyond the trailers officially released. Similarly, details on the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-leak-fresh-info-suggests-studio-saw-gap-in-the-market-with-metal-gear-solid-and-bond-absent"> Perfect Dark reboot leaked last month</a>.</p>
