            <p>The Witcher spin-off studio The Molasses Flood has been absorbed into parent company CD Projekt Red.</p>
<p>The news was shared with a <a href="https://www.themolassesflood.com/">brief statement on the studio's website</a>. "We want to let you know that on April 1, 2025, The Molasses Flood LLC ('TMF') merged with CD Projekt Red Inc. ('CDPR Inc.'), a company being a part of the CD Projekt Group," the notice reads.</p>
<p>"As a result of the merger TMF, in its former legal state (of a separate legal entity) ceased its operations, while CDPR Inc. assumed the rights and obligations of TMF."</p>

<p>The studio assured that this merger "will not affect the availability or distribution of The Flame in The Flood and Drake Hollow video games", and these titles will continue to be published by CD Projekt Group.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/damian-isla-815a46_well-its-the-end-of-an-era-tucked-away-activity-7315404560620044288-Qazy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAoO_OkB-VfPR7dhiZ-PZ-9sf_EfWliEy1k">post on LinkedIn</a>, The Molasses Flood co-founder Damian Isla called this merger a "GOOD AND HEALTHY thing for the studio", and something that had been expected for some time now.</p>
<p>"It breaks down some organisational barriers, and better integrates the TMF team with the rest of the amazing CDPR org," Isla wrote, before announcing he had departed the studio.</p>
<p>"Last Monday - the last day of TMF's legal existence! - was also my last day at the studio," the developer shared. "Obviously this is a big change. TMF has been a huge part of my life for the past decade plus, and I'm proud [to] have been a part of building something that lasted as long as TMF did, in a market environment often quite hostile to tiny teams like ours."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-buys-the-flame-in-the-flood-developer-the-molasses-flood">CD Projekt acquired The Molasses Flood</a> for an undisclosed fee back in 2021. The studio was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-red-announces-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-future-witcher-projects-outlined">tasked with bringing a part-solo, part-multiplayer experience set in The Witcher series to life</a>. However, this project - known as  Project Sirius - has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-spin-off-project-sirius-sounds-like-its-being-rebooted-from-scratch">hit a number of stumbling blocks since its conception</a>.</p>
<p>CD Projekt <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekts-stalled-the-witcher-spin-off-now-has-a-new-framework">shared an update on Project Sirius</a> in 2023, announcing its "work on defining a new framework" was now complete, but that news was followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-spin-off-studio-the-molasses-flood-hit-by-layoffs-following-project-reboot">layoffs at the Boston-based studio</a>.</p>
<p>Reflecting on this week's news, Isla said Project Sirius has a "bright future" and is "going to be an amazing game" on its release. </p>
<p>"I cannot wait until the rest of the world learns about what we've been working on," Isla wrote.</p>

<p>Elsewhere at CDPR, in December last year the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">studio lifted the lid on The Witcher 4</a>. This new saga will shift its focus away from Geralt of Rivia and toward a new protagonist in Ciri (pictured above).</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the developer confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-after-2026-so-could-it-be-a-next-generation-game">it doesn't plan to release The Witcher 4 by the end of 2026</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Rovio has announced a third <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/angry-birds">Angry Birds</a> film is on the way, due for release on 29th January 2027 to rival new Zelda and Sonic films.</p>
<p>The Angry Birds Movie 3, from Paramount, will see the likes of Jason Sudeikis (Ted Lasso), Josh Gad (Frozen), Rachel Bloom (Crazy Ex-Girlfriend), and Danny McBridge (The Righteous Gemstones) reprise their roles as the coloured birds from the hit mobile game.</p>
<p>The third film will also feature the likes of Keke Palmer (Nope), Lily James (Cinderella), Sam Richardson (Ted Lasso), Nikki Glaser (Golden Globe Awards), and Emma Myers (A Minecraft Movie).</p>

<p>John Rice will once again direct, following his work on the first Angry Birds film, while Thurop Van Orman will continue as screenplay writer from the sequel.</p>
<p>"We're very excited to be partnering with Paramount Pictures and extremely proud of our incredible cast," said John Cohen, producer. "Not only do we have Jason, Josh, Rachel and Danny returning to voice their fantastic characters, but they're surrounded by an all-star ensemble of comedic talent. These are some of the funniest people out there today, and we're so thrilled to have them all on board."</p>
<p>The first two Angry Birds films have grossed over $500m worldwide.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">A Minecraft Movie had the biggest US domestic opening weekend ever for a video game adaptation</a> last week and generated $301m worldwide on its first weekend. There are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">already talks for a sequel</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the third <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-film-franchise-surpasses-1bn-in-global-box-office-revenue">Sonic the Hedgehog film led to the film franchise surpassing $1bn</a> at the global box office.</p>
<p>So far, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-is-the-biggest-video-game-adaptation-ever">biggest video game film adaptation ever remains Nintendo's The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, which earned $500m globally in a single film. But perhaps this will be usurped by Minecraft.</p>
<p>No doubt the success of these films has spurred Paramount into creating a third Angry Birds film.</p>
<p>However, there is stiff competition. Next year will see the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">release of a second Mario film in April</a>, as Nintendo looks to capitalise on its previous success.</p>
<p>Then in 2027, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-movie-gets-a-release-date-but-its-still-a-few-years-away">Sonic the Hedgehog 4</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-movie-release-date-revealed-by-nintendo-and-its-not-as-far-away-as-you-might-have-feared">The Legend of Zelda</a> films will be released in March, following The Angry Birds Movie 3 two months prior.</p>
<p>Which film adaptation are you most excited to watch?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
