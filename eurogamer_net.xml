            <p><strong>UPDATE 10/08/25:</strong> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> continues to attract record numbers of players over the weekend, clocking up 521,079 concurrent players on Steam alone.</p>
<p>That's more than other multiplayer games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, making Battlefield 6 Steam's the eighteenth biggest game by concurrent numbers ever.</p>

<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY 09/08/25: </strong></p>
<p>Battlefield 6's open beta has been the series' biggest beta test ever.</p>
<p>On Steam alone, the shooter has clocked up <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?sort=peak">473,632 concurrent players</a> - that's simultaneous players, not total - making it one of the weekend's most-played games, behind only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, Dota 2, and PUBG.</p>
<p>It's also now the twenty-second biggest game on Steam <em>ever</em>, topping the phenomenal clamour for Monster Hunter Wilds, which also ran a PC beta which hit a concurrent peak of 463,798 players on Steam back in February.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6, which is set to release on the 10th October, is giving folks a chance to hop in early this weekend and the next. Everyone who requested access to Battlefield 6's Labs tests has been given access to these weekend tests, which - it turns out - is a lot of people. Don't worry if you can't get on this weekend, though; <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1954200952455544937">you can still complete the Weekend 1 challenges next week</a>, too.</p>
<p>If you're still keen to trial the Battlefield 6 beta, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-you-can-still-get-a-battlefield-6-multiplayer-early-access-code">you may be lucky enough to get a code via some avenues that are still open</a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mju6jz/bfcomms_a_quick_note_on_about_queues_and_early/">Just be aware of the queues if you get one</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-multiplayer-takes-a-bold-risky-new-direction">Connor's already spent some quality time with the highly-anticipated shooter, writing</a>: "[Playing Battlefield 6] leaves me in a state of cautious optimism. I think the building blocks for a truly fantastic Battlefield game are here with Battlefield 6 - perhaps even an all-time great - but I need to see a little more, need to play a little more. I need to see where the dice fall, whether the gamble of bold gameplay changes land well - where the hivemind of Battlefield's playerbase find new strategies beyond the this-beats-that approach of old, say - or whether they simply muddy an otherwise potentially brilliant experience."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-battlefields-biggest-open-beta-ever-says-ea]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Looks like Ubisoft may have prematurely posted about the project on its website.</p>

            <p>A TV show based on Ubisoft's Far Cry franchise is allegedly in development at FX.</p>
<p>Confirmation came not via a leak but apparently from Ubisoft itself, which posted about the show on its <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/2YgRby0tgbIWL7K03LKN4t/far-cry-series-adaptation-in-the-works-at-fx">own site</a> before quickly redirecting it back to the main page again, albeit not quite quickly enough to have escaped the notice of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1mlalqt/far_cry_series_adaptation_in_the_works_at_fx/">Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>Those who managed to access the page before it was removed report Rob Mac (Rob McElhenney) (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Mythic Quest, Welcome to Wrexham) and Hawley (Fargo, Alien: Earth) are the Far Cry series' co-creators. Hawley will also reportedly serve as showrunner, while Mac is set to star in the show.</p>

<figcaption>Are The Far Cry Games Connected?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Zlh_eibKpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The series will be executive produced by Mac, Hawley, and Jackie Cohn for More Better Productions, Michael Garcia for 26Keys Productions, Nick Frenkel for 3Arts Entertainment, and Ubisoft's Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, and Austin Dill.</p>
<p>"This collaboration is really an embarrassment of riches," Boykin, who serves as Ubisoft Film &amp; Television head of film and television content. "Far Cry a psychological tailspin that doesn't shy away from the darkest and most absurd parts of humanity, which aligns perfectly with FX's bold and fearless storytelling style."</p>
<p>It's thought the show will be an "anthology drama", where "each season will be set in a new world with a different cast of characters following the video game franchise's signature standalone storytelling format".</p>
<p>For now all we can do is chalk this up to a rumour, but it does fit with Ubisoft's plans to expand its three tentpole franchises, Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry, for which Ubisoft launched a new subsidiary <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-new-business-for-assassins-creed-and-other-big-ips-with-116bn-tencent-investment">back in March after Chinese conglomerate Tencent invested €1.16bn in a minority stake in the new entity</a>.</p>
<p>Ubisoft's announcement followed several reports that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-new-venture-with-ubisoft-assets-report">a new venture was being considered using the company's assets</a>, including claims <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-considering-fresh-business-to-own-assassins-creed-and-other-big-franchises-co-owned-by-others-like-tencent">Ubisoft was mulling over the launch of a fresh business unit part-owned by outside companies</a>, noting such a tactic could potentially result in the new entity being valued higher than Ubisoft itself following years of falling share prices and a string of disappointing game launches.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/a-far-cry-tv-show-that-doesnt-shy-away-from-the-darkest-most-absurd-parts-of-humanity-is-reportedly-in-development-at-fx]]></content:encoded>
