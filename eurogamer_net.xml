            <p>People Can Fly, the studio behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bulletstorm">Bulletstorm</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outriders">Outriders</a>, has revealed what Project Maverick actually is.</p>
<p>Project Maverick was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outriders-studio-people-can-fly-working-on-new-project-based-on-microsoft-ip">first reported back in June 2023</a>. At this time, it was said People Can Fly's Project Maverick would be fully funded by Microsoft with a budget of $30m-50m, and based on one of the Xbox maker's existing properties.</p>
<p>While details have remained sparse since then, People Can Fly has now revealed what Project Maverick is via its "about us" section in the <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/investors-en/#o-firmie">studio's investor website</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/cars/news/pcf-s-project-maverick-xbox-game-has-been-revealed/ar-AA1DLC3n">XboxEra</a>). And, perhaps unsurprisingly, Project Maverick is actually Gears of War: E-Day. The developer was revealed to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-e-day-dev-the-coalition-drafts-in-people-can-fly-as-partner-studio">working with The Coalition on the next Gears of War game in January of this year</a>.</p>
<p>People Can Fly is "currently working on seven projects", the developer's investor website now reads. "Gemini, a new AAA game developed in partnership with global publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>; Maverick (Gears of War: E-Day), in collaboration with Microsoft; Echo, a mode to the existing game developed for Krafton; and projects Bifrost and Victoria (Lost Rift) to be released in the self-publishing model."</p>
<p>In addition, People Can Fly is "also involved in a VR technology project named Project Bison, a new title in the immersive VR action survival genre" and Incuvo - a group subsidiary - is "actively working on the further development of a separate VR project, Green Hell VR".</p>
<p>Incuvo released the rather messy <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bulletstorm-vr">Bulletstorm VR</a> port. Eurogamer's VR aficionado Ian Higton took Bulletstorm VR out for a spin on release, and he was left <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-bulletstorm-vr-really-as-bad-as-everyone-says-it-is">pretty disappointed by the whole thing</a>, calling it sloppy.</p>
<p>As for Gears of War: E-Day, it's a prequel title for the series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marcus-fenix-returns-in-gears-of-war-prequel-e-day">set 14 years before the events of the original game</a>. Late last year, it was revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-is-so-back-as-original-voice-talents-are-confirmed-for-gears-of-war-e-day">John DiMiaggio and Carlos Ferro will be reprising their roles as Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago</a> in Gears of War: E-Day.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Our Ed has already gone hands-on with Nightreign.</p>
<p>"Nightreign provides a delectable hit of Elden Ring in a repeatable microcosm," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">Eurogamer's Nightreign preview</a>. "It's got the difficulty, the levelling, the boss battles, and the sense of discovery, but all at high speed for a new type of challenge, while its grim enemy selection is like a best-of Souls mixtape I'm itching to replay."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The characters within this collection of Eclipse images are each shown with various different outfits and equipment.</p>
<p>A selection of other humanoid characters that are smugglers are shown. The only two which appear to have specific names are Jotraaaz Kammzzzek and Travis, suggesting that they may play a bigger role in Eclipse's overall story, whenever it finally releases.</p>

<p>Star Wars Eclipse was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heavy-rain-developer-quantic-dream-reveals-star-wars-eclipse">first announced at the 2021 Game Awards</a>, where it was revealed it would have a High Republic setting. The affluent High Republic era is set around 200 years before the Skywalker Saga. (It's not to be confused the Old Republic, set thousands of years prior.) Happily, this means Jar Jar himself won't be featuring.</p>
<p>However, since that time, very little else has been heard of the game. In October 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/quantic-dreams-star-wars-eclipse-development-is-simmering">the studio described Star Wars Eclipse as "simmering"</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Quantic Dream CEO Guillaume de Fondaumière said the studio's teams had not been impacted by cuts made by its owner NetEase. At this time, the company head said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-eclipse-developer-quantic-dream-gives-update-amidst-netease-cuts-and-closures">the studio was "continuing to develop our projects at full pace"</a>.</p>
<p>Last year, former lead writer for Quantic Dream's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a> and Star Wars Eclipse Adam Williams revealed he had left the studio after 10 years. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-star-wars-eclipse-lead-writer-announces-new-studio-working-on-handcrafted-dark-mature-fantasy-rpg">He subsequently announced his new studio, Republic Games</a>, which is working on a handcrafted "dark, mature fantasy RPG".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
