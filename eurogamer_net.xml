</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Brendan Greene, the game designer better known by the alias PlayerUnknown, who helped create the battle royale genre - first in an Arma mod, then in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/h1z1">H1Z1</a>, then in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</a> (PUBG) - is planning a new and large-scale multiplayer shooter. The current plan is for the game to support 100 versus 100-player battles.</p>
<p>The shooter is to be the second game in Greene's three-game masterplan, which is underway at his newish studio PlayerUnknown Productions, he told me in a video call. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-creator-brendan-playerunknown-greene-is-about-to-release-his-next-game-and-its-not-what-youre-expecting-at-all">The first game in his plan, Prologue: Go Wayback, a wilderness survival and orienteering game</a>, is already close to release - it arrives in early access later this month, on 20th November.</p>

<p>But to understand the idea for the shooter you have to loosely understand the overarching idea for the three games Greene wants to make. They are significantly different experiences designed to test different parts of an ambitious and potentially industry-shaking new piece of game-making technology. I'm talking about world-generation on a planetary scale. I'm not exaggerating when I say Greene's goals are as ambitious as remaking the internet - but more about that in a separate article.</p><p>Game One, Prologue: Go Wayback, was initially created as a way to implement and test terrain-level planetary generation. Every time you play, the game generates a new 8x8km forested game world for you to survive and explore in. Game Two, meanwhile, will be about testing different systems like shooting and multiplayer.</p>
<p>"Game Two aims to test limited multiplayer, maybe up to 100 versus 100 players," Greene told me. "It's more of an FPS/RTS mix. This is in my head what it is. And the aim is to test terrains at a bigger scale. Therefore we can test FPS mechanics, we can test interaction between NPCs, we can try testing these networking protocols at scale. So Game Two is that.</p>
<p>"And then Game Three," he added, "is where we really go to big-scale multiplayer. And then we can take all the stuff we've learned from the previous two games of generating terrain, enabling players to create their own planets, and having a network that works for whatever you want to use it for, be that an FPS game or whatever you want to create in these worlds."</p>
<p>Big plans, and again, I'll discuss the overarching idea more in a separate article. But how much of Game Two has actually been made or committed to paper? How much of it exists outside Brendan Greene's head? Because remember, Prologue: Go Wayback isn't even available in early access yet, and there's still a year's worth of promised open development to do there, I'm told.</p>

<p>What exists of Game Two? "So far, general high-level plans," Greene said. "I have an idea in my head for the game and we're talking about what it would require from a team - what kind of timeline we expect to do that in. Because this would be using our own engine and not Unreal [as Prologue uses], so it requires Melba [the studio's proprietary engine] to be in a state that artists and designers can work with."</p>
<p>Incidentally, there's a playable demonstration of this world-generating engine, Melba, available on Steam. Look for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820060/Preface_Undiscovered_World/">Preface: Undiscovered World</a> there.</p>
<p>"But because it's going to be an FPS-type game," Greene continued, "that requires it to be in a very different state to how we released Go Wayback!, for example, which was very much in the early stages. So it requires time."</p><p>How much time? "We have a general idea of how long it will take to get to Game Two," he said, "and then with Game Two we expect another two, three, four years, maybe longer. We have a 10-year plan, more or less, of getting to Game Three."</p>
<p>You can already play Prologue: Go Wayback ahead of its early access release, incidentally, in an open - and free - beta playtest. That's where I've had a ramble around, and I found it a very powerful experience. The forested world is detailed and immersive, and the weather systems are terrifying. Rushing from cabin to cabin as a blizzard breaks and your temperature drops is a tense and thrilling thing. Even inside, you might not be safe, as wind rattles and breaks the windows, and dislodges wooden-planked walls. You'd better make sure there's a fire in the hearth and you've a full belly and you've salvaged all the warm clothes you can find.</p>

            <p>South Korean publisher Krafton announced it's transforming into an "AI first" company last month, and is now reducing human jobs with a voluntary resignation scheme.</p>
<p>The move comes after the company recorded record-breaking performance in its most recent financial quarter and has announced large-scale investments of over 100 billion won each in the Indian market and AI sectors, as reported by <a href="https://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=256319#google_vignette">Business Korea</a>.</p>
<p>The publisher - known for the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">inZOI</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> - maintains this scheme is not a layoff plan for workforce reduction. "The core purpose is to support members in proactively designing their growth direction and embarking on new challenges both inside and outside the company amid the era of AI transformation," said a company representative, adding "the company plans to support members in autonomously deciding whether to continue the direction of change internally or expand externally."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-and-inzoi-publisher-krafton-declares-itself-an-ai-first-company-placing-ai-at-the-centre-of-problem-solving">Krafton announced its "AI First" plan back in October</a>. "Starting today, Krafton will automate work centered on agentic AI," said CEO Kim Chang-han. "We will begin in earnest an AI-centered management system where members focus on creative activities and solving complex problems."</p><p>The company is also freezing hiring "excluding organisations developing original intellectual property (IP) and AI-related personnel", as explained by CFO Bae Dong-geun during a recent earnings call, adding "rather than reducing costs through AI First, individual productivity must increase at the company-wide level."</p>
<p>The news follows another South Korean developer and publisher, Nexon, whose <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nexon-ceo-believes-its-important-to-assume-that-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-following-arc-raiders-launch">CEO Junghun Lee believes "it's important to assume that every game company is now using AI"</a>. Nexon is the publisher behind Embark Studios' extraction shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, which uses AI for voice work.</p>
<p>It's not just Korean companies, either. According to a report from the organiser behind the Tokyo Games Show, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI in development</a>.</p>

            <p>It's that time of year again. As a new Call of Duty is about to be released, FPS lovers are coming together in a long-lived and important cultural tradition. To play <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a> early, thousands of fans are digitally migrating to New Zealand.</p>
<p>Why are they doing this? Well, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 (like many games) doesn't have a unified worldwide release time. The game launches on the 14th November, and thanks to time zones it's playable earliest in New Zealand.</p>
<p>As such, players can hop into their console settings and change their region to New Zealand from the comfort of their home that in reality is thousands of miles away from the idyllic island nation. This lets an eager player easily access the game way earlier than intended, and they can always switch their regions back once the game is fully released worldwide.</p>

<p>This isn't a new phenomenon among Call of Duty players, or in all honestly players of various series which have disjointed global rollouts. It turns out the super-passionate gamer is a migratory bird of sorts, flying their profiles over to the home of the net gun to get some games in before heading home.</p><p>Already on community hubs for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 fans including Reddit, fans are celebrating <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODBlackOps7/comments/1ova8ws/has_everybody_packed_their_bag_for_the_flight/">the incoming New Zealand release</a>. It's a running joke of sorts, with users speaking about these shenanigans as if going on a quick holiday. One user, Sneaky_Demise, wrote: "On my way to the airport now then a nap before midnight once I land".</p>
<p>You may be wondering, is this technique bannable? Well, over the past few Call of Duty games it certainly hasn't been. As long as players don't access the game prior to the New Zealand launch through more nefarious practices, and only start playing alongside their fellow gamers who actually live in New Zealand, it's been an unpunished practice. The New Zealand trick lives in the grey zone between what's allowed and what isn't, and has so far been ignored.</p>
<p>If you don't fancy heading on a quick trip to New Zealand, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-ops-7-release-times-and-pre-load-dates">you can find the global release times for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> to make sure you're awake for the launch. The game is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-your-xbox-game-pass-games-for-november">also available in November's Game Pass line-up</a>, if you fancied trying it out before paying full price for it.</p>
