            <p>A modding group has doubled down on its plans to port GTA: Vice City content into GTA 4's engine, despite publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> stepping in to apparently try and shut the enterprise down.</p>
<p>The project - known as GTA Vice City Nextgen Edition - ports the missions, side missions, cutscenes and world from Vice City into the GTA 4 engine. It was created by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@revteamhq">Revolution Team</a>, and initially required players own a legitimate copy of GTA 4 in order to play.</p>
<p>But the group has now switched its plans, after the YouTube channel charting its progress was suddenly taken down - something Revolution Team has blamed Take-Two for. Now, the project has been released and can work on its own - without requiring players buy GTA 4 first - in response to what the group has called Take-Two's "cruel move".</p>

</figure>
<p>"Friends, [you] probably already know that just two days before the release, Take-Two Interactive deleted our YouTube channel without any warning or attempt to contact us," reads a statement published by Revolution Team. "A huge amount of effort and time was invested into the channel, including hundreds of hours of streams dedicated to the mod's development."</p><p>"Additionally, we lost connection with our international audience, which was a significant part of our community. The teaser trailer for GTA Vice City Nextgen Edition gained over 100,000 views and 1500 comments in less than a day. Unfortunately, the channel was removed without any possibility of recovery."</p>
<p>The days since the channel's removal have been "emotionally tough", Revolution Team continued.</p>
<p>"The most important thing now is that we released the project on the promised date," the statement adds. "It's unclear how long it will remain publicly available or whether there will be demands to take it down. We are not opposed to reuploads, but we cannot openly encourage you to do so. Do as you see fit."</p>
<p>Revolution Team's initial plan to release the project with the requirement players needed the original GTA 4 game was designed to be a mark of "respect to the publisher", it said. "However, over the past two days, we have completely rebuilt the project, and it is now available as a standalone 'installation-ready package'."</p>
<p>Footage of the mod in action has since been released on YouTube, and you can check it out below.</p>

            <p>
Skies of Arcadia has been given a fresh trademark by Sega, raising fan hopes for some kind of revival. 
</p>
<p>
Fresh trademarks for the beloved Dreamcast and GameCube RPG - including for the game's original Japanese title Eternal Arcadia - were filed on 16th January and made public on 24th January, <a href="https://finalweapon.net/2025/01/26/sega-files-new-trademark-for-skies-of-arcadia/">Final Weapon</a> reported.
</p>
<p>
The future of Skies of Arcadia as a series has long been dormant, after Sega ditched plans for a PC port and a full-blown sequel. But fans of the game have never quite given up hope - and Sega is currently busy reviving many of its other past franchises.

<p>
Skies of Arcadia was originally released on Dreamcast back in 2000 - making this year its 25th anniversary. Hey, that would be a good time to launch some kind of remaster or remake! Its enhanced GameCube port Skies of Arcadia: Legends launched two years later.
</p><p>
Neither of the game's releases sadly set tills ringing, but the colourful air pirate RPG has maintained a core fanbase ever since, and Sega has occaisonally referenced the game in other titles - such as hero Vyse being a playable character in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-all-stars-racing-transformed">Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed</a>.
</p>
<p>Many of the game's original development team have now been scattered to the winds but, back in 2020, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/20-years-on-skies-of-arcadia-dev-hasnt-given-up-hope-of-a-sequel">Skies of Arcadia developer Kenji Hiruta made a push for Sega to bring back the RPG via a fresh entry</a>.</p>
<p>
Sega is currently going back to its roots to revive a swathe of classic franchises, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-announces-flurry-of-projects-including-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi">Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, Crazy Taxi</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-unveils-new-virtua-fighter-sonic-racing-and-like-a-dragon">Virtua Fighter and Sonic Racing</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Here's hoping this trademark isn't just leading to another Sonic Racing cameo.
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/putting-the-mega-drive-back-into-sega-how-the-company-wants-to-return-to-creating-video-game-rock-roll-compared-to-nintendos-pop-music">Eurogamer sat down with Sega president Shuji Utsumi to hear more of the company's plans</a>, and how the company wants to return to creating video game "rock &amp; roll", compared to Nintendo's "pop music".

<p>The series' highest peak overall remains <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>, which boasted 95,150 concurrent players after its popular Endwalker expansion was released.</p>
<p>This peak for Rebirth is positive news, considering <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> previously admitted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">sales of the PS5 version "did not meet expectations"</a>, leading to the company's multiplatform strategy.</p>
<p>Previously, PC versions of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-pc-barebones-port">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-final-fantasy-16-is-highly-demanding-on-pc-and-these-are-the-best-settings">Final Fantasy 16</a> were somewhat criticised for their performance, though Rebirth has been praised by comparison. It's also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-verified-for-steam-deck-handheld">Steam Deck verified</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, a PC release allows for fan-made mods. Director Naoki Hamaguchi asked players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-asks-pc-players-to-avoid-offensive-or-inappropriate-mods">not to install "offensive or inappropriate" mods</a> in a previous interview.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/i-respect-mods-they-breathe-life-into-the-pc-market-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-director-naoki-hamaguchi-reveals-a-more-personal-perspective-on-mods/">Automaton</a>, he admitted to using mods himself as a PC player and acknowledged how they can "breathe life" into games.</p>
<p>Referring to the previous interview, he said: "I wasn't trying to tell people not to use mods. It was more about being mindful. Both creators and users alike should ensure mods don’t detract from the intended game experience."</p>
<p>"I respect the modding community," he continued. "Mods have played a significant role in the rise of the PC market. Look at series like Fallout or The Elder Scrolls – even years after release, new mods breathe life into these games, making players want to come back to them."</p>
<p>As for the final game in the trilogy, series producer Yoshinori Kitase confirmed the story - written by creative director Tetsuya Nomura - has been completed and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-story-completed-producer-very-satisfied-as-development-continues-without-delay">he's "very satisfied with it"</a>.</p>
<p>The PC version of Rebirth includes an option to speed up cutscenes, which the developers would like to add back to the PS5 version, within the limits of the console's capabilities.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep - the Witcher anime heading to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> next month - will take place in the middle of the live-action show, specifically between episodes 5 and 6, and it includes a scene that was cut from Henry Cavill's first season.</p>
<p>As detailed in this month's <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/sfx/">SFX magazine</a> and shared by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/fantasy-shows/the-upcoming-the-witcher-anime-movie-features-a-new-version-of-a-scene-cut-from-the-henry-cavills-first-season/">GamesRadar+</a>, writer Mike Ostrowski and co-writer Rae Benjamin call it "a period of not being together [with Yennefer], or a period of trouble, but still on each other's minds".</p>

<p>The writers say they do not interfere with the live-action show's chronology or timeline, but the anime does include a "fun little scene" that was reportedly cut from the main Netflix series.</p>
<p>What, exactly, that scene entails? We're going to have to wait until the show debuts on 11th February, unfortunately - the writers wouldn't say more. But as we know Anya Chalotra reprises her role as Yennefer in the anime, the writers tease that we'll see more of Geralt and Yennefer's relationship in Sirens of the Deep.</p>
<p>"Geralt cannot let Yennefer go, even though he's trying his best," Ostrowski added. "She haunts him. Even if he wanted to be rid of her, he can't."</p>
<p>As Matt summarised for us recently, two and a half years after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-confirms-new-the-witcher-game-in-development">announcement</a>, CD Projekt finally gave it the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">big reveal treatment</a> late in 2024, confirming Ciri to be the focus this time around. And now Doug Cockle - voice of former series protagonist Geralt of Rivia both in the games and the anime - has had his say, calling the switch to a new main character, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ciri-as-witcher-4-protagonist-really-really-interesting-for-all-kinds-of-reasons-says-geralt-voice-actor">"really, really interesting move for all kinds of reasons"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
