            <p>If you haven't been watching, Fallout Season 2 is pretty great and has been enjoying a good deal of success. So much so that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-3-now-being-written-collaborations-between-show-and-games-discussed">Season 3 is already well into the writing stage</a>. New games are sadly still a ways off, however, which is why both veteran and new players are flocking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> and other entries to go post-apocalyptic.</p>
<p>That’s what <a href="https://steamdb.info/">SteamDB</a> has been saying, at least. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fallout-season-2-has-doubled-the-number-of-people-playing-the-fallout-games-on-steam/">PC Gamer</a> took a look at the data before and after Season 2 premiered back in December 2025. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a>, which recently received an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-announces-fallout-4-anniversary-edition-confirms-nintendo-switch-2-version-for-2026">Anniversary Edition</a>, seems to be the biggest winner, with its concurrent players count going from 20,000 on average to 40,000 as of last Sunday. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> and 2010's New Vegas also saw similar bumps, with the latter being the most relevant to Season 2's plot and setting.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> has also doubled its concurrent players from a hundred-ish to around 200. For a single-player game released on 2008 that’s also available elsewhere and doesn’t have as many direct ties to the TV show as the other three we’ve mentioned, that’s not bad. Even free-to-play, mobile-oriented <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-shelter">Fallout Shelter</a> saw an increase in activity.</p>
<p>The New Vegas-oriented second season of Fallout, which is currently airing new episodes each week via Amazon’s Prime Video, takes Lucy, The Ghoul, Maximus, and many other characters to very familiar places, yet the key creatives behind the show have been smart enough to avoid the usual interconnected universe, franchise-building issues.</p><p>Needless to say, Microsoft-owned and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a>-led <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a> has done a great job of shepherding the show alongside the creative team led by Jonathan Nolan, Lisa Joy, Graham Wagner, and Geneva Robertson-Dworet, making it not just the perfect gateway into the video game franchise, but also a respectable companion piece that’s defining the post-Fallout 4 timeline <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-5-will-exist-in-a-world-where-the-stories-and-events-of-the-show-happened-or-are-happening-says-todd-howard">the fifth game will be acknowledging when it finally arrives</a>. For now, we have more Fallout 76 content updates and the Switch 2 port of Fallout 4 to look forward to.</p>

            <p>Kazutaka Kodaka is one of the most recognizable names in the games industry for those who really enjoy anime-inspired visual novels. Recently, he led <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a>'s development, and the his name may be familiar to anyone au fait with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/danganronpa-and-the-surprising-joys-of-clumsy-queer-representation">Danganronpa</a> series. But the creator's journey to get back into the world of game development wasn’t exactly a straight line.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/danganronpa-creator-became-a-game-dev-because-of-an-argument-he-had-while-working-part-time-that-made-him-think-what-am-i-doing-with-my-life/">Automaton</a> (who also translated the original comments), we’ve learned that, during last year’s Computer Entertainment Developers Conference (CEDEC+KYUSHU 2025), the director explained  how he landed the position his Spike Chunsoft, which led to the creation of the original Danganronpa. The main twist? He decided to focus on games after having a heated exchange with a co-worker while working part-time at a game shop.</p>
<p>After a few games-related gigs, Kodaka spent quite some time in his twenties making indie films and working part-time jobs. One day, at the aforementioned game shop, he scolded a fellow university student working alongside him for a mistake she made, saying she wouldn’t make it in society. Her answer was pointing out that he "hadn't been out in society" for a while, which made him stop, ask himself "What am I even doing", and rethink his life choices and how he interacted with others (as revealed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1zJH-dl-kw">another interview</a>) going forward.</p>
<p>This exchange ended his game development hiatus after working in minor roles on projects like Clock Tower 3 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil 2</a>, as he started a job hunt which landed him a position at Spike. The rest is history. Danganronpa became a hit praised for its mix of dark comedy, heavy themes, and engaging mystery before spawning a larger series of well-recieved titles. By the late 2010s, he departed Spike and founded the studio Too Kyo Games alongside other veterans.</p><p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/the-hundred-line-and-danganronpa-creator-says-there-would-be-more-uniquely-japanese-games-if-development-was-more-creator-oriented-and-focused-on-individuality/">Kodaka has been vocal in the past</a> about the huge impact anime, manga, and “borrowed” video games had on his personal storytelling style and the visual aspect of Danganronpa and The Hundred Line. It’s nice to hear about his life before becoming a massive name in the Japanese games industry though. Yet another reminder you never know what might be around the corner.</p>
