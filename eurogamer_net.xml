        <p>"That attitude has remained consistent throughout my works and in Slitterhead."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Slitterhead creator Keiichiro Toyama says that he and the team at Bokeh Game Studio are committed to "originality", even if that comes at the cost of a game being "a bit rough around the edges".</p>
<p>Toyama - who created <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gravity-rush">Gravity Rush</a>, Silent Hill, and the terrifying Siren series - hasn't released a new game since 2008's Siren: Blood Siren, making this week's launch of Slitterhead especially exciting for horror fans.</p>

<p>Talking to <a href="https://gamerant.com/slitterhead-horror-game-like-silent-hill-toyama/">GameRant</a>, Toyama stressed that he has always fought to ensure that his games feel fresh and unique above all else.</p>
<p>"From the very first Silent Hill, we have maintained a commitment to freshness and originality, even if it means being a bit rough around the edges," Toyama said.</p>
<p>"That attitude has remained consistent throughout my works and in Slitterhead."</p>
<p>Quite what, exactly, Toyama thinks is "rough" about Slitterhead remains to be seen, but thankfully, we don't have to wait long - the highly-anticipated action horror is out later this week, coming to PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, PlayStation 4, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on 8th November 2024.</p><p>Slitterhead was first announced back in 2021. We first got a good look at it last summer, when a developer diary revealed new details about its inaugural title, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slitterheads-unique-mechanics-include-a-playable-dog">including a sneaky peek at some of the game's enemies, abilities</a>, and - surprise! - the ability to play as a dog, something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slitterheads-release-date-and-trailer-have-popped-up-online">reprised in leaked footage in June</a>, too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It's been 12 years since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-iii">Assassin's Creed 3</a> ended the story of Desmond Miles, the series' first recurring modern day protagonist and link between each game until that point. 
</p>
<p>
Now, speaking at a BAFTA event held in London on Friday evening attended by Eurogamer, Assassin's Creed franchise boss Marc-Alexis Coté has reflected on the series' struggles to tell a meaningful, connected narrative ever since - and how this will finally be rectified in future. 
</p>
<p>
"When the Assassin's Creed franchise was created, it introduced a bold and innovative narrative structure, a modern day story arc centred around Desmond that was intertwined with historical adventures," Coté recalled. "Desmond's journey was at the heart of the modern day conflict driving the search for powerful Isu artefacts - Pieces of Eden - that could change the course of history. However, with his death at the end of Assassin's Creed 3, we faced a creative crossroads. 
</p>
<p>
"Ending Desmond's arc was a difficult decision," Coté added, "and afterward, the modern storyline struggled to find its footing."

<p>
Subsequent games initially featured no specific modern day protagonist, before a replacement for Desmond was eventually introduced - Layla Hassan. But the length of time between different games and the shifting teams behind each entry meant the narrative suffered from being too sporadic, too inconsistent, and too repetitive. 
</p><p>
"The continued focus on characters hunting for Isu artefacts made the narrative more predictable," Coté continued, "and reduced the conflict between Templars and Assassins to a straightforward pursuit of control over - let's be honest - magical relics. This shift pulled focus away from what had always been at the heart of the franchise: exploring our history.
</p>
<blockquote>"As this approach became repetitive, both players and critics felt the modern day storyline had become a secondary concern."</blockquote>
<p>
"As this approach became repetitive, both players and critics felt the modern day storyline had become a secondary concern, more of a side-quest, rather than an integral part of the overall experience. Furthermore, the compounded complexity of 15 years of lore built in this parallel storyline created a cognitive load that made the franchise difficult to approach for newcomers."
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed games beginning with Shadows will be integrated via a single launcher/hub Ubisoft originally announced as a project titled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-unity">Assassin's Creed Unity</a>. It's here that ongoing, modern day narrative will be hosted, Ubisoft has said. But why should players simply tuning in for the latest historical adventure care?
</p><p>
"As we move forward, our goal is to put history back at the centre of the players' experience," Coté said. "The modern day narrative will serve to enhance, rather than overshadow, the historical journey. By drawing meaningful contrast between past and present, we aim to restore the balance that was once the hallmark of the franchise. 
</p>
<p>
"The modern day storyline will explore deeper themes of memory, identity and autonomy, how the past shapes who we are, and how controlling this past can impact our future. These themes will allow us to reflect on contemporary issues: freedom versus control, the power of knowledge and the tension between individuality and conformity, all through the lens of history. 
</p>
<p>
"The groundwork for this new direction will take shape with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which will lay the foundation for this narrative evolution that will grow in the years to come."
</p>
<p>
It's intriguing to hear Coté talk about this secondary narrative as "modern day" here after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-looks-like-a-cut-assassins-creed-mirage-post-credits-scene-points-to-a-huge-shift-in-the-series-story">mysterious story stinger tucked away in the files of 2023's Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> suggested the series would shift to focus on looking back through history from the far-flung future. Ubisoft is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-developers-acknowledge-its-mysterious-lore-bending-cut-post-credits-scene">still to fully address what this seemingly-cut ending teaser</a> was due to represent.
</p>

            <p>Good news, Disney fans - it looks like Disney Music Parade -Encore- is coming to Nintendo Switches outside of Asia.</p>
<p>Initially, Disney Music Parade -Encore- only had confirmed releases in Japan (21st November) and Asia (12th December), although English language support was in place for those prepared to import it.</p>
<p>However, as spotted by the eagle-eyed folks at the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ghz20a/disney_music_parade_encore_rated_by_esrb/">Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit</a>, it has just popped up on the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40237/disney-music-parade-encore/">ESRB</a> website, too… even though there are currently no confirmed plans for a US release.</p>

<p>ESRB's description says Disney Music Parade -Encore- is "a rhythm game in which players match on-screen prompts in time with music. Brief clips from Disney movies will occasionally play in the background".</p>
<p>"A handful of these clips include mild instances of violence (e.g., a character hit by a flaming arrow, a character kicking another person)", but none of this is egregious enough to deter an E for everyone rating.</p>
<p>The listing also confirms that there are no interactive elements, and seemingly no in-game purchases.</p>
<p>Disney Music Parade - Encore - is a rhythm action game in which players tap to the beat of Disney songs as they ride through famous scenes from Disney animated films, including Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beauty, Moana, and Frozen.</p>
<p>The game also features Collections consisting of 150 different Music Rides depicting well-known Disney characters in a "brilliant, vibrant art style", as well as Memory Crystals that feature famous scenes from "beloved Disney animated films".</p>
<p>Disney Music Parade -Encore- is currently exclusive to Nintendo Switch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Reports suggest there will only be QoL improvements and a "handful" of smaller content updates.</p>

            <p>There are currently no plans for Dragon Age: The Veilguard DLC.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/dragon-age-the-veilguard-john-epler-interview-1235147001/">Rolling Stone</a>, which reported in an interview with creative director John Epler that "full attention [of BioWare] has shifted entirely to the next <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>" game.</p>

<p>Whilst Epler didn't comment directly on future content plans for the latest Dragon Age game, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-no-dragon-age-the-veilguard-expansion-dlc-mass-effect-5">IGN</a> says it believes BioWare plans to "support The Veilguard with quality-of-life improvements and a handful of smaller content updates".</p>
<p>If true, that's likely to surprise many BioWare fans familiar not just with Dragon Age, but its Mass Effect series, too. The studio has long been associated with quality DLC drops, including fan-favourite DLC expansions like Trespasser or Awakening.</p>
<p>Did you know that early on in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-an-early-mass-effect-easter-egg">Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare offers a knowing nod to Mass Effect</a>, its other beloved role-playing game series?</p>
<p>This week, Bertie sat down with Dragon Age's original creator David Gaider to hear about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-knew-the-deepest-secrets-of-dragon-age-lore-20-years-ago-and-locked-it-away-in-an-uber-plot-doc">how BioWare knew some of the series' biggest plot points years ago, but kept its secrets hidden away</a>.</p>
<p>Awarding it a sterling five out of five stars in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> review, Bertie wrote: "It is the strongest and loudest answer BioWare could have mustered for the people still doubting whether it could do it. The answer is yes, emphatically. The Veilguard is spectacular. BioWare is back."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Earlier this week, Tom told us Nintendo Alarmo couldn't yet run Doom, but did confirm it could <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-alarmo-hack-cant-yet-run-doom-but-can-display-picture-of-a-cat">display a picture of a cat</a>.</p>
<p>Just three days later, however, Wii U reverse engineer GaryOderNichts has risen to the challenge and sent Alarmo rocketing into the Weird Things That Can Run Doom charts by... well, running Doom on Alarmo.</p>

<p>It's a long-running joke that iconic 90s shooter Doom is playable on almost anything, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-you-can-run-doom-in-balatro">Balatro</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>, a pregnancy test, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-is-now-playable-on-a-tractor">a tractor</a>, and a piece of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-piece-of-lego-can-now-play-doom">Lego</a>. It was only a matter of time for Alarmo to join the list, I guess.</p>
<p>"After my last post, it was pretty clear what everyone wanted to see on the Alarmo," GaryOderNichts quite rightly asserted.</p>
<p>"So, here it is - Doom running on the Nintendo Alarmo!"</p> <div>

<p>As usually happens, there's a handful of caveats. Firstly, GaryOderNichts says there's currently no audio support, and to avoid the USB loader memory size restrictions, the .wad needs to be compressed and then uncompressed to external memory on boot.</p>
<p>"However, it's possible to load the shareware version of Doom entirely from USB, without modifying the Alarmo," GaryOderNichts explained.</p>
<p>And if you want to run Doom on your very own Alarmo, GaryOderNichts has <a href="https://t.co/3qBnVjIhqX">kindly shared his workings</a>. For more, including on what, exactly, is inside the Alarmo, <a href="https://garyodernichts.blogspot.com/2024/10/looking-into-nintendo-alarmo.html">check out the blog</a>.</p>
<p>As Tom summarised for us at the time, Nintendo's leftfield launch this month of Alarmo, an interactive alarm clock, was something of a surprise. It's currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-alarmo-clock-costs-90-now-available-to-switch-online-subscribers">available only to Nintendo Switch Online members</a> via the My Nintendo Store, priced £90/$99. It's expected to go on general sale from "mid-January 2025", helping fill the gap in Nintendo's launch schedule before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
