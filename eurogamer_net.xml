            <p>There were plenty of exciting announcements in last night’s VR Games Showcase but one of the games that really caught my attention was the VR port of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lushfoil-photography-sim">Lushfoil Photography Sim</a> from</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> and Matt Newell. Described by Donlan in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lushfoil-photography-sim-review">Lushfoil review</a> as minimalist and luxurious, Lushfoil Photography Sim looks pretty as a picture and, played in VR, it could scratch that same, relaxing, photorealistic (pun not intended) itch as Kayak VR: Mirage.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below for a look at the game in action in VR, although you'll obviously only get the true experience when you're wearing the headset.</p>

<p>At the moment the VR version of Lushfoil is only confirmed for PC via Steam VR. Lushfoil also released on PS5, so it's not impossible we'll see it ported to PS VR2 in the future. If Annapurna Interactive makes an announcement on this in the coming months we'll let you know. No firm release date for the PC VR version of Lushfoil has been announced, but it's coming soon.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> hasn't been flush with new releases, I think it's fair to say, but Nintendo has offered up a nice lot of games in its Nintendo Classics games portal. The next GameCube game to arrive has been revealed, and it's the wonderful Chibi-Robo!</p>
<p>Classic GameCube games are an exclusive feature of the Nintendo Switch 2 and are only available to players who have the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. Chibi-Robo! joins a line-up that already includes the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f-zero-gx">F-Zero GX</a>, Super Mario Strikers, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-wind-waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Chibi-Robo is a four-inch-tall robot who's arrived at the Sanderson house with the goal of helping the family get the most out of life and find happiness. Day or night, he'll help however he can, whether that's by cleaning or looking for lost items. In this chibi action-adventure title originally released for the Nintendo GameCube system in 2006, you'll aim for the top of the Chibi-Rankings by gathering Happy Points and Moolah (aka money)! It's rumored that Chibi-Robo will become Super Chibi-Robo if he reaches the top of the rankings...but between a daughter who only speaks in the language of frogs and toys that come alive when humans aren't around, Chibi-Robo has his work cut out for him in the mystery-packed Sanderson house!</p></blockquote>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with Chibi-Robo, Nintendo has released a trailer for the Nintendo Classic release which you can watch below.</p>

            <p>Popular life sim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">InZoi</a>, already released on PC, has been confirmed for release on PlayStation 5 during the first half of 2026. While PS5 players keen for more life sim options are in luck, Xbox owners need to wait to see if the game will arrive on their consoles. Publisher Krafton has stated that an Xbox release of InZoi is "under consideration."</p>
<p>For console players worried about how InZoi will work outside of the PC space, Krafton has stated that the console version will be full-featured and be optimised for consoles. Given the game is some way from release we'll need to be patient to see if these claims are backed up.</p>
<p>InZoi raced to 1 million players on PC within one week of the game's release on Steam in March.</p>
<p>Aside from announcing plans to consider the game for Xbox, InZoi is also releasing on Mac on 20th August. On Mac players will need Apple silicon Macs with an M2 chip or newer and 16GB or more of unified memory.</p>
<p>We felt <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-25-years-of-the-sims-could-inzoi-be-about-to-steal-its-crown">InZoi had potential</a> to be a big player in the life sim market when we played the game back at release, although it was far from the complete package.</p>
