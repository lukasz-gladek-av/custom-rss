            <p>The now-cancelled Perfect Dark reboot had an "eco sci-fi" aesthetic, an Adrenaline System, and may have been released episodically.</p>
<p>That's according to internal documentation from a former developer on the project at The Initiative shared with <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/gameplay-details-concept-screens-cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot">mp1st</a>, revealing new artwork and gameplay details.</p>
<p>The document highlighted an opportunity to capitalise on the secret agent genre, due to the absence of Metal Gear Solid and James Bond 007 during development. Ironically enough, both franchises have since returned.</p>

<p>This may somewhat point to why <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">Perfect Dark was ultimately cancelled</a> - perhaps this reboot of the N64 classic from Rare wasn't able to differentiate itself enough.</p>
<p>Still, this newly unearthed documentation - which dates back to a period close to the game's cancellation this year - hints as to what players could have expected. The creative vision for the reboot aimed to reimagine the franchise while retaining the core DNA of the N64 original, with the HBO series Westworld providing inspiration for giving a classic property fresh themes and concepts.</p><p>While several systems are briefly mentioned, only the Adrenaline System is detailed. This would've been a resource regenerated over time to provide various abilities like healing and increasing damage dealt, as well as slowing time to aim with precision. Killing multiple enemies in quick succession would have extended this effect.</p>
<p>Until April of this year, the studio was working on a vertical slice (a playable proof-of-concept) that belonged to "Season 1", suggesting the game would have been released episodically.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark was properly revealed at last year's Xbox Games Showcase, with in-game footage of protagonist Joanna Dark exploring a futuristic Cairo (above). Later,<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lsypye2edk2v"> reports suggested this gameplay was fake</a>, though a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adammcdlt.bsky.social/post/3lt23bz2dwk2z">designer on the game responded</a> it was in-engine despite "some fake stuff in it".</p>
<p>The new documentation includes further artwork for the game, including an alternate design for Joanna, as well as various futuristic environments to show off its "eco sci-fi" aesthetic.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark was cancelled back in July, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">layoffs across Microsoft</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild was also cancelled</a>.</p>

            <p>The Pokémon Company is once again risking a poké-palava at a museum, with the announcement of a pop-up store at London's Natural History Museum selling exclusive items.</p>
<p>Back in 2023, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-van-gogh-exhibit-includes-exclusive-pikachu-trading-card">Pokémon collaboration was launched with Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum</a> featuring six Pokémon paintings and a store selling an exclusive Pikachu trading card. Yet scalpers descended on the museum, eventually leading to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-van-gogh-museum-employees-suspended-after-pokemon-exhibit-chaos">four employees being suspended</a> - one allegedly embezzled a box of cards.</p>
<p>Now The Pokémon Company is moving to London for its first pop-up in a UK museum, and it's all about evolution - and Pokémon's 30th anniversary.</p>

<p>"There is such a wonderful alignment between Pokémon and the Natural History Museum - we're obviously both big fans of the natural world and its evolution and diversity," said Adam Farrar, director of commercial and visitor experience for the museum. "We hope this collaboration will spark joy and curiosity in the creatures around us, both in the world of Pokémon and Earth."</p>
<p>The store will sell clothing, stationary, accessories, prints, and a brand-new exclusive plushie toy - it's a Pikachu hugging the museum, as below.</p>

<p>"Design inspiration has been drawn directly from the Natural History Museum's iconic building and architecture, as well as the beautiful naturalist sketches that fill the Museum's archives," said Mathieu Galante, senior director of licensing for Pokémon Europe. "We are excited to be working with the Natural History Museum to create this fun pop-up store for fans of all ages."</p>
<p>Note, however, the pop-up is not a Pokémon Centre.</p>
<p>What's more, in an attempt to prevent scalping, free tickets will be required to attend the store. These will be available online from 1st October, but you can <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/events/pokemon-pop-up-shop.html?utm_source=pokemon-press-announcement-20250922-hp&amp;utm_medium=nhm-press&amp;utm_campaign=retail">sign up to be the first to hear</a>.</p>
<p>The pop-up will run from 26th January to 22nd March next year, with the product range also available to buy <a href="https://www.nhmshop.co.uk/?srsltid=AfmBOorBseC_DhtYXMqRbGzy3Zxn6ye5OvDqVzxM9dHraX54OsyrcOM7">online from the Natural History Museum shop</a> from January - all purchases will support the museum's charitable mission of supporting scientific research into the planetary emergency.</p>
<p>Some products will additionally be available to buy from the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/">Pokémon Centre UK official online store</a>.</p>
<p>Let's hope it doesn't cause another chaotic fiasco over exclusive items, for which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-pokemon-company-apologises-for-the-disappointment-caused-by-scalpers-buying-up-all-of-its-van-gogh-items">The Pokémon Company has to apologise</a>.</p>
