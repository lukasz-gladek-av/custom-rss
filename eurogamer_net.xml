            <p>Spoilers for<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2"> Death Stranding 2</a> are flooding social media and YouTube, posted by those who bought the digital deluxe edition of the game.</p>
<p>This digital deluxe edition, which provides a 48-hour early access window to those who buy it, released on the 24th June. For owners of the regular version, the game becomes available tomorrow on the 26th June.</p>
<p>Those who have been able to play early have been keen to share their experiences online, but given how narratively rich Death Stranding 2 is (and the whole catalogue of Kojima's works), this has led to a deluge of early game story moments and equipment popping up on the internet.</p>

<p>Death Stranding 2, a game which takes between 35-50 hours to beat, is a chunky experience, especially for completionists. However, given the fact deluxe edition owners will obviously continue to play and post their screenshots and videos online as they proceed into the game's later moments, it's best to stay away from such platforms if you're looking to go in fresh.</p>
<p>It's been a rough few days for the spoiler-averse. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-death-stranding-2s-full-opening-hour-has-leaked-online">the opening hour of the game leaked online</a>, giving away all the twists and turns the game throws at you in the game's opening scenes.</p>
<p>One could argue plenty of story moments have already been revealed ahead of launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-releases-hype-trailer">due to a release trailer for the game</a> which featured plenty of cinematics from throughout the game's runtime. Still, it's nice to go in without knowing the surprises that await you. Except for some of the spoiler-free technical stuff maybe, like the fact <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2s-instantaneous-loading-times-truly-prove-the-power-of-the-ps5">Death Stranding 2 benefits from super fast load times</a>. Cool!</p>
<p>If you want a spoiler-free impression of what the game is like, why not read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">Eurogamer's Death Stranding 2 review</a>! In it, the game is described as: "A busier, louder, and more emotionally resplendent take on this singular hiking sim."

            <p>The Nintendo Museum in Japan is set to receive an art gallery extension.</p>
<p>The art gallery will allow visitors to "explore a wide range of game artwork, including character illustrations and concept art".</p>
<p>It's set to open on 3rd September at the Nintendo Museum near Kyoto, which is built on the site of the company's former hanafuda manufacturing plant that opened in 1969.</p>

<p>The art gallery is an intriguing prospect, which will no doubt have fans speculating as to what kind of never-before-seen artwork may be included. Perhaps some Miyamoto originals from when he designed Mario and Link? Or will this be a digital art display?</p>
<p>The Nintendo Museum opened on 2nd October last year, which includes exhibits showcasing the history of Nintendo's games as well as fun minigames to try out. Then, in the gift shop, you can buy one of those giant controller cushions.</p>
<p>Except, the museum already feels somewhat like a gallery. As former Eurogamer managing editor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-the-nintendo-museum-a-joyful-celebration-of-machines-magic-and-the-art-of-play">Katharine Castle wrote when she visited last year</a>, there's a "dizzying amount of stuff to absorb" but Nintendo states up front it's all "shared with little explanation". </p>
<p>"Having spent nine hours wandering round the museum this week," Katharine wrote, "it's a concept that feels both refreshing, but also rich with missed opportunity. This isn't a place that finally pulls back the curtain on Nintendo's secret inner workings, nor is it the kind of exhibit that sheds new light on what you already know."</p>

<p>I also luckily visited the museum last year on holiday and, while I had a great time reminiscing about past consoles and games, I didn't feel I truly learned anything new about Nintendo as a company.</p>
<p>Still, the opportunity to potentially see some rare artwork is certainly a draw to visit the Nintendo Museum, though whether you're able to visit remains luck of the draw for those applying for tickets.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/the-nintendo-museum-is-opening-an-art-gallery-this-september">Nintendo Life</a> reported, the museum was also updated back in April, to include a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> exhibit.</p>
<p>Ahead of the new console's launch, we published a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/virtual-boy-switch-2-review">review of Nintendo's other controversially expensive handheld - the Virtual Boy</a>. And that's something you can see for yourself at the museum.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-museum-in-japan-is-getting-an-art-gallery-extension]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Players are already impressed by the incredibly fast loading times in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, which only proves the power of the PS5 console, as well as Guerrilla Games' Decima game engine used by Kojima Productions.</p>
<p>Ahead of the game's release tomorrow, players with advanced access are already sharing their thoughts.</p>
<p>One player posted a video to reddit, stating "Death Stranding 2 has the fastest loading time I've ever seen in a video game". The video itself shows the game impressively loading from menu to gameplay in a split second.</p>

<p>When the PS5 launched, Sony touted the fast loading of the console's SSD as a major selling point. Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart - though it released months after launch - was seen as a key example of this technology. What's more, the Decima Engine was created by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> studio Guerrilla Games and used for its games since PS4 release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killzone-shadow-fall">Killzone: Shadow Fall</a>, yielding impressive results.</p>
<p>Yet Kojima Productions has clearly worked some magic with Death Stranding 2 - its load times really are astonishing. Take a look for yourself:</p>

</span></p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-death-stranding-2-tech-review">Digital Foundry gave its tech verdict on Death Stranding 2</a> earlier this week and was particularly impressed by the Decima Engine's ability to create "truly outstanding dynamic landscapes", as well as its lighting, weather, and other environmental effects.</p>
<p>"The first key improvement here stems from fine detail, with rock formations, vegetation and other natural elements holding up under closer scrutiny," wrote John Linneman. "The game opens in a gorgeous mountain range with a level of detail reminiscent of Epic's Nanite virtualised geometry demos, without relying on such tech."</p>
<p>If you're playing on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> in particular, Linneman recommends opting for the 60fps performance mode as on Sony's more powerful console, quality and performance modes are so similar in terms of image quality.</p>
<p>"Thankfully, both versions also feature lightning-fast loading times with virtually zero waiting," said Linneman. "Moving from the load screen to a save game is nearly instant and you basically never actually encounter anything resembling a loading screen during the game - it's seamless."</p>
<p>There's one particular sequence I was able to play when I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-death-stranding-2-preview-how-a-big-dollop-of-metal-gear-is-expanding-kojimas-bizarre-epic">previewed the game in May</a>, which was breathtaking in its use of lighting and particles. But I won't spoil it here.</p>
<p>In short, Death Stranding 2 is an exceptional technical achievement that truly shows the power of Sony's PS5 consoles, as well as the Decima game engine.</p>
<p>"A busier, louder, and more emotionally resplendent take on this singular hiking sim," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">full Death Stranding 2 review</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2s-instantaneous-loading-times-truly-prove-the-power-of-the-ps5]]></content:encoded>
