            <p>Here's a new date for your bumper summer line up of video game showcases: Konami has today announced its own livestream, which will give us all a fresh look at both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>.</p>
<p>The showcase - known as Konami Press Start - is scheduled for this coming Thursday, 12th June. It will air at 2pm here in the UK, so that's 6:00am PT / 9:00am ET / 3:00pm CEST.</p>
<p>The whole thing is expected to last for around 37 minutes, Konami has said. While the studio namechecked both Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill f, it also promised "and more" during that time. </p>

<p>"This is Miyamoto," reads the post. "For production reasons, we are changing the release date of the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda to May 7, 2027. It will be some weeks later than the release timing we originally announced, and we will take the extra time to make the film as good as it can be. Thank you for your patience."</p> <div>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-movie-release-date-revealed-by-nintendo-and-its-not-as-far-away-as-you-might-have-feared">release date for the film was first confirmed back in March</a> this year via Nintendo's newly released Nintendo Today app, after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-working-on-a-live-action-the-legend-of-zelda-movie">company confirmed a film was in the works in November 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Little else is known about the film at this point, whether it will be inspired by one game predominantly, or who has been cast as the iconic Link or titular princess.</p>
<p>Rumours have circled around Euphoria star Hunter Schafer for the role of Zelda, though reports have also emerged she is being eyed instead for a big Marvel role.</p>
<p>The Zelda film will of course follow the hugely successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-is-the-biggest-video-game-adaptation-ever">biggest video game film adaptation ever</a>.</p>
<p>The Mario film has a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">sequel already lined up for April next year</a>. The film will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-bros-movie-2s-new-characters-will-include-old-favourites-and-really-deep-cuts">reportedly include "old favourites" and "really deep cuts"</a>. Here at Eurogamer, we're particularly hoping for Birdo.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
