BioWare appears to have bid farewell to any further updates for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, following the launch this week of the game's Patch 5.
</p>
<p>
Patch <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-5-release-notes">notes</a> for the update thank fans for playing Dragon Age: The Veilguard over the past few months while some small additional quality of life features have been implemented. 
</p>
<p>
BioWare goes on to state that it is now happy the game is in a "stable place" and will move to monitoring for any reports of game-breaking bugs, should these occur.
</p>
<p>
The patch notes finish with "Dareth shiral!" - meaning '<em>farewell</em>', or '<em>safe journey</em>' in the game's Elvish language. It really sounds like this is it.

Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-ea-sports-fc-25-and-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-as-it-lowers-financial-forecast">EA said Dragon Age: The Veilguard had missed the publisher's own internal targets</a>, after it "engaged" 1.5 million players between October 2024 and the end of the year, "down nearly 50 percent from the company's expectations".
</p>
<p>Last week, Eurogamer published the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-game-director-leaving-bioware">first statement from Dragon Age: The Veilguard game director Corinne Busche</a>, discussing her exit from the studio.</p>
<p>
While large updates to Dragon Age: The Veilguard were not expected and BioWare had already ruled out the prospect of DLC, fans have still reacted in surprise at the sudden end to any further small additions.
</p>
<p>
There had been some hope of a New Game Plus mode being added, for example, as well as further cosmetic options for character clothing designs.
</p>
<p>
Instead, Patch 5 contains a number of small bug fixes, and one final quality of life change: "Recommended levels have been added to side quests that players may receive at significantly lower levels."
</p>
<p>
Dareth shiral, Dragon Age: The Veilguard. On the upside, here's hoping this helps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-isnt-ready-to-suddenly-have-a-team-of-250-300-people-working-on-it-now-dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-done">BioWare get work spun up more quickly on Mass Effect 5</a>.
