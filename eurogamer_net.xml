Ubisoft has finally lifted the lid on what to expect from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' post-launch plans, which will include "regular" dollops of extra story missions, fan-requested features and a New Game Plus option. 
</p>
<p>
New story "drops" will be free, provide new allies for your base, fresh abilities and activities, and "additional backstory that will permanently impact the game", Ubisoft has said.
</p>
<p>
There will also be a focus on further fleshing out side characters, as evidenced by the first mission, due early next month, which will centre on Portuguese character Luis Frois.

<p>
Other upcoming free content includes new difficulty settings, photo mode updates (including poses), extra parkour options, plus additional Codex updates and battle pass-esque Projects. There's also mention of "special collaborations" - which sound a lot like Assassin's Creed is dipping its toe back into crossover territory. (Remember when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-assassins-creed-origins-will-get-a-chocobo-horse">Chocobo turned up in Assassin's Creed Origins</a>?)
</p>
<p>
There's less detail, for now, on Shadows' first major expansion Claws of Awaji. Ubisoft noted today that the add-on - provided free to those who pre-ordered Shadows - will be set after the game's current epilogue, and pick up both Naoe and Yasuke's ongoing stories. When will it arrive? Ubisoft isn't telling - instead saying simply it'll launch "later this year".
</p>
<p>
Other gameplay changes coming include a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-fans-have-a-list-of-features-ubisoft-should-add-next">slew of fan-requests that Eurogamer noted shortly after Shadows' launch</a>, including the ability to remove your headgear in cutscenes. Additional parkour options such as height-gaining back and side ejects plus a new vertical ledge jump are also on the way.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Assassin's Creed Shadows free post-launch roadmap:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early May:</strong> The Works of Luis Frois story mission, codex update, quality of life improvements</li>
<li><strong>Late May:</strong> First "special collaboration", parkour update, photo mode update</li>
<li><strong>June:</strong> Second story mission including new ally, new difficulty settings, gameplay immersion options, open world alarm system, headgear in cutscene option</li>
<li><strong>Future:</strong> New Game Plus, more story missions, additional community feedback updates, further special collaborations, codex updates, rewards and Animus content</li>
</ul>
<p>
"Majestic in scope, impressive in detail, Assassin's Creed Shadows honours the beauty of feudal Japan," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Eurogamer's Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>, "even if its strongest moments are saved for the personal stories of its two protagonists."

</figure>
<p>A particular highlight here is the poker-themed roguelike Balatro. Released last year, Balatro <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poker-themed-roguelike-balatro-deals-out-1m-sales-in-first-month">sold 1m copies in its first month</a> and then proceeded to  scoop up numerous awards, most recently including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">BAFTA for Best Debut game</a>.</p>
<p>"A poker roguelike is such a brilliant idea you almost don't need to make it to see how clever it is. There are a few of these, and Balatro is comfortably the best I've played. It really is ingenious - and it's also ingeniously simple," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-review">Eurogamer's Balatro review</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we quite enjoyed the boltgun in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-boltgun">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a>, with Rick Lane stating it "earns a place in the pantheon of great video game weapons" in Eurogamer's review. However, he didn't feel the rest of the game's arsenal could quite live up to the thrill of the boltgun.</p>
<p>"If you want to make a big ol' mess with one excellent gun and several other decent ones, Boltgun satisfies this desire. A few design tweaks and a little more attention to detail would elevate it from a good shooter into a great one, but as a throwback starter course to the hotly anticipated main that is Space Marine 2, Boltgun does an acceptable job of stimulating the tastebuds," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review-a-signature-weapon-so-good-it-breaks-the-game">Eurogamer's Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun review</a>.</p>
<p>Last up, we have <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended</a>, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-delayed-survival-evolved-official-servers-to-shut-down-later-this-year">Unreal Engine 5 "next-generation remake" of the original Ark game</a>. Our Matt took the souped up Ark for a whirl on its release, calling it "a striking upgrade", but one that still has some flaws.</p>
<p>"Ark has long felt like a game that came into being through sheer fluke rather than any notable design acumen on the part of Wildcard, and it's a sense only exacerbated in Ascended. There just doesn't seem to be any consistency of vision here; you get new dinosaurs and new building pieces, a photo mode, cross-platform support - but tutorials are non-existent; I'm still stuck laboriously faffing around with an awkward, unintuitive inventory system; balance is all over the place, and on it goes," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-survival-ascended-is-a-striking-upgrade-but-old-problems-set-alarm-bells-ringing">Eurogamer's Ark: Survival Ascended feature from 2023</a>.</p>
<p>"Ark: Survival Ascended is just an incredibly weird beast, a remake absolutely in thrall of the shiny stuff but with minimal regard for the fundamental annoyances that have long plagued the game."</p>
<p>The above three games will be available for PS Plus subscribers until 2nd June.</p>

<p>PlayStation Plus members have until 5th May to add <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-your-ps-plus-games-for-april">RoboCop: Rogue City, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth – Hacker’s Memory to their game library</a>.</p>

        <p>Won't use AI generation itself to make new skins.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> maker Epic Games has weighed in on the increasing use of AI-generated thumbnail images within the game by third-party creators for their own mini-games. 
</p>
<p>
As well as its popular battle royale modes, Fortnite is also home to thousands of user-generated Islands, hundreds of which are recommended to players at any given time from the game's main menu. 
</p>
<p>
The growing use of AI-generated imagery to advertise these Islands has sometimes left Fortnite's main screen feeling awash with AI slop - and it's something Epic Games has now been asked about. Will the developer put a stop to it? In a word, no - though don't expect Epic Games to start using AI within any of its own first-party modes.
</p>
<p>
"From our perspective, for moderation, thumbnails - like, we don't really care what tool you use to make your thumbnails," product management director Dan Walsh said in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDZYR0gEsfg">interview with Mustard Plays</a>. "All we care about is whether or not it's compliant with our rules.
</p>
<p>
"I think to some degree AI is going to become more and more difficult to detect," Walsh continued. "It's not going to stand out as a unique thing, it's just going to be another tool that people are using to create things. 
</p>
<p>
"So trying to look for that specifically is going to become increasingly difficult to the point where it's probably going to become unenforceable. We're really just focused on - 'does this asset comply with our rules, yes or no?', not 'what tool did you use to make this asset'?"
</p>
<p>
Discussing the idea of Epic Games using AI image generation for its own experiences in future, executive vice president Sax Persson emphasised the company's stance that the "best results" came from humans still. So don't expect an AI-generated Fishstick skin in the shop anytime soon.

<p>
"We've always embraced new technology, but with an ethical stance on the source, like as we generate things, it has to be understood and it has to be properly licensed," Persson said of Epic Games' potential AI use. "So to that degree, we rely on what we provide to people directly to be the best tools that we can humanly do, but the ethical guidelines are proper ownership."
</p>
<p>
The fact that people can still tell that third-party thumbnails are obviously made by AI was an example of how human-made images remained the better option, Persson continued. 
</p>
<p>
"Do we feel like we need to start making Fortnite outfits using AI models? No. We believe the approach we have taken embraces technology but puts humans in the centre of it still, because that's how you get the best results."
</p>
<p>
Back in February, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-admits-call-of-duty-includes-generative-ai">Activision admitted it had begun using AI generation within Call of Duty</a> - after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-block-ops-6-players-accuse-activision-of-using-ai-slop">the discovery by fans of in-game artwork featuring a six-fingered character</a>.
