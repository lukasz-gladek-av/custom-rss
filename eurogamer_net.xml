            <p>Rhythm action game No Straight Roads is set to receive a sequel across PC and consoles next year.</p>
<p>The sequel will continue the adventures of its rock star duo Mayday and Zuke, as they embark on a world tour to "climb the international charts" along with two new playable band members with unique musical and combat styles.</p>
<p>No Straight Roads first released in 2020, followed by an Encore Edition in 2021. Set in a cartoonish world where "real" rock music is overthrown by evil EDM, it fuses combat and platforming with rhythmic timing.</p>

<p>Sound familiar? Essentially, No Straight Roads walked so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-review-an-unrepentant-riot-of-rhythm-action">Hi-Fi Rush could run three years later</a>. And while Tango Gameworks' game is a superior realisation of rhythmic action, Malaysian studio Metronomik's game is still a lot of fun.</p>
<p>For starters, No Straight Roads has an infectious soundtrack, with each song performed in both a rock and EDM style to match the genre clash of the narrative. What's more, the soundtrack dynamically shifts between genres depending on how successfully you're able to beat up the bad guys.</p>
<p>The sequel promises all-new music from previous game's composer James Landino, as well as additional musical guest stars. It will also have "revitalised" combat with collaborative link attacks, a greater focus on action, and a "huge" roster of megabosses to defeat.</p>
<p>"We are SO excited to reveal the first look at NSR2 to fans today," said Wan Hazmer, CEO and game director at Metronomik. "We're taking everything players loved about the first No Straight Roads and turning it up to 11. Expect incredible music, wacky bosses and engaging, imaginative cities to explore on Bunkbed Junction's rocketok tour across the globe! We can't wait for players to rock out with NSR2 in 2026."</p>
<p>Eurogamer described the game as "a quirky but overly simplistic action-adventure" in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-straight-roads-review-a-quirky-but-overly-simplistic-action-adventure">No Straight Roads review</a>. Hopefully the sequel can add some extra depth when it arrives next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> has been Nintendo's biggest launch here in the UK, but sits behind the launches of Sony's PS5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>That's according to data from NielsenIQ shared by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/switch-2-is-nintendos-biggest-uk">The Game Business</a>. Switch 2 has reportedly outsold the original Switch at launch by over two to one in the UK and has also beaten the Nintendo 3DS, which was previously the company's biggest launch.</p>
<p>While NielsonIQ doesn't share numbers, for comparison the original Switch sold over 80,000 at launch in the UK, and the 3DS sold 113,000.</p>

<p>It's an impressive start, then, as the company has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-predicts-switch-2-will-outsell-its-predecessor-at-launch-despite-demand-exceeding-expectations">predicted globally Switch 2 will sell 15m units</a> from release until the end of the financial year - about on par with the previous console.</p>
<p>However, in the UK at least, Switch 2's launch sits behind its rivals.</p>
<p>In terms of the biggest UK console launches of all time (excluding handhelds), Switch 2 is the fourth best-selling in terms of units - it's behind the PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>In terms of revenue, the Switch 2 is the third best-selling console in the UK - it's beaten the PS4, which was sold for a lower price.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait for official word from Nintendo until we find out the full global numbers for the Switch 2 launch.</p>
<p>At the least, in France the Switch 2 has reportedly sold over 200,000 units in its first weekend to record the best ever console launch in the country (according to <a href="https://x.com/GyoJvfr/status/1932014842652590330">French content creator Gyo</a>).</p>
<p>The news comes despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-switch-2-actually-cheaper-than-the-original-console-cost-in-the-uk-and-whats-the-situation-with-switch-2-pricing-globally">criticism of the console's high cost</a>, as well as the price of its games and accessories around the world.</p>
<p>As for the previous console, Nintendo stated in its previous financial report it expects to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-expects-switch-1-to-become-its-best-selling-hardware-ever-this-year-but-fall-just-short-of-ps2-record">sell a further 4.5m Switch units this year</a>, which would see it overtake the Nintendo DS as the company's best-selling hardware ever.</p>
<p>Globally, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-shipped-an-impressive-4-7m-in-four-months">original Switch sold 4.7m units in its first four months on sale</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
