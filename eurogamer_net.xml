            <p>
With the end of the year looming, Hello Games' exploratory space sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> is - in an occurrence that's rapidly becoming a bit of a tradition - revisiting all its limited-time Expedition events from 2024 over the next ten weeks. That means you've got another chance to whizz through and earn their various rewards if you missed them the first time around.
</p>
<p>
And I do mean whizz. While Expeditions ordinarily last around six weeks, No Man's Sky's latest Redux event is racing through this year's offerings at a pace of one a fortnight. Furthermore, things are already underway with Omega - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-is-free-to-play-this-weekend-as-new-omega-update-lands">kicked off 2024's Expeditions</a> back in February - now live and running until 11th December.
</p>
<p>
Omega (as is the case for all future Expeditions) can be accessed via the terminal in No Man's Sky's communal Space Anomaly, and - among its many rewards - gives players the opportunity to earn the rather flashy Starborn starship. Before we cover the highlights of each Expedition, though, here's the upcoming Redux schedule in full:

<ul>
<li>Omega: 27th November - 11th December</li>
<li>Adrift: 11th December - 25th December</li>
<li>Liquidators: 25th December - 8th January</li>
<li>Aquarius: 8th January - 22nd January</li>
<li>The Cursed: 22nd January - 5th February</li>
</ul>
<p>
Rewards for Adrift, which sees players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-latest-update-lets-players-explore-a-lonely-abandoned-universe-devoid-of-life">stranded alone in an empty universe</a>, include a haunted frigate known as the Ship of the Damned. Liquidators, meanwhile, features organic chitlin armour to earn as players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-borrows-some-of-light-no-fires-fancy-tech-for-a-planetary-overhaul-in-latest-update">embark on a Starship Troopers-style bug hunt</a> across the stars. 
</p><p>
As for Aquarius, it's a fairly leisurely Expedition primarily concerned with introducing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-gets-reel-in-new-aquarius-fishing-update">No Man's Sky's new fishing system</a>, and rewards here include the Lost Angler's fishing equipment and a octopus-inspired bobblhead for your starship's dashboard. As finally, there's The Cursed - a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-the-cursed-is-a-spooky-expedition-for-halloween-set-in-a-collapsing-reality">horror-themed Expedition</a> set in a collapsing reality populated by spectral entities. Rewards here are pretty nifty, including the Cthulhu-esque Horror Exosuit customisation, bioluminescent pets, and the UFO-like Boundary Herald starship.
</p>
<p>
Hello Games' Expedition Redux event is now underway on all platforms, and it follows yesterday's news that No Man's Sky has finally - eight years after its rocky launch - managed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eight-years-after-its-rocky-launch-no-mans-sky-finally-hits-very-positive-reviews-on-steam">hit the "Very Positive" reviews threshold</a> on Steam. Reaching the coveted "Overwhelmingly Positive" ranking will be a bit of a challenge given the way Steam ratings are calculated, but who knows - Hello Games has <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/11/holiday-2024-expeditions/">confirmed</a> it still has "much more in store" for No Man's Sky.

            <p>
Thursday is upon us, meaning the Epic Games Store's latest freebie is now live - and to coincide with its arrival, Epic has revealed the next two games it'll be making free in seven days time.
</p>
<p>
First up for those wanting immediate amusement is developer Blowfish's Brotato, which is free to download right now until next Thursday, 5th December. It's a top-down arena shooter roguelite in which players, in the role of the titular potato, fend off alien hordes using up to six weapons at a time. Regrettably, I can't give you Eurogamer's verdict on it seeing as we haven't revewied it, but I <em>can</em> tell you it's currently rated Overwhelmingly Positive on Steam.
</p>
<p>
As for next week's Epic freebies - which take over from Brotato in seven days time - you'll be getting public transportation shenanigans in Stillalive Studios' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bus-simulator-21">Bus Simulator 21</a>, plus some family friendly sci-fi action-adventure in TT Games' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga">Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a>.
</p>

<p>
The latter, if you're unfamiliar, is a Lego-ised retelling of all three Star Wars movie trilogies, combined with some exploration and collectible gathering across a large selection of open-world planets. Eurogamer editor-in-chief Tom Phillips called The Skywalker Saga "humourous if simple fun" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-review-a-complete-but-cluttered-collection">2022 review</a>, noting, however, that its open-world elements "held less pull."
</p>
<p>
Still, if it's freebies you want, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/brotato-ed4097">Brotato is your current Epic Games Store treat</a>, with Bus Simulator 21 and The Skywalker Saga taking its place starting next Thursday, 5th December.
