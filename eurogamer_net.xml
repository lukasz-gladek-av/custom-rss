Spring is officially here and the Epic Games Store is celebrating the occassion with a two-week long, seasonally appropriate Spring Sale. But bargain hunters can <em>also</em> pick up Epic's latest selection of free weekly games, which are available to download now.
</p>
<p>
As is customary, Epic latest freebies are available for seven days - starting today, 27th March, and continuing until next Thursday, 3rd April. After which another free title - currently listed as "mystery game" - will take over. Notably, clues suggests there's a bit of a cat theme for the duration of this year's Spring Sale, given the feline wrapping paper currently obscuring next week's title, and the two free games available right now:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Cat Quest</li>
<li>Neko Ghost, Jump!</li>
</ul>

<p>
Cat Quest, if you're unfamiliar, is the first game in developer The Gentlebros' now three-strong casual action-RPG series. It's a lot of fun too, taking everything you'd ordinarily expect to find in an action-RPG - real-time combat, dungeon crawling, equipment progression, and so on - and turning it into a breezy, super-streamlined, pick-up-and-play package. It also has more cat puns than is probably legal, and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/cat-quest-8373e0">you can grab it for free here</a>.
</p>
<p>
I'm less familiar with Neko Ghost, Jump!, but a quick bit of investigatory Googling reveals it to be a puzzle platformer that sees players switching between 2D and 3D perspectives as they attempt to navigate its 40+ stages. It's the work of developer Burgos Games, contains a further multitude of cats, and can be <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/neko-ghost-jump">downloaded for free on Epic here</a>.
</p>
<p>
To recap, you've gone seven days from today, 27th March, to add Epic's latest weekly freebies to your Epic Games Store library, after which they'll make way for something new. And if you do head over to Epic's digital storefront, you'll find the Spring Sale is also currently underway. This runs until 9th April, and promises up to 75 percent off selected games.

            <p>
Of all the mysteries still surrounding Switch 2, its rumoured 'C' button is perhaps the most enigmatic. Not least because when Nintendo finally revealed its Switch successor earlier this year, there was a conspicuously blank square where everyone was expecting a 'C' button to be. Now, though, with Switch 2's full reveal just a week away, the 'C' has finally, quietly been confirmed in an official image for the newly announced Nintendo Today mobile app.
</p>
<p>
Reports of a Switch 2 'C' button first emerged prior to Nintendo's official reveal, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-leaks-turn-into-deluge-as-dummy-units-shown-at-ces">various leaks</a> indicating it would be situated below the 'home' button on the console's right-hand Joy-Con. And a button mostly fitting that description did eventually show up when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2's hardware design was finally unveiled in January</a> - albeit minus the 'C'.
</p>
<p>
But now the 'C' is official. During <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-nintendo-direct-march-2025">Nintendo's latest Direct showcase</a>, the company unveiled its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">new calendar-style Nintendo Today news app</a>. And an accompanying App Store and Google Play promotional image just so happened to include a picture of Switch 2 - now with its mysterious Joy-Con button firmly emblazoned with its long-rumoured 'C':
</p>

 </a>

<p>
Of course, confirmation of the 'C' doesn't get us any closer to solving the mystery of what the button actually <em>does</em>. Some have speculated the 'C' is merely a nod to GameCube's 'C' button, itself an evolution of the yellow 'C' buttons on N64. But others have suggested the 'C' stands for more than just the first letter of the alphabet not already taken by other buttons on Switch 2.

<p>
Some, for instance, have reasoned it could stand for 'Cast' if Nintendo was considering some sort of streaming functionality for the console, or perhaps 'Chat' in the event it's planning more robust social features for its Switch successor. There've even been rumours it stands for 'Campus', claimed to be an evolution of Wii U's much-loved Miiverse. Alternatively, it could be a button to activate <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-trailer-appears-to-confirm-joy-con-mouse-functionality">Switch 2's leaked mouse functionality</a>, with the 'C' not actually standing for anything at all. Or perhaps it'll summon Fire Emblem's Chrom to have a little wink at you.
</p>
<p>
Whatever the now officially 'C'd button does, all will likely be revealed next week when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">Nintendo's hugely anticipated Switch 2-focused Direct</a> airs. It all kicks off at 2pm next Wednesday, 2nd April, in the UK. And needless to say, Eurogamer will 'C' you there.
