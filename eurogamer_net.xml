            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> is looking to boost the availability and accessibility of its games by ensuring future releases are "released simultaneously" on different platforms.</p>

<p>"Of course, we want you to play it a lot on other platforms as well," he said, talking about the upcoming release of. Fantasian Neo Dimension. "This time, we will also release the Xbox Series X|S version at the same time.</p>
<p>"In the future, Square Enix titles will be released simultaneously on each platform more and more, but since this is close to the first release, we would like Xbox users to play it as well."</p>
<p>Yoshida also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gikb5o/yoship_said_in_an_interview_with_4gamer_that_he/">teased</a> that he would like a re-release of Vagrant Story and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>, and "joked around with Hironobu Sakaguchi about the possibility of a new Parasite Eve game".</p>

        <p>"That attitude has remained consistent throughout my works and in Slitterhead."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Slitterhead creator Keiichiro Toyama says that he and the team at Bokeh Game Studio are committed to "originality", even if that comes at the cost of a game being "a bit rough around the edges".</p>
<p>Toyama - who created <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gravity-rush">Gravity Rush</a>, Silent Hill, and the terrifying Siren series - hasn't released a new game since 2008's Siren: Blood Siren, making this week's launch of Slitterhead especially exciting for horror fans.</p>

<p>Talking to <a href="https://gamerant.com/slitterhead-horror-game-like-silent-hill-toyama/">GameRant</a>, Toyama stressed that he has always fought to ensure that his games feel fresh and unique above all else.</p>
<p>"From the very first Silent Hill, we have maintained a commitment to freshness and originality, even if it means being a bit rough around the edges," Toyama said.</p>
<p>"That attitude has remained consistent throughout my works and in Slitterhead."</p>
<p>Quite what, exactly, Toyama thinks is "rough" about Slitterhead remains to be seen, but thankfully, we don't have to wait long - the highly-anticipated action horror is out later this week, coming to PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, PlayStation 4, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on 8th November 2024.</p><p>Slitterhead was first announced back in 2021. We first got a good look at it last summer, when a developer diary revealed new details about its inaugural title, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slitterheads-unique-mechanics-include-a-playable-dog">including a sneaky peek at some of the game's enemies, abilities</a>, and - surprise! - the ability to play as a dog, something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slitterheads-release-date-and-trailer-have-popped-up-online">reprised in leaked footage in June</a>, too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Last night we addressed an issue that occasionally limited the amount of 2XP awarded to some players as we continue to assess and balance progression tuning," Treyarch explained in a social media post.</p>
<p>"As a result, we are extending 2XP, 2X Weapon XP, and 2X GobbleGum earn rate until Nov. 5th at 10 am/PT."</p>
<p>That gives players in the UK until 6pm to make use of the promotion.</p> <div>

<p>Yesterday we reported how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-dont-stand-still-in-black-ops-6s-zombie-mode">Call of Duty Black Ops 6 players were calling on Activision to suspend the AFK timer in its Zombie mode</a>, especially as they work to solve the Liberty Falls easter egg.</p>
<p>In threads that have garnered hundreds of replies and thousands of upvotes, several redditors have shared their frustrations when they were unceremoniously kicked for inactivity, even when they were playing on their own.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review">Call of Duty Black Op 6's campaign review</a>, Chris T. said it was a "return to form for the series, mixing the usual, slightly unsavoury real-world set dressing with cracking action, horror twists and tongue-in-cheek charm".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
