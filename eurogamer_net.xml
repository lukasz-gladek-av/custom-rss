            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> studio Arrowhead has shared a number of former pitches, including a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-fox">Star Fox</a>-style game based within the Helldivers universe.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/pilestedt/status/1874226763913715938">In a New Year's post on X</a>, Arrowhead CCO and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> creative director, Johan Pilestedt, asked players to share their "expectations and desires for what the next Arrowhead game will be", hinting that he was "working on the high concept" to the studio's next release.</p>

<p>Responding to comments from the community, Pilestedt then opened up about a number of "high concept" pitches previously considered, including the Star Fox-esque game tentatively called "Eagles of Democracy".</p>
<p>"We made a prototype in unreal," Pilestedt <a href="https://x.com/Yurka_Shaman/status/1874267225554903448">added</a>. "It would basically try to capture Starfox. So arcade... but still simulated.</p>
<p>"The title was 'Eagles of Democracy'."</p>

<p>Pilestedt also shared that the team had previously worked on a concept for a top-down reimagining of the 1990 arcade game, Smash TV, too:</p>

</p></div>

<p>"Smash TV is a top-down reimagining of the classic arcade game of 1990," the pitch began which was reportedly written around 12 years ago. "The game pits up to four contestants in a violent game show set in the distant future of 1999. The game focuses on the source inspiration for Smash TV to create a game filled with brutal action, death traps, and gladiator-inspired game shows.</p>
<p>"The game plays homage to 80s action movies such as The Running Man, Total Recall, RoboCop, and Escape from New York, tying everything together with cheesy music, 'cool' visual effects and over-the-top storytelling."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developers-respond-to-criticism-of-killzone-2-crossover-cost">Arrowhead recently responded to criticism from players of the high cost of its Killzone 2 crossover</a>, eventually deciding to gift all players the planned second set of the collaboration items for free.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>'s new in-game event based on Squid Game will go live at 6pm UK time today (10am PT / 1pm ET), but its coolest rewards are locked behind the event's own premium battle pass.</p>
<p>As detailed in a new <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-squid-game-event-bundles-announcement">blog post</a>, the Squid Games crossover invites players to "win it all or die trying", introducing themed awards and multiple limited-time modes across multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone inspired by the hit <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> show, as well as Pink Guards, VIPs, and the singing, slightly-murderous Red Light Green Light doll, Young-hee.</p>

            <p>If you, like me, rather enjoyed The Rise of the Golden Idol - a game we called "a compelling modern mystery thriller that's bigger, better and more ambitious than its already brilliant predecessor" - then this news may be right up your alley.</p>
<p>Will Ackermann, one of The Rise of the Golden Idol's game designers, has today unveiled his next game: City of Voices. He's working on it in collaboration with pixel artist Matt Frith through his own studio Kini Games.</p>
<p>Described as a "Golden Idol-like" release, City of Voices takes place in suburban England, and focuses on a young girl who on her first day at secondary school gets bullied. If that wasn't enough to deal with, she is soon "thrust into a fantastical adventure", putting even more on her plate.</p>

<p>Like the Golden Idol games, City of Voices will similarly challenge players to "investigate a series of moments frozen in time, examining clues and solving deduction puzzles to uncover a rich story". However, in a change from the Golden Idol games, players will instead need to answer questions by choosing from a selection of images (see below), rather than dragging and dropping words into place.</p>
<p>If this sounds like City of Voices is still treading <em>a little too closely</em> to the Golden Idol formula, don't worry. Ackermann made sure he got the blessing from their creators before cracking on with his own game.</p>
<p>"I was quite nervous about asking Andrejs and Ernests, who co-created those games, for permission to essentially steal their mechanics," Ackermann admitted, "but luckily, they were flattered!"</p>
<p>Frith added: "Since then, they've both been really supportive, and have even said they 'loved every minute of the demo' we've made, which means so much to us. We hope other players will feel the same way."</p>
<p>There isn't currently a release date for City of Voices, but it is available to wishlist now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3342470/City_of_Voices/">Steam</a>. You can check out a trailer for it above.</p>

<p>As for The Rise of the Golden Idol, we awarded it four out of five stars on its release.</p>
<p>"This is a brilliantly plotted thriller story stuffed with an enormous cast of memorable scoundrels, buffoons and quietly tragic onlookers, and it's all backed up by wonderfully devised puzzles that really give your brain a good runaround before you're able to prise open its hard-won secrets," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-review">Eurogamer's Rise of the Golden Idol review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-vision-pro-3500-headset-reportedly-no-longer-in-production-as-stock-piles-up</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-vision-pro-3500-headset-reportedly-no-longer-in-production-as-stock-piles-up<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Apple has reportedly ceased production of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-unveils-3499-augmented-reality-vision-pro-headset">expensive £3500 Vision Pro headset</a>, as unsold stock has piled up.
</p>
<p>
The detail comes from a report by <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-sharply-scales-back-production-of-vision-pro">The Information</a>, initially published last year, that has now been more widely disseminated (thanks, <a href="https://kotaku.com/apple-vision-pro-vr-mixed-reality-report-1851731279">Kotaku</a>). </p>
<p>
According to sources, Apple component manufacturers had supplied enough parts for at least 500k Vision Pro headsets by October 2024, but had only actually sold around 370k. This had left "tens of thousands of undelivered parts" still awaiting use.
</p>
<p>
Apple reportedly believes it has now manufactured enough components to meet the Vision Pro's overall expected lifetime sales, which are lower than expected.
</p>
<p>
These numbers roughly tally with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-reportedly-scales-back-sales-target-for-3499-vision-pro-headset-due-to-production-difficulties">report published by the UK's Financial Times last summer</a>, in which components suppliers claimed they expected to produce fewer than 400k units of the Vision Pro by the end of last year.

<p>
That same report claimed Apple had significantly scaled back its internal sales targets for the headset due to production difficulties, after previously expecting at least 1m sales in 2024.
</p>
<p>
Apple has reportedly struggled to easily produce the Vision Pro's two micro-OLED displays for each eye, as well as the device's outward facing lens. 
</p>
<p>
The Vision Pro's cost - around 10 times that of Meta Quest VR headsets - has likely also been a factor, placing the device out of reach of many VR enthusiasts. And while Apple still reportedly has plans to follow the Vision Pro with further devices, the company is still to make its usage case clear.
</p><p>
Apple describes The Vision Pro as a "spatial computer" that "seamlessly blends digital content with your physical space" and navigate apps or media via voice commands, eye tracking, and hand tracking. Some "spatial games" are also supported, including What the Golf?, Game Room, and Super Fruit Ninja - you can see that in action above.
</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Apple for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Fantastic Four are on their way to Marvel Rivals.</p>
<p>Whilst it's yet to be formally confirmed when Mister Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, the Human Torch, and the Thing will arrive in the free-to-play hero PvP shooter, a teaser posted to X told fans to expect more in a new trailer dropping on Monday, 6th January, just ahead of Season 1's launch on 9th January.</p>

<p>This may not be a surprise for some given The Fantastic Four have long been rumoured to be on the way following datamines that even precede the game's full launch. It's fair to say, however, that some didn't expect their arrival quite so soon.</p> <div>

<p>The timing also ties in nicely with the release of the next Marvel movie, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, which is slated to release on 25th July, 2025.</p>
<p>Expect more information when the trailer drops next week.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-review">Eurogamer's Marvel Rivals review</a>, Chris awarded it two stars out of five, saying, "NetEase's spin on the hero battler is complex and moreish, but rarely much actual fun. Its biggest impact is a renewed appreciation for the rivals that do it better".</p><p>"I like the invention of special character team-ups, which feels perfectly Marvel in itself. I like the enduring sense of competition it inspires. I just don't truly like much else. The end result is a game that, above all, makes the success of its own rivals much more clear to me."</p>

<p>This latest sales figure means that Stardew Valley has sold a further 11m copies in less than a year.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1762195335936627147">February of last year</a>, creator  Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone revealed his game had moved more than 30m copies since launch. Even then, that number was impressive, but clearly the appeal of pixelated chickens and crops is still enough to entice even more players to take to the farm.</p><p>It is worth noting that last year, Barone also released Stardew Valley's bumper 1.6 update, which essentially boosted the game to an almost 2.0 status. This update introduced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-will-soon-let-players-drink-mayonnaise">ability for players to drink mayonnaise</a>, among a vast number of other features such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-16-update-is-finally-here-with-some-impressively-lengthy-patch-notes">new NPC dialogues, home renovations and turtle pets</a>. This update was released on PC first, before becoming available across all platforms.</p>
<p>As for the future, Barone is also working on his next game: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a>. In May of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-creator-wont-rush-haunted-chocolatier-better-to-have-a-good-delayed-game-than-a-bad-game-on-time">Barone said he's "not too concerned with the pressure" of releasing Haunted Chocolatier</a>, stating, "it's better to have a delayed game that's actually good than a bad game that's on time".</p>
<p>In the meantime, if it is more Stardew Valley you are after, a new concert <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-symphony-of-seasons-concert-tour-announced-coming-to-the-uk-in-2026">known as Symphony of Seasons</a> was announced in November. The concert tour will be coming to the UK in 2026.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
