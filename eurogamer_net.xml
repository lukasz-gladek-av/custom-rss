            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Those keen to get their hands on Xbox's recently announced handheld consoles ROG Ally and Ally X may be able to preorder the devices as of next month.</p>
<p>According to the ever reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-vous-devoile-la-date-douverture-des-ventes-60300">Dealabs</a>, preorders will go live on 20th August. That's the day <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> kicks off, with the convention in Cologne running between 20th and 24th August. During this time, attendees will be able to go <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-xbox-branded-asus-handheld-finally-gets-an-official-reveal">hands-on with the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X</a>.</p>
<p>Dealabs added that the devices will be priced thus: €599 for the Xbox Ally and €899 for the Xbox Ally X. That's around £518 and £777 here in the UK. Current suggestion is Xbox's handheld devices will then be available in October, although an exact date has not yet been specified. Previously, Xbox said the devices would be available this "holiday" period, across select countries.</p>

<p>The Xbox ROG Ally and ROG Ally X are both powered by Windows 11, and feature an "immersive" full-screen Xbox experience, plus an aggregated gaming library with access to installed games from a range of PC stores, including Steam, Battle.net, and GOG. And, of course, the machine supports Xbox Play Anywhere titles, of which there are now over 1,000.</p>
<p>Those opting for the standard Xbox ROG Ally can expect an AMD Ryzen Z2 A Processor within, alongside 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage, while the Ally X upgrades that to an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor and 24GB of high-speed RAM.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Xbox laid out its Gamescom plans, when it confirmed that not only will those in attendance be able to give the ROG Ally and Ally X a shot, but also that<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-has-laid-out-its-gamescom-plans-and-they-include-a-playable-demo-of-hollow-knight-silksong"> its booth will include a playable demo of Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Other games available to try out on the company's upcoming handheld devices include Roblox, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-handheld-consoles-rog-ally-and-ally-x-preorders-open-during-gamescom-report-says]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microsoft is implementing age verification for Xbox users, in compliance with the UK's new Online Safety Act.</p>
<p>From today, players aged 18 and over based in the UK and accessing Xbox with a Microsoft account will be encouraged to verify their age. This, Microsoft said, is a one-time process to ensure access to age-appropriate experiences.</p>
<p>Then, starting early next year, age verification will be required for players in the UK to retain full access to Xbox social features, such as game invites and communication via voice and text. Without age verification, use of social features will be limited to friends only.</p>
<p>Microsoft has detailed the process on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-age-verification-uk/">Xbox Wire</a>, including a QR code to scan to begin the age verification process away from a console. Secure methods include proof of government-issued ID, age estimation, mobile provider check, and credit card check.</p>
<p>"As this age verification process rolls out across the UK, we'll continue to evaluate how we can keep players around the world safe and learn from the UK process," reads the Xbox Wire post from Xbox vice president of gaming trust and safety Kim Kunes.</p>
<p>"We expect to roll out age verification processes to more regions in the future. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to player safety, so these methods may look different across regions and experiences. We'll work with local communities, publishing partners and regulators to determine the right approach that both respects player privacy and doesn't take away from the Xbox gameplay experience. We'll continue to communicate the changes we're making to our practices and the data we collect so we can better protect players on our platform."</p>
<p>Xbox advises parents and caregivers to set up child or teen accounts, which do not require age verification and allow for gaming activities to be managed appropriately, including screentime and spending limits.</p>
<p>At present, Sony and Nintendo have not implemented similar measures. Eurogamer has contacted both companies for details on how they will comply with the new UK Act.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-introduces-new-safety-features-including-an-ai-to-estimate-a-teenagers-age-through-video-selfies">Roblox recently implemented new safety features</a> to ensure it's compliant, including a new age estimation tool.</p>
<p>"Safety has always been foundational to everything we do at Roblox, and we've spent nearly two decades building advanced safety tools," a Roblox spokesperson told Eurogamer. "Our Community Standards prohibit various types of content including content defined as harmful to children under the OSA. For some time, we've made certain features accessible only to ID-verified users over the age of 17.</p>
<p>"Two weeks ago, as part of our global roadmap to deliver age-appropriate content and features, we introduced a new facial age estimation tool, which unlocks access for users 13 and over to communicate more freely with people they know and trust - adding to a suite of more than 40 recent safety updates, such as updated parental controls and communications restrictions for our youngest users, which we have rolled out over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>"We take our legal obligations seriously and are working hard on the assessment and implementation of the Children's Code and will continue to engage with Ofcom."</p>
<p>Years in the making, the UK's Online Safety Act came into effect last Friday. Its aim is to make the internet safer, especially for children, which will impact social media, video-sharing platforms, and video games.</p>
<p>To find out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-online-safety-act-explainer">how the UK's Online Safety Act will impact the games industry</a>, Eurogamer spoke with the experts.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-users-will-now-need-to-verify-their-age-in-compliance-with-uks-online-safety-act]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-plans-warfare-2-installation-file</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-plans-to-remove-modern-warfare-2-and-3-from-game-launcher-to-reduce-the-frankly-comical-size-of-the-installation-file.1256127/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>If you're the sort of player that jumps into the yearly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> experience, there's probably one thing that's stuck with you more than anything else: that obscene download size.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the catch-all Call of Duty app (often referred to as Call of Duty HQ) via Xbox wants me to free up 381.19GB of space on my PC hard drive in order to install all the 'recommended' files it needs to run. The Steam app only requires 'at least' an SSD with 128GB available space, which is still, frankly, too much.</p>

<p>In an announcement made via <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1949968296121344261">Activision's CODUpdates account</a> on X, the publisher announced:</p>
<p>"On July 29 at 9am PT, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 will be moved from the main Call of Duty install and become standalone downloads."</p>
<p>That means, sometime this week, you will be able to load the games on their own - without the need for the massive download offered by the Call of Duty HQ app. In short, as soon as tomorrow (30th July), anyone that owns either of the games will be able to launch directly into the titles once downloaded. Read: no faffing with interstitial menus or confusing screens via the somewhat cumbersome app.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Legacy content for each title - this means MW2 and MW3 modes within the main Call of Duty HQ app - will be automatically removed on 7th August, freeing up space for players still wanting to access the other Call of Duty titles without bothering with the two affected titles.</p>
<p>Whether this indicates Activision is willing to remove other Call of Duty games from the app in the coming days and months remains unclear. It's also unclear why these two games have been targeted first: do they have a lower engagement rate than other titles? Are they simply easier to unhitch from the integrated ecosystem?</p>
<p>It also raises questions about upcoming series entry, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-promises-to-be-most-mind-bending-black-ops-ever">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a> (the multiplayer aspect of which we can expect to see sometime 'this summer').</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3s-up-to-200gb-file-sizes">Way back in 2023</a>, Activision justified its decision to merge all the games into one app by saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusing-call-of-duty-hq-launcher-justified-by-activision">it allowed for easier file management and seamless switching between games</a>. Even back then, the decision drew fire from the community. Players criticised the publisher for putting the onus on individuals to "reduce the overall footprint" of the title. At the time, players became frustrated and confused when trying to access games they actually owned, as the app kept presenting them with opportunities to purchase the newest content added to the store. As you can imagine, this went down poorly.</p>
<p>Are you still playing either of the affected titles? Is this going to have a meaningful impact on you - or your SSD? Is there any reason for you to go back to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023-campaign-review-vapid-and-hastily-assembled">the "vapid and hastily assembled" Modern Warfare 3 campaign</a>? Probably not, after all this.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-plans-warfare-2-installation-file]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/after-the-lukewarm-reception-to-battlefield-2042-fans-seem-to-be-getting-behind-battlefield-6-as-steam-wishlist-numbers-soar.1256067/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Battlefield 6 was officially unveiled earlier this month, and it looks like so far the community is keen for the upcoming release, despite the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042s-opening-weekend-has-been-a-disaster">somewhat lacklustre initial reception to its predecessor Battlefield 2042</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7355565272528826369-FoP1?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACr_MyIB0LsPQAIci9zs45L99nTb3k_h6f8">a LinkedIn post</a> shared by Alinea Analytics CEO Rickard Linder, following the debut of Battlefield 6's reveal trailer last week, the game racked up nearly 500,000 Steam wishlists over the weekend (thanks, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wishlist-on-steam-half-million/">Insider Gaming</a>). Linder added roughly 60 percent of those who added Battlefield 6 to their wishlist had played <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>.</p>
<p>This isn't too shabby when you consider that former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-review-dices-magic-fps-formula-gets-spread-too-thin">Eurogamer editor in chief Martin Robinson called Battlefield 2042 "the weakest Battlefield in some time"</a> when it first released in 2021. To be fair, the team did work on improving Battlefield 2042, and in 2023 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-with-humility-and-hustle-dice-might-yet-win-the-war">Eurogamer noted DICE had "course-corrected in dramatic fashion"</a>, though the developer would likely "have to wait for the next iteration to see its efforts rewarded". Given those wishlist numbers, it seems this may indeed be the case.</p>

<p>Like I said, we got our first look at Battlefield 6 last week, courtesy of a new trailer. While a firm release date was not provided as part of this reveal, the disclaimer URL featured in the video takes you to a page that says: "This promotional offer expires October 10, 2025. Code expires October 10, 2027." <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-finally-revealed-with-a-dedicated-multiplayer-reveal-coming-next-week">This indicates that pre-sell offers end on October 10, and that a release date for Battlefield 6 may be October 11, 2025</a>.</p>
<p>A separate multiplayer reveal is scheduled for later this week, on 31st July.</p>
<p>Aside from what has been officially announced, we already know a fair amount about the next Battlefield entry. Leaks from the Battlefield Labs tests revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-leak-confirms-return-of-fan-favourite-mode">Rush will be coming back to Battlefield 6</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-single-player-campaign-details-leak-online">single player details have spilled out into the internet</a>, and a variety of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-most-important-leaks-battlefield-6">weapons that'll be usable in the full release have made their way online, too</a>. Then, just this weekend, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leaks-keep-on-coming-this-time-its-the-battle-royale-map">Battlefield 6's Battle Royale map popped up online</a>.</p>

<p>Also recently shared via the world that is social media are images from the Battlefield 6 alpha showing that the 'Battlefield stretch neck' - which is exactly as it sounds, with players having overly stretched necks - is back (see image above).</p>
<p>"It is an absolute classic that dates all the way back to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-3">Battlefield 3</a> beta," <a href="https://x.com/rivaLxfactor/status/1949885360613323210">reads a post on X</a>. "It is a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>"Battlefield is so back."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-lukewarm-reception-to-battlefield-2042-fans-seem-to-be-getting-behind-battlefield-6-as-steam-wishlist-numbers-soar]]></content:encoded>
