            <p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl released yesterday, and has since seen a strong number of players jumping into The Zone over on Steam.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, its all-time player peak on Valve's platform is 113,587. Meanwhile, it has 71,497 players making their way through the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone at this very moment in time.</p>
<p>These numbers are perhaps not too surprising, given Stalker 2 was one of Steam's most wishlisted titles up until its debut. However, even with a strong wishlist, reviews of the game have pointed out that it has been released with a number of glaring technical issues. These issues are one of the reasons <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wheres-our-stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Eurogamer's own Stalker 2 review isn't on the site just yet</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-dev-acknowledges-rough-edges-says-its-monitoring-feedback">Stalker 2 team addressed these issues and acknowledged the game "may" have some "rough edges"</a> now that it is out. The studio has assured its players it will address any niggles that arise in the game, as and when it is able.</p><p>Many users have been forgiving of these issues, however, given the road developer GSC has had to take to get Stalker 2 released at all. Since 2022, GSC has delayed Stalker 2 several times due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-on-hold-ukraine-based-developer-confirms">Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>. This has seen the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-developer-reportedly-moving-to-prague-to-finish-game">relocate staff</a> to safely finish the project elsewhere, while others <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-harrowing-update-from-gsc-game-world-the-stalker-2-developer-based-in-ukraine">joined Ukraine's armed forces</a>, and dealt with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-dev-says-russian-hackers-have-leaked-test-build-online-asks-fans-not-to-share">Russian hackers who leaked test builds</a>.</p>
<p>Stalker 2 currency sits with a 'Very Positive' review average on Steam. "Stalker 2 is nothing short of a miracle," reads one user review.</p>

            <p>
Dragon Age: The Veilguard has launched to "solid" sales in the UK, though has numbers of "nearly 21 percent lower" than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>: Rebirth across Europe. 
</p>
<p>
That's according to European sales data analysed by Eurogamer sister site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/european-video-game-sales-jumped-12-in-october-on-the-back-of-blockbuster-launches-european-monthly-charts">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, which noted that Dragon Age: The Veilguard had been the continent's seventh biggest launch of October, after arriving on the 31st.
</p>
<p>
Over on Steam, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-off-to-solid-start-on-steam">Dragon Age: The Veilguard launched to a peak of 70,414 players</a>, setting a new record for a single-player game published by EA, previously held by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>. It's all-time peak is now 89,418, with around 23,000 people playing in the last 24 hours.

<p>
Steam reviews, which require users to own and have played the game, sit with a Mostly Positive rating. But on Metacritic, The Veilguard still sits with Generally Unfavourable rating, in contrast to its average score by critics. 
</p>
<p>
In a statement to Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metacritic-responds-after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-review-bombing">acknowledging the backlash to Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> on its site, a spokesperson for Metacritic parent company Fandom said its site was a "place of belonging for all fans".
</p>
<p>
"We take online trust and safety very seriously across all our sites including Metacritic," the spokesperson said. "Metacritic has a moderation system in place to track violations of our terms of use. Our team reviews each and every report of abuse (including but not limited to racist, sexist, homophobic, insults to other users, etc) and if violations occur, the reviews are removed."
</p><p>
"It is the strongest and loudest answer BioWare could have mustered for the people still doubting whether it could do it," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>. "The answer is yes, emphatically. The Veilguard is spectacular."

            <p>The publishing rights to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue-3">Shenmue 3</a> have transferred from Ys Net to ININ Games, sparking hope of a future multiplatform release.</p>
<p>Ys Net was founded by former Sega developer and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a> creator Yu Suzuki, initially to produce Shenmue 3. At release, the game was exclusive to PS4 and the Epic Games Store (for its first year). Even now, the game is only available on PS4 and PC (Epic and Steam).</p>
<p>Enter ININ Games, then, a German publisher focused on remakes and re-releases of Japanese games.</p>

<p>In fact, ININ Games published the console and PC versions of Suzuki's most recent game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/air-twister-review-yu-suzukis-space-harrier-successor-is-a-compelling-curio-rather-than-a-classic">arcade shooter Air Twister</a>, originally released exclusively on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a>.</p>
<p>This new publishing deal has therefore raised hope among Shenmue fans it could be released on other platforms, Xbox and Switch specifically.</p>
<p>Indeed, a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E8u6GL-k0QVeUeDzSSJ2RHZrgtKOvtqu/view">press release</a> states ININ Games is "excited to shepherd Shenmue 3 into its next phase" and the two companies will "honour the series' legacy while ensuring its accessibility to even more fans around the world".</p>
<p>Presumably, that includes its availability on multiple platforms.</p>
<p>ININ's releases include the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wonder-boy-asha-in-monster-world">Wonder Boy: Asha in Monster World</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/space-invaders">Space Invaders</a> Forever, the Taito Milestones series, and Shadow of the Ninja - Reborn.</p>
<p>Shenmue 3 received a mixed response on its release, though our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-3-review-a-faithful-follow-up-to-an-all-time-classic">Eurogamer review</a> was certainly positive. "Yes, Shenmue 3 can look and play like a Dreamcast game," it reads. "But it looks and plays like a Dreamcast game that's as off-kilter, maddening, magical and majestic as the Shenmue and its sequel, both all-time classics. I think there's good reason to rejoice in that."</p>
<p>Fans, meanwhile, are eager for a fourth game to continue the Shenmue story. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-fans-rent-times-square-billboard-campaigning-for-fourth-game">one group of fans even rented billboards in Times Square</a> as part of their campaign.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> team has apologised to its community for the game's less than perfect debut, admitting "this is not the launch experience we want for our players".</p>
<p>Among other niggles, developer Asobo recently admitted it vastly underestimated how many of us would be looking to take to the skies in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 at launch. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuMd7udCyFM">YouTube</a> video, the developer said player numbers had "overwhelmed [its] infrastructure". This was obviously not missed by prospective pilots.</p>
<p>The team is now doing what it can to combat this particular issue, and has increased its server capacity (it has not, at this time, said by how much). Some ongoing issues still remain, however, and our own Matt Wales has just informed me the game is still barely playable for him.</p>

            <p>It's been a year of change for UK high street stalwart GAME, with impacts felt by the chain's loyal customers and long-term staff alike.</p>
<p>In January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-retailer-game-to-cease-video-game-trade-ins-staff-say">Eurogamer broke the news that the brand would end its long-running trade-in scheme</a> and the sale of pre-owned games, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-staff-discovered-zero-hours-contracts-move-via-mass-microsoft-teams-calls">some staff were moved onto new zero-hour contracts</a>. This summer, we reported on a flurry of further changes, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-shutting-reward-scheme-next-month-and-you-should-use-any-remaining-credit-while-you-can-still-can">the closure of GAME's membership programme</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-to-end-in-store-pre-orders">ending of in-store pre-orders for new releases</a>, as GAME's technical systems were "upgraded" to those of its parent company, Frasers Group.</p>
<p>This autumn, further effects of that change became apparent, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-acknowledges-website-issues-as-customers-await-missing-pre-orders">GAME customers struggled with online pre-orders</a> and faced confusion over deliveries - most notably including the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> Steelbook. And throughout this year, dozens more GAME shops have closed on the high street, replaced by concessions in other stores such as Sports Direct.</p>
<p>As 2024 comes to a close, we've spoken with shop floor staff, managers and those close to GAME's head office for more detail on where the company is currently, and an explanation for why the issues customers have faced over the past few months have been so persistent. All wished to remain anonymous for the sake of their careers.</p>
<p>Eurogamer contacted Frasers Group for comment on this report, as it has done with its reporting previously, but once again did not receive a response.</p>
<h2>"We have lost 78 percent of GAME head office staff"</h2>
<p>"When Frasers Group took over GAME, they had their own departments that deal with marketing and logistics making sure stuff goes out on time," someone with knowledge of GAME's head office told me. "But then Frasers Group sat down and said 'why do we need two of everything?'"</p><p>This year has seen layoffs and redundancies across the chain, from shop staff who have been moved to zero hours contracts or offered work elsewhere - such as in Sports Direct stores. Others have simply been told they are no longer required, including a widespread loss of area managers over the past couple of months, as well as the bulk of GAME's previous head office staff.</p>
<p>"They made area managers redundant, eliminating some very loyal staff members - up to 20 years with the company in some cases," a current employee said. "This means store managers now talk to and are managed by someone in head office - the same head office which has also had redundancies and been reduced significantly."</p>
<p>"Since the full integration with Fraser group on 1st August we have lost 78 percent of GAME head office staff," another employee said. "It was triple digits and now in the 20s," another person confirmed. "Of course, we are now suffering the effects of that."</p>
<p>On a shopfloor level, staff say Frasers Group sees redundancies as a way to cut GAME's wage bill while simultaneously investing in more staff for Sports Direct - "the brand they really care about, the more profitable business", one staff member told me. Eurogamer is aware of staff who have quit because they did not wish to be moved from a video games specialist store to selling sportswear and trainers, and others who were only offered nominal shifts, such as just three hours on a Saturday, under new zero hours contracts.</p>
<h2>"There's just been stock issues with every new release"</h2>
<p>The loss of head office staff and those experienced in the video games business has affected the delivery of games to stores, multiple staff say. "The Frasers Group ordering and logistics managers are not doing enough to meet release dates," one person said. "They're just ordering stuff whenever." While the launch of Silent Hill 2 made headlines, GAME staff say that, with few exceptions, the majority of game releases are not arriving on time. "There's just been stock issues with every new release," a staff member said. "Anything that hasn't been EA Sports FC or Call of Duty has been late arriving, or not arrived at all. And if we do get it, maybe we get a handful of copies. I've genuinely been sending more people away than serving. We did get a few <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> consoles in, but only half what we were told we would receive."</p><p>"It appears on the surface to all of us that yes, whoever is in the GAME head office now does not understand what a game specialist is," another staff member said. "The last delivery we had at our store, there were no new releases, no games, no accessories - instead we received 136 Zendaya action figures."</p>
<p>Eurogamer recently reported on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-games-bungled-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-orders-too">customers waiting days to receive Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 copies they had pre-ordered</a>, after GAME previously claimed customers would be available to "pick up and play" the game with an added Steelbook on the day of release. In reality, the game's launch brought an update from the chain that it was aware some orders were still "processing", with no word on how long the delay would last.</p>
<p>"My store got five copies of COD, one of the biggest launches of the year," one source said. "How can you make money on five copies? New copies cost a lot and you don't make much, £6-£12 depending on how much they're marked up. If you have someone working eight, 10 hours a day, you have to sell a lot to make their wages.</p>
<p>"I recently saw six or seven people come in within about half an hour to buy a game that came out that day, only to be told GAME didn't have it. 'What do you mean, it came out today, I pre-ordered it?' they'd say. We just have to tell them we don't have it in, and I'm really sorry. All of them left without the stuff they'd already paid for, on the day of the release. And you know how people who play video games are. We're compulsive buyers. The number of people who are then like 'well cancel my pre-order, I'll buy it from Smyths'. And then they don't come in ever again."</p>
<h2>"Honestly at this point we would not be surprised"</h2>
<p>The Call of Duty snafu came just weeks after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-pre-order-customers-left-in-limbo-as-metaphor-and-silent-hill-2-launches-loom">GAME shipped Silent Hill 2 copies late</a> and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-game-pre-order-customers-receive-copies-but-for-wrong-edition">left customers without the game's accompanying Steelbook</a>, which the chain simply said had been delayed, with no apology or further reason given. Eurogamer asked GAME staff what had happened there, and heard a persistent rumour that the person now ordering the chain's stock had been unaware of how to process it properly. </p><p>"When you have Steelbook editions, you order 50 copies of the game. You also order 50 Steelbooks," a person close to GAME's head office said. "I was told the person at Frasers Group who is now in charge for ordering stock for GAME simply didn't click that they wanted the Steelbook too. They just ordered 40k copies of the game but didn't select the Steelbook. It was only when area managers - some that were still there - said 'you just haven't ordered it' [that Frasers Group realised]. And at first they were like 'what do you mean, I have ordered it'. And they said 'no, for special editions you have to order it under special offers'."</p>
<p>"The Silent Hill 2 Steelbook we have heard several different excuses for," another GAME staff member told me. "The one that comes up the most is since the switch over to Fraser Group systems, all pre-order information was lost into the ether on pre-orders made before 1st August. So information on which stores needed allocations was gone. Then they randomly sent more than required to certain stores and some stores like ours who had pre-orders received none. Another store in my area only had 10 pre-orders but received 37 Steelbooks. So all available Steelbooks ended up at a select few stores."</p>
<p>"There are internal rumours," said a third staff member, "honestly at this point we would not be surprised if it were the truth."</p>
<h2>"Frasers Group doesn't know what to send out, where to send it to"</h2>
<p>Eurogamer has repeatedly heard of issues behind the scenes since GAME moved over to Frasers Group systems this summer, and indeed this is the reason behind many of the chain's various schemes, such as GAME Rewards and GAME Wallet, no longer being supported.</p><p>"They don't even have the sales data," one person close to head office said, "because all of the point of sale and stock managing systems have been ripped apart and converted over to the Frasers Group, or the people who knew this stuff are being made redundant. Frasers Group has no background in games, they have no affinity, no passion for it.  They can't look back at 10-15 years of sales history because it's been deleted.</p>
<p>"My local store, they haven't had Switch Pro controllers in for months," they continued. "Personally I got mine from CEX, saved £20. But some people want them from GAME and they're not being sent. There are warehouses up and down the country filled to the brim with stock because the Frasers Group doesn't know what to send out, where to send it to."</p>
<p>Staff say they don't believe anything will change until Frasers Group acknowledges GAME's current issues - and that this doesn't seem likely, as the company's focus on cutting costs and staff continues. Some even believe the only explanation for the changes is a form of self-sabotage, they told me.</p>
<p>"The general feeling amongst staff has been that the poor decisions, the firing of almost all the knowledgeable staff and now the low stock with absolutely zero communication of the issues from head office can only be a deliberate, calculated attempt to run the company into the ground," one employee said. "If it's not deliberate, it's total incompetence or desperate cost-saving measures that will only be detrimental to profits in the long run."</p>
<p>"I don't think they know they're doing a bad job," another said. "They think they're saving loads of money, still doing well, customers are still coming back. Well, they're not listening to anyone."</p>

            <p>Valve has updated its Steam policy on Season Passes, warning developers if they're not "ready to clearly communicate" about DLC content they "shouldn't offer a Season Pass on Steam".</p>
<p>Now, when a Season Pass is made available on Steam, developers must adhere to <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/seasonpass">new guidelines</a> which include providing a complete list of DLC in the pass, a basic description of its content, and expected release date.</p>
<p>Further, a Season Pass must include at least one released DLC when available for purchase (though Season Passes included in pre-purchasing a deluxe edition are exempt).</p>

<p>"By offering a Season Pass, you are promising future content," Valve's new guidelines read. "In the process of launching a Season Pass you will be asked to commit to a launch timing for each content release in the Season Pass. That launch timing is a commitment to both customers and Steam.</p>
<p>"If you aren't ready to clearly communicate about the content included in each DLC AND when each DLC will be ready for launch, you shouldn't offer a Season Pass on Steam."</p>
<p>Valve does acknowledge development can go awry and release dates aren't always met. As such, it will allow developers to self-reschedule the release date once during a Season Pass, though the new date must be within three months of the original scheduled date.</p>
<p>Further - and importantly for users - if a specific DLC in a Season Pass is cancelled, customers will be offered a refund for the value of the unreleased DLC.</p>
<p>"Under the Steam Distribution Agreement you have provided a warranty to Valve that your DLC will conform in all respects to the descriptions provided to customers, including promised release dates," the guidelines read.</p>
<p>"Even if there has not yet been a customer complaint, Valve may take action if you delay a DLC more than a quarter (three months) beyond the release window you originally promised."</p>
<p>That action may include removing the Season Pass from sale, refunding customers the value of DLC, or allowing customers to refund the entire Season Pass.</p>
<p>Valve last week announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-announces-limited-edition-white-steam-deck-oled">white version of its Steam Deck OLED handheld</a>, which is now available to purchase.</p>

            <p><strong>This story discusses the ending of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.</strong><em></em></p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> director Naoki Hamaguchi has said he deliberately intended for the game's ending - the fate of Aerith - to cause debate and keep players guessing until the trilogy's forthcoming conclusion.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer, Hamaguchi discussed fan reaction to the game's divisive ending and how he wanted to avoid fan service with its development.</p>
<p>"There was a danger there, there was definitely a trap," he said with regards to Aerith's fate. "With the original game, I was just a fan. I played the game when I was younger, and I've got my perspective on that scene as just a single fan. I felt if I made a decision - it has to go in this direction, we have to do it this way - that would very much make it a fan-driven thing. Maybe make it more like fan service. I kind of want to avoid doing that."</p>

<p>As a result, Hamaguchi took a backseat to the original creators - Tetsuya Nomura, Yoshinori Kitase, Kazushige Nojima - and instead shifted his focus to the presentation of their vision.</p>
<p>"Mr Kitase often says this," Hamaguchi continued, "that he really wanted to create that kind of debate and speculation after the game and moving through to the third game, that people keep talking about it up until they do see the final conclusion. In that sense I think we probably have achieved exactly what he wanted to do there and I'm very satisfied with that, because people are still talking about it."</p>
<p>Hamaguchi acknowledged a mixed reaction to the game's ending, but admitted "that's kind of the way we wanted it to go" to ensure discussion continued until the third game in the trilogy.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/aeriths-fate-in-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-the-trouble-with-remakes">controversial ending</a> is part of a continuous guessing game for players familiar with the original, though Hamaguchi remained tight-lipped on what will be changed in the third game.</p>
<p>"The important thing is that the player will wonder whether it's going to change or not," he said. "So if it was all exactly as it was in the original storyline, you'd know exactly what was coming: there'd be no anticipation, there'd be no excitement. For people who played the game, they'd know exactly what's coming next. It wouldn't really be a fun experience. It might be nostalgic, but it wouldn't be a fun experience."</p>

</figure>
<p>Hamaguchi notes the ending of Remake with the characters breaking the barriers of fate, the inclusion of the whispers, and Zack's alternate timeline in Rebirth as key moments to keep players wondering.</p>
<p>"The real purpose of these elements is to indicate to the player, this is where the story might change," he said. "It doesn't mean it <em>will</em> change, this is where it <em>could</em> change. You might see something new, you might see something different. And that really does help people to keep engaged with the story and keep having that wonder and that anticipation about what's coming next."</p><p>He continued: "I think that kind of divided opinion is something we were always going to get just because <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>, the original game, was such a popular game, it's such a well known game that if we'd have completely left it as it was, not change anything, people wouldn't like that. And if we changed it completely, there'd be another set of people who wouldn't like that at all. So we really have to try and find a balance, I think, to try and satisfy as many people as possible.</p>
<p>"I really do want to continue with that level of fans looking at us [and asking] so how's it going to change? What's the ultimate conclusion of this story going to be? Is it going to be the same? Is it going to change? And to keep that level of excitement and anticipation up for the third game in the series. I think that's the job that we've set for ourselves."</p>
<blockquote>"Is it going to be the same? Is it going to change? And to keep that level of excitement and anticipation up for the third game in the series. I think that's the job that we've set for ourselves."</blockquote>
<p>I had to ask, then, considering the dominance of Aerith's fate to the narrative of Rebirth, is she or Cloud the real protagonist of Final Fantasy 7?</p>
<p>"The way I see it for both Remake and Rebirth is very much the story told from Cloud's perspective," said Hamaguchi. "He is the character you follow, and you see events from his eyes and perspective really. The game design for Rebirth, we set very early on in development as a core concept, the idea of the bonds between Cloud and his allies. So you definitely see things from the perspective of, how does this other party member relate to Cloud? How are their bonds becoming strengthened as they journey together, as they experience things together? I can very much say, for the first two games - Rebirth and Remake - up until then, it is all from Cloud's perspective."</p>

<p>Lastly, Hamaguchi said he was "blown away" when he saw Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth running on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> for the first time. Sony's console was released earlier this month and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-on-ps5-pro-delivers-huge-image-quality-improvements-at-60fps">Rebirth is one of a handful of games to receive a significant visual improvement</a>.</p><p>"I think certainly that was one of the problems with using the PS5 base hardware, is that to try and get 60fps output with the same level of graphic fidelity and resolution as you have in the graphics mode was something that was just really, really difficult to achieve," he said.</p>
<p>"But certainly using the PSSR technology within the Pro, that really did allow us to do both at once and achieve both of those goals of the frame rate together with the resolution. I remember when I saw it for the first time, I really was blown away by it."</p>
<p>PlayStation hardware architect Mark Cerny also had a hand in which part of the game was shown at the PS5 Pro reveal. While Hamaguchi and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> development team wanted to show the grasslands region for its open world elements, Cerny had a different opinion. "He said 'no, we really want to see the Gold Saucer'," laughed Hamaguchi. "He really pushed to show the Gold Saucer. So ultimately that's the one we showed."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-lead-this-years-the-game-award-nominations">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth leads this year's The Game Award nominations</a>, alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>, with seven nominations - including for Best Game, as well as Best Game Direction, and Best Narrative.</p>
<p>While it's unknown when the third and final part of the trilogy will be released, series producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-wont-betray-fans-of-the-original-says-series-producer">Kitase stated previously it won't "betray fans of the original"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
