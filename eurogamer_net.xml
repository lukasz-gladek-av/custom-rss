            <p>At the end of this month, co-op spin-off <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will make its debut. Back in February, developer FromSoftware hosted a network test for the upcoming release, before later revealing some stats which suggested many players actually struggled to finish it.</p>
<p>According to figures shared in March, the final boss Nightreign testers came up against in the cycle - Nightlord Gladius, Beast of Night - was only defeated 58,615 times. To compare, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-players-were-really-struggling-to-complete-the-network-test">the mini bosses strewn across the world were defeated from between 99,000 times to 195,000 times</a>, depending on how often they appeared over the day cycle.</p>
<p>So, what has FromSoft learned from the playtest? Well, speaking with <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/07/elden-ring-nightreign-interview-reimagined-game-design-anchored-by-in-depth-combat/?sf277193252=1">PlayStation</a>, Nightreign's game director Junya Ishizaki said the team had "received a lot of helpful feedback regarding the difficulty", and as a result has made some adjustments to the final build.</p>
<p>These adjustments will "strike a balance that makes the game challenging as you progress, but still manageable", Ishizaki said. The director added Gladius "will also receive some updates", although he did not elaborate on what exactly these updates will include. These, Ishizaki said, will be something for players to look forward to on Nightreign's release.</p>
<p>Ishizaki added that some of those who took part in the network test "found it difficult to understand what elements were visible on the map, and said it was hard to identify next steps or how to use some of the character movesets". Therefore FromSoft has made some tweaks to the final version of the game, which will ensure this information is presented more clearly.</p>
<p>Nightreign's director additionally said that on the game's release, players will be able to determine a boss's weakness before heading on into the fray.</p>
<p>"So, if poison is effective against an upcoming boss, you may proactively search for and loot items that inflict poison more often in that run. Taking advantage of their susceptibility will give you an edge in the fights," Ishizaki explained. "We intentionally designed the game so that youâ€™ll need to adapt and evolve your strategies along with the changes that happen in the game."</p>
<p>Nightreign will be released on 30th May across PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC. You can check out the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-the-pc-requirements-for-elden-ring-nightreign">PC requirements for Elden Ring Nightreign here</a>.</p>
<p>Our Ed has already been hands-on with Elden Ring Nightreign. "Nightreign provides a delectable hit of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> in a repeatable microcosm," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">Eurogamer's Nightreign preview</a>. </p>
<p>
"It's got the difficulty, the levelling, the boss battles, and the sense of discovery, but all at high speed for a new type of challenge, while its grim enemy selection is like a best-of Souls mixtape I'm itching to replay."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sony has revealed a new developer that's joined PlayStation Studios, originating from Bungie and working on a new team-based action game.</p>
<p>The studio, teamLFG, comprises industry veterans from the Destiny and Halo studio, as well as developers from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, Roblox, and newcomers.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">Bungie laid off 220 staff</a>, representing roughly 17 percent of its workforce. At the time, Bungie CEO Pete Parsons stated one of its early-development projects would be moved to PlayStation Studios to form a new studio.</p>

<p>"The 'LFG' in 'teamLFG' stands for 'Looking For Group'," explains a message from the studio on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/07/welcome-teamlfg-to-the-playstation-studios-family/?sf277193480=1">PlayStation Blog</a> (as opposed to "let's f**king go"). </p>
<p>"We are driven by a mission to create games where players can find friendship, community, and belonging. We want our players to feel excited when they log on to discover their teammates already hanging out online. We want our players to recognise familiar names and to make myths and memes out of each other. We want our players to love remembering that one time where they pulled off That Play that changed the whole story of the match. As we say on the team - dat's da good stuff."</p>
<p>The studio will make "immersive multiplayer worlds propelled by action games that players can learn, play, and master for countless hours," the message continues, adding player communities will be invited to early access playtests as part of the studio's development process.</p>
<p>"It's critical that we stay nimble enough to react to player feedback, not just in our lead-up to launch, but throughout live service as we continue to grow the game and community for years to come," the studio said.</p>
<p>"Our first game is a team-based action game that draws inspiration from fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, life sims, and frog-type games. Players will inhabit a lighthearted, comedic world set in brand-new, mythic, science-fantasy universe."</p>
<p>Presumably, this game is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-cosy-moba-is-codenamed-gummy-bears-and-features-smash-bros-mechanics-to-target-younger-players">rumoured Gummy Bears that leaked earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>PlayStation has certainly struggled with live-service games in the past couple of years.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, the company aimed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">launch over 10 new live service games</a> by March 2026, as part of a strategy from former Sony exec Jim Ryan.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">Concord was a high profile failure</a> for the company, and at the start of this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">two live service projects were cancelled</a>, resulting in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-layoffs-at-playstation-following-live-service-cancellations">further layoffs</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buying-bungie-for-usd3-6bn">Sony announced it would acquire Bungie</a> in February 2022 for $3.6bn, partly with the intention of it supporting the company's live-service ambitions.</p>
<p>It would appear teamLFG's new project will showcase the results of that acquisition, alongside Bungie's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">forthcoming multiplayer shooter Marathon</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
