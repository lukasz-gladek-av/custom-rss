<p>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap brings a rogue-lite progression system and new heroes with unique abilities and traps with which to beat waves of enemies.</p>
<p>Players can utilise randomised buffs, the environment, and the weather too, fighting orcs, skeletons and more either solo or with up to four players in co-op.</p>
<p>The Orcs Must Die! series has proven particularly popular since the release of the first game back in 2011.</p>
<p>Since then it's spawned a number of sequels, resulting in Deathtrap bringing four-player co-op for the first time.</p>
<p>"With Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap, we embraced the challenge of innovating within a thirteen-year-old franchise by listening closely to our fans and their requests," said Patrick Hudson, co-founder and CEO of developer Robot Entertainment.</p>
<p>"We've stayed true to the classic chaotic action and light-hearted tone, while introducing four-player co-op, new and versatile heroes with deeply unique abilities, expanded level variety, and new roguelite progression choices."</p>
