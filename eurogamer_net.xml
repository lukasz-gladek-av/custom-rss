            <p>From 3rd January 2025, Riot Games will ban content creators for bad "off-platform conduct".</p>
<p>In a message posted to Valorant's social media channels, the developer said that "if a creator uses hateful slurs about an opposing player or teammate on their stream" - even if it's not via its in-game comms - it will "still issue a penalty as if that behaviour occurred in-game".</p>

<p>"Our intention with this update is to help protect players from harmful behaviours they can experience across the various places that touch their gaming experience," Riot explained.</p>
<p>"This update applies very specifically and only to content where Riot's games are the background of the content produced. Though we aren't going to proactively monitor everything that happens across social media, it is now within our rights to issue penalties in-game when that content is brought to our attention."</p> <div>

<p>"As an example, if a creator uses hateful slurs about an opposing player or teammate on their stream, but not in-game over chat or voice comms, we can still issue a penalty as if that behaviour occurred in-game.</p>
<p>"TL;DR - if you say or do things that break our Terms of Service while broadcasting or creating content about our games, we can restrict access to your Riot accounts (and suspend your Partner privileges if you are part of our Partner Program)."</p><p>This is just the latest initiative from Riot to clamp down on toxicity in its playerbase. In a frank discussion about the "current state of player behaviour" in Valorant earlier this year, Riot Games' head Anna Donlon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valorant-studio-head-tells-toxic-players-to-play-something-else-we-wont-miss-you">outlined upcoming changes designed "to make our community a better place"</a>.</p>
<p>Though Donlon acknowledged at the time that the development team had no plans to "sanitise gaming" or suppress harmless banter, she said players should not be expected to "grow a thicker skin" when playing video games.</p>
<p>"There's no room in our community for the most egregious behaviours, and we're not going to compromise on that point," she said.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/watch-dogs">Watch Dogs</a>: Legion, the game which imagined a post-Brexit London that wasn't too far off from the truth, is getting a follow-up - but it's not a video game. 
</p>
<p>
Instead, Watch Dogs: Truth is an audio drama series available via Audible, with choose-your-own-adventure elements that let you pick various options at the end of every episode.
</p>
<p>
Truth once again delves into the London-based activities of hacktivist group DeadSec, featuring returning character Bagley - a sentient AI.
</p>
<p>
Joining the cast for Truth are a number of names you might have heard of or seen before: Doctor Who companion Freema Agyeman (she played Martha opposite David Tennant, and also popped up in Torchwood), Russell Tovey (who played Alonso in that Titanic episode with Kylie Minogue, though is really more famous for Being Human) and David Morrisey (yes, he was The Governor in The Walking Dead, but he also played someone who thought he was The Doctor in another David Tennant Doctor Who Christmas special).
</p>
<p>
Also in the cast are T'Nia Miller and Gary Beadle. I don't believe either of them have been in Doctor Who.
</p>
<p>
"Listeners of this thrilling story will once again join the fight for truth whilst guided by the self-aware AI, Bagley, as they make decisions at the end of each episode, with choices that shape the hacking collective's next move, profoundly impact character relationships and ultimately, the success of the resistance effort," Ubisoft says of Watch Dogs: Truth.
</p><p>
"Across the series, listeners will have the fate of the city in their own hands, as the government's cyber intelligence force (SIRS) orchestrates a sinister campaign of message manipulation and fake news, which leads DedSec to fight back using its revered tactics to battle against alarming disinformation."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-golds-blind-assassin-hero-provides-the-perfect-formula-for-audio-drama">Ubisoft previously partnered with Audible for Assassin's Creed Gold</a>, a series that cleverly featured a blind hero (played by Star Wars: Rogue One's Riz Ahmed), with Buffy the Vampire Slayer's Anthony Head as Sir Issac Newton. (Head was also in Doctor Who.)
</p>
<p>
While there's no sign at all that Ubisoft is working on a Watch Dogs 4, the publisher is clearly keen to keep the brand alive via other means.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/technical-ambition-optimism-and-timeframes-what-we-learned-about-the-witcher-4-from-speaking-to-cd-projekt-red.1048005/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/technical-ambition-optimism-and-timeframes-what-we-learned-about-the-witcher-4-from-speaking-to-cd-projekt-red<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Earlier this week, CD Projekt joint CEO Michał Nowakowski announced the next game in The Witcher franchise - otherwise known as Project Polaris and unofficially referred to by most as just <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> - has finally entered what he described as "full-scale production - the most intensive phase of development".</p>
<p>It's good news for Witcher fans of course, although information remains incredibly thin when it comes to what exactly we can expect from the game itself, or even when we might hear more. All that's been publicly shared so far is that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-confirms-new-the-witcher-game-in-development">early-phase development was confirmed back in March of 2022</a>; that the game won't "focus" on previous protagonist Geralt of Rivia; and that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-voice-actor-confirms-he-will-be-part-of-the-witcher-4">Geralt's voice actor, Doug Cockle, will still be "part of" the new game</a> in some way.</p>
<p>But having spoken to a number of people from CD Projekt - including Nowakowski - over the past year for our long-read on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saving-cyberpunk-2077-how-cd-projekt-red-recovered-from-one-of-video-games-most-disastrous-launches">what happened with Cyberpunk 2077 and how the studio turned it around</a>, there are a few little nuggets of info we can share that might help piece together some extra context.</p>
<p>First up, a bit of chatter about process - albeit chatter that leads into a few other little hints at what we can expect about how things are going. One of the few other tidbits of already-public information is that CD Projekt Red has moved away from its own bespoke, internal REDengine to the more widely-adopted Unreal, which is owned by Epic Games.</p><p>"I know a lot of people are curious about it, so I'll try to explain," CDPR's vice president of technology, Charles Tremblay told me earlier this year, wryly joking that the decision has been a "very polarising question in general, for the company and for everyone". He explained that, contrary to popular belief, the REDengine wasn't the specific cause of the studio's troubles with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s development, and nor was its severely troubled launch the key reason for the switch.</p>
<p>"The first thing I want to say again, to be sure, 100 percent clear, is that the whole team, myself included, are extremely proud of the engine we built for Cyberpunk. So it is not about, 'This is so bad that we need to switch' and, you know, 'Kill me now' - that is not true. That is not true, and this is not why the decision was made to switch."</p>
<p>Instead, it came down to the developer wanting to have multiple projects in development at once - namely the next Witcher game, the further-off Cyberpunk sequel codenamed Orion, and the still distant new IP codenamed Hadar. "The way we built stuff in the past was very one-sided, like one project at a time. We pushed the limit - but also we saw that if we wanted to have a multi-project at the same time, building in parallel, sharing technology together, it is not easy," he said.</p>

<p>The other factor was that the developer felt it could benefit from "having a good partnership with Epic, and working together on the technology," as Tremblay put it. "We can also help them to achieve their vision, to do open world game[s], and also they can help us too, from some technical perspectives, on some of the aspects that we would like them [to] and that we would like to not have to be focusing on too much - because in the end, we are game company, right?" In other words, it's a decision made with the intention of getting more of CDPR's developers working on the games themselves.</p><p>"So the idea was that we can push the technology, we can finally have all the technical people in the company working together on different projects, rather than super centralised into one technology that can very difficultly be shared between other projects.</p>
<p>"We can share expertise, share people, share knowledge. And also we wanted to be sure that we developed some of the technology correctly this time around - with our expertise, we know how to do things with the experience we had in the past, and now it's time to actually make it shareable across all the groups."</p>
<blockquote>"It will be better than Cyberpunk - because for us, it [was] unacceptable"</blockquote>
<p>One of the major lessons for CD Projekt after its issues with Cyberpunk 2077 was the studio's difficulty with balancing its ambition - and confidence in delivering on that ambition that bordered on "magical thinking," as joint CEO Nowakowski put it to me - with the realities of the studio's rapid growth and surprise obstacles of Covid-19. But Trembley, as with many other developers at CDPR, maintained that the team's ambition itself remains undimmed.</p>
<p>"Again, I will not say it's easy," he added, "but I think that we have some cool stuff going, and hopefully that will have some good showcase [of the technology]. The only thing I will say is that changing the tech for us does not change the fact that we always will be ambitious," he said. "And the next game we do will not be smaller, and it will not be worse. So it will be better, bigger, greater than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a>, it will be better than Cyberpunk - because for us, it's unacceptable [to launch that way]. We don't want to go back.</p><p>"Even if there will be some 'sweaty moments' and maybe even some bad stuff happening, still, I think that we will try everything we can to make it even more than what we achieved in the past years. So the technology should not be a blocker for us, basically."</p>
<p>Coming back to the next Witcher game moving up to "full-scale production", Tremblay also explained part of what that process looks like for CDPR. Tremblay's recent role, since moving up from being very much "in the trenches" on Cyberpunk 2077, has been to "pretty much oversee the tech development across all the products," as he described it. One aspect of that includes speaking with the various game directors across the studio's projects in North America and Europe, reviewing "what they are doing, challenging [them], approving when we go," and then making "recommendations to the board" about whether the studio is ready to press on with a project on the technical side of things.</p>
<p>This is a new process CDPR brought in as part of its response to the Cyberpunk launch, with the studio allowing more time for pre-production, and conducting regular reviews on whether the technology is ready for each individual project to move forward - including, in some cases, delaying that step where necessary.</p>
<p>"How it works in what we're doing," Tremblay explains, is "basically we have different stages of the project, where we have different requirements for tech. Then basically, with me and the tech directors, we nail down - we agree on 'this is what we want to nail' - and we work together to make sure this happens."</p><p>Then, "if we want to go into pre-production, we will prepare all the tooling to scale up the production and the [number of] content people. If it's not ready, or it's just a specific thing that is not ready, then we can discuss, okay, what can we do next? How are we going to approach it? And we can also discuss [whether] to delay - delay not as in delay release, but delay in terms of like, before we scale up production. And then we go to the board or the other people, and we discuss the reason why. And usually it's perfectly fine.</p>
<p>"It's easy to discuss in a very pragmatic approach, like: 'This is why. The reason we cannot go forward with different environments, with the production, is because this, this, they are not ready. And if we do so, we'll pay later - because everything they do will not work, or we'll have to go as [with Cyberpunk], catch up during production.' We do not want to do that again."</p>
<p>He suggested "a good example would be like, console [builds] not working. So having the console working super late, it's unacceptable anymore, and it's part of our process. So we do the reviews on console, so we know exactly where we are on all the platforms - the lower platforms we have - rather than, you know, 'Oh PC is fine, so we can go forward'. So we changed this approach to have a broader visibility on the other platforms we want to have."</p>
<blockquote>"Most likely, we will not have a PC only launch"</blockquote>
<p>When it comes to the next major game's launch, Tremblay also gave a rough steer on what the studio's strategy will be when it comes to those additional platforms. One of Cyberpunk 2077's major development struggles came from issues with last-gen consoles and their hard drive read-write speeds, for instance. I asked whether CDPR would consider an approach similar to that Larian took with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, where it launched on PC first, and then consoles a few months later to buy a little more time. (Ironically, Larian boss Swen Vincke later explained this was partially also to avoid some major releases at the time, including Cyberpunk 2077's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> expansion.)</p>
<p>"It's something we discussed, actually," Tremblay told me, "but we're not 100 percent sure. Maybe - so it's hard to say if we want to go this way at this stage. I would assume that as long as I understand, like, the strategy we want to do - I'm just trying not to say too much, bear with me - most likely, the launch, we will not have a PC-only launch, for example. I don't think this is a strategy we want to adopt right now. That being said, will it mean that we will have - let's say there were 20 platforms available - we'll have 20 at launch? Maybe not. But at least PC only, and then scattered, it's not necessarily the approach we want to go forward, for sure."</p><p>Meanwhile, Paweł Sasko, who was lead quest designer on The Witcher 3 and is now the associate game director on Project Orion, Cyberpunk 2077's sequel, also shared a bit of extra context on CD Projekt's development team sizes and timeframes, firstly in the case of Project Hadar, the studio's new IP.</p>
<blockquote>[Hadar]'s in its early stages, right?</blockquote>
<p>I spoke with Sasko twice for Eurogamer's big Cyberpunk 2077 article, the first time as far back as spring of 2023, the second in the spring again of this year. Back in 2023, Sasko described the Hadar team as "incredibly tiny - well, not incredibly tiny; it's a small group of people that are putting like, a small concept board into that. And it will become a game, because you need to slowly get there, but it's in its early stages, right? It's not a full blown production where we have like a 600-people team on it."</p>
<p>Come spring 2024, there was a smidge more detail, noting Hadar was still "in early stages, so in that ideation phase, or however you call it - it requires constant communication, bouncing ideas."</p>
<p>The Boston-based team that's focused on the Cyberpunk sequel meanwhile is what he described as "a pretty tight core team composed out of the directors that have been shipping Cyberpunk and Phantom Liberty." Part of the studio's decision to set up there - alongside proximity to some top universities and tech companies for recruitment, and the ability to become "one of the biggest players" on the US' east coast - was to straddle the timezones of Vancouver, which houses a CDPR studio composed of "mostly engineers," and Warsaw, which is now "mostly art". The Cyberpunk sequel team remains "fairly small for triple-A," he said at the time.</p><p>Thirdly and finally with Sasko, there was a little discussion of The Witcher studio. "That team is probably the biggest team, the team that took all The Witcher, Cyberpunk devs on board, and is working on their game. I don't know, certainly, the exact number," he added. "It's like a couple hundred there," as of around late March this year.</p>
<p>Notably, that's a fair bit earlier than this recent announcement that full-scale production had begun. It's tempting to infer that fairly significant pre-production work has been going on for a little while before that public confirmation, but then it's worth remembering Tremblay's explanation of how that new process works: it may be that this time has been spent getting the technological side of things ready before full development started in earnest. Likewise, a few hundred isn't as big as it sounds for CDPR these days: while around 300 people worked on The Witcher 3, 350 developers worked on Phantom Liberty alone. The studio now employs something in the region of 1400 people worldwide.</p>
<blockquote>"There's no magic, only hard work and making sure you stay on the right course"</blockquote>
<p>Sticking with inferences, there's also one more bit of information we might be able to glean, this time from a conversation with joint CEO Michał Nowakowski. Like a lot of developers I spoke to from CD Projekt Red, he described his mindset on the studio's future releases.</p>
<p>"Optimistic. I feel optimistic because I'm, in general, an optimistic person," he said. "But on the on the more realistic side - I think that's actually part of why I'm optimistic - is I think we are aware, as an organisation, that, let's say what was one [example] with Phantom Liberty coming back to 95 percent, currently 94 percent [positive Steam reviews], nothing is granted forever. And I think it's something that it's important for us to understand. And I think also for all the people in the company: there's no magic. There's only hard work and making sure you stay on the right course."</p><p>With future games, he added, "with the Witcher or you know, with Cyberpunk in the future, it's only down to us. Everything can fail, but it's our role to make sure it doesn't. And remembering and understanding that I think is the biggest reason for me to be optimistic, because in the company everyone's constantly worried - but worried in a good way, if you know what I mean. Worried that we are going to do it in a good enough way? 'Are we, for sure, not letting something slip through our fingers?' And if you're that kind of worried, I think that gives us better chances of being successful in the future than thinking we can't fail because we're too big, or too whatever - you know, noses up our somethings."</p>
<p>One of the specific lessons the studio took from Cyberpunk, which has particular relevance here, to bring things back to the next announcement, was to be "smarter in how we want to announce and kick off marketing campaigns," Nowakowski told me.</p>
<p>"To be honest, when we were kicking off the marketing campaign officially with pre-orders, which was the Keanu on stage [moment, at E3 in June 2019], the plan was actually to launch roughly one year later. It just didn't really work. So we didn't really plan for like a two-year campaign, and I still think that one year would really be fine [in terms of] time for a promotional campaign of that game."</p>
<blockquote>"For a new game, expect a slightly longer - but not two-year - campaign"
</blockquote>
<p>The studio "learned a lot of good practices from that experience: so announce the date when you're like really, really sure of it. And now I think we have much better tools to be sure of that date, which we - on a smaller scale - proved to ourselves with Phantom Liberty." While that campaign lasted around six months, given it was only an expansion, Nowakowski added that "for a new game, we would still expect a slightly longer - but not two-year - lasting campaign."</p>
<p>"Having said that," he added, "I want to stress: it doesn't mean we would not tease or drop some cool assets before [a full reveal]. Because the marketing campaign, slightly earlier before the launch of the game, that's different than the actual, say, 'mass attack'. Mass attack is when you announce the date, you start collecting the pre-orders and it really is that race from that point, that moment, to the moment you launch the game."</p><p>For example, he continued, "If I ask you, what do you know about The Witcher 4? The answer is not much, probably - yes, there's theories and so on. But there's nothing really specific. So we want to drop the crumbs here and there so that people - and the media as well - can, you know, pick up on it and try to figure out what it is we're trying to say this time. So that [is something] we can start doing a little bit earlier." That would involve aspects such as "having some video assets, or something to whet the appetite of the fans - not even to create the hype so much," he said, as to simply get the early conversations flowing.</p>
<p>Another note on platforms, too: another thing the studio took from the mistakes of Cyberpunk 2077 was what Nowakowski described as "the focus on the target platform" during marketing from the off. "I think what put us into a lot of trouble is how late we started with PS4 and the Xbox [One] back in the day, and we don't ever want to be in that same spot again."</p>
<p>What can we take from that? Well, expect at least a year - but most likely less than two years - between The Witcher 4's proper reveal and its actual launch. Expect, possibly, some light teases or short trailers a little earlier than that. We probably shouldn't expect a firm commitment to platforms early on, nor a PC-only release - although plans can of course always change - and hopefully, if Phantom Liberty is a guide and if those lessons truly have been learned, expect CD Projekt Red to launch The Witcher 4 a lot closer to the first release date it gives.</p>
<p>Purely to speculate: the Game Awards, known for their hefty emphasis on major reveal trailers and teases, are just around the corner, too, and CD Projekt has put some weight behind Keighley-powered events such as Summer Games Fest before, most notably with Phantom Liberty. We might see the first of those breadcrumbs quite soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has just made its Chapter 6 launch trailer available to view in-game, revealing fresh details about the evergreen battle royale's latest revamp.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-6-season-1-estimated-release-date">Chapter 6 isn't due to launch until this weekend</a>, following Saturday night's big Remix live event finale starring Eminem and Snoop Dogg, so the upload of a trailer in-game now looks like an unfortunate slip-up.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the internet has now pounced on the trailer, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-6-leaks-point-to-godzilla-crossover">confirms the towering Godzilla as an enormous boss</a> that roams around Fortnite's fresh new Japan-inspired map. 
</p>
<p>
There are also smaller bosses - a huge samurai, a floating demon mask - as well as a giant turtle. Hopefully we don't have to shoot the giant turtle.

<p>
On an even smaller scale, Fortnite looks to be introducing some kind of cute jelly thing as a pet? Previous artwork showed what looked like pet-like creatures, including a cute-looking dragon, hanging out on characters' shoulders.
</p>
<p>
Oh and finally: Big Hero 6's Baymax - part of the upcoming Chapter 6 Season 1 battle pass - will get to do his 'Balalala' thing as an emote.
</p>
<p>
Despite Chapter 6 being a big revamp for Fortnite, there's actually a fair amount here that feels familiar. Samurai swords are back but look similar to their usage in the game previously. Some of the architecture here looks similar to the Japanese-themed biome back on the Chapter 4 map. And the towering Godzilla boss, let's be honest, feels a little similar to the towering Doctor Doom live event. Although this time with fire breath.
</p>
<p>
We're expecting much more to be officially revealed about Fortnite's future this weekend. 
</p>
<p>
Next week, Chapter 6's launch will be followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-reviving-original-map-as-permanent-addition-featuring-multiple-classic-seasons">the arrival of the game's Fortnite OG mode</a> - that brings back Fortnite's beloved original map as a permanent addition <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-permanent-og-mode-will-have-its-own-battle-pass">with its own battle pass</a>.

Popular mobile card game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> has warned players it will take action against anyone with a rude, inoffensive or inapproproate username.
</p>
<p>
After all, Pikachu and friends appeal to players of all ages, and the app is definitely not a place for username gags on Pokéballs.

In other words, keep your swears, insults and lewd references to Diglett to yourself.

Today brings a selection of fresh cards via a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-cards-joining-pokemon-tcg-pocket-leak-ahead-of-december-events">new Venusaur PVE event that's live from now until 13th December</a>. </p>

            <p>The next project from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> developer Round8 Studios will be a sci-fi survival horror, in a marked change from the souslike genre.</p>
<p>As reported by Korean news site <a href="https://www.ebn.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=1644423">EBN</a>, the game will utilise Unreal Engine 5 and is targeting a release on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The same report also confirms DLC for Lies of P is slated for the first quarter of 2025.</p>

<p>A statement from publisher Neowiz said it's too early to disclose progress of the project and that it is one of multiple PC and console games in development - presumably alongside the confirmed sequel to Lies of P.</p>
<p>Still, a swing to survival horror for its next standalone project is quite a change and proves the wide-reaching ambitions of the developer to become a leader in the South Korean games industry.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-sequel-confirmed-as-game-director-teases-dlc">sequel to Lies of P was confirmed last year</a> by director Ji Won Choi. "Our highest priority is developing the DLC and working on our sequel," he said at the time.</p>
<p>While it's unknown where the story will lead in a sequel, hints at the end of Lies of P have certainly had fans speculating on what fairytale could be next for the soulslike treatment, following the game's Pinocchio inspiration.</p>
<p>As for the Lies of P DLC, its existence was revealed shortly after the game's release, though so far only concept art of a ship has been shown. "I can promise you one thing," said Choi with the reveal. "What I just showed you scratches merely the tip of an iceberg."</p>
<p>Following its launch last October, Lies of P sold a million copies in less than a month and, by March of this year had surpassed seven million players (including through subscription services).</p>
<p>It's proven a big success for the developer and is now frequently considered one of the best soulslike games not created by From Software.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-developer-details-playstation-5-pro-enhancements">Lies of P is also receiving a PS5 Pro patch</a> to boost performance.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
