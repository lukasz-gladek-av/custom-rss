            <p>Bethesda and MachineGames have released an extended look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, giving us a deeper dive into the upcoming game.</p>
<p>In the 15-minute presentation, the team offers a look at a broad spectrum of gameplay, including combat, puzzles and traversal. The part I am most looking forward to - Indy's turn as an Agent 47-like man of disguise - is also shown off, with MachineGames letting us see the archaeologist infiltrate areas dressed as a member of the clergy. </p>
<p>And yes, just like Hitman's Agent 47, you can hide bodies by picking them up and moving them out of sight of patrolling guards or whoever else you don't want happening upon your corpse wake.</p>

<p>The trailer also gives us a look at the Great Circle's Adventure Points, which are used to unlock new skills. One such skill is Lucky Hat, which allows our hero an extra chance to come back from a fatal blow. Another, Bear Hands, lets Indy do unarmed takedowns of enemies. Speaking of taking down enemies, Indy can use his gun and whip to get the upper hand, but also items he finds lying around the environment. One moment sees the archaeologist bopping his assailant on the head with a rolling pin.</p><p>On the puzzle side of things, we see Indy pouring out some wine to reveal a number hidden within a basin, and elsewhere bouncing light around a secret room with ancient mirrors. He can use his camera to search for puzzle clues, as well. </p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is set to release across Xbox and PC next month, on 9th December. It will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">arrive on PS5 next year</a>.</p>

<p>Our Ian has been hands on with the upcoming release already.

            <p>Arcane Season 2 is the most popular show on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> right now, not just in the UK or US, but across 60+ countries worldwide.</p>
<p>As detailed by data collated by <a href="https://flixpatrol.com/title/arcane/">FlixPatrol</a> - official figures will likely come from Netflix later this week - Arcane leads the pack by a considerable margin and is presently number one on the streaming platform in 65 different countries.</p>

<p>This is great news for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> spin-off given both seasons of Arcane cost a total of approximately $250m USD to create and promote, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/league-of-legends-spin-off-arcane-most-expensive-animated-series-ever-report-says">making it the most expensive animated series of all time</a>.</p>
<p>The show's first nine episodes are said to have seen a production cost "north of $80m", while the second set of nine episodes - which will make up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-now-describes-arcane-season-two-as-the-final-chapter">the show's final season</a> - reportedly had a production cost "approaching" the $100m mark.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how the rest of the series will fare - right now, just three of the nine episodes are available to view. Episodes four, five and six will debut on 16th November, and the final three on 23rd, bringing the hit show to a close.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-2-review">Eurogamer's Arcane Season 2 review</a>, which earned a respectable four out of five stars, Chris T. said, "Some iffy pacing moments aside, Arcane's second and final season truly puts the money on screen. This is a striking, emotionally wrought, hard-punching climax."</p>
<p>Not all game TV and movie adaptations see the same success, of course, although Lara Croft fans were delighted to learn that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-animated-tomb-raider-series-is-returning-for-season-2-and-laras-teaming-up-with-an-old-pal">Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft Netflix show was coming back for a second season</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Has "no idea why" Embracer chose to abandon the franchise.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> creator Warren Spector reckons "if someone made Deus Ex today", the cyberpunk role-playing game "might be perceived as a documentary", given its themes of a dystopian world and evil factions competing to control it.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/deus-ex-director-warren-spector-thinks-that-if-someone-made-deus-ex-today-it-might-be-perceived-as-a-documentary-so-if-he-made-a-new-one-it-would-be-pretty-different/">PC Gamer</a>, Spector reflected on how the world - and game design - has changed in the 25 years since Deus Ex first debuted, adding "I wouldn't make Deus Ex again as it was in 2000 when it could be read as a believable fantasy".</p>

<p>"Y2K was around the corner, AI was becoming a thing, conspiracies were everywhere, terrorism was on the rise, bioengineering was in its infancy, techno-augmentation was in the works," Spector said, talking about how he leaned into real-life issues rather than "trying to convince people to be interested in something" more fantastical.</p>
<p>"All that stuff was floating around in the zeitgeist. Making a game about it was an obvious thing to do."</p>
<p>If he returned to the series now, however, Spector says he'd like to examine "other concerns that would be more relevant, more pressing, more worthy of exploration".</p>
<p>Spector also commented on Embracer's decision to cancel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-cancels-deus-ex-game-in-development-for-two-years">Eidos Montreal's new Deus Ex game</a> earlier this year, putting almost a hundred people out of work.</p>
<p>The project had been in development at Eidos Montreal for around two years, following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-sells-off-western-studios-and-ip-including-tomb-raider-and-deus-ex">acquisition by Embracer in 2022</a>. The decision to call an end to this project was part of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-confirms-900-employees-laid-off-in-previous-financial-quarter">Swedish conglomerate's ruthless restructuring</a> and cost-cutting measures.</p>
<p>"I really have no idea why Embracer would abandon the Deus Ex franchise, at least for now," Spector said. "From my perspective, the gameplay approach is still relevant, but the world and situation needs some updating."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Spector - who also created Epic Mickey - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-mickey-3-currently-impossible-warren-spector-says">said he was unavailable to work on a third game in the series</a>, despite the announcement it was being revived.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
