            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> is getting a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> bundle, as a series exec has confirmed there's still a big <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield (2025)</a> reveal set to come this summer.</p>
<p>This Mass Effect bundle comes with various N7-themed skins for both specialists and weapons, with a "Citadel Bundle" containing all Mass Effect cosmetics for 3,000 Battlefield Currency. This comes to roughly Â£22.50 / $25 in value, though you'd have to buy 2,400 <em>and</em> 1,100 BFC separately. </p>
<p>A few days ahead of the bundle's reveal,  Battlefield Studios' Global Senior Director of Integrated Comms Andy McNamara <a href="https://x.com/TheRealAndyMc/status/1934708241810043104">responded to a fan on Twitter</a> to say the team has "some things brewing", suggesting a reveal of a new game was on the way. Then, following the announcement of the Mass Effect bundle, <a href="https://x.com/TheRealAndyMc/status/1934717781230145715">McNamara posted</a>: "The community will know when the reveal is coming. We are focused on Labs and preparing for the reveal this summer".</p>

<p>So there's still something to look forward to in the next month or so. We first learned of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-full-battlefield-reveal-coming-this-summer-as-it-reconfirms-release-window">this summer reveal back in May</a>, as a proper showcase of what the game will look and play like has yet to be produced by the company. The actual name of this new Battlefield is yet to be revealed, an indicator of how much of a mystery the game remains. There have been a series of invite-only playtests, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefields-invite-only-playtest-has-just-begun-and-gameplay-is-already-leaking-online">though information from those has leaked online</a>.</p>
<p>In response, EA stated that "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reminds-battlefield-players-things-taking-place-in-labs-may-or-may-not-make-their-way-to-the-final-game">things taking place in Labs may or may not make their way to the final</a>" game as it cracked down on leakers. Aside from that, all we know is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-expected-to-release-before-april-2026">EA is still aiming to release the game before April 2026</a>.</p>
<p>One would assume that Summer Game Fest would have been a good time to show off this new Battlefield in earnest, but it appears EA is comfortable taking its time with the game still cooking in the oven. Its absence did however allow Call of Duty to take the spotlight somewhat, thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-promises-to-be-most-mind-bending-black-ops-ever">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 wrapping up the Xbox showcase</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
