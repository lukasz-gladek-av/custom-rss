            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> has received its first ever crossover DLC, adding <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killzone-2">Killzone 2</a> cosmetics.</p>
<p>The crossover is part of a new tier of special Premium content, a post from developer Arrowhead reads, suggesting more collaborations will be on the way.</p>
<p>"We decided a long time ago to do crossovers only if and when they make perfect sense for the game," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516322672418750491?sf275819234=1">Steam post</a> reads. "So in that spirit, we're hyped to announce our very first crossover: Killzone 2."</p>

<p>Available now in the Superstore are a new armour set, primary weapon, player banner, cape, and player title.</p>
<p>A second batch will then be available from 23rd December.</p>
<p>The post also hints at other content: "High Command informs us that beyond the Superstore content, there’s also an additional Killzone 2 reward for all <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> depending on your success in the Galactic War…"</p>

<p>The collaboration additionally marks the start of a longer rotation of items in the store, as Arrowhead temporarily tests a five day rotation.</p>
<p>"Right now, many of you feel the items are in rotation for too short a time, and that you sometimes miss out on that killer look you had your eyes on," it said. "At the same time, the more things we add to the store the longer it takes to come back into rotation."</p>
<p>Following the collaboration, page rotation on the store will return to normal as the developer gathers feedback.</p>
<p>Last week, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youll-soon-be-able-to-spread-democracy-with-a-limited-edition-helldivers-2-dualsense-controller-in-hand">Helldivers 2 limited edition controller</a> was revealed.</p>
<p>Killzone 2 was released for the PS3 back in 2009 by Guerrilla Games, published by Sony. It was followed up by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killzone-3">Killzone 3</a> in 2011, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killzone-mercenary">Killzone: Mercenary</a> on the PS Vita in 2013, and then Killzone: Shadow Fall for the launch of PS4 that same year.</p>
<p>Since then, there's been no word of a new game in the series.</p>
<p>Indeed, in October Guerrilla art director Roy Postma suggested the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/killzone-developer-done-with-series-guerrilla-says-of-switch-to-horizon">studio was done with the series</a> and created Horizon Zero Dawn to "refresh the palette".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Fresh details on Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra have been revealed by writer Amy Hennig, as well as a first look at its version of Wakanda.</p>
<p>The game was first announced in 2021, with former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> writer Hennig (Uncharted) at the helm of Skydance New Media, and a proper reveal was given earlier this year at the State of Unreal livestream. It features Captain America and Black Panther feuding during World War 2.</p>
<p>"[The setting] led us to do a bunch of interesting things," Hennig told <a href="https://ew.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-globe-trotting-wwii-epic-wakanda-setting-exclusive-8760326">Entertainment Weekly</a> in a new interview, "one of which was to not only tell a story with a young Steve Rogers who's still trying to find his feet, as opposed to the more seasoned guy that we've seen in a lot of the films. It also let us introduce a new Black Panther of 1943."</p>

<p>She continued: "It led us to tap into all the things that I love, all of the wonderful tropes of World War II-era adventure films, classic men-on-a-mission movies and all of that.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of intrigue in our story, a lot of twists and turns, fascinating characters, and interesting locations."</p>
<p>This era's Black Panther is Azzuri, T'Challa's grandfather, who Hennig described as "more mature" than the young Captain America.</p>
<p>The jungles of Wakanda will be a key setting alongside Occupied Paris, with the below screenshot providing a first look at its "photo-real, cinema-real level of detail", according to Hennig.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Marvel-1943-Rise-of-Hydra-01-121224-3ab812b589ea4a4ba8004f7b64c5a70b.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Skydance / Marvel / EW</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The game will tell a "globe-trotting story" she added, stating there are more locations yet to be revealed.</p>
<p>"Wakanda at this point in time is hidden away from the outside world and protected by this impenetrable jungle," she said. "They are non-interventionist, but events transpire that pull them into the conflict. They have to protect their interests. The world is getting smaller. No satellites yet, but there will be soon. You can shoot down planes that maybe want to fly over Wakanda, but how long can you stay in the shadows?"</p><p>The story will see Captain America and Black Panther work together against the same enemies, though they begin as rivals. And as the game's name suggests, the villains are clear. Said Hennig: "It's pretty black and white. Who doesn't want to punch a Nazi?"</p>
<p>The previous trailer hinted a third super soldier will also feature in the game, though their identity remains under wraps.</p>
<p>That trailer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-jaw-dropping-look-at-amy-hennigs-new-captain-america-and-black-panther-game">impressed for the game's use of Epic's MetaHuman Creator</a> that gives each character remarkable detail.</p>
<p>"We really wanted the visual fidelity to be high so that you could kind of forget that you're looking at a game, that it should feel and look and sound and smell like you're watching a great Marvel movie or TV show, but you're driving the action," said Hennig in this new interview.</p>
<p>"As a new studio trying to do some groundbreaking stuff with cinematically presented games, the way we invite the most people in is by bringing them something they already know and love, but in a new form."</p>
<p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is expected to release next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Archetype Entertainment has finally unveiled a first look at gameplay of its forthcoming sci-fi RPG Exodus.</p>
<p>The game was first revealed at last year's The Game Awards and was notable for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matthew-mcconaughey-to-make-his-video-game-debut-in-sci-fi-rpg-exodus">starring Matthew McConaughey in his first video game role</a>.</p>
<p>A year later and we finally have a better idea of how exactly it will play, thanks to a new gameplay trailer (below) - it's got alien planets, third-person space shooting, and a very very angry bear.</p>

<p>In short, it's looking a lot like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> running on current platforms: from its shooter gameplay to its sci-fi aesthetic and narrative focus.</p>
<p>That's not surprising considering the studio's BioWare pedigree. This is the debut game from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-bioware-vets-working-on-story-driven-sci-fi-game-at-new-wizards-of-the-coast-studio">Archetype Entertainment</a>, co-founded by BioWare veterans James Ohlen (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age: Origins</a>) and Chad Robertson (Anthem).</p>
<p>The game will be published by Wizards of the Coast.</p>
<p>Further details on Exodus were provided in a livestream following the trailer's reveal with both Ohlen and Robertson.</p>
<p>In particular, details on its setting were shared. It takes place in a post-Earth exodus scenario (hence the name, presumably), where humanity has explored star systems and created advanced civilisations, as well as genetically modified creatures. That explains the bear, then.</p>
<p>There's competition between the human colonies, too, creating a web of various relationships and alliances players will need to navigate.</p>
<p>A key element will be Livestone, a hybrid of mineral and vegetation created by the Celestials that can be controlled by certain humans - I'm guessing the player protagonist will be one of them.</p>

<p>Time dilation is also a major focus, with the passage of time moving at different speeds across the universe. For instance, players will make personal and civilisational choices in their journey to other star systems, and while this may only be weeks for their character their homeworld will be significantly changed once they return due to differences in time.</p>
<p>Missions will be led with two companions - and yes, there will be romance.</p>
<p>We still don't know, though, who Matthew McConaughey will be playing.</p>
<p>So if you're done with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> and you're itching for some space adventure ahead of the next Mass Effect game, Exodus should have you covered.</p>
<p>That said, Exodus still doesn't have a release date. However, there's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-episodes-of-amazons-secret-level-anthology-hints-at-a-rich-visual-picknmix-but-is-that-enough">themed episode in Amazon's Secret Level series</a>.</p>
<p>As for the next Mass Effect, project director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-wont-dabble-with-stylised-visuals-like-dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-says">Michael Gamble said it won't feature stylised visuals</a> like the latest Dragon Age. "Mass Effect is photorealistic and will be as long as I'm running it," he said.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Secret Level is set to return for a second season, following its debut on Amazon last week.</p>
<p>The animated anthology is inspired by video games, with episodes dedicated to the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a>, Pac-Man, and Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
<p>Details of the second season are under wraps, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/secret-level-season-2-amazon-prime-video-1236251726/">Variety</a> reported, though Secret Level is the most-watched animated series debut of all time on Amazon's Prime Video streaming platform.</p>

<p>Exact viewership numbers have not been released, though Luminate estimates the series was watched for 155.3m minutes in the US during its first week - that's around 1.4m views as per its 109-minute runtime.</p>
<p>The series covers gaming past, present and future, from the iconic Mega Man to Amazon's MMORPG New World, to forthcoming space opera Exodus.</p>
<p>It's perhaps become best known for its Concord episode, which follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">Sony's decision to shut down the online shooter</a>.</p>
<p>"I don't feel bad that it's a part of the show," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-episode-in-amazons-secret-level-series-shows-potential-of-world-and-characters-says-creator">series creator Tim Miller told Rolling Stone</a>, "because I think it's an episode that turned out really well, and you can kind of see the potential of this world and the characters. If it's the remaining vestige of that product, I hope the developers feel that it's in some way worthy, just a little bit, of the blood, sweat, and tears they put into it."</p>
<p>Miller also directed the first Deadpool movie and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> animated anthology Love, Death &amp; Robots.</p>
<p>Ahead of the release of Secret Level, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-episodes-of-amazons-secret-level-anthology-hints-at-a-rich-visual-picknmix-but-is-that-enough">Eurogamer sampled the first four episodes</a> to see how the series fares.</p>

            <p>Amir Satvat was the recipient of the first 'Game Changers' award at The Game Awards last week, but has since received "countless hateful messages", "disturbing comments" and antisemitic remarks about his wife.</p>
<p>Satvat received the award for his work helping laid-off employees across the games industry to find new work. The award was host <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>'s way of addressing the "significant and unprecedented industry-wide layoffs", which he admitted the show struggles to address "in a constructive way".</p>
<p>Satvat has helped to place nearly 3000 people into jobs, and was described at the awards show as "career Santa Claus". Yet since last week, he's been subjected to abuse online due to his current work at Chinese tech conglomerate <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>.</p>

<p>"Over the past four days, I have received countless hateful messages targeting me personally, alongside hundreds more on YouTube and Twitter," Satvat wrote in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amirsatvat_fellow-members-of-the-games-industry-i-need-activity-7274667576159350787-Zzpw?utm_source=li_share&amp;utm_content=feedcontent&amp;utm_medium=g_dt_web&amp;utm_campaign=copy">LinkedIn post</a>.</p>
<p>"People have made disturbing comments about my family - I am only not sharing those comments because they are disgusting, but I will share some other sample comments. My wife and me have been targeted with anti-Semitic slurs. Several videos mocked my comments suggesting I sounded autistic - riffing on it for their audience's amusement."</p>
<p>Due to his work as a business development director at Tencent, Satvat has been accused of being some sort of agent or plant exploiting the community, or that he's a fraud, he wrote.</p>
<p>However, he explained his community work began in November 2022 before he started at Tencent in August 2023. Before this he worked for Amazon, but again his community work was separate.</p>
<p>"I didn't / don't work on mergers and acquisitions at Tencent or Amazon," Satvat continued. "This stems from one innocent, erroneous mention of what I do in a Level Infinite article, since corrected to show I only work on investments."</p>
<p>He has also never laid employees off.</p>
<p>"They simply didn't mention Tencent at TGA because it had nothing to do with this community and they wanted to focus on how we drove this ourselves," he said.</p>
<p>"I've been accused of creating 'jail-worthy fraud' and mocked for 'just making one spreadsheet people enter info into', usually by people who spent all of eight seconds looking at our site with no understanding of the work we do or the impact we've had. We have 15 resources across five different resource homes and there is a lot of depth to our community, as any of you who have used it know."</p>
<p>He surmised: "This can happen to you too when you sacrifice over 2,000 hours of your time to help the industry - this is the 'reward' for two years of service."</p>
<p>Finishing the post, he said he would now "return to our mission of positive, public service".</p>
