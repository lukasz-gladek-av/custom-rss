            <p>
Bungie has announced an indefinite delay for its live-service extraction shooter Marathon, citing the community's "passionate" feedback following its reveal in April and a subsequent playtest.
</p>
<p>
Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-returns-to-its-roots-with-a-pvp-twist-on-classic-fps-series-marathon">formally unveiled its Marathon reboot</a> in May 2023, but the response wasn't an immediately enthusiastic one, given the decision to ditch the classic Marathon series' single-player focus in favour of PvP - and the reboot has largely remained in the news for all the wrong reasons since then. It's faced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-gets-new-director-as-part-of-creative-leadership-shakeup">leadership changes</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-responds-to-marathon-reboot-directors-200m-wrongful-dismissal-lawsuit-alleges-disturbing-communications-with-female-employees">substantial legal challenges</a>, it's seen ongoing reports of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">declining staff morale</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-management-vehemently-shut-down-destiny-2-subscription-idea-as-reports-of-toxicity-continue">accusations of toxicity aimed at Bungie management</a>, it's been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">embroiled in a plagiarism scandal</a>, and more.
</p>
<p>
April's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">big reveal</a>, then, was a chance for Bungie to shift the narrative to something more positive. But reactions weren't especially kind - some went as far as to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-concord-developer-hits-back-at-criticism-of-bungies-marathon-reveal">draw comparisons with Sony's ill-fated Concord</a> - and it seems Marathon's alpha playtest last month also generated substantial negative criticism, judging by <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon_update">Bungie's latest blog post</a>.

"Thank you not only for your passionate feedback around the Marathon reveal and Alpha playtest," the studio wrote, "but also for your patience while we took the time to listen closely and chart our next steps. Through every comment and real-time conversation on social media and Discord, your voice has been strong and clear. We've taken this to heart, and we know we need more time to craft Marathon into the game that truly reflects your passion."
</p>
<p>
As a result, and "after much discussion", Marathon will no longer launch on 23rd September as originally announced, and has instead been indefinitely delayed. "The alpha test created an opportunity for us to calibrate and focus the game on what will make it uniquely compelling," Bungie continued. "We're using this [extra] time to empower the team to create the intense, high-stakes experience that a title like Marathon is built around."
</p>
<p>
As it looks to get Marathon back on track, Bungie will hold more closed testing over the "next few months". These will bring new game updates and features, with the studio's "immediate focus" being on the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Upping the Survival Game</li>
<ul>
<li>More challenging and engaging AI encounters</li>
<li>More rewarding runs, with new types of loot and dynamic events</li>
<li>Making combat more tense and strategic</li>
</ul>
<li>Doubling down on the Marathon Universe</li>
<ul>
<li>Increased visual fidelity</li>
<li>More narrative and environmental storytelling to discover and interact with</li>
<li>A darker tone that delivers on the themes of the original trilogy</li>
</ul>
<li>Adding more social experiences</li>
<ul>
<li>A better player experience for solo/duos</li>
<li>Prox chat, so social stories can come to life</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Bungie says it'll provide a progress update, alongside a revised release date, some time this autumn. "Thank you again for your patience and - much more importantly - your passion," it concluded. "Your continued feedback will help us make Marathon the incredible gaming experience we all know it can be."
</p>
<p>
Today's delay announcement follows a wave of live-service project cancellations at Sony, as it continues to reassess the viability of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan's ambitious live-service strategy</a>. In 2023, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">pulled the plug on Naughty Dog's multiplayer The Last of Us game</a>, and it opted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">not to revive Concord after its disastrous launch last year</a>. The company has reportedly also cancelled a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">live-service adaptation of Twisted Metal</a> in development at Firesprite, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/footage-of-insomniacs-seemingly-canceled-live-service-spider-man-the-great-web-appears-online">live-service Spider-Man at Insomniac</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">live-service God of War at Bluepoint</a>, and an unknown live-service project at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> studio Sony Bend. Despite that, the company recently insisted it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-remains-committed-to-diverse-and-resilient-live-service-games-including-forthcoming-marathon-and-fairgames-despite-high-profile-failures">remains committed to "diverse and resilient" live-service portfolio</a>.

        <p>As AMD partnership announced.</p>

            <p>
If recent reports are true, we likely <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-next-gen-console-reportedly-targeting-2027-with-handheld-device-due-this-year">won't be seeing Microsoft's next-generation Xbox console until 2027</a> at the earliest. But that hasn't stopped the company from teasing a couple of details - including backward compatibility and vague handheld allusions - as it announces a partnership with AMD to co-engineer the bits inside.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-says-next-xbox-will-deliver-largest-technical-leap-seen-in-a-hardware-generation">confirmed an Xbox Series X/S successor was in the works</a> last February, as the company rushed to assure fans - amid the start of its multi-platform release strategy - that it wasn't abandoning the console market. At the time, Xbox president Sarah Bond insisted Microsoft was "invested in [its] next-generation road map" and "focused on... delivering the largest technical leap that you will have ever seen in a hardware generation."
</p>
<p>
And it now transpires AMD will be the company helping make that bold promise a reality. Microsoft announced its "strategic, multi-year agreement" with AMD in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOCtRanwXrA">short video shared earlier today</a>. In it, Bond explained Microsoft is "investing in [its] next-generation hardware line-up across console, handheld, PC, cloud, and accessories", and would be working with AMD to "co-engineer silicon across a portfolio of devices including our next-generation Xbox consoles in your living room and in your hands".

<p>
There is, of course, quite a bit to unpack in that last sentence, starting with Bond's clear reference to multiple next-generation "consoles", and continuing on with the distinction between a machine "in your living room" and "in your hands". While it's entirely possible "consoles" refers to a dual release strategy similar to the Series X and S, it's hard to ignore the additional allusion to an Xbox-branded handheld. But whether that might be an internally development machine - as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-next-gen-console-reportedly-targeting-2027-with-handheld-device-due-this-year">previously rumoured</a> - or something similar to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-xbox-ally-handhelds-microsoft-takes-its-next-step-towards-a-windows-driven-future">AMD's recently unveiled Xbox Ally</a>, remains to be seen. Notably, Windows Central recently reported Microsoft's internal handheld project <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad">had been "sidelined"</a> in favour of more third-party partnerships, while The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad">went further</a>, saying the project was "essentially cancelled".
</p>
<p>
Bond's spiel continued by insisting Microsoft's new AMD partnership would result in "the next generation of graphics innovation" and will "unlock a deeper visual quality". That's alongside "immersive gameplay and player experiences, enhanced with the power of AI", and "compatibility with your existing library of Xbox games".
</p>
<p>
"This is all about building a gaming platform that's always with you, so you can play the games you want across devices anywhere you want, delving you an Xbox experience not locked to a single store or tied to one device," Bond concluded. "The next generation of Xbox is coming to life and this is just the beginning. We can't wait to show you what's next."
