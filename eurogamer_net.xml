            <p>Pokémon developer Game Freak is working with multiple partner companies on its upcoming release, Beast of Reincarnation.</p>
<p>During last night's Xbox Developer Direct, Game Freak gave us all another look at Beast of Reincarnation, which takes place in a post-apocalyptic Japan. In Beast of Reincarnation, players take the role of Emma the Sealer, who along with her canine companion Koo will need to confront the source of the world's corruption to save humanity.</p>

<p>Beast of Reincarnation all looks really rather promising, with many noting it was quite different and larger than Game Freak's other games outside of Pokémon. So, did the studio have to increase its numbers for the upcoming release? Well, not exactly. Rather, it has called in the help from a number of outside companies and fellow developers to get things going.</p>
<p>"The team is quite large, as you can imagine, but I will note that it's not all folks internally here at Game Freak," Beast of Reincarnation's game director told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beast-of-reincarnation-game-director-answers-all-our-burning-questions-about-the-pokemon-developers-upcoming-action-game">IGN</a>.</p>
<p>"We managed to seek out a lot of partner companies to work with us, companies, studios that are able to realise the vision of this game in the way that we wanted to make it, so we're lucky to have a lot of people working on it externally as well."</p><p>A PR further clarified with the publication that Game Freak's internal team working on Beast of Reincarnation is actually "relatively small". However, that team is made up of those in core direction and management roles, and who are leading the project.</p>

            <p>
Following its slam-dunk first season, Amazon's TV adaption of Fallout has, according to reports earlier this year, faced a bit of a sophomore slump in terms of viewership. But despite an apparent dip in popularity, Amazon has now revealed enough people are still tuning into the show that it's officially Prime Video's sixth biggest season of all time.
</p>
<p>
Back <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-streaming-ratings-down">in January</a>, media valuation and data analytics company Nielsen reported that between 15th and 21st December, Fallout's season two premiere and eight earlier season one episodes managed to accumulate a combined 794m viewing minutes. That's a big number, but also well below the 2.9bn viewing minutes season one's eight episodes attracted in its opening week in April 2024. Further raising questions about Fallout's second season success is the fact Amazon - which was quick to talk up some impressive figures first time around - has been keeping quiet about the whole thing.
</p>
<p>
That, though, has now changed. While Amazon is still not talking specific viewership numbers, it's shared some comparative information giving at least some indication of just how well Fallout season two (which is being released weekly unlike season one, and which is yet to air its final two episodes) has so far done. As <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/fallout-season-2-viewership-update-explained-amazon-1236692296/">reported by Deadline</a>, Amazon is calling Fallout's latest instalment the top-performing season on Prime Video since Reacher Season 3, which debuted back in February 2025.
</p>
<p>
It's also being described as Prime Video's sixth biggest season of all time. That, if you're wondering, puts it behind the series' debut season, the first two seasons of Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, and Reacher's second and third seasons. And if we're purely talking Prime Video's most successful <em>returning</em> seasons, Fallout Season 2 comes in at fourth place.
</p><p>
"We are thrilled with the Fallout S2 reception from audiences and critics globally," Peter Friedlander, Amazon MGM Studios' head of global TV, said to Deadline. "After its first four weeks, Fallout S2 already ranks as the sixth most watched season ever on Prime Video and is even higher rated on Rotten Tomatoes than S1. More than half of the season's audience to-date has come from outside the US, and we're excited for even more viewers to discover the show as we continue to release new episodes over the weeks ahead."
</p>
<p>
Regardless of season two's success, Amazon has already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">committed to a third season</a>, with production due to start on 1st May, 2026. And whatever happens beyond that, it's clear the company continues to have confidence in the Fallout property. It's already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-newly-announced-fallout-reality-show-will-plop-competitors-inside-a-vault-to-find-out-just-how-special-they-are">announced a reality show based on the Fallout games</a> that'll see contestants living inside a real-life Vault. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-shelter">Fallout Shelter</a>, as it's known, will run for 10 episodes when it eventually airs on Prime Video.

            <p>Ubisoft has confirmed Beyond Good and Evil 2 - which it first announced almost two decades ago - remains a priority for the studio, and "fits with [its] strategy of focusing on Open World Adventures".</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Ubisoft left many in shock when it announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">"major organisational, operational and portfolio reset"</a>, which saw the company delay seven unspecified projects, close two studios and cancel multiple games.</p>

<p>One game to survive, though, was Beyond Good and Evil 2, which was first announced in its original form back in 2008, and last seen (at least publicly) during E3 2017 with an open-world slant. In a statement shared with Eurogamer, a Ubisoft spokesperson has said:</p>
<p>"Beyond Good and Evil 2 remains part of our portfolio and our roadmap and fits with our strategy of focusing on Open World Adventures."</p>
<p>The studio's spokesperson added that within thiz market, "the fantasy genre is underserved". Therefore, Ubisoft has a "unique proposition" with its  Beyond Good and Evil sequel.</p>

<p>It has not been an easy path for Beyond Good and Evil 2, though there has been some movement in recent years. In 2024, the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-still-in-development-now-with-new-creative-director">got a new creative director</a>, with original creator Michel Ancel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2s-troubled-development-due-to-passionate-managers-not-getting-along-says-creator-michel-ancel">saying the troubled development came down to "passionate managers" not getting along</a>.</p><p>Last year, meanwhile, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unbelievably-17-years-after-its-original-announcement-ubisoft-appears-to-still-be-hiring-for-beyond-good-and-evil-2">job listing looking for a technical sound designer specifically for Beyond Good and Evil 2 was shared by Ubisoft</a>. At this time, we also got an updated description of what Beyond Good and Evil 2 will actually be:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Beyond Good and Evil 2 is an action-adventure open world game set in a captivating space opera universe and the direct prequel to the 2003 cult classic. Based on a breakthrough technology driven by the proprietary Voyager engine, Beyond Good and Evil 2 aims to offer a seamless experience of exploration and space piracy across a solar system full of exotic locations, colorful characters and mysteries to uncover, solo or with friends. So, if you are ready for an adventure like no other, come join forces with us to build System 3!"</p></blockquote>

<p>As for elsewhere at Ubisoft, this week's cancellations included the studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">was only a few months from its planned release</a>. </p>
<p>While the team behind the remake has since called Sands of Time's cancellation "deeply disappointing" for fans and the development team, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sands-of-times-shock-cancellation-does-not-mean-we-are-stepping-away-from-the-franchise-says-remake-team">does not mean Ubisoft is "stepping away" from the Prince of Persia franchise for good</a>.</p>

            <p>Digital online PC game store GOG has acknowledged that it "damaged the trust our users have in us" when it abruptly removed the <a href="https://shop.redcandlegames.com/app/devotion">acclaimed horror game Devotion</a> from sale just over five years ago.</p>
<p>Managing director Maciej Gołębiewski reflected on the decision after facing scrutiny for a comment he made - "We as a company are always ready to take a stand on the right values" - in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-says-selling-horses-when-steam-wouldnt-was-matter-of-freedom">an interview on Eurogamer</a> last week. That remark was made in relation to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-review">Horses, the provocative indie horror game</a> that GOG would sell when other storefronts Steam and Epic would not. But the comments contradicted the stance GOG took with Devotion in late 2020.</p>
<p>To recap: Devotion is a short, smart, 1980s-set Taiwanese-made horror game - "a genre landmark", we said in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devotion-review">our Devotion review</a> - initially released in early 2019 but pulled from sale after an outcry over the inclusion of unflattering references to China's president Xi Jinping. This had dramatic consequences in China - developer Red Candle's Weibo social media account was closed - and the game was yanked from sale on Steam.</p>

<p>Red Candle insisted the offending asset was only ever a placeholder. It apologised at length for it, and removed it, so things seemed to settle enough for a prospective re-release. This is where GOG comes in. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-under-fire-for-dramatic-u-turn-on-devotion-gog-release">GOG announced it would sell the game but then on the same day reversed the decision</a>, <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1339227388438306817?s=20">stating</a>: "After receiving many messages from gamers, we have decided not to list the game in our store." Was it standing for the right values then?</p><p>Maciej Gołębiewski today said: "That situation remains difficult to reflect on. At the time, we made that decision in the context of very real business constraints, a limited understanding of the complex geopolitical factors at play, and a lack of good options that would both protect GOG and partners and allow the game to be released responsibly. In hindsight, we acknowledge that this decision - and the way we communicated it - understandably damaged the trust our users have in us.</p>
<blockquote><em>"When I say that we're ready to take a stand on the right values, I don't mean that we won't make mistakes"</em></blockquote>
<p>"But it's also important for us to be transparent," he added. "Keeping a global digital storefront operating means navigating legal, operational, and commercial realities that don't always allow for ideal outcomes. In 2020, we chose a path we believed was best for GOG, even though it came at a cost to our credibility."</p>
<p>The situation with Horses he said was different. That game was played by multiple GOG employees who agreed that it didn't pose any "legal, political, or operational risk to our business or partners". "There was no other concern driving this decision," Gołębiewski remarked, "just a straightforward evaluation of the game itself."</p><p>"When I say that we're ready to take a stand on the right values," he continued, "I don't mean that we won't make mistakes, or that every decision will be easy, or that we'll never face trade-offs. I do mean that with every given opportunity, we're striving to be clearer, more consistent, and more willing to stand behind our choices (including explaining them openly when they're being questioned)."</p>

<p>Gołębiewski's willingness to discuss the matter I believe shows a renewed push by GOG to be seen as open and approachable following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-and-cd-projekt-founder-micha-kicinski-acquires-100-ownership-of-gog">its recent independence</a> - when it separated from the mothership CD Projekt, which it had always been a part of. GOG was under CD Projekt ownership when the Devotion situation occurred, so did that heap additional pressure on? CDP is a publicly traded company answerable to investors and had far bigger concerns to deal with at the time, such as righting the rocky launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>As a private company now, GOG is answerable only to new owner Michal Kiciński, who, coincidentally, was one of the original founders of CD Projekt <em>and</em> one of the people who launched GOG - Kiciński remains a major shareholder at CD Projekt but he hasn't actively worked there since 2012. Under his ownership, GOG is now autonomous and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-eyes-indie-game-publishing-something-it-couldnt-do-under-cd-projekt-red">he's apparently not afraid of taking a risk</a>. Nothing major is set to change, but the company is looking into the possibility of branching into indie game publishing. A new era has begun.</p>
