            <p>Developers InnerSloth and Schell Games have announced the release date of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/among-us">Among Us</a> 3D on PC.</p>
<p>The upcoming 3D release of the space-set social deduction game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/among-us-3d-announced-demo-out-next-week">first announced in February of this year</a>, but with that all important release date missing. That has changed now, however, with confirmation Among Us 3D launches on PC via Steam on 6th May.</p>
<p>"MARK IT IN YOUR CALENDARS," the Among Us team proclaimed on social media, with a confident use of caps lock. "3D BEANS COMING TO UR SCREENS SOON AAAAAA."</p>

<p>As to what players can expect on Among Us 3D's release, well, it'll be pretty much just like the Among Us that blew up in popularity during 2020, but with an extra dimension.</p>
<p>"In this party game, Crewmates work together to complete tasks before one or more Impostors kill everyone aboard. Experience all of the same deception and deceit as the original Among Us in all three dimensions," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3168600/Among_Us_3D/">reads the game's Steam page description</a>.</p>

<p>Away from games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/among-us-sci-fi-social-deduction-is-getting-the-animated-adaptation-treatment">Among Us is being turned into an animated series</a>. On its announcement, we were given a general overview that read: "Members of your crew have been replaced by an alien shapeshifter intent on causing confusion, sabotaging the ship, and killing everyone. Root out the 'Impostor' or fall victim to its murderous designs."</p>
<p>Since then, famous faces such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/among-us-animation-cast-rounded-out-with-jurassic-park-ratatouille-talent">Elijah Wood, Wayne Knight and Ashley Johnson have been announced as voicing various crewmembers</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Niantic has made 68 employees redundant as part of its company restructuring process <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-will-be-sold-to-monopoly-go-maker-scopely-niantic-confirms">following the sale of its gaming portfolio to Monopoly Go maker Scopely - a deal worth $3.5bn</a>.
</p>
<p>
The deal has seen Scopely become owner of Niantic games <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-now">Monster Hunter Now</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin-bloom">Pikmin Bloom</a>, and the new employer of the teams that work on those titles. 
</p>
<p>
These layoffs, meanwhile, come from the remaining staff at Niantic working on other projects, as the organisation slims down and effectively rebrands as a startup, named Niantic Spatial.
</p>
<p>
Niantic had previously warned of job losses among its remaining team as part of this process. Now, as detailed in a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/niantic-is-laying-off-68-employees-after-selling-its-game-business-for-3-5-billion">Game Developer</a>, we know how many.
</p>
<p>
The company has declined to comment further about the job losses.
</p>
<p>
Niantic Spatial will focus on a refreshed version of Niantic's original core interest - creating a digital map of the planet, now using geospatial AI. The newly-rebranded company has secured $250m of capital investment, $50m from Scopely and $200m from Niantic's own balance sheet in order to move forward.
</p>
<p>
"We're in the midst of seismic changes in technology, with AI evolving rapidly," Niantic founder John Hanke wrote recently on Niantic Spatial's focus. "Existing maps were built for people to read and navigate but now there is a need for a new kind of map that makes the world intelligible for machines, for everything from smart glasses to humanoid robots, so they can understand and navigate the physical world.
</p>
<p>
"Today's LLMs represent the first step towards a future where a variety of expert models collaborate to reason and understand complex problems, and many of those problems will require deep and accurate knowledge of the physical world. Niantic is building the models that will help AI move beyond the screen and into the real world."
</p>
<p>Eurogamer recently travelled to a major Pokémon Go fan event in Italy, held shortly after the sale was announced, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amidst-pokemon-gos-35bn-sale-fans-flock-to-italys-first-major-meetup-with-mix-of-emotions-over-games-future">heard of players' mixed emotions regarding Scopely now being in charge</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>FromSoftware has revealed another new playable character in its forthcoming co-op spin-off <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>.</p>
<p>Raider is a powerful barbarian warrior in typical style, wearing a fur cloak and horned helmet while wielding a gigantic axe for slow but mighty attacks.</p>
<p>He looks to be a strength build, then, in contrast to the more nimble previously revealed characters. Yet he has a fierce ultimate ability that benefits all players.</p>

<p>The trailer for Raider shows him screaming with rage to summon a pillar of rock from the ground. This can then be clambered up by all characters.</p>
<p>From there we see the archer Ironeye sniping at a boss from above, while Raider himself leaps off for a plunging axe swipe.</p>
<p>FromSoftware is yet to reveal all of Raider's abilities, but it's easy to see how he'll fit neatly into the roster of playable characters.</p>
<p>The final game will include eight Nightfarers to choose from and so far six have been revealed.</p>
<p>The network test included the all-rounder Wylder, the tanky Guardian, the magic-wielding Recluse, and the rogue-like Duchess. Then, earlier this month, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-elden-ring-nightreign-playable-character-revealed">sniping Ironeye was revealed</a>.</p>
<p>Still, eagle-eyed fans spotted both Raider and Ironeye in the game's initial trailer, though their names and abilities were unknown.</p>
<p>One other yet-to-be-revealed character can be seen too: she's in gold armour and wields a katana with golden magic. Perhaps that hints at a Faith build?</p>
<p>That leaves one unknown character left. What kind of build are you hoping for?</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign will be released on 30th May across PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One.</p>

            <p>Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida is being immortalised in pixel form thanks to Bionic Bay.</p>
<p>Bionic Bay is an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-featured-in-day-of-the-devs-2024-indie-games-showcase">upcoming "precision-puzzle platformer" that casts players as a scientist</a>. It's coming from developers Mureena Oy and Psychoflow Studio, and is all set in an "ancient bio-mechanical world" which has been "hand-crafted pixel by pixel to create a high-fidelity, atmospheric environment". The game is set to release across both PC and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement">Yoshida may have now left PlayStation</a>, his legacy will certainly live on, and the former exec has now been announced as an unlockable character skin. Not only that, he even has his own "special" level.</p>

<p>Writing on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/14/the-making-of-hand-crafted-pixel-art-platformer-bionic-bay-out-april-17-on-ps5/">PlayStation blog</a>, Bionic Bay creative director Juhana Myllys said the team was "ecstatic" to reveal its collaboration with Yoshida.</p>
<p>Yoshida's level will be available via the upcoming game's online challenge mode. "If you take part and beat Shu's score, you can even unlock our Shu skin," the developer wrote.</p>
<p>This skin, once unlocked, will allow players to customise the look of their scientist for Bionic Bay's online leaderboards. You can see how it looks via the image below.</p>
<p>Following a slight delay, Bionic Bay will release tomorrow, 17th April.</p>

<p>Bionic Bay isn't Yoshida's only video game collaboration post-PlayStation. Back in January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-lands-first-video-game-voice-role-in-promise-mascot-agency">Yoshida was announced to be part of the cast of Promise Mascot Agency</a>. His role is a bright green, bird-like mascot called MonouGe who "just loves games".</p>
<p>Away from starring roles in video games, earlier this week Yoshida made headlines for his thoughts on Nintendo's next console, suggesting that positioning <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> as simply a bigger and better follow-up to Switch 1 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-losing-their-identity-former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida-shares-damning-switch-2-verdict">damaging to the company's brand identity</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It seems some retailers in the US will open up <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> pre-orders as soon as next week.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Nintendo made the unprecedented decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">delay its Switch 2 pre-orders</a> in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-orders-in-canada">both the US and Canada</a>, stating this was "in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions".

<p>Nintendo did not give details as to when it expected to open pre-orders following this decision, merely stating it would update timings "at a later date". However, the ever-reliable Billbill-kun of Dealabs has now said Switch 2 pre-orders in the US will begin soon, with some retailers starting next week.</p>
<p>According to Billbill-kun, pre-orders for Switch 2 consoles will go live on either 21st April or 30th April, "depending on retailer". They did not specifically mention any outlet by name. Additionally, Billbill-kun reports pre-orders for Switch 2 accessories such as the Pro controller will kick off on 30th April.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has messaged Nintendo for further information. </p>
<p>Yesterday, Billbill-kun reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-delayed-canadian-preorders-reportedly-beginning-next-week">Canadian Switch 2 pre-orders could start from 23rd April</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> boss Doug Bowser said the US administration's trade tariffs - which had heavily impacted some of the company's key manufacturing locations around the world - had posed a "challenge" for the company, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-tariffs-werent-factored-into-switch-2-price-but-its-something-were-going-to-have-to-address">was something Nintendo was "going to have to address"</a>.</p>
<p>Despite a temporary pause on some tariffs since then, the situation has remained uncertain amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-appears-to-backtrack-on-us-electronics-tariff-exceptions-but-no-one-seems-to-know-exactly-whats-going-on">confusing messaging around potential electronics exceptions</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
