            <p>Indie Sims-like Paralives has landed itself an early access release date.</p>
<p>It will be making its debut on 8th December, developer Alex Massé and team revealed last night.</p>
<p>"We are so excited to share the game with you all and can't wait to collect all your feedback to keep on improving the game," the Paralives crew shared along with a new trailer (see below). Here, we see some of the game's building techniques, and its world activities.</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with Paralives already, it's a very promising looking Sims-like. The developer has promised a single player game which does not require an internet connection to enjoy, complete with dogs, cats, horses, cars, bikes and boats. <a href="https://www.paralives.com/faq">That includes boat houses</a>.</p>
<p>"Even if there will be bugs and some important features missing," the Paralives team explained last year, in the game's announcement post. "We think Paralives' Early Access will be quite enjoyable. Players who like to create characters and build houses will have a lot of tools and content to get creative with and the live mode will have its core features established which will allow people to create great stories for their Parafolks."</p>

</figure>
<p>At this same time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-sims-like-paralives-gets-seven-minute-gameplay-video-hitting-early-access-next-year">the developer added that it will have no paid DLC</a>. "As a small team without any shareholders to please," it said, "we believe the money we make from selling the game alone will be enough to support us and the development of free updates in the long run."</p>
<p>Well, colour me interested!</p>
<p>Paralives follows another Sims-like release <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">InZoi</a>, which debuted at the end of March. This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-access-life-sim-inzoi-breaks-krafton-sales-record">particular release broke records for publisher Krafton</a>. </p>
<p>Other games playing with this genre, however, have not fared as well. Last year, Paradox shut down ambitious Sims-like Life by You, before also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-shuts-down-life-by-you-studio-following-sims-likes-sudden-cancellation">closing the internal studio behind the project, Paradox Tectonic</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The launch of Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a> has finally brought GameCube games to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers, but there's also a secret startup sound.</p>
<p>Once downloaded, the GameCube collection features three games so far: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f-zero-gx">F-Zero GX</a>, Soul Calibur 2, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-wind-waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>. Open the collection and it works just like others for the N64, SNES and more.</p>
<p>But! If you hold the Switch 2's left stick in any direction as the collection loads, you'll be treated to the iconic GameCube startup screen with its plinky-plonky sound effects and rolling cube. Cute!</p>

<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dwKgKoSGHQ">Spawn Wave</a> shared a video of the screen over the weekend. I then had to try it myself for that hit of nostalgia.</p>
<p>I tested it with other buttons too - the face buttons and the shoulder buttons - but only the left stick works for this little Easter Egg.</p>
<p>If you're planning on playing F-Zero GX - and you should be, it's great - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/f-zero-gx-on-switch-2-is-virtually-unplayable-without-remapping-the-controls">note the default controls mean the game is virtually unplayable</a>. You'll need to enter the suspend menu to remap the controls, specifically moving boost to a more easily accessible button.</p>
<p>So far <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-gamecube-games-coming-to-switch-2-via-switch-online-along-with-purchasable-gamecube-inspired-controller">only three games are available in the collection</a>, though you can buy a GameCube controller too. Other games on the way include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fire-emblem-path-radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a>, Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, Mario Smash Football, Chibi Robo, Luigi's Mansion, and Pokémon Colosseum.</p>
<p>What other GameCube games are you hoping to see added to the collection? Personally, after splashing around in Mario Kart World over the weekend, I am hopeful Nintendo will whip out Wave Race: Blue Storm from its vault.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> may well be a Nintendo legend, known for giving the world iconic characters such as Mario, Zelda and Donkey Kong, but even so, fans have noticed that his name has been omitted from the credits of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>Mario Kart World is the latest iteration of Nintendo's racing series, debuting last week alongside the launch of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a>. Many have now raced through World's variety of tracks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-track-list">from Acorn Heights to Whistlestop Summit</a>.</p>
<p>However, Miyamoto is not mentioned in the credits for Mario Kart World, despite being an instrumental part of the series' legacy. This means that Miyamoto's last Mario Kart credit was with the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>.</p>

<p>"It definitely feels weird, especially as the 'father' of Mario," one person mused on Bluesky while discussing Miyamoto's lack of credit in Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>However another suggested that, perhaps, the creator asked not to be credited if he wasn't actually part of the development, so that "people would focus on the new" team. </p>
<p>"I would feel like that is a classy move," they reasoned.</p>
<p>Miyamoto has steadily moved away from game development itself in recent years, taking on more of an advisory role within Nintendo. As such, this isn't the first time Miyamoto has been absent from the credits of a Nintendo game. He also doesn't feature in mobile game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-tour">Mario Kart Tour</a>, nor does he <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/echoes-of-wisdom-is-the-first-zelda-game-without-miyamoto-in-the-credits/">pop up in credits for last year's Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>.</p>

            <p>Team Cherry has confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> will be coming out before the holiday season this year, following the game's appearance at last night's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-showcase-2025-round-up-everything-announced">Xbox Games Showcase</a>.</p>
<p>Writing on the official Silksong Discord, Team Cherry's Matthew Griffon wrote: "I confirmed BEFORE holiday - we are not tied to a console release." This indicates that Silksong's release is not tied to that of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-xbox-branded-asus-handheld-finally-gets-an-official-reveal">Xbox's new Xbox ROG Ally handheld</a>.</p>
<p>The reason for the confusion is due to the game's sudden appearance at the tail-end of the Xbox ROG Ally reveal at the Xbox Games Showcase. Xbox's Sarah Bond stated that people will be able to play Silksong on this new handheld, leading some to interpret the two sharing a release date.

<figcaption>Check out Eurogamer's video on the Silksong release date situation here!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2nAnDLgHBM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The gaggle of people who have been fiending for anything and everything Silksong related have been desperate for anything concrete about the game and its release. Prior to the event-heavy weekend, interest was piqued <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-update-ignites-perfectly-reasonable-shadow-drop-hopes">due to an update to the game's Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>Before that, the game was confirmed as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-is-playable-in-a-museum-this-september-but-that-probably-doesnt-help-narrow-down-its-release-date">playable at an Australian museum this September</a>. Earlier still, Nintendo included the game in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-both-switch-consoles">Nintendo Direct and locked in the game's presence on both the Switch 1 and Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>There was also the cake fiasco, in which the eagle-eyed Silksong lovers went all in on a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-fans-believe-creators-switch-2-hint-points-to-april-announcement-and-its-all-thanks-to-a-slice-of-cake">cake recipe as the core of a release date tease</a>, a theory Team Chery had to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-progressing-and-will-release-says-team-cherry">come out and put to rest</a>. With last night's news, those down bad for the smallest crumb of Silksong info may be able to rest, at last.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the concrete confirmation last night has folks very excited. A peak at the Silksong Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1l6k3vt/thank_you_leth/">provides a window into the joys of happy gamers far and wide</a>. However the scars of hopium still ache in the hearts of some battle-hardened Silksong-minded folks. One user, Breadbowl004 wrote in response to Griffon's post: "Notice how he didn't say Holiday 2025".</p>
<p>That being said, it's still unknown when <em>exactly</em> the game will be released. Also consider this, it would be incredibly funny if the game was pushed back to 2026. Something to think on.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
