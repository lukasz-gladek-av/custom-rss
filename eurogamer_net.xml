<p>Amazon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-god-of-war-tv-adaptation-is-officially-go">initially announced its God of War adaptation</a> back in December 2022. Series showrunner, Ronald D. Moore, recently revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-show-retain-the-tone-of-the-2018-reboot-series-but-also-makes-reference-to-older-greek-saga">the adaptation will remain largely faithful to Sony Santa Monica's 2018 game</a>, though it won't be a frame-by-frame remake.</p>
<p>"This world and this universe are really rich, and it's interesting, and it's really been fun to adapt," Moore explained at the time. "It's an adaptation, so it's an adaptation-slash-interpretation as you go into live-action, and it's been really fun to sort of go, 'Wow, there's a lot here we can play with. Okay, we want to keep the story. We want to keep the characters and the spirit of it'. There's all this stuff that you can keep turning to for inspiration."</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer">Moore joined the production almost two years after its was confirmed to be in the works</a> after the series based on Sony Santa Monica's God of War series reportedly had a "do-over" after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-reportedly-starting-from-scratch-as-showrunner-departs">the companies involved decided on a "different creative direction"</a>. Despite the early issues, though, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written">second season has been greenlit at Amazon</a>.</p>
