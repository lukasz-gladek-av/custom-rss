Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has said there's nothing stopping any of the company's games coming to Nintendo or PlayStation platforms in the future.
</p>
<p>
"I do not see sort of red lines in our portfolio that say 'thou must not,'" Spencer told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth">Bloomberg</a>, adding that it was still too early to discuss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-developer-343-industries-rebrands-confirms-multiple-new-games">Microsoft's plans for the next Halo</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-halo-on-unreal-engine-5-means-for-ps5">now being built in the cross-platform-friendly Unreal Engine</a>.
</p>
<p>
Xbox launched Pentiment, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, Grounded and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> across a mixture of PlayStation and Nintendo Switch consoles earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-just-topped-europes-ps5-download-charts">to some success</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-published-sea-of-thieves-reportedly-surpasses-1m-sales-on-playstation-5">more than 1m sales reported for Rare's popular piratical live-service game</a>. Microsoft will follow this with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">PlayStation launch for Xbox's biggest Christmas blockbuster, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, early next year. The expectation is that many other Xbox games will follow.

<p>
In a wide-ranging interview, Spencer also discussed his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-discusses-potential-xbox-handheld-plans">long-held desire to launch some kind of Xbox handheld</a>. Microsoft is currently working on prototypes and considering the market, Spencer said, though the launch of an official Xbox handheld is still a few years out. (So, no Xbox handheld before <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.)
</p><p>
Spencer also said Xbox still "definitely want to be in the market" to acquire other companies, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-been-12-months-since-microsoft-purchased-activision-blizzard-so-whats-changed">Microsoft's record-setting $68.7bn buyout of Activision Blizzard</a>. That said, deals of similar size were currently unlikely due to the still-ongoing process of merging in Activision teams.
</p>
<p>
The Xbox chief said he was still looking for deals that added "geographic diversity", such as teams in Asia, despite it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matt-booty-implies-tango-gameworks-closure-was-partly-due-to-leadership-change">walking away from Hi-Fi Rush studio Tango Gameworks</a> earlier this year. 
</p>
<p>
"The Xbox business has never been more healthy," Spencer concluded, when asked how he felt about 2025 after a year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">punctuated</a> by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">repeated layoffs</a>. "The business is performing right now, and I think that means a more healthy future for hardware and the games we build."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-1-battle-pass-includes-a-parasite-skin-for-some-reason<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Treyarch has shared more details on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> Season 1, including a look at its battle pass' rather unexpected new skins. These include a 'Raccoon Goon' skin for Niran, some kind of parasitic nightmare for Carver (see header image above) and a shark suit also for Carver, because why not.</p>
<p>The Call of Duty team has released a new system for its battle pass, which will now adopt a pages system to replace the sector map. In Treyarch's words, players should think of it all like a book.</p>

<p>"The first Page displays BlackCell Instant Rewards and the second Page shows premium Battle Pass Instant Rewards, followed by 100 in-game Battle Pass rewards across 14 Pages and a Completion Page that is instantly unlocked once all other Pages are completed," it explained, adding these pages include both free and paid content.</p>
<p>As for its content, which the developer noted is pretty ample, highlights include new weapon blueprints (there are 30 of them), those aforementioned operator skins, and some new equipment skins.</p>
<p>Players can get their hands on the premium battle pass for 1100 COD Points, or scoop up the 'Battle Pass Bundle' for 2400 COD Points, "including 20+ Tier Skips".</p>
