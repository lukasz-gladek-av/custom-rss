            <p>Head of Battlefield Vince Zampella has given his opinion on the creation of the Call of Duty franchise, stating the series only exists "because EA were dicks".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/battlefield-6-vince-zampella">In an interview with GQ</a>, Zampella spoke about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s potential to save the modern military shooter, but also his own history in game development. After all, before he touched Battlefield, Zampella was part of the original Call of Duty team.</p>
<p>"The only reason that Call of Duty exists is because EA were dicks," stated Zampella. For those who don't know, Zampella was working on the Medal of Honor series  - specifically the fantastic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/medal-honor-allied-assault">Medal of Honor: Allied Assault</a> - at developer 2015 Inc. Zampella and his peers then formed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/infinity-ward">Infinity Ward</a>, and soon after EA quickly decided to move development of Medal of Honor in-house. It's here when Infinity Ward made a deal with Activision Blizzard to create a new game codenamed "MOH Killer", which later manifested as Call of Duty.</p>

<p>While Zampella's comment on the creation of Call of Duty is new, whisperings about the birth of CoD and EA's sudden decision to take Medal of Honor in-house have been circulating for years.</p>
<p><a href="https://mcvuk.com/business-news/publishing/the-medal-of-honor-killer-a-call-of-duty-story/">In a 2013 MCV article</a>, former Infinity Ward artist Justin Thomas (who worked on Medal of Honor: Allied Assault), stated: "After leaving 2015 we were working with a major publisher. For legal reasons I will say things didn't go as planned with it. We were left in a situation of unpaid milestones that were delivered and no finances to operate on.</p><p>"The company was potentially going to disband. In a last ditch effort our then president, Grant Collier sent out a signal to all the major publishers in the industry letting them know that the majority of the Medal of Honor: Allied Assault team was available. Within days of closing the doors on the studio, Activision responded immediately with an offer."</p>
<p>Fast forward decades later, and Zampella has found himself leading the charge with a new military shooter facing off against the Call of Duty series, in an interesting twist of fate <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinity-ward-studio-heads-sacked">especially given Zampella was dramatically fired from Activision</a> back in 2010 due to claims of breach of contract and insubordination. Infinity Ward staff <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-told-infinity-ward-staff-to-take-the-money-and-get-over-it-after-west-and-zampella-firing">were then given a pay-rise, and told to "take the money and get over it"</a>.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 is proving to be a successful challenger to Call of Duty's throne right now, given the sheer popularity of the game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-only-been-out-a-day-and-its-already-one-of-steams-biggest-games-ever">quickly becoming one of the most popular Steam launches of all time</a>.</p>

            <p>A new job listing has been spotted at Bluepoint Games, fuelling speculation over the studio's next project.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bluepointgames.com/career-board?gh_jid=5600969004">job in question</a> is for a senior combat designer, to "refine engaging combat systems and mechanics" for its "next great title". More specifically, the qualifications require "solid understanding of combat systems and mechanics for third-person melee action experiences".</p>
<p>It's not much to go on, for sure, and there are plenty of third-person action games out there with melee combat.</p>

<p>Still, it's been a while since the studio released a new game and fans are eager to know what it's working on.</p>
<p>The studio is known for its remakes and remasters, with its PS4 remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> really putting it on the map. This was followed by the PS5 remake of FromSoftware's Demon's Souls for the console's launch in 2020, and a year later the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buys-demons-souls-remake-developer-bluepoint-games">studio was acquired by Sony to become part of PlayStation Studios</a>.</p><p>Since then? Nothing. Back in 2024, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/demons-souls-developer-bluepoint-games-still-working-on-an-original-title-for-playstation">studio was said to be working on an original title</a>, but earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">Sony cancelled two live-service games</a>, one of which was from Bluepoint and reportedly based in the God of War series.</p>
<p>As a result, it's unknown what the studio is currently working on, though this job listing is certainly leading to plenty of speculation.</p>
<p>There's long been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-god-of-war-trilogy-is-rumoured-to-be-getting-remastered">rumour of a remake of the original God of War trilogy</a>, for instance, and after the cancellation of that live-service game, perhaps Bluepoint is now back on some form of remake.</p>
<p>The other big speculation - though it's more fervent fan desire at this point - is a remake of Bloodborne, FromSoftware's beloved PS4 exclusive that would certainly follow Bluepoint's work on Demon's Souls.</p>
<p>FromSoftware's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-discusses-bloodborne-remake-benefits-of-waiting-for-new-hardware">Hidetaka Miyazaki himself told Eurogamer that remakes and remasters can certainly benefit from new hardware</a>, while admitting Bloodborne is "a title we hold very dear and just as much as our fans".</p>
<p>"I think having new hardware is definitely a part of what gives these remakes value," he said. "Things you weren't able to achieve on previous generations of hardware, ways you weren't able to render specific expressions - [new hardware] sometimes makes it possible.</p><p>"However, I wouldn't say that's the be all and end all," Miyazaki continued. "I think purely from a user perspective, modern hardware also allows more players to appreciate all the games. And so, it ends up being a simple reason, but as a fellow player, I think that accessibility is important. I think that can be the driving force between bringing an old game to a new platform."</p>
<p>Still, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-is-now-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawas-largest-shareholder">Sony became FromSoftware owner Kadokawa's largest shareholder</a> last year (even though that's predominantly to scoop up anime rights more than anything), could the two companies have struck a deal for Bloodborne to return? And if so, is Bluepoint the right studio to make it happen?</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> series of action games are notoriously challenging, but ahead of the release of Ninja Gaiden 4 its directors have emphasised the importance of fairness.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/ninja-gaiden-4-creators-say-fairness-in-dying-is-what-sets-apart-a-challenging-action-game-from-an-unreasonable-one/">Automaton</a>, directors Yuji Nakao (PlatinumGames) and Masakazu Hirayama (Team Ninja) discussed their approach to balancing the game's difficulty.</p>
<p>"What really stands out throughout the Ninja Gaiden series," said Nakao, "is how enemies are on equal footing with the player. They guard, and they even use throws."</p>

<p>He continued: "We focused not only on making the action feel satisfying, but also on offering the cathartic release of overcoming disadvantageous odds, that was a core part of development."</p>
<p>Hirayama added that fairness between the player and enemies is "crucial", maintained by whether death feels like the player's fault.</p>
<p>"If the player gets killed unreasonably," he said, "it's hard for them to reflect and think about what they could’ve done differently. But if they die because they made the wrong choice among several options, they'll think, 'Okay, let's try this instead'. That kind of trial-and-error cycle requires a fair dynamic between offense and defense to work. That's something we talk about a lot at Team Ninja, and it's something we've always valued throughout the series."</p>
<p>Ultimately, said Nakao, Ninja Gaiden 4 is "not a game you'll be able to breeze through" and has "hardship…scattered throughout". "That sense of catharsis you feel when you overcome those challenges is something I truly value," he said.</p>
<p>Debate around difficulty in games has raged for years, particularly with regards to Soulslike action-RPGs. While action games like the Ninja Gaiden series are known for their difficulty, the Dark Souls games certainly popularised high levels of challenge, especially after the success of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>.</p><p>Most recently, the debate has resurfaced in the wake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, Team Cherry's long-awaited sequel. For many players, it's proven an incredibly steep challenge, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-devs-admit-it-has-moments-of-steep-difficulty-but-also-a-higher-level-of-freedom-to-avoid-getting-stonewalled">the studio's Ari Gibson noted</a> players "have ways to mitigate the difficulty via exploration, or learning, or even circumventing the challenge entirely, rather than getting stonewalled."</p>
<p>After Ninja Gaiden 4's initial reveal, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ninja-gaiden-4s-two-protagonists-will-honour-the-series-legacy">Nakao spoke to Eurogamer about honouring the series' legacy</a> with its dual protagonists, as well as its difficulty.</p>
<p>"Ninja Gaiden is known for its intensity, especially that back and forth between offence and defence, and that dynamic ebb and flow of the combat," said Nakao. "With Ninja Gaiden 4, we are making sure it inherits those qualities and that the high speed action and the gameplay feel that longtime players have come to expect from Ninja Gaiden games - including the challenge and the difficulty - are present in this new entry."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the Tokyo Games Show last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-xbox-tokyo-game-show-broadcast">Xbox detailed the difficulty options in Ninja Gaiden 4</a> for newcomers and experts alike ahead of its release later this month across Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.</p>
