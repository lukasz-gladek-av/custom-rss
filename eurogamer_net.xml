            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> is reportedly working on a full remake of Dragon Quest 7, following the success of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake last year.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/square-enix-developing-dragon-quest-vii-remake-for-release-in-2026">mp1st</a>, Square Enix has specifically described the project as a remake - as opposed to a remaster - meaning the PS1 classic Dragon Quest 7 (released in 2000) will receive more than just a graphical update.</p>
<p>The report states the game is intending to launch in either the last quarter of the current fiscal year, or at the beginning of the next - in essence, Square Enix is aiming to release the game in early 2026.</p>

<p>This won't be the first time Dragon Quest 7 has been re-released. A remake was released exclusively on the Nintendo 3DS in Japan in 2013, arriving worldwide in 2016 with the subtitle Fragments of the Forgotten Past. One major change was visible enemy encounters instead of random encounters, while the international release was localised afresh.</p>
<p>Square Enix has not officially announced the remake of Dragon Quest 7.</p>
<p>Instead, it's gearing up for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-coming-to-switch-2-but-physical-version-is-just-a-download-key">release of Dragon Quest 1+2 HD-2D Remake</a>, coming to Switch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam, Windows) in October.</p>
<p>It will follow the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-exceeded-square-enix-expectations-but-game-sales-drop-overall">huge success of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</a>, in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-already-best-selling-game-in-japan-for-2024-after-just-one-week">Japan especially</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-7-remake-reportedly-in-development-at-square-enix]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nicolae Ștefănuță, Romanian poliician and vice president of the European Parliament, has spoken out in support of Stop Killing Games, saying, he "stands with the people" behind the initiative, and that "a game, once sold, belongs to the customer, not the company."</p>
<p>Ștefănuță voiced his support - and confirmed he'd added his own signature to the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/eci">EU petition</a> - in an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stopkillinggames.bsky.social/post/3ltseohvy7k2b">Instagram Story spotted and shared by Stop Killing Games</a>. "I stand with the people who started this citizen initiative," he said. "I signed and will continue to help them. A game, once sold, belongs to the customer, not the company.'</p>
<p>Ștefănuță's offer of help comes after Stop Killing Games' official EU petition surpassed 1m signatures earlier this month, meaning it can now be submitted to the EU for verification and then, potentially, either progress to a public hearing or full debate session at the European Parliament. However, organiser Ross Scott is still encouraging more signatures ahead of the EU's deadline to ensure its signature count remains above the essential 1m threshold once mistakes or deliberate spoofing are eliminated.</p>
<p>But while Stop Killing Games now has at least one prominent EU politician on its side, it's unlikely its aim - of securing legislation that'll leave purchased games in a playable state once support is terminated - will reach fruition without significant resistance from the games industry itself. Last week, EU industry body Video Games Europe - which represents the likes of Ubisoft, Take-Two, Warner Bros., Activision Blizzard, Microsoft, and Nintendo - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-proposals-for-game-preservation-prohibitively-expensive-major-publishers-insist">released a statement</a> insisting the initiative's proposals would make games "prohibitively expensive to create".</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Stop Killing Games' <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074">official UK petition</a> has surpassed over 150K signatures, meaning it must now be considered for debate in parliament, despite the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/favourite-game-no-longer-playable-uk-government-says-it-wont-tighten-rules-to-punish-publishers-who-switch-off-servers">government's earlier response</a> that it had "no plans to amend UK consumer law on disabling video games".

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> started development after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> was finished, Nintendo has said, and work first began on the original Switch console.</p>
<p>The forthcoming game is the first 3D game featuring Nintendo's gorilla since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, but in an interview with <a href="https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20250710/10876902/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2-entrevista.html">La Vanguardia</a>, Bonanza's producer Kenta Motokura stated the team felt "this was the right time to develop this game".</p>
<p>When asked when development began, Motokura replied: "Although I can't give you very precise details, I can tell you that we started developing it after finishing Super Mario Odyssey (2017)" (via machine translation).</p>

<p>Later in the interview, director Kazuya Takahashi discussed how Donkey Kong Bananza's focus on destruction was only made possible on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>"As we mentioned before, we wanted to generate continuity through chain destruction, and to do this we needed to place a large number of destructible objects," said Takahashi. "This was only possible on Switch 2, which allowed so many elements to be placed on the screen, as well as different materials and large-scale destruction. In addition, to increase the feeling of satisfaction when destroying, we have put a lot of care into the effects and sounds, and also in the appearance of the objects that are destroyed."</p>
<p>Nintendo confirmed earlier this month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-donkey-kong-bananza-is-being-made-by-the-mario-odyssey-team">Donkey Kong Bananza has been developed by the team responsible for Super Mario Odyssey</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier today we reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-film-copyright-registered-by-nintendo-as-gorillas-prominence-continues">Nintendo has registered copyright for a Donkey Kong film</a>, which will likely follow the forthcoming Mario film sequel and Legend of Zelda film.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-started-development-after-super-mario-odyssey-and-wouldnt-have-been-possible-on-the-original-switch]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Haru Urara has been sent an absurd amount of tasty ryegrass, thanks to her appearance in Uma Musame: Pretty Derby and an influx of new fans.</p>

            <p><strong>Uma Musume: Pretty Derby</strong> fanatics have come out en masse to send packages of delicious ryegrass to their favourite horse from the game: Haru Urara. 
</p>
<p>Uma Musume, if you're not in the know, is an extremely popular gacha game that is getting more players by the day: over the weekend, it enjoyed over 50,000 concurrents on Steam alone (notable, since the vast majorioty of the playerbase is on mobile). In-game, you must further the careers of a variety of horses - obviously represented as horses, here - in order to progress. And it just so happnes that Haru Urara is the current fan favourite.  </p>
<p>This flood of new fans have been so passionate in their support the <a href="https://namabokusobank.jp/article/%E3%83%8F%E3%83%AB%E3%82%A6%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A9">Japanese ryegrass gifting website Live Grass Bank</a> has been sporadically crashing for days due to the intense traffic. However, <a href="https://x.com/namabokusobank/status/1944550718050042228">a public statement from the site</a> has confirmed the orders have been received and these gifts will be sent out over time.
</p>
<p>Haru Urara, depicted as a lighthearted pink-haired horse girl in Uma Musame: Pretty Derby, isn't a particularly great horse. During her professional career, the actual racehorse didn't win a single race, which is reflected in-game with career goals focused on gaining fans rather than taking home trophies.
</p>

<p>However, her delightful character has proven more than enough to garner a fresh fanbase with the worldwide release of free-to-play hit Uma Musame: Pretty Derby. An exceptionally popular gacha game available on both mobile and PC, many players who have yet to nab one of the rarer horses have nonetheless been having a blast with Haru and the other basic characters.
</p>
<p>Messages of support for Haru Urara are numerous on the ryegrass gifting website. Alongside each gift, you can leave a lovely message of support, such as "enjoy the grass from a loving sailor", or the short but sweet "never give up". We know Haru's getting the grass too, <a href="https://x.com/animal_love_kaz/status/1942472338420666628">courtesy of videos posted on X (formerly Twitter)</a>.
</p>
<p>Then, of course, you have social media, where artists have galloped along to immortalise this feeding frenzy <a href="https://x.com/HARUURARA_mochi/status/1943903597994901727">with custom illustrations</a>. It's safe to say that while Haru Urara may not have won any races in their career, winning the hearts of gacha fans will keep them full for a while.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/so-why-exactly-are-uma-musume-pretty-derby-players-are-sending-massive-amounts-of-grass-to-a-retired-japanese-race-horse]]></content:encoded>
