            <p>The Silent Hill fandom is seemingly split once again, this time over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>'s "soulslike" combat.</p>
<p>As more and more teasers and footage pop up online in the run-up to 25th September's launch day, fans are getting stuck into all the new gameplay. But while we already <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/silent-hill-f-launches-september-25-ps5-gameplay-revealed/">knew</a> the combat would have a "heavier focus on melee and be more action-oriented compared to last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>", fans are concerned about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mggyrw/silent_hill_f_looks_great_but_the_enemy_combat/">how enemies react</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mg6fn0/the_small_hypocrisy_im_seeing_for_silent_hill_f/">degradable weapons</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mf7e5l/why_are_they_making_silent_hill_a_soulslike/">"soulslike" boss encounters</a>.</p>
<p>"The game is looking incredible overall in terms of detail and quality. The amount of work the devs have put in is really impressive. That said, I’m a bit worried about how the combat is shaping up, specifically, how enemies react (or don’t react) when taking hits," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mggyrw/silent_hill_f_looks_great_but_the_enemy_combat/">said one player</a>.</p>

<p>"Why, I can't guy[s] please don't tell me it's true," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mf7e5l/why_are_they_making_silent_hill_a_soulslike/">lamented one fan</a>. "I love this series and I'm really hyped for the game, but please game devs, don't take this route, don't sacrifice what this series is know [sic] for to trend chase. Don't alienate your audience. I'm honestly scared if this is the direction there [sic] taking this series."</p>
<p>"The combat certainly concerns me. Even if it ends up being amazing, I feel apprehensive about a Silent Hill game having combat that evokes the counter timings of Sekiro," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mf9o9e/comment/n6fl6ds/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">added</a> someone else. "Hopefully they pull a Bloober and prove me wrong. At the very least, I hope it’s a good horror game even if it ends up failing as a Silent Hill game."</p>
<p>To be fair, this isn't the first time the series has dabbled with degradable weapons – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-4-the-room">Silent Hill 4: The Room</a> and Silent Hill Origins did, too, although how successful that was lies in the eye of the player, I guess. The problem for some, however, is how those degradable weapons could inhibit exploration.</p>
<p>"I'd like to scour the in-game world and pick up all the details/memos, but if I'm burning through my decent weapons at every stop to do so, I'm eventually gonna stop exploring to conserve resources," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mf2maj/comment/n6ffoo9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">suggested one fan</a>.</p>
<p>As for the other complaints? Well, there were plenty of those for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> in the run-up to release, and that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">turned out to be one of my favourite games in years</a> (and what I think is the only 5/5 I've awarded in all the years I've reviewed here). So the good news is, regardless of how the previews are making fans feel, September will be here before we know it.</p>
<p>Silent Hill f was unveiled as part of Konami's four-game series revival back in 2022, but it took until the middle of March 2025 to get an update. Now that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Bloober Team's superb Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> is behind us, the publisher is turning its attention to its mysterious follow-up, a new mainline instalment set in 1960s Japan.</p>
<p>It's being developed by Neobards Entertainment (which has previously served as a support studio for Capcom's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>), with creature and character design by Kera, and a script by When They Cry writer Ryukishi07.</p>
<p>As Matt recently summarised for us, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/konamis-japan-set-silent-hill-f-resurfaces-with-eerie-new-trailer-and-fresh-details">Silent Hill f's events are unfolding in the rural town of Ebisugaoka</a> - based on Kanayama, Gero, in the Gifu Prefecture - where our protagonist Shimizu Hinako, an "ordinary teenager", finds her home shrouded in fog and changed in "horrific" ways. As Silent Hill f play out, she'll explore a town she no longer recognises, solving puzzles, fighting strange enemies, and eventually having to make a "beautiful yet terrifying" decision that lies at the heart of the game.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/fandom-split-on-silent-hill-fs-soulslike-combat]]></content:encoded>
