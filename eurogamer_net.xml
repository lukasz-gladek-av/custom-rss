            <p>Bungie is continuing to respond to your feedback during Marathon's Server Slam event, paying particular attention to your thoughts on the UI, PC performance, and those pesky weasel error codes.</p>
<p>The Server Slam – scheduled to close tomorrow, Monday 2nd March, 6pm UK time – is not only giving players the chance to try before they buy, but it's also helping Bungie stamp out bugs and server issues ahead of its full launch next week on 5th March.</p>
<p>"As we continue through your third full day on Tau Ceti, we wanted to once again share some of the primary discussion topics we've seen pop up - and, share some ways you can provide us intel if you haven't had a chance to just yet," the team explained, before thanking players "for taking the time" to share their feedback and "ensure that the launch goes as smoothly as possible".</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Here's the full update:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UI feedback:</strong> We are continuing to gather your posts and will keep iterating post‑launch (which, we’ll keep you posted on with regard to any future timelines once they’re available). Add your thoughts in the UI thread on our Discord so we can track them all in one place: <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1303855380845301861/1476673733358915778">https://discord.com/channels/1303855380845301861/1476673733358915778</a></li>
<li><strong>PC performance:</strong> We are reviewing reports of high CPU use, low GPU utilisation, FPS ceilings ~80–100, and some stuttering. If you’re running into any of these issues (or another one we didn’t mention), please feel free to mosey on over to our Help Forum and let us know! Details on your system specs or links to short video clips are super helpful:<a href="http://bung.ie/marathonsupport"> http://bung.ie/marathonsupport</a></li>
<li><strong>PvP frequency:</strong> As we continue to keep an ear to the ground on this one, we’re further investigating total player density on non-beginner maps to cover all of our bases. If you've got any feedback - be it on Perimeter (Beginner), Perimeter, or Dire Marsh - we want to hear it!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Movement and heat generation:</strong> As the test continues on, we’ve seen continued discussions about heat generation, momentum, and overall movement feedback. Make sure to take a chance and let us know your thoughts!</li>
<li><strong>Med and ammo economy: </strong>These two items have been a regular feedback item, and we’re thankful to see your reports. Discussions about stack sizes, the efficacy of green-tier med items, and more opportunities for ammo to drop have been primary topics – but, our ears remain open. Keep sharing your experiences and please let us know what you brought into any runs where you feel like you’re running dry.</li>
<li><strong>Weasel error codes:</strong> Over the last day we’ve seen a number of Weasel error codes, which are caused by a disruption of your network connection to Marathon servers. We have several investigations under way and will report back with updates. In some cases, this may be caused by issues with your home Internet connection, or with your Internet provider. If you have made changes that have resolved this issue for you, please let us know.</li>
</ul>
<p>Marathon's Server Slam kicked off just before the weekend, and attracted a healthy number of players on Steam. The game <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4254230/charts/">brought in a peak of 143,621 concurrent players, solely on the PC platform</a>, with a Steam peak of around 76K players on Saturday (28th February).</p>

            <p>Patricia Summersett, the voice of Princess Zelda in four Legend of Zelda games – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, and Hyrule Warriors spin-offs Age of Calamity and Age of Imprisonment – can "write in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-twilight-princess">Twilight Princess</a> Hylian".</p>
<p>Casually dropping the information into conversation with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-zelda-turns-40-voice-actress-patricia-summersett-reveals-hopes-for-the-future-and-clarifies-her-thoughts-on-link-and-zeldas-gorgeous-relationship">IGN</a>, Summersett said she taught herself how to write using the Hylian alphabet "over coffee" while recording Breath of the Wild.</p>

<p>"It's something I did early on when I was recording [Breath of the Wild] and I was just starting to look through [series companion book] Hyrule Historia at the different versions of the languages from all the previous games," she said.</p><p>"Obviously, Breath of the Wild wasn't out yet, so I didn't know what would be in that game. But I saw Twilight Princess Hylian, and it's so beautiful. I thought I could probably learn those characters, which is essentially just the alphabet, and started practising that over coffee. So now I can kind of write fluently and use it all the time."</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, Summersett revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/link-and-zelda-are-in-a-relationship-voice-actress-says">she'd interpreted Link and Zelda's friendship as "being in a relationship"</a>, before clarifying she <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tears-of-the-kingdom-voice-actress-backtracks-after-stating-link-and-zelda-were-in-a-relationship">did not mean to imply</a> they were a romantic couple. A few months after that, Nintendo said it was "up to the player's imagination" to interpret the relationship.</p>
<p>Asked to comment once again on the issue, Summersett was cautious, saying: "I have to be so careful when I answer that question. Let me formulate this... I have all sorts of personal theories about what this might be, but I think there's something beautiful in the way that it's left ambiguous, it's left in a kind of — if there are romantic undertones, it's left in an unrequited state. </p>
<p>"There's obviously a deep friendship and a protectorship between the two of them. It's a gorgeous relationship and it continues to evolve and be left open in so many iterations of this."</p>
<p>As for the live-action movie? Summersett said she thinks we're "going to see a strong Zelda. I'm sure you're going to see a powerful lead character in Zelda. And Link I have no idea, is he going to speak? They certainly haven't alluded to the fact that he does, yet".</p><p>Filming for that aforementioned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-the-project-begins-production-it-looks-like-the-legend-of-zelda-film-is-following-in-lord-of-the-rings-esteemed-footsteps">Nintendo's Legend of Zelda adaptation began last November in New Zealand</a>, and is expected to run until April next year. The film is due to release on 7th May, 2027. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-reveals-its-link-and-zelda-for-forthcoming-the-legend-of-zelda-film">Link and Princess Zelda will be played by Benjamin Evan Ainsworth and Bo Bragason</a>, respectively, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-live-action-adaptation-of-the-legend-of-zelda-will-stream-on-netflix">is coming to Netflix after its "theatrical and home entertainment release periods"</a>.</p>
