<p>Consequently, from today, 31st January, you won't be able to buy any in-game currency, Gleamium, although you're welcome to keep spending what money you do have until the season is over.</p>
<p>The free-to-play game will also be pulled from Epic Games Store, Steam, and both the PlayStation and Microsoft stores in May, with season 5's new playable characters, DCâ€™s Aquaman and Looney Tunes' Lola Bunny, still "earnable through gameplay".</p>
<p>Players who have deleted or uninstalled the game prior to the end of Season 5 will still be able to reinstall it after 30th May.</p>
<p>"We want to thank every player and person who has ever played or supported MultiVersus," the team wrote.</p>
<p>"All of us on the Player First Games and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a> teams have poured our heart and soul into this game. We will be forever grateful for the incredible support of the MultiVersus community throughout this journey."</p>
<p>The news follows the announcement that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Warner%20Bros.%20Games%20boss%20David%20Haddad%20departs%20following%20rocky%20period%20for%20publisher">Warner Bros.
