            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>'s gorgeous PlayStation 5 sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> is inching ever-closer to release, and ahead of its October arrival, developer Sucker Punch has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgM6poO2JmY">shared its best look yet</a> at what the revenge-soaked open-world action-adventure will bring - including, it turns out, a lo-fi beats mode for a more soothing saunter through Ezo.
</p>
<p>
Ghost of Yōtei, of course, features a brand-new protagonist in Atsu, a "lone wolf mercenary" so single-minded in her mission to punish the Yōtei Six - the ruthless gang who slaughtered her family - she's believed to an Onryō (a Japanese spirit of vengeance) by the local people.
</p>
<p>
Atsu returns to Ezo after 16 years in the south as Sucker Punch's deep dive begins, travelling back to her childhood home in order to put the spirits of her family to rest. Here, she can revisit the "cherished times" of her youth, switching between the past and present at the push of a button, before venturing out across the stunning world in her relentless quest for blood.

<p>
And with each victory Atsu secures against the Yōtei Six, the more her renown grows, increasing the bounty on her head and leading to encounters with deadlier foes. But Atsu can also take on bounties of her own in order to make money and fuel her quest. Which brings us nicely onto Ghost of Yōtei's expanded combat.
</p>
<p>
Atsu can wield a katana, spear, kusarigama, odachi, or dual swords (and can switch between them on the fly) with each being uniquely effective against particular enemies. The odachi, for instance, is best used against massive enemies, and when opponents switch weapons, players will need to do the same in order to adapt - unleashing their dual swords, say, to better counter spears. All weapons feature their own upgrades to discover and master, and Atsu has access to ranged abilities too, including throwing weapons such as bombs and blinding powder.
</p>
<p>
As to how players can find themselves in these sorts of sticky situations, Sucker Punch says Ghost of Yōtei is more focused on player freedom than any of its other games, and there's a clue system - based on interrogating enemies and collecting new mission cards - that can take players everywhere from snow-covered heights to a landscape scarred by fire. But there's seemingly ample space for players to simply grab their spyglass, pick a point of interest, and forge their own path across Ezo, taking in its golden fields, shimmering lakes, swaying trees, and endless valleys of fallings leaves and rising mist.

<p>
Players might, for instance, stumble across Altars of Reflection. These provide Atsu with fresh inspiration and unlock new abilities - such as Perfect Parry and Disarm Counter - that'll help her on the journey ahead. Alternatively, players can buy travellers maps from a cartographer if they'd prefer to focus on forward momentum rather than languid exploration. Either way, they've the option to set up camp under the stars throughout their adventure, resting up, play shamisen, cooking, and preparing for the fight ahead. Camping also brings important characters and upgrades straight to players, replacing Ghost of Tsushima's journal with a system said to provide a "more character-driven way of managing allies and vendors", so you "don't have to leave where you're exploring, [because] the game comes to you".
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in Sucker Punch's deep dive, there was talk about customisation and finding the right combination of armour, charms, and gear that works for different play-styles, be that the stealthy approach or a more melee-focused one. And of course armour and weapon appearances can be customised too, meaning you'll be able to look your best as you crank out Ghost of Yōtei's returning photo mode.
</p>
<p>
That's not the only returning feature, however; it's once again possible to select a Japanese voice track with full lip sync and subtitles from the beginning, if you want a more authentic representation of the samurai movies Sucker Punch's series is inspired by. And you can go even further with the returning Kurasowa mode, which emulates the legendary film director's movies with a distinctive black and white palette, film grain, audio filters, and increased wind.
</p>
<p>
Kurasowa isn't the only Japanese movie director being represented this time though. There's a new mode taking its cue from Ichi the Killer and Audition director Takashi Miike that puts the camera closer during combat for a "more intense, raw experience" that also features increased mud and blood splatter. Alternatively, you can opt for the mode created in conjunction with Cowboy Bebop director Shinichirō Watanabe. This is where the lo-fi beats come in, switching out Ghost of Tsushima's usual music in favour of more relaxed tunes created by Watanabe that play during exploration and combat.
</p>
<p>
And that's pretty much all we're getting for now. Ghost of Yōtei launches for PS5 on 2nd October, and it'll arrive alongside a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-limited-edition-ghost-of-yotei-ps5-bundles-with-designs-rooted-in-traditional-japanese-art-announced">newly announced limited edition console and controller</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>This evening, Sony and developer Sucker Punch gave us all a closer look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>, as part of a dedicated State of Play.</p>
<p>Along with an overview of gameplay, different modes, weapons and more, the team also revealed its custom PS5 and DualSense controllers, which are coming with the newly announced Ghost of Yōtei Limited Edition Bundles. </p>

<p>The limited edition designs are "rooted in traditional Japanese art", the Ghost of Yōtei team said. There are two designs to choose from: The PS5 Console - Ghost of Yōtei Gold Limited Edition Bundle and the PS5 Console - Ghost of Yōtei Black Limited Edition Bundle.</p>
<p>The Gold bundle features, as the name suggests, gold detailing running across the hardware inspired by kintsugi, "a traditional process to repair broken ceramics with lacquer and gold". PlayStation states this design mirrors the personal "journey of healing and resilience" of Ghost of Yōtei's lead Atsu, while also "symbolising beauty in imperfection".</p>

</figure>
<p>The PS5 Console - Ghost of Yōtei Black Limited Edition Bundle, meanwhile, takes its inspiration coming from Sumi-e. This is another traditional Japanese art form, which uses black ink on plaintings.</p>
<p>"Expressing the landmarks of Ezo through bold black brush strokes, this design captures the essence of the land's beauty and mystery, while echoing Atsu's inner struggle and journey towards redemption," PlayStation said.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sony</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Both of the above Ghost of Yōtei PS5 bundles come with a matching DualSense wireless controller. A silhouette of Atsu adorns the touchpad.</p>
<p>"Our inspiration for this design came straight from one of the core aspects within the game: a deep focus on exploration," Sucker Punch creative director Jason Connel said. "This includes the hand-drawn icons Atsu marks on her map, a kintsugi-style effect pulled from her Ghost mask, and brushstrokes reminiscent of her Sumi-e paintings.</p>
<p>"The towering Mount Yōtei is included at the center of the console design to pull it all together, and Atsu is spotlighted on the DualSense controller. Each of these elements were thoughtfully woven into both the console and controller designs."</p>
<p>As well as these bundles, those with a PS5 Slim or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> will be able to purchase Console Covers. The DualSenses will both also be available as a standalone purchase.</p>
<p>This hardware is set for release on the same day as Ghost of Yōtei itself: 2nd October. You can find further information on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/10/first-look-ps5-ghost-of-yotei-limited-edition-console-designs/">PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>

<p>Ghost of Yōtei will focus on Atsu and her quest for vengeance. She is hunting down a gang of outlaws known as the Yōtei Six, you see.</p>
<p>"They killed her family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree outside her home. But Atsu survived," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-announced">Sucker Punch teased earlier this year</a>. "She learned to fight, to kill, and to hunt, and after years away she has returned to her home with a list of six names: The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/two-limited-edition-ghost-of-yotei-ps5-bundles-with-designs-rooted-in-traditional-japanese-art-announced]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>' seventh birthday celebrations back in March, developer Rare has cast its spyglass toward new horizons, outlining its vision for the multiplayer pirate adventure's future in its first-ever Community Direct livestream. And those plans include the introduction of multi-ship private servers and paid custom servers "early" next year.
</p>
<p>
Today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKQiiI3ElkU">stream</a> wasn't perhaps the most revelatory of affairs, despite its hour-long runtime, but it did see Rare admitting to having dropped the ball in terms of game health and narrative momentum in recent years. Both are things it's talked about before, but it's now detailed some of the ways it hopes to keep players onboard as Sea of Thieves sails into year eight and beyond.
</p>
<p>
To that end, the studio talked at length about "finding balance" between introducing new features, reinvigorating and expanding some of Sea of Thieves' neglected legacy systems - including the likes of captaincy, hourglass battles, and guilds - tackling long-standing bugs and issues, and implementing some of the community's most-requested features.
</p>

<p>
As to what that'll look like in practical terms, from Sea of Thieves' upcoming Season 17 onward, seasons will "focus more consistently on reaching a broader set of player motivations". That means a mix of new stuff, revisiting previous content to "tease out more value", plus a renewed sense of narrative and world-building to ensure seasons are "always moving the world forward". The studio did, however, stress story won't be "front and centre", implying the likes of Tall Tales and long-abandoned Adventures are now well and truly a thing of the past.
</p>
<p>
Starting with Season 17, each three-month-long season will follow a fixed pattern: month one will focus on "reinvigorating the sandbox" and "stirring the pot around a theme and a set of motivations" to keep things fresh; month two will bring an "expanded approach to live events", while month three will introduce some kind of community call to action. Additionally, recurring seasonal events will now be run on a more predictable schedule: Community Weekends, for instance, will take place during the first month of a season, and Gold and Glory in the third.
</p>
<p>
Using the upcoming Season 17: Smugglers' Tide as an example, Rare's revised plan means month one will bring the new Smugglers faction, new hideouts around the world, new smuggling runs that reward players for ferrying dangerous cargo, and a refresh for the likes of shipwrecks and skeleton ships, which will both harbour valuable smuggler cargo. 
</p>

<p>
Month two introduces a new heist-inspired live event, bringing the community together to battle over a sea fort location (Rare notes these live events won't be one-and-done, but will instead enter some sort of rotation), and month three gives Skeleton Forts a Reaper-themed makeover. So alongside the likes of a new loot pool, players can anticipate being invaded by the Dark Brethren and their ghost ships mid-battle, switching crews' role from invaders to defenders. All that and a narrative thread to bring the whole season together.
</p>
<p>
And that'll be the seasonal template players can expect from here on out. Season 18, for instance, is aiming to revitalise Sea of Thieves' long-neglected Devil's Roar area, introducing a banished faction of Dark Ancients, hidden shrines, a new ancient threat, plus reinvigorated Emissary gameplay. Beyond that, things are a lot vaguer, with Rare teasing a "multi-year" vision it'll talk about in the next Community Direct, in six months' time.
</p>
<p>
All of which brings us to Rare's final reveal: confirmation that custom servers - AKA Custom Seas - are coming in "early 2026". These are set to feature a host of options and toggles, enabling players to turn off the likes of the kraken or storms, spawn in chests, break current crew limits, and more. They'll also include access to the tools Rare uses to make its trailers, including a cinematic camera. The catch is all this is being labelled as a "premium" feature, and will require a regular subscription to access - Rare's justification being that custom servers are expensive to develop, maintain, and continue evolving.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Sea of Thieves' Safer Seas mode - which essentially gives a single ship and its crew access to a private server version of the game, albeit one with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-is-finally-letting-private-server-players-earn-full-rewards-starting-in-december">some restrictions</a> - will be expanded to allow fleets of friends to sail together. This announcement came amid Rare's chatter of custom servers, and it's not entirely clear if this is a free addition or if it'll require the custom server subscription. I've asked Microsoft for clarification.
</p>
<p>
Sea of Thieves' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKQiiI3ElkU">inaugural Community Direct</a> is a fairly meandering thing, but probably still worth a watch for some insight into Rare's thinking (there's also talk of an overhaul for its long-running Insiders programme, which includes the ditching of its NDAs and the ushering in of a new spoiler-filled future), just don't expect much in the way of specific reveals.
</p>
<p>
Today's Sea of Thieves Community Direct does, of course, follow <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">sweeping layoffs and project cancellations across Microsoft and its Xbox division</a> last week. One <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">notable casualty was Rare's fantasy action-adventure Everwild</a>, announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rare-announces-everwild-its-next-big-new-ip">all the way back in 2019</a>. In the wake of its cancellation, Rare veteran Gregg Mayles - who directed the likes of Sea of Thieves and Banjo-Kazooie before helming Everwild - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-and-banjo-kazooie-director-gregg-mayles-reportedly-leaving-rare-after-35-years">confirmed to be departing the studio</a> after 35 years.
