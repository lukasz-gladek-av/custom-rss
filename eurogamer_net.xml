            <p>The co-CEO of MindsEye developer Build a Rocket Boy has suggested the game's negative reaction so far has been paid for in a "concerted effort" against the studio ahead of its release.</p>
<p>MindsEye is an upcoming action-adventure thriller from former GTA producer Leslie Benzies, which is being published by Hitman studio <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>. It is set for release on 10th June, across PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC.</p>
<p>A new trailer was released last night, highlighting some of the features coming to the game such as the ability for players to create their own missions using the in-game creation system. You can check it out below.</p>

<p>However, despite the trailers and having veteran developers working at the studio, the reaction to MindsEye has so far been underwhelming. A <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1925528143843999907">bulleted rundown listing issues with the game</a>, which was shared online earlier this week, called MindsEye a "broken mess, filled with bugs" and enemy encounters that "lacked depth".</p>
<p>Now, Build a Rocket Boy's co-CEO has claimed that there is a reason MindsEye is getting negative feedback - it's because people are being paid to do so. In an exchange on the MindsEye Discord server, Mark Gerhard was asked if he believes "all the people who reacted negatively were financed by someone", to which he replied: "100 percent."</p>
<p>When another user in the chat highlighted Gerhard's claims were rather unexpected, the studio exec replied: "Not wild when it's true....."</p>
<p>In another reply, the studio exec added it "doesn't take much to guess who" with an accompanying laughing emoji, though he didn't elaborate on this point further at the time. However, when confronted about the matter further, Gerhard said there has been a "concerted effort" involved regarding criticism around the game and the studio.</p>
<p>Wrote Gerhard: "I just said that there is a concerted effort by some people that don't want to see Leslie or Build A Rocket Boy to be successful that are making a concerted effort to trash the game and the studio. It's pretty easy to see the bots and the repeated replies to any content that we put out."</p>
<p>Eurogamer contacted Build a Rocket Boy for comment on Gerhard's claims, however neither the studio or publisher IOI was able to say more at this time.</p>

<p>It's not only a fitting sales milestone for the game, but a huge debut success for the studio. Even French <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-calls-clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-shining-example-of-french-audacity">President Macron has congratulated the team</a>.</p>

<p>For those yet to play the game, the number 33 is key to the story. Players control the 33rd expedition on a mission to stop the mysterious Paintress from killing the population. The game then plays on this number in multiple ways - the maximum level for your weapons is 33, for one example.</p>
<p>"Outstanding artwork and glorious combat bring Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's bold, painterly world to life," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">our review</a>.</p>
<p>Since release, more details on the game's development have emerged, including how its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-french-inspired-setting-was-originally-steampunk-london">authentic French setting was originally steampunk London</a>.</p>
<p>Director Guillaume Broche also said the possibility of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-on-switch-2-could-be-interesting-says-director">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 on Switch 2 "could be interesting"</a>, so perhaps there are more sales to come.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It looks like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> launch game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> will have a reverse mode for the first time.</p>
<p>Previous games in the series have included Mirror Mode as an unlockable extra, which flips tracks horizontally for a new challenge.</p>
<p>However, characters have been spotted racing in reverse in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5wuhtJfj54&amp;t=51s">Japan-only advert</a> for the new game, suggesting a reverse mode will finally be included.</p>

<p>The advert includes footage of characters racing around the Mario Bros. Circuit in the opposite direction, when compared to footage from Nintendo's Treehouse Live stream (thanks <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/it-seems-that-you-can-play-courses-in-reverse-in-mario-kart-world/">NintendoSoup</a>).</p>
<p>It's unknown yet how racing in reverse will be included in the game - perhaps as a separate option following completion of 150cc - but the footage appears to show a Grand Prix race rather than Knockout Tour, judging by the UI.</p>
<p>Of course, with Mario Kart World being an open world game, players will be able to drive in all directions in Free Roam, so it would make sense Nintendo would make use of this for its Grand Prix.</p>
<p>It's not long to wait now until we'll be able to play Mario Kart World for ourselves. It launches alongside the Switch 2 on 5th June - that's next week!</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-was-first-developed-for-the-original-switch-but-60fps-only-possible-on-switch-2">Nintendo shared an interview with Mario Kart World's developers</a>. They confirmed the game was originally in development for the original Switch, but the open world design was better suited to the new console running at 60fps.</p>

            <p>In the run up to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s release next week (next week!), Nintendo has released a new video highlighting the changes N64 classics will have on the console's debut.</p>
<p>Those with a Nintendo Switch Online plus Expansion Pack subscription are able to play classic games from the N64 days, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask">Majora's Mask</a>, Pok√©mon Snap, and a personal favourite, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/goldeneye-007-review">GoldenEye 007</a>.</p>
<p>And soon, those on Switch 2 will be able to play these games, and then rewind them when things don't go quite as planned (what, that has never happened to me), pop on a CRT screen filter and remap the controls. You can check out how this all looks via the video below.</p>

<p>While those on the original Switch consoles won't be able to utilise that rewind feature or the  CRT screen filter, they will be able to remap the controls when this update goes live.</p>
<p>As to when all this is happening, that would be next Thursday, 5th June. That's the day Switch 2 releases.</p>

<p>In the meantime while we wait patiently for next week, you can check out the full run down of games available on Nintendo's subscription service via our handy guide: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-online-games-available-to-play-right-now">All Nintendo Switch Online games available to play right now</a>.</p>
<p>As for the Switch 2, while it is not technically available just yet, some have managed to get their hands on the console early. Last night, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-reportedly-already-out-in-the-wild-but-needs-a-day-one-update-to-function">footage was shared online of someone unpacking their new console</a>, however they were unable to play it due to it requiring a day one update to function. Nintendo obviously didn't seem best pleased with this video making the rounds online, and soon removed the footage from the internet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
