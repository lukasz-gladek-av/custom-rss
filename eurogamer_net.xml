            <p>
Relaxing cleaning sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a> is getting a full-blown sequel, and it's due out this year. Eurogamer can also confirm the game will launch on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
PowerWash Simulator 2 will soak into PC via Steam, Epic Games Store and Windows Store, as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S at some point in 2025, with more details of the Switch 2 version to follow.
</p>
<p>
British studio FuturLab has come up with several major improvements for this new iteration, including four-player online co-op with shared progression, as well as a two-player local splitscreen option.

<p>
The game will also now feature a Central Homebase hub for your PowerWash business, which you can customise with various furnishings, and show off collectible rewards.
</p>
<p>
PowerWash Simulator 2 will feature a full new campaign, picking up where the original's truly wacky ending left off (no spoilers here, scrub). That means heading back to the filthy town of Muckingham and its surrounding Caldera County for more filth-ridden jobs.
</p>
<p>
These include a parade float, tram and teapot house, a quick initial look at the game has revealed. PowerWash Simulator 2's visuals have also clearly had a scrub up, and there's mention of a new soaping system where you can cover an area and quickly rinse away even the toughest grubbiness.
</p>
<p>There are "no plans" currently for a VR version, FuturLab told Eurogamer.</p>
<p>
FuturLab says more than 17 million players have played the original PowerWash Simulator to date, and experienced its relaxing gameplay and dopamine-inducing 'pings' when sections are complete. I can't wait for more.

<p>In Firefight Classic, you and a team of three others will do your utmost to last as long as you can against endless waves of increasingly difficult enemies. Five waves make up a round, and three rounds (plus a bonus round) make a set.</p>
<p>"You can keep the party going for as long as you want. No, really, you could keep the good times rolling with your squad into next week if you really wanted to! Or - at the end of a set - head to the exfiltration zone and end the match," <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/blue-team-operation-launch">proclaims the Halo Infinite team</a>.</p>
<p>"Try not to die, as lives are limited [there are a pool of seven lives], but you'll be able to earn them back by successfully completing a bonus round."</p>
<p>Many are quite excited by this mode's return, with jubilations such as "YES CLASSIC FIREFIGHT FINALLY" gracing the launch trailer's comments section. </p>
<p>If you are as excited as that there commenter, you can find full details on the <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/firefight-classic">dedicated Halo Infinite Firefight Classic blog post</a>.</p>
