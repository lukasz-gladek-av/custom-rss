            <p>
A high-profile mod that allows Bloodborne to run at 60fps has been hit by a legal takedown notification from PlayStation, its creator has said. 
</p>
<p>
Noted modder Lance McDonald revealed the legal request from Sony Interactive Entertainment today via a post on social media. 
</p>
<p>
The takedown specifically targets McDonald's famous Bloodborne patch that ups the game's frame-rate, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloodborne-modder-releases-60fps-patch">released back in early 2021</a>. It's unclear why PlayStation has finally decided to take action now, four years later.

"On 21st February 2021, I created and released a patch for Bloodborne which makes the game run at 60fps," McDonald wrote this afternoon.</p>
<p>"Today I received a DMCA takedown notification on behalf of Sony Interactive Entertainment asking that I remove links to the patch I posted on the internet, so I've now done so."

<p>Eurogamer has contacted PlayStation for comment.</p> <div>

McDonald first announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modder-plans-to-release-a-bloodborne-60fps-patch-but-will-give-sony-a-chance-to-go-first-on-ps5">plans to upgrade Bloodborne's frame-rate</a> by, essentially, hacking the game back in 2020. Initially, however, McDonald held off as hoped Sony would update FromSoftware's beloved Soulslike itself. 
</p>
<p>
However, Sony has never issued a 60fps patch for Bloodborne, or shown any inclination of wanting to do so. Infamously, there's been no word of a PS5 version of the game, either.
</p>
<p>
"There's a real opportunity here for a genuinely crowd-pleasing piece of back-compat magic from Sony," Digital Foundry's John Linneman wrote in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2020-bloodborne-60fps-hack-tested-the-complete-story">deep-dive into how the Bloodborne 60fps patch worked</a> with McDonald himself. "The question is whether the platform holder has any appetite at all to revisit the game."

<p>Consequently, from today, 31st January, you won't be able to buy any in-game currency, Gleamium, although you're welcome to keep spending what money you do have until the season is over.</p>
<p>The free-to-play game will also be pulled from Epic Games Store, Steam, and both the PlayStation and Microsoft stores in May, with season 5's new playable characters, DC’s Aquaman and Looney Tunes' Lola Bunny, still "earnable through gameplay".</p>
<p>Players who have deleted or uninstalled the game prior to the end of Season 5 will still be able to reinstall it after 30th May.</p>
<p>"We want to thank every player and person who has ever played or supported MultiVersus," the team wrote.</p>
<p>"All of us on the Player First Games and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a> teams have poured our heart and soul into this game. We will be forever grateful for the incredible support of the MultiVersus community throughout this journey."</p>
<p>The news follows the announcement that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Warner%20Bros.%20Games%20boss%20David%20Haddad%20departs%20following%20rocky%20period%20for%20publisher">Warner Bros.
