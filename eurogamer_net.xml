            <p>Careful, Doom fans - details of Doom: The Dark Ages have leaked ahead of its release next week.</p>
<p>As posted to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1kiyzhc/doom_the_dark_ages_screenshot_leak/">Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit</a>, some players have received their discs ahead of the 15th May street date, which means details are popping up all over the place now, including information about the plot, menus, combat, weapons, beastiary, and more.</p>

<p>"Hey dudes, I got lucky and got the [Collector's Edition on] the 8th and just finished this amazing game, what a trip. This will have spoilers, so it's up to you if you want to get spoiled," one player wrote, before individually linking dozens and dozens of screenshots with spoilers a-plenty.</p>
<p>The early shipping has also identified something else, too; it seems as though even with a physical disc, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1kighkz/doom_the_dark_ages_the_entire_game_in_the/">PS5 players have to be connected to the internet and download the entire game to their consoles</a> before they can play.</p>
<p>As reportedly verified by <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/369411/doom-the-dark-ages-z-haczykiem-w-wersji-pudelkowej-na-ps5-uzytkownik-ppe-pl-zdradza-istotny-szczegol.html">ppe.pl</a>, "the disc for Doom: The Dark Ages contains nothing but the data necessary to trigger a download of the game from the internet. This means PS5 owners hoping to step into the Doom Slayerâ€™s boots should be prepared to download over 80 GB - the full size of the game."</p>
<p>"Literal waste of materials," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1kighkz/comment/mrelxmr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">responded</a> one commenter. "This is just profoundly stupid."</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-review">Eurogamer's Doom: the Dark Ages review</a>, Chris D. awarded it four stars out of five, writing: "It's all so simple, so joyously, generously straight ahead. You're a powerful goody, you're surrounded by powerful baddies, and you have to finish them all off. Everyone knows where they stand, and they all seem pretty happy with the roles they're playing. And it's kind of lovely."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Amazon's hit Fallout show will run for five or six seasons.</p>
<p>That's according to actor Aaron Moten, who revealed in an interview at Comic Con Liverpool that when he signed on for the role of Maximus, he was told to expect the show to run for "five, six" seasons in total.</p>

<p>"When I signed on to do the series, we would have a starting point, and they gave me the end point," Moten explained (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-tv-show-six-five-seasons-of-story-planned/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>"That endpoint hasn't changed, but it is season five, season six, type of endpoint. We've always known that we're going to take our time with the development of the characters."</p>
<p>Given Fallout's rich lore across several games, this may not be a complete surprise, but it's good news nonetheless, as it assures Fallout fans that the show was created with longevity in mind.</p>

            <p>What had been a closed beta test for Funcom's upcoming Dune Awakening is now available to everyone who has pre-ordered the game, not just those lucky enough to have bagged a code.</p>
<p>In a message posted to social media, Funcom confirmed that has "had heard [the] feedback" from fans surprised a pre-order wasn't enough to secure a beta key, and now anyone who has ordered the MMO "can now also access the beta" which is live now and due to close tomorrow, Monday 12th May.</p>

<p>"We heard your feedback on this, "the studio said. "If you already own or decide to pre-order any of the editions this weekend, you should now also see a Beta Weekend product in your Steam library. You might need to restart your Steam client to see the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> Beta Weekend app."</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening has been in closed beta for over a year now, but with its full release now looming following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-delayed-for-last-minute-changes-from-beta-testers">brief delay</a>, this final, large-scale beta blowout will run from 9th-12th May. The studio is calling it Dune: Awakening's "largest beta yet... with a huge number of new players joining compared to previous closed betas".</p>
<p>It's likely the studio acquisced after players on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1kfzht6/have_people_been_informed_that_they_are_in_the/">game's subreddit and Discord complained</a> about not getting access to the latest beta despite having pre-ordered the MMO.</p>

<p>"If we see that weâ€™re nearing capacity, we will be able to spin up more. This is not our first rodeo, weâ€™ve launched several MMOs and survival games over the past 25 years, and we have a robust set of tools and processes in place, managed by an experienced live operations team."</p>
