            <p>
You can always count on Pyschonauts studio Double Fine to do something unexpected, and hot off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/keeper-review">last year's magical lighthouse adventure Keeper</a>, the team has unveiled its latest oddity, Kiln: a pottery themed party brawler making its way to Xbox Series X/S, PC, Game Pass, and PS5 this "spring".
</p>
<p>
In Kiln, players - in the role of a tiny spirit - must first create a pot from scratch before they're able to inhabit it, using an "easy and accessible" control scheme to quickly mold a lump of clay into the pot of their dreams. The idea is the shape and size of the pot they create will impact their abilities in the team-based multiplayer portion of the game.

<figcaption>Here's Kiln's announcement trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C11Zmc93-I" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
In order to keep things balanced, though, pots sizes are limited to one of three weight classes: little pots are fast, while big pots are slow, with medium pots sitting somewhere in between. Additionally, Kiln features eight available shapes - including bottles, cups, and bowls - each with a unique special move, basic attack, and air attack. Cylinders, for instance, can slam the ground hammer-style, while plates can trick-shot and ricochet off enemies. And on top of those basic building blocks, pots can be personalised with glazes, patterns, stickers, and handles before going in the oven.
</p><p>
From there, it's off to The Wedge, which serves as a social hub for players between matches - and when it's time for battle to commence, participants can choose between a variety of modes and obstacle-strewn maps, the latter all inspired by ancient Greek or ancient Egyptian gods. At launch, Quench mode will be the focus, challenging two teams of four to jostle across the play space and put out their opponent's kiln while protecting their own. That's where pot size becomes relevant again, given a pot's capacity determines how much water they can hold - although, as <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/kiln-developer-direct-double-fine-hands-on-preview/">explained over on Xbox Wire</a>, greater capacity is balanced by less health.
</p>
<p>
And once a battle is over and a victor has been secured, it's back to The Wedge, where players can use their winnings to purchase the likes of trinkets and stickers to decorate their pots from the in-game store.
</p>
<p>
If that's got your curiosity piqued, you'll be able to fire up Kiln when it launches for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC (including Steam), and Game Pass this "spring".

            <p>A release window for Fable has just been announced at the Xbox Developer Direct.</p>
<p>Following a new gameplay deep dive, it was revealed Fable will be releasing in Autumn 2026 on the Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.</p>
<p>In addition, Playground Games presented a bunch of info about its first open world RPG. Apparently being packed with not only British humour, but also chickens and more, you start off in Fable as a child and the first hero in Albion in a generation.</p>
<p>Tragedy strikes as the village is turned to stone (including your nan), thus kicking off your adventure. Multiple regions in Fable were briefly shown off, including Bowerstone! This classic Fable city is returning in ample size, which is very exciting.</p>

<p>Strength, Skill, and Will returns at the core of the combat system, including a variety of weapon types that'll let you engage in fights the way you desire. Ranged and magic attacks are back too, filling distinct purposes in clashes with a range of new and returning enemy types.</p><p>Yes, you can marry people and have kids too, just like in the older games. You can buy houses and businesses too and horde your wealth. This is powered by what Playground is dubbing the Living Population system. There are more than 1,000 of them, they can all be spoken and interacted with, and their lives are impacted by your actions.</p>
<p>This ties into a reputation system, as well as a morality system too. Instead of a black-and-white morality system, this new Fable appears to be taking a more complicated approach to the actions you take. So if you're rich and buy lots of stuff, some folks will dig that and others certainly won't.</p>
<p>You can also kill Dave, played by Richard Ayoade, after he turns into a giant. His corpse will stick around in the world permanently, and will bring down house prices in the area. His sister also won't like you!</p>

            <p>It's a big day for Xbox fans, with Microsoft finally offering a closer look at some of its most anticipated titles, courtesy of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-developer-direct-2026-everything-announced">first Developer Direct of the year.</a> And that began with a fresh peek at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>, bringing word of a 19th May release date on PC and Xbox, with a PS5 launch coming later this year.</p>
<p>For this latest entry in the world-hopping racing series, developer Playground Games is shifting the action to Japan, with the studio calling Forza Horizon 6's open-world map  the "largest" it's created for the series so far. It's said to reflect the country's diversity with areas both rural and urban, modern and traditional. It's also described as being "full of verticality", featuring roads inspired by the likes of C1 Loop, Gingko Avenue, and mountain passes including Mount Haruna and Bandai-Azuma.</p>

<figcaption>Forza Horizon 6 gameplay trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG1Ll2CVhug" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>It also features <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a>'s "biggest urban area yet", with Tokyo City said to be five times larger than anything seen in the series so far. It also includes multiple districts, each with their own identity. And as players explore the world, they'll be able to collect cars, houses, landmarks, and mascots, all tracked in their Adventure Journal.</p><p>In terms of progression, players start Forza Horizon 6 as tourists who, after passing qualifiers, will slowly rise through the ranks by completing races in faster cars and unlocking new wristbands. In order to move up, they'll need to participate in "spectacular" events, including classic showcase events and "thrilling" new Rush obstacles courses. And once they've finally unlocked their gold wristband, they'll gain access to Legend Island, featuring exclusive events, tracks, and areas to explore.</p>
<p>Playground says Forza Horizon 6 will feature over 550 cars at launch - ranging from classic cars to the series' latest cover vehicle, the GR GT - bringing new body kits, new Forza Aero, and the ability to paint liveries on windows. The studio also says it's better balanced its roster across all performance classes, from D to the new R Class, which is designed for track-focused cars. There's also talk of better vehicle audio and improvements to how cars are affected by the world - including new cosmetic tire wear.</p>
<p>Cars, once acquired, can be stored in Forza Horizon 6's new customisable garages (available at every player house), which can be freely decorated and have space for multiple cars. This latest game also marks the debut of The Estate, a huge mountain valley expanse where players can freely build and decorate their own abode - which is permanent and visitable by friends.</p>
<p>Speaking of pals, players can now attend open-world car meets, where they're able to show off cars and characters, download tunes and liveries, or buy copies of any car they see. And from here, they can set out to explore the world with others, playing street races or new nighttime Touge battles, which see players racing down mountain passes. Other new social events include Horizon Time Attack Circuits - accessed seamlessly as part of the world, with no loading or matchmaking.</p>

<p>And that's almost everything announced so far, with Playground wrapping things with a few words on accessibility features, all of which will be carried over from previous games. That's on top of a few new additions, including a customisable high-contrast mode, a proximity radar, and auto-drive for those wanting to sit back and soak up the sights without touching the wheel.</p>
<p>So to recap: Forza Horizon 6 launches 19th May on Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass, with a Playstation 5 release due later this year.</p>
