            <p>Epic Games has announced that Sidekicks are coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, little pets that you can bring with you into the battle royale as well as other in-game experiences within the Fortnite platform.</p>
<p>These sidekicks are essentially another form of cosmetic that players can earn and, of course, buy. They are customisable, and can even be given cute little accessories. The first sidekick to come to the game is Peels, a small yellow banana dog who'll be present in the next battle pass starting the 1st November.</p>
<p>If you're not feeling Peels, there's another bunch coming in November as part of the in-game shop. This includes Bonesy, Spike, and Lil-Raptor. Epic Games has also teased that some type of cat sidekick is set to come to Fortnite in the near future too, so there should be plenty of options. And that’s before we get to the inevitable IP tie-in stuff that’ll be sure to rear its head in the future.</p>

<figcaption>Here's a new tutorial video for the sidekicks coming to Fortnite.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N0m9H13pGM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Sidekicks do not provide any in-game advantage, though they can be interacted with thanks to new sidekick emotes coming to Fornite. They also can "react to the world around you", though how exactly that works remains a mystery as of writing.</p><p>One quirk of the sidekick features is that a sidekick can only be customised one time after they're acquired, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/fortnite-battle-royale-c-202300000001636/gameplay-c-202300000001721/how-do-i-customize-the-appearance-of-my-sidekick-a202300000021343">as declared on the Epic Games help website</a>. You can, however, buy the same sidekick multiple times, and can own several copies of the same sidekick as long as their customisation options are different. So, for example, you can own one red Lil Raptor, and one green Lil Raptor. You cannot own two green Lil Raptors.</p>
<p>Who doesn't love pets in video games? Even if they are just cosmetics when you really think about it, a little fella running alongside you, doing tricks or dancing on command? It's a surefire way to please people, and on Epic's part, a nice way of tempting folks to spend a little extra this month on Fortnite.</p>

            <p>Amid Nintendo's ongoing patent infringement lawsuit against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a>, the company's initial efforts to patent a variety of Pokémon-style monster capture and throwing mechanics in Japan have been rejected.</p>
<p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">launched its controversial lawsuit against Palworld maker Pocketpair</a> last year following the game's<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-reaches-25m-players-in-first-month"> wildly successful launch</a>, accusing the studio of infringing  "multiple" patents. At the time, it said it was seeking an injunction and compensation for damages. In response, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-vows-to-fight-nintendo-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-fans-and-indie-developers">vowed to fight the legal action</a>, saying it wanted to ensure small studios could not be "hindered or discouraged from pursuing creative ideas".</p>
<p>Throughout all this, it remained unclear exactly what patents Nintendo was accusing Palworld of infringing, although evidence unearthed by legal observers suggested the lawsuit primarily<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-looks-to-hinge-on-pokeball-patent"> hinged on Pokémon's ball-throwing and creature catching mechanics</a>. Notably, one of the patents Nintendo appeared to be pinning its legal hopes on wasn't filed until <em>after</em> PalWorld's release - albeit appended to a pre-existing "parent" patent filed in December 2021. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/exceedingly-plausible-nintendo-crafted-patent-claims-to-specifically-target-palworld-says-ip-expert">one IP expert observed</a> at the time, it was "exceedingly plausible" Nintendo had crafted the patent application to specifically target Palworld.</p>
<p>Speculation Pokémon's Pokéball mechanics lay at the heart of Nintendo's lawsuit <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">appeared to be confirmed last December</a> when Pocketpair released an update to remove Palworld's Pokéball-style summoning mechanic. It later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-says-pokemon-lawsuit-will-prompt-more-disappointing-changes-as-it-continues-to-dispute-claims">removed a gliding mechanic</a>, saying it had to make "yet another compromise" due to the lawsuit. Since then, Palworld lawyers have argued, among other things, that the continued existence of games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a> - which all feature similar mechanics to those Nintendo wishes to patent - invalidates the company's efforts, and Pocketpair has continued to assert the "invalidity of the patents in question". And it now appears Japan's patent office agrees - in part and for now at least - with that stance.</p><p>As <a href="https://gamesfray.com/japan-patent-office-rejects-nintendo-application-relevant-to-palworld-dispute-cites-games-like-ark-as-prior-art-after-third-party-submission/">reported by GamesFray</a>, the Japan Patent Office has now rejected an application (specifically application no. 2024-031879) filed by Nintendo in March last year which attempts to patent certain capture and item-throwing mechanics. According to the machine translated rejection notice, the patent will not be granted in its current form as the "claimed invention(s) could have easily been made by persons who have common knowledge in the technical field to which the claimed invention(s) pertains", given evidence the "invention(s)" already existed "in Japan or other foreign countries prior to the filing of the patent application".</p>
<p>The rejection notice then highlights documentation provided by an unnamed third-party pointing to instances of similar mechanics existing prior to the filing in games such as Monster Hunter 4, Ark: Survival Evolved, Pocketpair's own Craftopia, and even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>. However, as GamesFray notes, the rejection isn't final, and Nintendo may still choose to amend its application in order to sway the patent examiner. It also stresses a final rejection of the application would have no "direct impact" on the Palworld lawsuit given patent office decisions are non-binding. That doesn't necessarily leave Nintendo in the clear, however; GamesFray says Japanese judges "tend to have respect for the determinations made by patent examiners".</p>
<p>Of course, Nintendo finds itself in an entirely different position in the US, where it was recently granted a patent covering gameplay mechanics relating to the summoning of a sub-character to let it fight another. Eurogamer spoke to legal experts at the time to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-nintendos-potentially-industry-changing-new-monster-battling-patent-enforceable-we-asked-some-lawyers">find out how enforceable that patent actually is</a>.</p>

            <p>Arc Raiders has surpassed a peak concurrent player count of 250,000 on Steam, only a day after its release. This makes it the most popular Steam release for a PvP extraction shooter to date.</p>
<p>The game in its opening hour<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-online-connection-error-launch-server-problem"> attracted over 130,000+ concurrent players yesterday</a>, itself an impressive figure for a new IP. It beats out the Steam release of games like <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2016590/charts/">Dark and Darker</a>, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2507950/charts/">Delta Force</a>, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2073620/charts/">Arena Breakout: Infinite</a>, and <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/594650/charts/">Hunt: Showdown 1886</a>. It is of course worth noting this doesn't take into account console users, nor games like Dark and Darker that released first on different PC clients.</p>
<p>This figure nonetheless sets the bar high for the upcoming Steam release of Escape from Tarkov, arguably the most popular extraction shooter, which is set to arrive as a major competitor to Arc Raiders on the 15th November.</p>

<p>With players flocking to the game, some interesting quirks are being discovered as of writing. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-arc-raiders-one-of-the-most-pleasant-multiplayer-shooter-experiences-on-the-market-early-adopters-seem-to-think-so">This includes the surprising level of kindness on display from random players found out in the world</a>, something that has caught many players off-guard.</p>
<p>If you've not had a chance to check out Arc Raiders yet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-40-hours-and-counting-arc-raiders-has-me-convinced-extraction-shooters-are-brilliant">why not read Eurogamer's preview</a>, in which the game is described as: "Arc Raiders is, simply put, a third-person extraction shooter. It is a factory that mass produces tense moments, by its own nature a source of intense anxiety: high stakes, devastating losses, rapturous victories. Pulling back, it's a game of gradual self-refinement, both of your inventory full of resources and your characters abilities, and likewise your own know-how."</p>
