            <p>The Long Dark's final episode, Episode Five, is the "largest episode to date", featuring "between two to three times as much cinematic and story content" as preceding episode Four and about "three-to-four times as big".</p>
<p>Addressing fans in a lengthy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/305620/view/512956388211687524?l=english">Steam update</a>, Hinterland founder and creative director, Raphael van Lierop said the team "won't be sharing much detail about the episode until he first teaser", but it includes "quite a few systems we haven't used in other episodes".</p>
<p>"We know many of you - like us - have been waiting for years for this story to be completed. And once it's done, we can never go back. So that's really on our minds. The episode can't just be good; it has to be great," van Lierop added.</p>

<p>"There are a lot of story threads to tie up across all the episodes, to wrap up the Wintermute storyline, but also to set the stage for the future of The Long Dark, so we have to take you to several different places and hear from a lot of new people," the director added (thanks, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/305620/view/512956388211687524?l=english">PC Gamer</a>). "Because of what the story needs, we've focused on narrative more than we have traditionally, and the mission flow for Episode Five is probably more linear than previous episodes as a result."</p>
<p>There will be "many" new locations - "everything in the episode is new to the game and the world, so these will all be places you’ve never seen before" - and as "this final episode of the story has you playing as both Mackenzie and Astrid, you'll also be seeing some of the key characters from previous episodes, so...there's a lot!"</p>
<p>"We're also using new motion-capture tech for our team, to attempt to deliver an ever higher bar for story delivery than we have achieved so far," he added. "These are all things that exist outside the context of Survival Mode, although some of the work in Tales helped set the foundation of some of the things we're attempting in Episode Five.</p>
<p>"I can confidently say that Episode Five will be the most ambitious thing we've done on The Long Dark at Hinterland to date. I know that won't mean much to you until you have it in your hands, but hopefully that gives you some sense of the ambition behind the episode."</p>
<p>The update also confirmed that Tales from the Far Territory expansion is now complete, further visual enhancements are being trialled with the test team, with improvements to shadows, fog, anisotropic filtering, enhanced draw distances, terrain blending, motion blur, and more on the way, albeit "mainly apply to high-end PCs or the top-end consoles".</p>
<p>There'll also be an update for PlayStation and Xbox players in mid-late June.</p>
<p>Nearly a year after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-long-dark-dev-teases-unannounced-survival-game-that-might-just-be-the-long-dark-2">teasing</a> an 'unannounced survival game' that looked suspiciously like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-long-dark">The Long Dark</a> 2, developer Hinterland's has officially unveiled its snowy survival sequel. It's called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/snowy-survival-game-the-long-dark-is-heading-to-the-city-in-sequel-blackfrost">Blackfrost: The Long Dark 2 and it's coming to Steam early access in 2026</a>.</p>
<p>While our first tease of The Long Dark 2 in January didn't go much beyond a slow pan across a slightly ramshackle room, Hinterland's The Game Awards <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIAiNhlghY4">announcement trailer</a> shows considerably more, with the wilderness action of its predecessor now expanded to cover towns and even cities gripped by the apocalyptic winter.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Fallout creator Tim Cain has revealed that he was "ordered to destroy" all of his notes, code, and prototypes from his days at Fallout's original developer and publisher, Interplay, and as a result, no original source code or assets remain.</p>
<p>Making the admission on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F707wIeTX2g">new YouTube video</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/fallout-creator-tim-cain-says-he-was-ordered-to-destroy-his-personal-archive-of-the-rpgs-development-individuals-and-organizations-actively-work-against-preservation/">GR+</a>), Cain explained that he was told to destroy everything after he left the Fallout studio, having been told that the studio would "be the archive keeper".</p>
<p>Cain later learned, however, that it "lost it".</p>

<p>"There's a lot of organisations out there that demand to be the archive keeper, and then they do a terrible job at it," Cain said. "They lose the assets they were in charge of keeping. This has happened multiple times in my career.</p>
<p>"When I left Fallout, I was told 'you have to destroy everything you have', and I did. My entire archive. Early design notes, code for different versions, prototypes, all the GURPS code – gone.</p>
<p>"When they finally, a few years after I left, contacted me and said 'oops, we lost it' I thought they were trapping me into 'we're going to sue you if you say you have it.' Turns out, no, they really lost it."</p>
<p>Cain said the experience shows why programs like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-announces-preservation-program-aims-to-maintain-game-compatibility-with-modern-and-future-systems">GOG's preservation work</a> are so important.</p>
<p>"Individuals and organisations actively work against preservation," Cain added. "The amount of stuff that's been lost about Fallout and its early development saddens me. I had it. I had that in digital form and was ordered to destroy it.</p>
<p>"So many other games that came out in the '70s, and '80s and '90s - the code is gone. The art assets are gone. Sure, you can try to crack open the databases and pull out those things, but you're only getting the final stuff. You're not getting the original source code or art[work]. I think it's even happening for the '00s and the '10s and probably now in the '20s. Stuff is being lost."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-creator-tim-cain-is-a-big-fan-of-the-tv-show">Cain has plenty of praise for Amazon's TV adaptation</a>, saying of the show: "They had huge sets with amazing production values on them... Amazing props. The acting was phenomenal. It was just surreal to watch Fallout recreated in real life like that."</p>

            <p>The fifth and final season of Netflix's live-action The Witcher show is in production, and we've finally had a peek at Liam Hemsworth in the titular role.</p>
<p>The Witcher and House of the Dragon site, <a href="https://redanianintelligence.com/2025/04/26/first-look-at-geralt-in-the-witcher-season-5-exclusive/">Redanian Intelligence</a>, which shared the shot, said it's been "quite a trick" getting a shot of the actual Hemsworth, as he has had two body doubles popping up on location in the UK, too, often confusing onlookers.</p>

<p>As the fourth season hasn't yet aired, it's hard to know where, exactly, in Geralt's chronology we find him, but the sword on his back suggests it's after he was gifted the blade from Zoltan, which has yet to happen on the show.</p>
<p>As the location is "filled with beehives and beekeepers", some think this could be a scene from Andrzej Sapkowski’s Tower of the Swallow, where Geralt encounters beekeepers who direct him to druids. Druid costumes spotted on set seem to strengthen the theory.</p> <div>

<p>The shots also evidence that Hemsworth stuck around to reprise The Witcher role for the final season after assuming it from Henry Cavill, who bowed out of the show at the end of season three. For more shots of Hemsworth - albeit all mainly in the same position and wearing the same costume - head on over to <a href="https://redanianintelligence.com/2025/04/26/first-look-at-geralt-in-the-witcher-season-5-exclusive/">Redanian Intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>In related news about the game, we recently learned CD Projekt Red has recast <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>'s Ciri. Whilst originally it only sounded as though the character's original actor, Jo Wyatt, had been replaced in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">Witcher 4's reveal trailer</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-the-witcher-4s-ciri-has-been-recast">development studio has now confirmed it</a>, albeit without expanding on why Berkeley had been brought in to replace Wyatt.</p>
<p>Last week, CD Projekt <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-beta-test-invites-a-scam-cd-projekt-warns">warned fans of a The Witcher 4 beta test "scam"</a>, saying it's "been taking the necessary steps to take this fraudulent messaging down".</p>
<p>The studio shared its warning to the Witcher community in a statement posted to social media, writing, "Recently, we've been getting reports from some community members that they've been invited to a beta test of The Witcher 4 - this is a scam!"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty</a> fan had a run-in with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) after trying to get a "replica explosive device" Monkey Bomb onto a plane in the US earlier this year.</p>
<p>The figurine - styled on the in-game version which is used to distract enemies - was showcased online after the organisation shared a number of its more memorable contraband seizes on social media.</p>

<p>"Our officers at Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) had a 'What the frag?!?' moment when they discovered this replica explosive device in a passenger's checked bag," the TSA quipped in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1202998258156542">Facebook post</a>, sharing an image that appears to show a phone holder and charger (thanks, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-fan-runs-into-tsa-by-trying-to-take-monkey-bomb-on-plane-3185682/">Dexerto</a>).</p>
<p>"This monkey may rack up points in a game, but in real life, leave the gear for your loadout screen, not your baggage. Replica weapons and explosives, no matter how cool or collectible, aren't allowed in either carry-on or checked baggage."</p>
<p>The post racked up thousands of responses, with many taking umbrage with the organisation's decision to seize it.</p>
<p>"So basically, you took a child's toy. If it's not real, did you only take it to post on Facebook?" asked one.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Activision confirmed it was amending crossplay functionality in Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Season 3 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-will-allow-players-to-turn-off-crossplay-in-an-effort-to-limit-cheating">to allow players to restrict matchmaking to consoles only</a>. Effectively, this means console players can turn off crossplay with PC players across all the game's major multiplayer modes in an effort to limit cheating.</p>
<p>While removing crossplay was already available in the game's ranked modes, the new options will extend this to all multiplayer modes.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
