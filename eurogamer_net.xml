Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii - the swashbuckling new instalment in Sega's long-running crime saga - is getting a New Game Plus as part of a free post-launch update.
</p>
<p>
Sega shared the news during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viAEO_cMqfU">15-minute Like a Dragon Direct showcase</a> focusing on the imminent Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. It marks a notable shift in strategy for the publisher, after last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a> caused controversy among fans by making New Game Plus exclusive to its pricier Deluxe and Ultimate Editions.
</p>
<p>
Sega hasn't said much else about Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii's newly announced New Game Plus mode just yet, only that it'll arrives as part of a "post release patch" at some unspecified point following the game's launch on 21st February.

Elsewhere in today's Like a Dragon stream, developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio dove a little deeper into some of Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii's systems, offering a closer look at the likes of land and sea combat, ship customisation, crew building, side activities, and more.
</p><p>
Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii  - which charts the swashbuckling adventures of fan-favourite series regular Goro Majima after he wakes up with amnesia on the remote Rich Island - will be available for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on 21st February.
</p>
<p>
Alongside the £54.99 standard edition, Sega's releasing a £64.99 Deluxe Edition featuring the Legendary Pirate Crew Pack, Legendary Outfit Pack, Ship Customisation Pack, and Extra Karaoke &amp; CD Pack.

Six minutes of developer Splash Damage's unreleased <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/transformers-reactivate">Transformers: Reactivate</a> have leaked online following the studio's announcement it was ending development earlier this week.
</p>
<p>
Transformers: Reactivate - an online action game for up to four players, featuring some of the franchise's most iconic characters - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/brink-developer-splash-damage-developing-transformers-reactivate">unveiled for PC and consoles</a> during The Game Awards back in 2022. Little has been seen of the title since then - and it seemed that would likely remain the case after Splash Damage this week confirmed its cancellation.
</p>
<p>
Now, however, six minutes of leaked gameplay footage has appeared on social media, shared by an <a href="https://x.com/DpzLuna/status/1877095975665242277">anonymous Transformers fan account</a>. There's no word on how the footage was acquired, but it features a combination of third-person gunplay and vehicular traversal across an unfinished, open-world style city - seemingly from a work-in-progress developer build.

Splash Damage <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splash-damage-cancels-transformers-reactivate-says-roles-at-risk-of-redundancy">announced Transformers: Reactivate's cancellation on Wednesday</a>, saying the studio would be "scaling down" in order to refocus its efforts on other projects - leaving a "number of roles" at the company "potentially at risk of redundancy" as a result.
</p><p>
"While not being able to see the game through to release is painful," it wrote in a statement, "having to say goodbye to friends and colleagues hurts even more. We're now focused on doing everything we can to support them through this tough period, just as we are committed to caring for those who will stay with us as we build a stronger Splash Damage for the future."
</p>
<p>
The studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/brink-dev-splash-damage-teases-aaa-open-world-survival-game-project-astrid">previously announced</a> it was working on a new "AAA open-world survival game", codenamed Project Astrod, in collaboration with streamers Mike "Shroud" Grzesiek and Chris "Sacriel" Ball. However, no further updates have been shared since its unveiling in March 2023.
