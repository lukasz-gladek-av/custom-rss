            <p>Patrick Söderlund – founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> studio, Embark – has been appointed as executive chairman at Nexon to "accelerate global strategy, transform creative direction, and lead the next phase of growth" for its parent company.</p>
<p>Fresh from the success of Arc Raiders, Söderlund will now be working "closely with [Nexon] CEO Junghun Lee and the executive leadership team", setting the "strategic direction" that Lee will then implement.</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear if this position comes in addition to Söderlund's already pretty meaty role leading Embark – which is owned by Nexon – or is in place of it, but it appears to be the former.</p>

<p>"Nexon has all the assets to unleash dramatic growth – incredibly talented people, iconic franchises, large and committed player communities, and best-in-class live service capabilities," Söderlund said via a press statement.</p>
<p>"This is an enormous opportunity, but one that will require deep focus and discipline. [Nexon CEO] Junghun and I are aligned on what needs to happen, and I'm ready to get to work."</p>
<p>It's a huge appointment for Nexon, which – although bobbing along just fine with its immensely popular mobile titles like MapleStory – has failed to get a bite of the live-service sector, and chiefly dabbled in casual and mobile gaming until subsidiary Mintrocket released the hugely successful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a> in 2023. It also published Embark Studios' inaugural title, The Finals, that same year, and the middling The First Descendant in 2024.</p>
<p>As we reported earlier this week, Arc Raiders continues to impress, nearing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-had-nearly-1000000-concurrent-players-last-month-and-thats-on-pc-alone">almost 1m concurrent players </a>on PC alone and pushing onwards with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-shared-watch-event-rewards-pve">events</a> and regular updates <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/roadmap-january-april-2026">planned out until April</a>.</p>
<p>It has also started to grapple with the consequences of that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-latest-duplication-glitch-has-players-placing-hundreds-of-ziplines-and-trigger-nades-and-safe-to-say-its-scaring-everyone-i-hope-this-gets-addressed-soon/">massive duplication glitch</a> that allowed cheeky players to double anything they were holding in their hands, confirming it has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embark-studios-details-actions-against-exploits-and-glitches-abusers">finished a large investigation into how the recent exploits and glitches</a> came to be and how to deal with offenders now and in the future.</p>

            <p>The developers of Mewgenics, the cat breeding indie hit from the creators of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a> and The End is Nigh, are "getting a little bit excited" about what's next for the hit roguelike.</p>
<p>Though the team had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-dlc-is-coming-but-dont-expect-it-any-time-soon">already confirmed that Mewgenics DLC was planned</a> (a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-console-release-for-steams-cat-breeding-roguelike-hit-mewgenics-is-currently-in-the-works">console version is also on the cards</a>), this is the first insight we've had about any additional content since the turn-based strategy game released earlier this month.</p>

<p>"Edmund and I have been discussing and mapping out what we want to do for DLC 1, and I gotta say I'm getting a little bit excited about it," Tyler Glaiel wrote on X/Twitter as the patch notes went live, detailing a raft of QoL changes, bug fixes, and more.</p>
<p>However, when a fan suggested that the duo should "really think about doing some UI touch up", Glaiel warned it wasn't that easy.</p> <div>

<p>"We're gonna be pretty careful about stuff like that because a lot of the requests are people not quite understanding the tradeoffs we had to make during dev regarding complexity," he <a href="https://x.com/TylerGlaiel/status/2025023674508869764">explained</a>. "Some stuff is in the works, though."</p>
<p>Last week, Mewgenics broke a rather impressive Steam record, welcoming 115,428 concurrent players on Steam, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-sets-huge-steam-concurrent-player-record-taking-a-crown-previously-worn-by-hades-2">meaning it now boasts the highest concurrent player count of any roguelike on Steam <em>of all time</em></a>.</p>
<p>If you are one of the many already playing Mewgenics on Steam, be sure to check out our guides. Here is one on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/best-mewgenics-classes-tier-list-how-to-unlock">best Mewgenics classes tier list and how to unlock every class</a> to get you started. As for those aforementioned patch notes? Here you go:</p>
<blockquote><h2>MEWGENICS 1.0.20695</h2>
<ul>
<li>This patch is focused on major bug fixes and "easy" changes that are unlikely to cause secondary issues</li>
</ul>
<h3>QOL Changes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Coin/Food/Item zoomers no longer prevent you from opening the backpack while they're animating</li>
<li>Added "Limit Framerate" to video settings.</li>
<li>"Tall" tiles now go semi-transparent when in tactical view</li>
<li>Fixed item sort order upon returning from an adventure (one of the last changes pre-release was adding sort buttons to the in-combat inventory screen and this broke how they sorted upon returning home)</li>
<li>If playing on steam deck, End Turn (Hotkey) is now bound to "Enter Key" by default instead of nothing. Should allow for some steam input config hacks for those who want to bind it to a back button easier.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Copy Cat / Learn From Me being able to copy things other than spells in some cases</li>
<li>Fixed Tina3's Mama Maggot and Familiar Korbee not having a portrait</li>
<li>Fixed a certain very late game boss fight's summons running away when the boss died. In this particular case they weren't supposed to run</li>
<li>Fixed a few cases where an ability or passive icon in the UI would not update after being overridden by a new one (ex when using a Forbidden spell while already having 2 disorders)</li>
<li>Fixed a minor odds issue related to how Stimulation affects a parent with a class passive but not a class active</li>
<li>Fixed level spawn order to spawn static objects before familiars (This should fix a few cases where a familiar occupies a space a static object wants to be, causing it to spawn in a different place and sometimes blocking cats or enemies in)</li>
<li>Fixed Eat Rock and Rock Crusher showing a tooltip for Petrify</li>
<li>New idle animation for pet rock and pet boulder and fixed death gib</li>
<li>Fixed the way Interchange interacts with Bonus Move and Bonus Attack</li>
<li>Fixed a case where quitting after losing your last cat to a sacrifice event would cause a crash upon re-loading the save file</li>
<li>Fixed a few flickering pieces in a cutscene</li>
<li>Fixed amoebas being able to drop larger rocks partially off-map</li>
<li>fixed a very late game enemy leaving an invisible corpse</li>
<li>fixed Unscarred+ and Uncapped HP causing infinitely growing HP</li>
<li>lowered the odds of seeing a variant version of one act 3 miniboss</li>
<li>Added "texture_atlas_size" to settings file to allow for some configuration hacks for under-min-spec machines. Default is 4096. Note that lowering this will also require lowering "texture_scale_big" as well so larger textures can fit into the atlas. This will remain settings-file-only, no intent to add this to the options menu</li>
<li>Misc localisation fixes</li>
</ul></blockquote>
