            <p>The PlayStation published <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> made its way onto PC last night, and has got off to a very good start indeed.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?compare=1151640,1659420,1817070,1817190,1888930,2322010,2531310,2561580,2651280,3489700">SteamDB</a>, Stellar Blade has already welcomed a peak player count of 99,980, less than 24 hours since its release on PC. This means it currently has the highest peak concurrent player count for a PlayStation published single player game on the platform.</p>
<p>To compare, Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered has a peak player count of 66,436, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Complete Edition has a peak of 56,557. Meanwhile, The Last of Us Part 1 has a peak of 36,496 and its sequel - The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered - has a peak of 30,690.</p>

<p>As for what players are saying, right now Stellar Blade is sitting quite happily with an "overwhelmingly positive" Steam review average. "In a world full of unoptimised slop it really is great to see a game run so smoothly," reads one such review.</p>
<p>So, yes, things are going well for Stellar Blade's PC release. Back in February of this year, Shift Up stated in a financial report it expects <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-pc-sales-expected-to-exceed-console-says-shift-up">the PC version to exceed console sales</a>.</p>
<p>"In the AAA game market, PC devices have a higher market share than consoles, so we expect the performance of the PC version to exceed that of the console version," the company said at the time. "We are particularly observing trends such as the significant expansion of the single-player action game market in the Asian gaming industry."</p>

<p>Not sure if the game is for you? In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">Eurogamer's original Stellar Blade review</a> we noted it "has a fair bit of weirdness", but " its killer tunes and vibey, flow-state combat - plus a transformative hard mode - are enough to leave you entranced".
