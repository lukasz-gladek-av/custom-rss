            <p>Nothing spreads the festive cheer quite like spooky things, right? Well, ok, I can think of a few other things that are probably higher up the festive list, but for Megabonk fans, spooky is what's on the cards.</p>
<p>Megabonk's "Spooky Update" was initially meant to arrive on a smaller scale around Hallowe'en, but solo developer Vedinad decided they wanted "to make it bigger", and as things grew, naturally so did the work involved. Anyway, while later than first intended, the spooky update for Megabonk is now here.</p>
<p>As for what it includes, along with some general bug fixes such as the Giant Fork's Megacrit not working as intended, this update also adds new items, a new character and a new map.</p>

<p>You can check out the full patch notes for Megabonk's Spooky Update, as shared by Vedinad, below:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>New Content</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New Map</li>
<li>New Character</li>
<li>New Weapon</li>
<li>New Items</li>
<li>New Enemies and Bosses</li>
<li>New Achievements and challenges</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Game</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Made a lot of improvements to FPS late-game</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bugs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where Giant Fork's Megacrit didn't work</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you could buy items you didnt have unlocked</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Frost Walker reset opacity when changing attack speed</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Holy Book was not affected by Particle Opacity</li>
<li>Fixed weird text popup when trying to microwave an item that has already hit its max cap (for example Overpowered Lamp)</li>
<li>Fixed a "bug" where you could just use the full map on the Blind Challenge</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you could reset as you teleported to the next stage to keep your progress and not move to the next stage</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you got an error if you banished every item except one in a specific rarity and then talked to a shady guy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Settings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New Game Setting: Advanced Settings - Will enable certain settings that most players don't need to use. This is disabled by default to avoid making the settings cluttered for new players.</li>
<li>New Game Setting: Shrine Counter -&gt; Shows you how many of each shrine is available, and how many you have used</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Show HUD -&gt; Shwo or hide the HUD</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Skip Chest Animation -&gt; Skips the chest animation. Note: You won't be able to banish items from chests if you use this setting.</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Skip Portal Animation -&gt; Skips portal spawn animation (on stage 1)</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Enable Silver Pots -&gt; Enable / Disable silver pots (Ghost Item in shambles if you do this)</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Show Item Feed -&gt; Show what items you picked up in a feed at the left side of the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Balancing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tried to fix the "caveman" bug / exploit where you could hide in caves and enemies wouldn't be able to spawn close to you or reach you</li>
<li>Increased Diceheads passive minimum reward potential (0.02 -&gt; 0.04). Basically his late level up rewards will be twice as high, surely won't be OP</li>
<li>Chunkers now start with one more projectile</li>
<li>Amog Passive now increases in radius every level, from 4 to 12 over 220 levels. Previously it was always 4. Also gain 1 percent Poison Damage per level.</li>
<li>Calcium's passive has been changed slightly. Instead of losing half of his momentum upon taking damage, he now loses about 25 percent, which decreases the higher you level up. At level 110 (max) you lose about 6.6 percent</li>
<li>Cursed grabbies now has a proc per tick limit of 250. Similar items (Spicy Meatball, Ice Cube, etc) already have a limit like this (at 50). It's to improve FPS, but it is probably a slight nerf to Cursed Grabbies if you're veeeryy late game.</li>
<li>Poison Flask starting projectile speed increased 12 -&gt; 16</li>
<li>Dragon's Breath now has 200 percent faster rotation speed, and automatically targets enemies instead of following the player rotation. Damage buff 15 -&gt; 16, duration buff 1s -&gt; 1.5s and damage upgrade offer also buffed 3 -&gt; 4</li>
<li>Noelle passive gives less size per level: 1 percent -&gt; 0.75 percent, and the damage she gains per frozen enemy has also been reduced a bit: 2 percent -&gt; 1.5 percent</li>
<li>Max Silver Multiplier in Final Swarm has changed from 16x -&gt; 8x. People seem to have way too much silver, so it doesn't make sense to have such a high multiplier anyway. At some point it would be nice to create some features that use silver, but im not sure what that would be yet</li>
<li>To address some of the flying meta: Final swarm ghosts will start increasing their speed after 20 minutes have passed. Also, normally, an enemy can only be stunned or frozen 15 times (CC cap) before it becomes immune. After this update, starting at 20 minutes, the CC cap will slowly decrease until they can no longer be stunned or frozen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Console</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can press f10 to open the console</li>
<li>At the moment, this is only really used to set a specific seed for the dungeon if you wanna speedrun it or something</li>
<li>Type "help" in the console to see all the commands and how to use them</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The action roguelike Megabonk recently made headlines after Vedinad <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mystery-megabonk-developer-withdraws-from-the-game-awards-following-incorrect-nomination">withdrew from The Game Awards after being nominated for Debut Indie Game</a>. Vedinad admitted Megabonk was not in fact their debut game, as they had already been making games under different studio names for several years.</p>
