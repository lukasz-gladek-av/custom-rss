            <p>
Silksong fans, prepare to ride the rollercoaster of delirious anticipation and potential crushing disappointment once more: Nintendo has announced another indie-focused showcase is happening this week, so could this finally be the day for that release date news?
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Nintendo's Indie World showcase - as these things are officially known - airs this Thursday, 7th August, at 2pm in the UK. If you're over in yonder US, it's a considerably earlier start, with things kicking off at 6am PT or 9am ET.
</p>
<p>
As to what we can expect this time around, Nintendo's being as coy as always. However, it <em>is</em> promising "roughly 15 minutes of new announcements and updates" regarding indie titles for both Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>. And if that appeals, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mTv0HmKoUqw">watch the whole thing on YouTube</a>.

<p>
A release date for Silksong - developer Team Cherry's massively anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> sequel - is, of course, the great hope this time around, especially given the excitement generated by its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-both-switch-consoles">reappearance in Nintendo's Switch 2 showcase back in April</a>.
</p>
<p>
Anticipation for the title - and frustration over the continuing lack of a release date - has now reached such a fever pitch other developers are savvily starting to get in on the action. Earlier this month, indie developer Pere Albacar promised social media followers a free Steam code for his upcoming release Sands of Hope if Silksong made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">last week's third-party focused Nintendo showcase</a>. In the end it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-silksong-social-media-joke-could-be-game-changing-for-this-indie-developer-despite-direct-no-show">didn't show up</a>, but there's always next time - which just happens to be this Thursday.
</p>
<p>If you're curious about what else is coming to Nintendo Switch consoles, you may also like to know that there'll be a separate Showcase in Japan, where the Indie presentation will be an extra five minutes long - these bonus minutes are usually home to some pretty cool stuff, so we will make sure to watch this, too, and bring you any extra information you need. </p><figure>
