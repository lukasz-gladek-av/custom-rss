            <p>Witchbrook, the cosy life-sim set in a wizard school from Chucklefish, has finally received a release window eight years after its initial reveal.</p>
<p>Though Project Spellbound, as it was known, was first teased back in 2016, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-publisher-reveals-new-details-on-magic-school-rpg">Witchbrook proper was announced in 2017</a>. It immediately drew comparison with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, previously published by Chucklefish, and in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-inspired-magic-school-sim-witchbrook-gets-a-gorgeous-new-look">2020 switched to an isometric view</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/chucklefishs-witchbrook-is-still-alive-pretty-new-screenshots-show">look at fresh screenshots in 2022</a>, little has been shown of the game. Until today! During the Nintendo Direct, we finally got a release window of winter 2025 across PC, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox - including a day one Game Pass release.</p>

<p>Witchbrook has players enrol in the titular magical college, able to explore the seaside city of Mossport, the surrounding woodlands, and the college grounds themselves. In fact, four players can explore together in online co-op multiplayer.</p>
<p>Players will be able to learn new magical abilities to support themselves, local businesses and the community, make friends and romance other characters, renovate a cute woodland cottage and its garden, and spend time between classes by foraging, selling crafts, and entering seasonal events.</p>
<p>"Witchbrook is the most exciting project I've ever worked on, and it's been a long time coming, but I'm very eager to get the game in the hands of the players soon," said Chucklefish CTO Rodrigo Braz Monteiro.</p>
<p>"I don't think that the level of simulation and fidelity we've aimed for in this game is expected of any games short of AAA, and to see it realised in a pixel art indie game has been very satisfying to us. For now, we're only sharing a small glimpse into a vast game, and I can't wait for the community to see what's coming over the next few months."</p>
<p>"Witchbrook is our love letter to thoughtful living, the quiet magic of slow moments, and the connections we share with each other and the world around us," added art director Steph Caskenette. "Whether players are exploring solo or sharing in the adventure, we hope Witchbrook becomes a space to relax and make lasting memories."</p>
<p>Witchbrook was shown at today's Nintendo Direct, alongside a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-will-give-samus-psychic-powers">first look at Metroid Prime 4: Beyond gameplay</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-has-a-battle-royale-mode-that-finally-explains-what-its-name-means">new look at Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A</a>, and a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-still-a-switch-game-coming-out-in-2026">Tomodachi Life game due in 2026</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
