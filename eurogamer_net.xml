            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-requires-pricey-extra-accessories-and-a-4k-tv-to-fully-complete<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Welcome Tour arrives today alongside the launch of Nintendo's new console, though it cannot be fully completed without also purchasing extra accessories - and a 4K TV.</p>
<p>The minigame collection has already drawn criticism for not being a pack-in game, considering it is designed to show off the capabilities of the Switch 2. Instead, it'll set you back eight quid. Even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/reggie-fils-aime-wades-into-switch-2-pricing-debate-by-subtweeting-nintendo-over-pack-in-games">former Nintendo of America boss Reggie Fils-Aime waded in</a> on the debate.</p>
<p>Yet as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/aahea/products/soft.html#other">Nintendo has stated on its website</a> (thanks <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-to-require-a-few-accessories-for-100-completion/">Nintendo Soup</a>), some of the 34 minigames and tech demos require peripherals which are sold separately.</p>

<p>One minigame requires a USB camera; another requires the GL/GR buttons on the Switch 2 Pro Controller (although they're also on the Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip with the console); and a 4K TV is required for both a minigame and a tech demo to experience the proper resolution.</p>
<p>Nintendo states that all 12 areas of the game can still be accessed without these accessories, but to 100 percent the game you'll need three medals in every minigame.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 Pro Controller will set you back £74.99, an extra Charging Grip costs £29.99, while the Switch 2 Camera costs £58.99 - although a cute Piranha Plant alternative is £34.99 if you don't mind a poor resolution.</p>
<p>As for a 4K TV, that could cost you hundreds, if not thousands of pounds.</p>
<p>Over in the US, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-raising-cost-of-switch-2-accessories-in-us-due-to-tariffs-but-console-price-to-remain-same-1">Nintendo even raised the price of its accessories to combat US tariffs</a> on the console itself.</p>
<p>"From my slightly extended but still brief time with it, it feels like Nintendo has created, if not the most wildly entertaining, at least the most spiritually accurate take on visiting an actual museum dedicated to a games console," wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/welcome-tour-is-the-switch-2s-welcome-surprise-and-might-even-be-worth-your-8-quid">Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell on Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>.</p>
<p>"You read a bit, you play around a bit, you go, 'huh,' and have a little ruminate on what you've learned, and move on. If it weren't for all the Joy-Con waggling I'd ideally play this thing with my arms clasped behind my back, head slightly cocked to one side, assuming the official position of the museum attendee."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Our Bertie has already had some time with The Alters. "It's a glimpse of a game that intrigues me but also leaves me slightly confused," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-war-of-mine-devs-clone-survival-game-the-alters-is-a-curious-blend">Eurogamer's The Alters preview from 2023</a>.</p>
<p>"This War of Mine had a much clearer idea - living as a civilian through war - whereas The Alters seems more speculative and fragmented. Is it a mining game? Is it a survival game? Is it a game about clones? I think it's trying to be all three, but I'm not yet convinced it's managed. But like I say, I've only seen a glimpse, and if it turns out to be anything like This War of Mine, I'll be happy."</p>
<p>As for Control spin-off FBC: Firebreak, our Chris called it a "frantic, electrifying run-based shooter, with difficulties feeling like gambles" following his time with the game earlier this year.</p>
<p>"Its potential is up there with the games other Remedy staff reference in casual chit-chat around the studio's corridors, from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, yes, to Darktide, Payday, Deep Rock Galactic or even Overcooked," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedys-control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-has-only-come-together-at-the-last-minute-and-somehow-feels-better-for-it">Eurogamer's FBC: Firebreak preview</a>.</p> <div>

<p>Meanwhile, and as is the case with every new batch of games, the following titles will be leaving Game Pass on 15th June:</p>
<ul>

<li>My Time At Sandrock (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Rolling Hills: Make Sushi, Make Friends (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Depersonalization (PC)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to keep playing these games after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to purchase them. On the plus side, Game Pass subscribers get a 20 percent discount.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> team is gearing up for the first patch since its release earlier this year. Actually, it is working on two patches at the moment, with those who are part of the Steam Beta getting first dibs.</p>
<p>The first of these two patches will focus on "quests, major bugs and blockers, and quality of life fixes," the developer said. Those on the Beta path will be able to experience these changes from today, 5th June. The rest of us will then follow next week, on 11th June.</p>
<p>A second patch will be released at a later date, though we don't know when just now, and this chap will be focused on Oblivion Remastered's performance.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> may be getting a next gen update alongside a port to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>On YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyhMv3N8UKk&amp;t=597s">Nate the Hate's Xbox Showcase Predictions video</a>, the leaker stated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>' cowboy classic will receive the update and a port to Nintendo's latest console release later this year. It follows reports of a Switch 2 port from last month, adding to its veracity.</p>
<p>Nate the Hate previously stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-imminent-reports-suggest">Switch 2 reveal would be imminent back in January of this year</a>, and also noted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-release-acclaimed-first-party-game-on-another-platform-report-suggests">Xbox would be bringing more of its third-party games to other platforms</a> before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-hi-fi-rush-on-ps5-and-the-xbox-multi-platform-story-so-far">Hi-Fi Rush's departure to the PS5</a>.

<p>He elaborated this Switch 2 port of Red Dead Redemption 2 would come "a few months" following the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, speculating a late summer / early autumn window. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Given that the Switch 2 is out today</a>, that means if this is true the timer starts… Now.</p>
<p>This comes following another report by <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/exclusive-red-dead-redemption-2-for-nintendo-switch-2-may-arrive-this-year-1544753/">GameReactor</a>, stating a Switch 2 port will be coming later this year. So this isn't a rumour out of the blue, there are multiple voices stating it'll happen in the near future.</p>
<p>Take Two CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-reportedly-set-for-switch-2-as-take-two-boss-praises-nintendos-console">recently praised the Switch 2</a>, and the industry giant has multiple other games set to release on the platform including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nba-2k24">NBA 2K</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wwe-2k24">WWE 2K</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven't had a chance to play it, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-review-9">Red Dead Redemption 2 is a fantastic open world game</a> that absolutely earned its consumer and critical acclaim since releasing back in 2018. If it does come to the Switch 2, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-can-the-new-nintendo-console-handle-it">it'll join Cyberpunk 2077</a>, which could make the console a grand starting point for a dive into vast open worlds.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
