            <p>It's never too late to release your game on console, apparently. Nearly 30 years later, Namco's Tokyo Wars is getting a PlayStation, Nintendo Switch and Xbox release. It's almost as old as me! (Keep a straight face, Bertie, keep a straight face.)</p>
<p>Tokyo Wars is a tank-battling game that first arrived in arcades in 1996, complete with racing car-like cabinets for you to sit in and steer your tank from. The idea of the game was simple: drive around downtown Tokyo, in a tank, and blow things up - either computer-controlled enemies or tanks controlled by other players. You could rumble over cars and even collapse tunnels. It was impressive at the time!</p>

<p>The console release, which happens tomorrow - 6th November - arrives courtesy of a company called Hamster and its Arcade Archives range. This revival of Tokyo Wars comes in two variations, the biggest difference between the two being the addition of four-player split-screen multiplayer. You cannot access this on Switch 1 and PlayStation 4, but you can on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, PlayStation 5, and the Xbox Series consoles.</p>
<p>There's <a href="https://www.arcadearchives.com/en/title/aca-385/">more detailed Tokyo Wars information on the Arcade Archives website</a>, should you want it. The game costs $15 or $17 depending on which version you want.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco produced a spiritual successor to Tokyo Wars in 2009, called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tank-tank-tank-review">Tank! Tank! Tank!, which Donlan reviewed and sadly didn't think was very good</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hardware-rivals-review">Sony's online multiplayer game Hardware Rivals</a> clearly took a hefty does of inspiration from the game, too, in 2016.</p>
<p>Arcade Archives has brought back games like the original Ridge Racer, King of Fighters '98, Splatter House, Galaga and many, many more. There are pages of games listed on its website.</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you're a fan of old games coming back to life, make sure you also check Digital Eclipse's peerless recent documentary-slash-restoration work for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/atari-50-the-anniversary-celebration">Atari</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat</a>, <a href="http://r/">Jeff Minter</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-making-of-the-making-of-karateka">Karateka</a> and more.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> players on PC are editing their game files to force crossplay off, in an attempt to avoid console players.</p>
<p>By going into Battlefield 6's Steam files, specifically the PROFSAVE profile, people can add a single line of code that turns off crossplay. <a href="https://x.com/ottrTweets/status/1985715884455817538">This trick was posted on Twitter by Swedish competitive gamer Ottr</a>, who claims - at the moment - it'll place those who attempt it into bot lobbies due to a lack of players making use of this little tweak. However, they hope (if it catches on) they might be able to get "solid games".</p>
<p>As for why players are doing this? Well, console players almost entirely use standard controllers to play Battlefield 6 across Xbox Series and PS5 machines. These controllers offer less accuracy than a keyboard &amp; mouse, and as such Battlefield Studios (as well as the developers of many, many other games) offer a degree of aim assist to bridge the gap between hardware.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-lead-confirms-aim-assist-is-getting-nerfed-but-the-25-percent-recoil-reduction-is-staying-for-now-the-stickiness-straight-up-kills-you-if-theres-multiple-enemies/">It's worth noting that Battlefield 6's aim assist <em>is</em> getting nerfed in the near future</a>, though the 25 percent recoil reduction for controller users is going to stick around for a while longer at least. So those being burned by controller users should hopefully feel a little less frustration moving forward.</p><p>This aim assist, in the mind of a significant portion of PC FPS players, provides an unfair advantage. As such, tweaking the files to turn off crossplay provides matches free from 'console scrubs', as it were. This, however, would not prevent players on PC from just plugging in a controller and taking advantage of aim assist that way. This, in theory, shouldn't be a problem, though. The assumption being that those willing to take these steps to disable crossplay are specifically looking for a controller-less experience.</p>
<p>The gripes against aim assist are not solely a Battlefield thing. In fact, the more competitive-minded Call of Duty community often rage endlessly at the advantages granted to console players when it comes to aim assist. The same is true for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, which, to be fair, has perhaps laid on the aim assist a little strong in the past.</p>
<p>As easy as some find it to put anti aim-assist players in a box marked tryhard, it's worth asking, how would you feel if you were beaten by another player given advantages not available to you? Some aim assistance is obviously fine, in fact, it's probably necessary in this age of cross-platform play. But lather it on a touch too thick? You might find some of your better players feeling sour, and not without reason.</p>

            <p>Arc Raiders players are waging a war of words online, in addition an actual war in-game. This war is focused on the matter of violence itself, or more specifically, is violence between players in Arc Raiders bad form?</p>
<p>As an extraction shooter, Arc Raiders is by its nature a high-risk, tense experience. When out completing quests, collecting resources, or grinding out points in your weekly trials, a single player shooting you can cause a loss of all your progress. This, as you can imagine, can be frustrating, leading a substantial number of players toward taking a friendlier approach.</p>
<p>So many players, in fact, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-arc-raiders-one-of-the-most-pleasant-multiplayer-shooter-experiences-on-the-market-early-adopters-seem-to-think-so">Arc Raiders has struck some as quite a friendly game to play</a>. Many raiders have been opting to hash things out over voice comms rather than let their bullets do the talking. However, others who are staying true to the PvP portion of the experience feel otherwise, thriving in a game where proper aim and smart play can lead one to overflowing loot from knocked-out opponents.</p>

<p>Some players, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oohnf0/i_am_a_changed_man/">including IncompetentCat on Reddit</a>, have seen the value of kindness in Arc Raiders, noting how being revived or otherwise assisted by strangers are special moments in-game. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ooqzo8/i_tried_being_the_shoot_on_sight_guy/">Others have felt intense guilt</a> with a "kill-on-site" approach to solo play, hearing verbal sadness flow freely from other players upon being knocked down.</p><p>There is, of course, the other side of the argument. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oncgsr/i_mean_this_in_the_most_respectful_way_possible/">User Garbaggiogreco</a> stated outright: "As long as there is PvP in this game it will never change. Stop complaining and come up with strategies to combat against it," courting lots of agreement from the community at large. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ons1ac/for_the_small_minority_of_people_who_didnt/">Others note that the game is explicitly marked as PvP</a>, and to get upset about that is a touch silly.</p>
<p>There's also a degree of "toxic anti-PvP" behaviour, with the moderator of the Arc Raiders <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1olgls0/toxic_anti_pvpers_not_welcome/">stating outright in a post that people who rail against those who engage in PvP are not welcome</a>. They wrote: "You are allowed to have an opinion that such players morals in game are not good or they are ‘Villain players’ or what not, that is fine for that is what they are but any time an outside insult is going to be used on people over gameplay you are getting the hammer of doom."</p>
<p>For what it's worth, it's clear at least to me that the friendlier moments in Arc Raiders are only as special as they are <em>because</em> there's a risk of betrayal. It takes a lot to put your life and loot in the hands of someone who'd gain a lot from taking you out. Villainising PvP-focused players would lessen the magic of such moments, making the entire game a little worse. It is perhaps better to cherish those who lend an open hand, rather than decry those who stick to their closed fists.</p>

            <p>The Steam Deck now has a low-power, display off download mode, a feature that's been dearly sought after by users for a good while - since launch over three years ago, in fact.</p>
<p>This will allow Steam Deck users to complete all active downloads without chugging through battery life, entering sleep mode once the downloads are finished. This can be accessed by users by pressing the power button during a download and selecting the new low-power download option, or it can occur automatically during an idle timeout.</p>
<p>During this low-power download mode, pressing the power button or moving the Steam Deck will cause a new status screen to pop up showing the progress of the download. The Steam Deck will automatically enter sleep mode during this new low-power download if the battery life falls below 20%.</p>
