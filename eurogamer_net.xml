            <p>2025's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> was a big enough stumble to push Xbox-owned Activision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-receive-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-releases-as-latest-series-entry-fails-to-meet-expectations">reconsider its approach to yearly CoD entries</a> moving forward. Mind you, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/january-2026-us-consumer-spending-on-video-games-was-up">the game is still topping charts</a>, but after a poor critical reception and lukewarm player sentiment, things are being re-examined. Could a standalone, fully-fledged Zombies entry spice things up? Maybe, but it appears that's not on the table... yet.</p>
<p>At least that's what a rare comment posted through <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty">Call of Duty's official X/Twitter account</a> is suggesting (hat tip to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-aint-it-activision-issues-rare-denial-of-standalone-call-of-duty-zombies-report">IGN</a>):</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The rumor factory working overtime. This ain't it.</p>— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/2026038116364992596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Social media accounts are typically run by community managers and dedicated social teams, but needless to say, replies to rumours about new entries <em>should</em> have to go through a few approvals first even if they're in jest. That's what makes the quick comment significant. Traditionally, the teams would just ignore and move on when being hit with these claims.</p>
<p>If we're to believe the denial, however, it's not entirely clear what the comment is referring to. The original rumour, kickstarted by alleged insider <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope">TheGhostOfHope</a> and <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/standalone-cod-zombies-game-reportedly-planned-for-next-gen-consoles-3322963/">shared by Dexerto</a>, was actually saying two things: First, that a standalone Zombies title was in dev. Secondly, it claimed there were plans to release it alongside a mainline entry just in time for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-2027-launch-reportedly-best-case-scenario-following-amd-hint-that-microsoft-may-ship-new-hardware-next-year">Microsoft's next Xbox launch</a>, which could even skip 2027 according to recent reports. Perhaps that's the play here: Shutting down the whole conversation without really specifying what they're referring to.</p><p>In any case, I'm of the opinion a standalone Call of Duty Zombies game (perhaps released with a lower price tag on it) would make <em>a ton </em>of sense. It's not uncommon to see longtime fans say they're annoyed by the franchise's current state only to pick up the latest entry to get that Zombies fix only. And in many cases, it's safe to say diehards would happily grab two separate Call of Duty releases that offered different-enough experiences.</p>
<p>For now, however, we're stuck in the loop of wondering about the series' future following a subpar entry that's performing really well regardless. Is Modern Warfare 4 next in line? It's what everyone is assuming, especially after lead developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/infinity-ward">Infinity Ward</a> openly said "<a href="https://in.ign.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/249223/news/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-4-infinity-ward-shuts-down-rumours-about-the-game-being-a-copy-of-mw2">see you in 2026</a>" back in December.</p>

            <p>Following a calmer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-shared-watch-event-rewards-pve">two-week event</a> and an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embark-studios-details-actions-against-exploits-and-glitches-abusers">assault on exploiters</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>' next huge content update, Shrouded Sky, is here. A hurricane is engulfing the Rust Belt, and all-new Arc enemies are joining the hunt for human survivors. Good luck out there.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 23rd February, Embark Studios released the introduction to the Shrouded Sky update with an official post and an ominous trailer you can watch below. The short story is the game's generally chill setting (if we don't count the killer robots and treacherous raiders) is being hit with nasty weather, at least for a bit. Today, 24th February, the update has gone live.</p> <figure>

<p>The new Hurricane map condition affects visibility and movement, but new loot caches are being unearthed by the rains and winds, so of course the most daring raiders will be going topside in search of valuables. To make matters worse, two new Arc enemies will roam the Rust Belt moving forward: Fireflies are floating, flame-emitting terrors, and then you'll have to deal with the spherical Comets, which lock on to unsuspecting raiders before exploding. You can imagine why these two are especially scary when visibility is so bad.</p>
<p>The good news is a new free raider deck is available: the Surgeon. The new cosmetic drop comes alongside the ability to (finally) put facial hair on your toon, a feature that somehow wasn't there at launch. A stubble will be available from the get-go to all players, but the full beard is part of the Surgeon deck. Via the store, the stubble beard and thick moustache are available too. I dislike having to grind for proper facial hair, but some folks have it worse IRL, so I won't complain too much.</p>

<p>Other additions include updates to the Dam Battlegrounds map, a new expedition window, new cosmetic bundles, and the Weather Monitoring System project, which has, as usual, its own set of rewards. Also, you'll probably want to check out the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/es/news/shrouded-sky-patch-notes-1-17-0">full patch notes</a> to keep track of the latest balance pass, fixes, and tweaks before you go on a rant online about your guns feeling like pea shooters.</p>

            <p>A new interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a>'s head of parental advocacy Dr. Elizabeth Milovidov has touched on the subject of children's safety on the platform, as well how easy it is for children to be exposed to unregulated content. This, according to Milovidov, is a "challenge".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/roblox-kids-safety-head-of-parental-advocacy-interview.html?utm_medium=s1&amp;utm_campaign=vulture&amp;utm_source=bluesky">Speaking to Vulture</a>, Milovidov addressed previous reports of children being exposed to content or people that they shouldn't have access to, and stated that they've heard mixed reports from parents on the dangers of Roblox.</p>
<p>"That's kind of the interesting spot right now is that no matter how good my intentions are, sometimes it's hard to beat back against something negative that goes viral," Milovidov said. "A lot of the reports that have come out have been based on things that happened a few years ago, or where moderation teams caught it but, unfortunately, someone took a screenshot; it went out on Instagram and it's game over for us."</p>
<p>When Vulture asked if Milovidov was saying the problem wasn't real, she responded: "I would say that, in general, Roblox is a platform online. The internet is the internet, right? We have to realize that once we give a child any sort of Wi-Fi access, the world is an open place, right? I remember doing digital parenting sessions and telling parents, 'Look, I'm wearing my Apple Watch. Can you believe I can be bullied on my Apple Watch?' You can be bullied in Google Documents. It's not about banning these things. It's about balance and boundaries. Now that we've introduced them, they've seen the water; we can't just say, 'You're never going to go there.'</p><p>When asked if parents and Roblox and the parents of Roblox players had equal responsibility in protecting these children, Milovidov responded with: "Oh, 1,000 percent. Would I say equal? Oh, Nicole, I think you're going to get me in trouble. I would say the company has even more responsibility. But yes, parents are right in there. I think all the tech companies have a responsibility to ensure that they are doing their utmost to make sure the platform is safe. Do I think Roblox is doing that? Yes, I do. I wouldn't be here if I didn't. Do I think there's more to be done? Yes, I do."</p>
<p>Vulture also raised the issue of ease of access, specifically with how easy it was for children to make new accounts and access unregulated, potentially problematic content. To this, Milovidov said: "We're trying to balance the privacy concerns of users and families with trying to wall things down a little bit more. It's a challenge. When I was writing the parent's guide for Instagram, I was also telling parents about finsta -- fake Instagram accounts. I mean, these things exist in almost every setting. The idea, again, is to talk with your children and say, 'Listen, this is our family. These are our expectations on this. This is why I don't want you to do this.'</p>
<p>"I know parents are busy, and I don't want to put the onus on them, which is why I'm trying to make it as simple as possible. Let your child guide you. Ask them what they're doing on Roblox. Ask them, 'Has anything ever happened that made them feel a little icky?'"</p>
<p>In a 2022 UK report - the <a href="https://assets.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/wpuploads/2022/09/cc-digital-childhoods-a-survey-of-children-and-parents.pdf">UK's Digital childhoods: a survey of children and parents report</a> -  the Children's commissioner for England found among other things that "50 percent of children who saw harmful content reported it, older children and girls are less likely to report harmful content. 40 percent of children who didn't report harmful content told us they didn't report because they felt there was no point in doing so, while only 15 percent felt that the content didn't need to be reported."</p><p>Roblox is currently being sued by a variety of entities on the grounds of children's safety. Only last week, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/los-angeles-county-sues-roblox-rcna259891">Los Angeles county sued Roblox</a>, alleging it made it easy for adults to target children. <a href="https://www.lawsuit-information-center.com/roblox-sex-abuse-lawsuit.html">Many families are also suing Roblox over similar grounds</a>, these include <a href="https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/roblox-class-action-lawsuit-sent-to-arbitration-in-kids-data-privacy-case/">class action lawsuits</a>, <a href="https://newschannel9.com/news/local/georgia-attorney-general-investigates-roblox-over-child-exploitation-concerns">a grooming lawsuit in Georgia</a>, and <a href="https://www.uppermichiganssource.com/2025/09/03/accused-assault-dickinson-county-girl-brings-lawsuit-towards-roblox/">one from Dickinson Country, Michigan</a> in which its alleged that an 11-year-old girl was sexually assaulted on the platform.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The surprising appointment of Microsoft's CoreAI president Asha Sharma as head of Microsoft Gaming at the weekend - in conjunction with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/today-marks-an-exciting-new-chapter-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-retiring-amid-major-leadership-shakeup-that-sees-microsofts-coreai-president-taking-over-roll">Microsoft Gaming boss Phil Spencer retiring and former Xbox president Sarah Bond suddenly departing</a> - may actually be a genuine attempt by the company to turn Xbox's fortunes around. This slightly different read on the events of the past few days comes from The Verge, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/883015/microsoft-xbox-new-ceo-shakeup-notepad">a report compiled by long-time Microsoft reporter Tom Warren</a> who spoke to "multiple" sources it sounds like were inside the company itself.</p>
<p>The Verge heard that Spencer's retirement had been a long time coming and was largely expected by staff. But Bond's more surprising departure - for she had been the obvious replacement-in-waiting for Spencer - came about as the result of her big 'Xbox Anywhere' push not working out. Her idea was to move Xbox away from a single console and spread the brand across multiple devices including mobile. This divided focus led to continued drops in hardware revenue, and core parts of the vision - such as a promised Xbox mobile gaming store - still haven't appeared long after they were supposed to.</p>
<p>Internally this Xbox Anywhere plan apparently "offended many Xbox employees", The Verge reported, and Bond herself is described as "tough to work with". She's praised by employees for striking deals with companies - apparently she was "crucial" in completing the $68.7bn Activision Blizzard deal - but she was also allegedly ruthless if you didn't stick to her vision. "You were out," The Verge wrote. "Most of the current and former Xbox employees I've spoken to in recent days are relieved that Bond is leaving Microsoft."</p>
<p>It's against that backdrop Asha Sharma was brought in, someone who seems ill-fitted to the role of CEO of Microsoft Gaming because she doesn't have gaming experience, either professionally or personally, and because of her worrying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-new-head-of-gaming-has-no-tolerance-for-bad-ai-following-concerns-about-the-proliferation-of-ai-slop-and-sharmas-tech-background">background in AI - a background she's already had to answer for</a>. But there might actually be a legitimate push here to reboot and refresh the Xbox division.</p><p>If Microsoft were only interested in making Xbox a game publisher going forwards, why not promote Xbox game overseer Matt Booty? And why would Sharma promise a "return of Xbox" and say things like "I want to return to the renegade spirit that built Xbox" if looking only for empty platitudes while Xbox was sunsetted? Those are the kind of claims that will embarrass a person should they be proven insincere. "I get the impression from sources that Microsoft wants a turnaround and is worried about losing Xbox," The Verge wrote, "as it's one of its only remaining successful consumer brands."</p>
<p>Those who know Sharma reportedly say she's "enthusiastic" and "willing to learn" and "very capable of getting teams to execute on a clear vision", and that she's had good success with user acquisition at previous companies - something Xbox could sorely do with. Is this the start of a comeback fight for the Xbox console - a return to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-was-afraid-sony-was-going-to-own-the-living-room-the-big-xbox-360-interview">the "challenger brand" mindset Peter Moore instilled so aggressively for Xbox 360</a>? And if it is, what happens to that Xbox Anywhere vision?</p>
<p>Questions abound. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has been the vision holder for Xbox for a long time. He became president of Xbox in 2014 and then CEO of Microsoft Gaming in 2022, and helped drastically revitalise Xbox's image after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-one-developers-have-their-say-on-specs-self-publishing-and-tvtvtv">the disastrous Xbox One reveal</a> and launch. He was the face and figurehead of Xbox, even with Sarah Bond as president, and he instigated things like Xbox Game Pass, which Sharma will have to deal with now.</p>
<p>But there is an opportunity for Sharma to re-establish Xbox when launching new hardware, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-gen-xbox-confirmed-in-development-following-rumours-microsoft-would-stop-making-consoles">Microsoft has said it's working on</a>, although we have no idea when it intends to release it. There are, however, strong economical challenges faced by hardware manufacturers today, notably those caused by a rush to gen-AI, which is pushing component prices sky high, as well as unpredictable tariffs and a general rise in living costs. As we've been told before, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-role-of-the-console-is-shifting-are-rising-prices-the-end-for-games-consoles-as-we-know-them">the role of the console is changing</a>.</p>

            <p>Excitement around <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marathon">Marathon</a>'s launch next week seems to finally be a thing, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-come-has-come-for-you-to-judge-marathon-for-yourself-again-theres-a-new-server-slam-running-late-feb-into-march">this weekend's "server slam" aims to convince extraction shooter enjoyers</a> on the fence. Ahead of it, Bungie has outlined a frankly impressive effort regarding networking and security features that will be implemented from the get-go.</p>
<p>On 23rd February, the Sony-owned developer <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonsecurity">shared a meaty blog post</a> that dives deep into what players can expect from the game's many layers of security and key network features. Needless to say, all of them are crucial to ensuring a smooth and fair online experience, but it's often that shooters targeting a competitive crowd don't launch in a robust-enough state.</p>
<p>First, Bungie has made Marathon's dedicated servers "fully authoritative on key combat and looting actions," meaning any "correction" of suspicious behaviour won't impact other players and their experience. It's combined with "client-side prediction and rewind" to ensure actions feel immediate. Moreover, it's promised that servers "carefully track each bullet to its target even with high packet loss." Consistent hit registration at launch in an online shooter? Imagine that.</p>
<p>When it comes to wall hacks and other cheats that might reveal the position of key items and players, a Fog of War system limits the regions of a map that individual player clients have knowledge of. "It also helps keep your position hidden from other players' clients." This isn't enough to guarantee full protection from hacks alone, but it's part of the game's arsenal to combat cheaters. On top of that, the security stack was rebuilt "from the ground up" for this game, and that will work alongside the familiar BattlEye solution.</p><p>There's also the matter of one's Internet connection going down mid-run. Each online game handles such events differently. In the case of Marathon, "you can reconnect and continue playing the run" like in other match-based shooters. "If connection recovery fails due to an issue with Bungie's server or network infrastructure, we will attempt to return the starting gear to all impacted players."</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest shocker comes near the end of the list of features, where Bungie states "anyone found to be cheating will be permabanned from playing Marathon forever." Yeah, no second chances. So, make sure you're not running anything suspicious while playing it.</p>
<p>In any case, the veteran online shooter developer, admits that "product security is never fully solved" and says it'll continue to invest in systems and infrastructure for as long as the game stays alive.</p>
<p>As an extra, we now also have confirmation Xbox players will automatically get <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-isnt-just-favouring-playstation-players-with-exclusive-cosmetics-xbox-and-steam-players-promised-bonus-loot-too">exclusive gun charms</a> when the game releases on 5th March:</p> <div>
