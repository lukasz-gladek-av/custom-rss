            <p>
Hundreds of staff at Bethesda parent company ZeniMax will go on strike today in protest at parent company Microsoft outsourcing work without bargaining with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) union. 
</p>
<p>
The one-day walkout by staff who work on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> and Doom will be held today, Wednesday 13th November, from 10am to 6pm local time at four ZeniMax Studios offices in Maryland and Texas. 
</p>
<p>
Staff say they are concerned over the "unilateral decision" to outsource quality assurance (QA) work to external teams at a time of uncertainty and layoffs. In short, the worry is ZeniMax will undercut its own union staff by shifting the work elsewhere. 
</p>
<p>ZeniMax workers say they have also been prompted to walk out over continued concerns over remote work policies - the same issue which sparked a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-developers-strike-over-office-working-policy">protest by Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 developers at Activision's QA studio in Minnesota</a> at the end of last month.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted ZeniMax and Microsoft for comment.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-recognises-300-person-zenimax-testers-union">Microsoft recognised the ZeniMax Studios union back in January 2023</a>, when 300 video game testers who worked on ZeniMax and Bethesda titles grouped together under the CWA. 
</p>
<p>
The union was the first Microsoft recognised and the largest video game union in the US. At the time, Microsoft was still battling to buy <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a>, and was keen to voluntarily recognise worker unions to mitigate concerns over its growing portfolio's impact on workers.
</p><p>
"The Xbox business has never been more healthy," Microsoft's gaming boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">Phil Spencer said in a Bloomberg interview published just earlier today</a>, when asked what the future had in store following a year filled with Microsoft layoffs. "The business is performing right now, and I think that means a more healthy future for hardware and the games we build."

            <p>Following the passing of Sylens' original actor Lance Reddick last year, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> has recast the role.</p>
<p>In the latest Horizon outing, the character is voiced by Tim Russ, Eurogamer can confirm.</p>
<p>Russ has been in the industry for many years, and is known for his roles in the likes of Star Trek: Voyager where he portrayed Vulcan Lieutenant Commander Tuvok, and as doorman Frank in Samantha Who?</p>

<p>Sylens features in both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>, which Lego Horizon Adventures is based on, and its sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a>. Series developer Guerrilla is yet to comment on who will replace Reddick, who portrayed Sylens in both mainline games and their respective DLC, longer term.</p>
<p>Reddick <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/actor-lance-reddick-star-of-destiny-and-the-wire-has-died">passed away in March last year</a>, aged 60. Following his passing, players discovered a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lance-reddick-memorial-added-to-horizon-forbidden-west-dlc">memorial situated on an island visited in Horizon Forbidden West's DLC Burning Shores</a>, which served as an homage to the late actor.</p>
<p>"In honour of Lance Reddick, we created a memorial to commemorate the profound impact he had on us all," Guerrilla wrote at the time.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Lance, for everything you brought to the role of Sylens: your gravitas, energy, wisdom and more. An incomparable talent and friend. We miss you terribly."</p>

<p>As for Lego Horizon Adventures, we just awarded the game two out of five stars.</p>
<p>"It's a decidedly joyless kind of game, the sort that's better to look at than actually play with, and one that does little to bridge the gap between its two main subjects," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-review">Eurogamer's Lego Horizon Adventures review</a>. "I still don't know why it exists or who it's for, and there's little evidence to suggest that Guerrilla or Gobo know the answer either."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
