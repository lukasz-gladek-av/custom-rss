            <p>
The Japanese version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has been hit by censorship restrictions from the country's ratings board. 
</p>
<p>
In Japan, Ubisoft will now release a version of the game without the ability to behead your enemies or slice off their limbs.
</p>
<p>
These changes - and others listed below - will now mean the game will be granted a Z rating, which is the equivalent of an 18, by  Japan's Computer Entertainment Rating Organisation (CERO).

<p>
"Regarding differences in content between the overseas (North America, Europe) and Japanese versions of Assassin's Creed: Shadows, the version sold in Japan of Assassin's Creed: Shadows (CERO: Z) will have some differences in in-game content in order to comply with the regulations of the certification organisation," Ubisoft revealed in a statement posted to its Japanese <a href="https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/1882611785775174070">social media account</a>.
</p>
<p>
"The option to switch amputation on/off from the game settings has been removed, and amputating the neck and limbs of enemies during gameplay is now always impossible."
</p>
<p>In other words, all versions of the game have the ability to turn off more graphic violence. But, in Japan, these options will be locked down, and limbs will always remain attached.</p>
<p>
There are other changes, too. Ubisoft has altered the "amputated surface of the body", presumably to make it less graphic. 
</p>
<p>
"The representation of some Japanese voices played in the overseas version (North America and Europe) has been changed," Ubisoft added, without further explanation.
</p>
<p>
Japan's rating board has long been squeamish around the issue of violence in video games, with limb removal an issue in other games previously such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cod-black-ops-censored-in-japan">which was censored</a>) and the recent Dead Space Remake (which was denied a release altogether).
</p>
<p>
The issue sparked a notable response last year from a Japanese EA executive, after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-will-be-uncensored-in-all-regions">Japanese version of Stellar Blade was allowed a rating despite showing severed limbs</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"What's going on CERO?" EA's Japanese boss Shaun Noguchi <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blades-uncensored-release-in-japan-prompts-criticism-of-rating-system/">wrote at the time</a>. "You denied our Dead Space a rating because it included cross-sections of severed body parts and internal organs, but here we have both cross-sections and insides on display passed off with a CERO D [17+] rating. I find this hard to accept..."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer recently went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">hands-on with Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which our Katharine described as the series' "biggest shake-up of the series in years".

            <p>An unannounced, under-wraps Warhammer RPG - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unannounced-warhammer-rpg-cancelled-towards-end-of-last-year-report">that last week was revealed to have recently been cancelled</a> - was based on Warhammer: Age of Sigmar, Eurogamer can confirm. </p>
<p>Last week, former developers working at new studio Thought Pennies were spotted as having departed the studio after work on a Warhammer game was ceased. Now, speaking with Eurogamer, the company has confirmed it was developing a Warhammer: Age of Sigmar RPG, in collaboration with Games Workshop and Nexon.</p>
<p>"While the partnership worked well and we got a lot of good input from Nexon, Nexon made a strategic change," a Thought Pennies spokesperson told Eurogamer. "Late last year we agreed to end the project and Nexon is helping as a board member."</p>

<p>The project was being made for PC, consoles and mobile platforms. Developer Thought Pennies was not mentioned in this release.</p>
<p>"It is an era of war. The Mortal Realms have been despoiled. Ravaged by the followers of the Chaos Gods, they stand on the brink of destruction," the 2021 description reads. "Players will command the war hosts of the God-king Sigmar and his allies as they fight to reignite hope and bring order back to the realms. Each season, players will collect characters and enter new realms. Each character comes with unique options, stories and gameplay. Players will be able to customise their characters and work cooperatively to guide how sections of the Realms are retaken."</p>

Ubisoft has responded to a report that claims fresh content for 2023's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> is on the way, following investment from Saudi Arabia's controversial Public Investment Fund (PIF).
</p>
<p>
The report, published by French financial newspaper <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/letonnant-deal-dubisoft-avec-larabie-saoudite-2144626">Les Echoes</a>, states that Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot secured PIF funding during a meeting last month in Saudi Arabia (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan/status/1882849239434232101">j0nathan</a>).
</p>
<p>
In a statement to Eurogamer today, a Ubisoft spokesperson declined to offer more detail, but did not offer a denial.
</p>
<p>
"We'll decline to comment," a Ubisoft spokesperson said. "We are focused on finishing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> and excited for players to get to play it on 20th March."

<p>
The PIF is an initiative designed as a way to diversify the country's revenues via investment in foreign companies, with a large arm focused on the video games industry. It's chaired by Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the controversial ruler <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">blamed by the CIA for the assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi</a>, who has upheld the country's <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/">notoriously poor human rights record</a>.
</p>
<p>
Despite this, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabia-sets-sights-on-acquiring-a-bigger-stake-in-nintendo">PIF holds a notable stake in a swathe of gaming companies</a>, including Grand Theft Auto publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>, Nintendo, EA, Embracer, Nexon and Capcom.
</p>
<p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-acknowledges-buyout-reports-stating-it-regularly-reviews-options">recently been seeking investment</a>, as the company discusses its future with Chinese stakeholder <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">explores sale options</a>.</p>
<p>
Additional content for Assassin's Creed Mirage is something of a surprise, considering Ubisoft's upcoming push for the long-awaited Shadows.
</p>
<p>
Mirage, set in ninth-century Baghdad, was designed as a smaller project similar in scope to the Assassin's Creed series' earliest entries, and something of a palate cleanser after a trilogy of enormous Assassin's Creed epics.
</p>
<p>
Released in late 2023, Mirage was primarily developed by Ubisoft Bordeaux, a team which is now building Claws of Awaji, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">first 10-hour expansion for Assassin's Creed Shadows that anyone who pre-orders the game will now get for free</a>.
</p>
<p>
But DLC for Mirage could tie into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-reflects-on-series-struggle-to-tell-consistent-modern-day-story-after-desmond">Ubisoft's plans for a more cohesive overall storyline for the series</a>, found within its Animus Hub. This will launch alongside Shadows, and serve as a primary home for ongoing story content and free rewards. (Eurogamer recently got to take a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animus-hub-revealed-ubisofts-new-assassins-creed-start-screen-and-modern-day-story-wrapper-thats-definitely-not-just-another-launcher">deep dive into Assassin's Creed's new Animus Hub</a>, and everything we know so far that it'll contain.)
</p><p>
Shadows looks to tell a completely new story, with a modern day now set in the "near future". Could fresh DLC for Mirage be used to tie up some dangling plot threads, perhaps - particularly what happened next in the series' modern day, following the ending of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>?
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer recently went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">hands-on with Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which our Katharine described as the series' "biggest shake-up of the series in years".

<p>"Part of releasing the game in Early Access means we do take on the risk of negative early reviews and feedback," the post reads. "Everyone has different expectations for an Early Access game.</p>
<p>"All the feedback about the lack of keybinding and sensitivity controls, FPS drops etc. is extremely reasonable. And, receiving large quantities of the same actionable requests actually helps us determine how to prioritise future updates."</p>

<p>Then, last week, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1534840/view/519703537657053480?l=english">new patch</a> was released to add a rework of medkits as suggested by the game's community.</p>
<p>Now, players will start each run of the roguelike with a medkit and these will auto-refill on the launch of a run. This should make the game a little easier to get going with.</p>
<p>Other changes include reducing enemy aggro distance, increasing the time between waves of enemies in Crown Fights, and bug fixes.</p>
<p>While reaction to the game has been mixed, it's clear Heart Machine is listening and acting directly upon community suggestions.</p>
<p>"We made Hyper Light Breaker with Early Access in mind to have it grow and evolve with our community, and today's patch represents that as we made some pretty big changes, including a rework on Medkits, thanks to your feedback," said Michael Clark, lead producer on Hyper Light Breaker.</p>
<p>An early access roadmap is also planned for later this week, to firm up the studio's ongoing plans for the game.</p>
<p>"Hyper Light Breaker is really, really punishing," wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyper-light-breaker-offers-loot-lore-and-the-tiniest-touch-of-fortnite">Christian Donlan on Hyper Light Breaker's release</a>. "It's punishing in a way that I understand, because it's probably balanced for multiplayer and because this is probably a small team who can't endlessly feed new stuff into the procedural maw, and so they need players to take their time with what's there. But it makes for an uninviting introduction if you're a fan of the series and you love these games for their lonely beauty."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A modding group has doubled down on its plans to port GTA: Vice City content into GTA 4's engine, despite publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> stepping in to apparently try and shut the enterprise down.</p>
<p>The project - known as GTA Vice City Nextgen Edition - ports the missions, side missions, cutscenes and world from Vice City into the GTA 4 engine. It was created by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@revteamhq">Revolution Team</a>, and initially required players own a legitimate copy of GTA 4 in order to play.</p>
<p>But the group has now switched its plans, after the YouTube channel charting its progress was suddenly taken down - something Revolution Team has blamed Take-Two for. Now, the project has been released and can work on its own - without requiring players buy GTA 4 first - in response to what the group has called Take-Two's "cruel move".</p>

<p>"Friends, [you] probably already know that just two days before the release, Take-Two Interactive deleted our YouTube channel without any warning or attempt to contact us," reads a statement published by Revolution Team. "A huge amount of effort and time was invested into the channel, including hundreds of hours of streams dedicated to the mod's development."</p><p>"Additionally, we lost connection with our international audience, which was a significant part of our community. The teaser trailer for GTA Vice City Nextgen Edition gained over 100,000 views and 1500 comments in less than a day. Unfortunately, the channel was removed without any possibility of recovery."</p>
<p>The days since the channel's removal have been "emotionally tough", Revolution Team continued.</p>
<p>"The most important thing now is that we released the project on the promised date," the statement adds. "It's unclear how long it will remain publicly available or whether there will be demands to take it down. We are not opposed to reuploads, but we cannot openly encourage you to do so. Do as you see fit."</p>
<p>Revolution Team's initial plan to release the project with the requirement players needed the original GTA 4 game was designed to be a mark of "respect to the publisher", it said. "However, over the past two days, we have completely rebuilt the project, and it is now available as a standalone 'installation-ready package'."</p>
<p>Footage of the mod in action has since been released on YouTube, and you can check it out below.</p>

<p>This is not the only GTA mod to make headlines recently.</p>
<p>Earlier in this month, a mod known as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-shuts-down-ambitious-mod-that-put-gta-4s-liberty-city-in-grand-theft-auto-5">Liberty City Preservation Project was taken down after its creators were contacted by Rockstar</a>. "This isn't a DMCA, rather a friendly takedown, mutually agreed upon by all parties involved. There is no negativity between us and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> / Take-Two Interactive," the Liberty City Preservation Project said.</p><p>As for the next entry in Rockstar's series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-highly-confident-of-autumn-2025-release-window">GTA 6 is set to release this year</a>. In the meantime, Grand Taking Ages, a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> "parody" that uses AI artwork and voice acting, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-parody-grand-taking-ages-set-to-launch-on-steam-despite-playstation-pulling-it-from-store">done enough to convince Valve it should launch on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
