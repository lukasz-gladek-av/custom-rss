            <p>There is a new patch for co-op climbing caper Peak, which adds a colour blindness mode as well as a number of fixes and balance tweaks.</p>
<p>The colour blindness mode, which has long been requested by the Peak community, adds patterns to the game's different coloured berries. This, the developer says, will help "further differentiate them", and make the berries more readily able to be told apart.</p>
<p>On the balance side of things, the Peak team has among other things made Nest Eggs heavier.</p>

<p>You can check out the latest patch notes for Peak below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Colour Blindness Mode! This adds patterns to differently-colored berries to further differentiate them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Balance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced the maximum time before the first tornado can spawn.</li>
<li>Slightly increased the minimum time before a tornado can spawn again.</li>
<li>Slightly reduced the commonness of the "Tornado Hell" biome variant,</li>
<li>It is now wayyy less likely that the maze is blocked after entering the TOMB.</li>
<li>Nest Eggs now weigh more to match the weight of the Egg inside.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Major fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where players would be unable to obtain the Endurance Badge!</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where The Scoutmaster couldn't climb walls. This went unnoticed for a while because he can jump pretty high, but now he should be even scarier.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Scrolls and Berrynanas and other objects that change form when used would drop the new item instead of putting it in your hands.</li>
<li>Fixed a potential issue where playing a vanilla game after previously having visual mods installed (or playing with a modded player while not having their same mods installed) could cause a variety of visual and functionality issues. This could include, but was not limited to, players permanently showing up as a default skin in the endgame screen even if not wearing modded cosmetics, as well as the endgame report breaking entirely and preventing certain achievements from being obtained.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, rarely, getting caught in a tornado would cause the game to freeze on the loading screen upon failing a run.</li>
<li>We gave the backpack new physics that should prevent more cases where people would lose their backpack.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minor fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Magic Bugle and Scoutmaster's Bugle play at a strangely low volume. (its not too loud now I promise)</li>
<li>The Guidebook renders at a higher resolution if you set the Render Scale to low.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where placing a Scout Cannon atop a jellyfish could cause a softlock.</li>
<li>A missing treetop has been added to a branch on the giant tree.</li>
<li>Removed the annoying flicker on the end game countdown.</li>
<li>Removed Scoutmaster grain effect in Photosensitive Mode.</li>
<li>Rainbow stamina bar is now slower in Photosensitive Mode.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where it said "Move" instead of "Interact" on a prompt in the Controls page.</li>
</ul></blockquote>

            <p>Konami has released a patch for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> on Xbox Series X/S and PS5, which among other things will update some of those wonky textures during certain scenes.</p>
<p>This update will also be coming to Steam, though for now we don't have a date, with Konami merely saying it will be "soon".</p>
<p>In addition, Konami has promised stability improvements are being investigated, along with an option to select a preferred rendering mode on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>. However Konami still needs "some time to review and address" these issues.</p>

            <p>Feeling spritely? This shouldn't help: the original PlayStation console was released 30 years ago today in the United States, on 9th September 1995. It was a machine that would change gaming forever.</p>
<p>We celebrated the 30th anniversary of PS1 last December because that's when it was first introduced, in Japan, on 3rd December 1994. Sony's debut console was released in Europe at a similar time to America, on 29th September 1995.</p>
<p>It's such a momentous milestone we dedicated a week to it, writing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-30th-anniversary">a collection of articles</a> about the grey, oversized Discman-style box. The articles ranged from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/writing-wipeout-one-of-gamings-most-enduring-vivid-worlds">love-letters to WipEout</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-playstation-propelled-tekken-into-the-big-time">Tekken</a>, to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-playstation-30th-anniversary-interview-with-shawn-layden-it-was-a-fight-to-get-the-sony-name-on-the-machine-they-didnt-want-to-be-associated-with-it">interviews with former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden</a>, who was there at the time (which is why his photograph is in black and white).</p>
<p>We also asked for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tell-us-your-favourite-playstation-memory-and-win-a-games-worth-of-ps-store-vouchers">your memories of PS1</a>, which you provided in abundance - there were more than 300 comments. And I read them all. And they're all lovely; funny, heartfelt, poignant. Prepare yourself: it's an emotional ride.</p>
<p>As the regional reverberations of the PS1 anniversary are felt again, I thought I'd resurface some pieces you've maybe not read.</p>

            <p>A number of in-game websites and apps which may well be a part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> have leaked, and they appear to parody the likes of Uber and WhatsApp.</p>
<p>A post on the <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1002286-gta-vi-general-speculation-discussion-vice-city-baby/page/51/#comment-1072587065">GTA Forums</a> from insider Tez2 (known for their Rockstar tips) revealed they had come across "domains all registered on May 27 under Take-Two's nameservers" which they believe relate to Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>"These domains could be in-game sites that [Rockstar] may redirect to 6's page later on, like what we've seen with 4 and 5," they wrote.</p>
<p>These sites are:</p>
<ul>
<li>what-up.app</li>
<li>rydeme.app</li>
<li>buckme.app</li>
<li>leonidagov.org</li>
<li>brianandbradley.com</li>
<li>hookers-galore.com</li>
<li>wipeoutcornskin.com</li>
</ul>
<p>What-up.app is a name you may recognise. This chap was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-acknowledges-gargantuan-grand-theft-auto-6-leak">uncovered in the GTA 6 leaks from 2022</a>, and is supposed to be the copycat for Whatsapp.</p>
<p>Some in the GTA Forums have surmised that rydeme will be an Uber-like app, and buckme could be something along the lines of a Patreon or PayPal equivalent (though, my first thought was some kind of deliverable bucking bronco like rodeo stall you find in Western bars). Hookers-galore seems pretty self explanatory.</p><p>Some have speculated that brianandbradley.com, meanwhile, is a spin on Florida law firm Morgan and Morgan, which despite where my Rockstar trained mind went, is unrelated to Red Dead's Arthur Morgan. Anyway, I had a quick google, and apparently historically Morgan and Morgan is considered a firm focused on personal injury, medical malpractice and class action lawsuits. Personal injury sounds like something many GTA characters will be dealing with, so that would fit.</p>
<p>Again, there is nothing official to say these apps and websites will definitely appear in GTA 6, but it doesn't seem unreasonable to imagine Jason and Lucia using an app to call a car to take them across Vice City.</p>
