            <p>The original Sonic the Hedgehog game was "terribly controversial" at Sega, according to PlayStation's Mark Cerny, who's detailed more on its development in a new interview.</p>
<p>Cerny was lead system architect for Sony's PS4 and PS5 consoles, but began his career at Atari before moving to Sega and founding its Sega Technical Institute in America. It's this team that developed the sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-the-hedgehog-2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>, after the original game was made in Japan.</p>
<p>The first time he saw Sonic the Hedgehog, it was "obvious that game was going to do great," Cerny told journalist Simon Parkin on the <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console/episodes/mark-cerny-lead-system-architect-playstation-4-5">My Perfect Console podcast</a>.</p>

<p>Was there pressure to find a mascot to rival Nintendo's Mario? "The pressure was to make a game that could sell a million copies," Cerny replied, before describing the game as "terribly controversial" due to the increase in resources focused on the game, which ultimately led to Sonic co-creator Yuji Naka's departure from Sega.</p><p>"Part of the idea there was…Let's put much more resource on this project than we usually do," said Cerny. "As I said, what's usual? Three people, three months. So they were going to do, if I remember properly, three people, ten months. But they ended up needing four and a half people for 14 months. I'm a little hazy on the numbers these days. And though it was a success, they blew their budget so badly by putting in a couple of engineers on this that Yuji Naka was just getting yelled at and quit the company."</p>
<p>Cerny admitted "it pays off fantastically well for Sega" due to the success of the game. "But Yuji Naka was pretty tired of the situation by that point." Cerny described Naka as a "top level creator making $60,000 [after a bonus] in their best year and getting yelled at a lot. And he'd had it."</p>
<p>Famously, development on the Sonic series after the success of the first game was split. Development of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 moved to the Sega Technical Institute in America founded by Cerny and included original developers Naka and designer Hirokazu Yasuhara. Meanwhile in Japan, another Sonic game was developed by original co-creator Naoto Ohshima intended to be a sequel, but ultimately became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-cd">Sonic CD</a>.</p>
<p>Cerny noted "nobody realised how big Sonic was going to be" in either Sega Japan or America. "Sonic ships and almost immediately I've got the team ready to work on a sequel and do you want a sequel? And I've got Sega of America saying no, it's much too soon. Do a different game first," he said.</p>
<p>That soon changed following sales of Sonic the Hedgehog over its first Christmas period, quickly leading to the sequel's development by STI.</p>
<p>Cerny described his time at Sega overall as "brutal". "Atari was great, Sega was difficult," he said. "It was a difficult environment with a hard-driving president who was going to force us to success. That isn't to say that there wasn't an incredible amount of cameraderie with the people that I worked with but it was just brutal. Nakayama [president of Sega Japan] would come in and he would just give it to us if he didn't see happening what he wanted to see."</p>
<p>"Getting out of Sega was a very healthy thing," he said, before adding "Nakayama is amazing. He understood games like nobody's business...It's just that working for Nakayama - that was difficult and seven years of that was enough."</p>
<p>Sonic co-creator Yuji Naka has since had something of a fall from grace. After eventually leaving Sega in 2006, he later developed Balan Wonderworld with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> which was considered a critical and commercial flop on its release in 2021. He soon left the company and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-creator-yuji-naka-was-removed-as-director-of-balan-wonderworld-before-disastrous-launch">accused Square Enix of removing him as director six months before its launch</a>.</p>
<p>Then, in 2022, he was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-creator-yuji-naka-reportedly-arrested-for-insider-trading">arrested for insider trading at Square Enix</a>, which led to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-co-creator-yuji-naka-receives-suspended-prison-sentence-for-insider-trading">suspended prison sentence</a>.</p>

            <p>Developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> may have its sights currently set on the upcoming James Bond origin story 007 First Light, but that doesn't mean we have seen the last of the studio's Hitman series.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/hitman-eminem-slim-shady-mission-io-interactive-ceo-interview-1236595901/">Variety</a>,  IO Interactive's head Hakan Abrak assured fellow Agent 47 fans that "of course" there will be more Hitman in the future. Exactly how far in the future, though, remains to be seen.</p>

<p>"Right now, I think we need to get to the other side of this year and next year you'll get more news about Hitman co-op, because I think co-op is a really, really good extension to the universe, and will introduce very interesting mechanics and combinations in World of Assassination," Abrak told the publication.</p>
<p>"But we will, after that, be talking about the next Hitman - because, of course, there's going to be a next Hitman."</p>
<p>And, thank goodness for that! It's always a hoot prowling around the many opulent settings Agent 47 gets sent off to, before (if you are anything like me) running away in a hail of bullets as any attempts at stealth get put back on the shelf.</p><p>As for that aforementioned co-op mode, this will feature two names you may recognise: Stone and Knight. These two popped up in the Hitman Sniper mode. On the co-op mode's eventual release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-hitman-co-op-mode-with-stone-and-knight-is-in-the-works-at-io-interactive">players will be able to pop into "exciting missions" from the Hitman world with their pal by their side</a>. These missions will "challenge" players to rethink how they approach things now they are going in as one of a pair. </p>

<p>In addition to Hitman and 007 First Light, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-confirms-development-of-bold-new-online-fantasy-rpg">IO Interactive also has a multiplayer fantasy project in the works</a>, aptly codenamed Project Fantasy. This upcoming release, which hasn't officially been revealed yet, is "extremely ambitious and really cool and is something [other] than a gun in a suit", Abrak said. "So that's also good to have something new within the creative outlook here."</p>
<p>But, before that arrives, 007 First Light will be shooting onto PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> and PC on 27th March next year. The studio has promised a deeper look at the gameplay we can all expect to see as part of a dedicated stream it is hosting tomorrow, 3rd December, at 4pm UK time.</p>

<p>For more on IOI and Bond, our Alex recently got a closer look at 007 First Light, stating it's "so much more than Hitman", and thanks to "its 'breathing' structure", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-james-bond-preview-hitman-uncharted-comparisons">it looks like "the ultimate composite video game"</a>.</p>

            <p>More people have downloaded mods for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> than Larian ever expected. "Way more than we ever expected," studio founder and Baldur's Gate 3 director <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1995565346892513574?s=20">Swen Vincke shared on X</a>. The total downloaded-mods number now stands at more than 350m, the studio revealed, and more than 10,000 mods have been uploaded for other people to play.</p>
<p>"This is insane," Vincke added in a video accompanying <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/community-update-36-a-very-moddy-christmas_146">a Baldur's Gate 3 community update</a>. From giant bunnies to giant... Not going to do that! It's absolutely amazing. So you should give yourselves a pat on the back, have a shot of whiskey, and have a party. Have a great holiday everybody."</p>
<p>To mark the occasion, Larian shared some of its favourite Baldur's Gate 3 mods, including the mod Vincke stopped himself from mentioning in the video: Wither's big naturals. Yes, tits. Yes, an undead, mostly mummified character with big boobs, because why not?</p>

<p>The tongue-in-cheek mod recommendations do not stop there. Why not add a selection of inflatable pool floaties to your fantasy adventure, for instance? You could wear an inflatable duck on your head. For some reason. Why not also paint yourself in clown make-up? Few things are as likely to strike fear into the hearts of your enemies.</p><p>You might also be interested in a car wildshape because perhaps you think yourself a Transformer. Would you like to make Astarian even more handsome? Would you like to redress Raphael? Lightsabers? A grenade launcher? Vintage firearms? Bald heads? It's all here, and there's a good chance you'll recognise the person in Larian's videos demonstrating them. Hello Aoife!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">Larian is currently hard at work on two new projects</a>, and both of them will be based on the studio's own original properties, or IP. We don't know what they are or whether they'll have anything to do with the studio's existing Divinity franchise, but we certainly can expect them to follow the role-playing tradition of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divinity-original-sin">Divinity: Original Sin</a> and Baldur's Gate 3, for that is Larian's thing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-dd-owner-wizards-says-of-course-we-want-to-do-a-successor-to-baldurs-gate-3-we-wonder-who-will-make-it-and-what-kind-of-game-it-will-be">Dungeons &amp; Dragons owner Wizards of the Coast seems keen on making a follow-up to Baldur's Gate 3</a>, which may or may not be called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> 4, and is probably in development at Wizards' internal studio Invoke, which has already confirmed it is working on "a triple-A game set in the world's most iconic role-playing universe - Dungeons &amp; Dragons". I wonder if The Game Awards will provide a time and place for that reveal.</p>

            <p>The upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> film adaptation from Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions has found its director.</p>
<p>Fast &amp; Furious director Justin Lin will be at the helm of the upcoming adaptation, which is based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a>' space-based shooter. After directing The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift and Fast &amp; Furious, Lin went on to also direct Fast Five, Fast &amp; Furious 6 and F9: The Fast Saga.</p>

<p>Along with his directing duties, Lin will also produce the Helldivers film via his Perfect Storm Entertainment banner, along with Hutch Parker and PlayStation Productions' Asad Qizilbash and Carter Swan.</p>
<p>According to The Hollywood Reporter's sources, while Lin himself is not a gamer, he used this to his advantage when pitching his take for the film.</p>
<p>"He aims to find the humanity in the characters and weave timely themes into the story, while building out a world and mythology," <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/">the publication stated</a>. "There are plenty of details waiting to be drawn in, something that is compelling to the filmmaker."</p>
<p> Joining Lin is writer Gary Dauberman, who is known for penning horror movies It and Annabelle.</p>

<p>The Helldivers film was initially announced back in January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">along with a Horizon Zero Dawn adaptation</a>. Soon after it was announced, Arrowhead's Johan Pilestedt confirmed the developer will be involved with the upcoming film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-will-be-involved-in-film-adaptation-but-not-as-much-as-you-may-have-hoped">but in a somewhat limited capacity</a>.</p><p>In the meantime while we wait for Sony's Helldivers film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-largest-fan-film-premieres-today-and-even-arrowhead-is-waiting-to-watch">there is a fan made release available to watch now</a>. Created by volunteers at YouTube channel Plot Coalition, the film is almost an hour in length, making it longer than any other Helldivers fan project made to date.</p>

            <p>Blizzard has promised players of World of Warcraft that player housing, which launches in a limited form today (tomorrow across Europe), is going to be expanded in every patch and in future expansions released for the online game.</p>
<p>"I will reassure you as much as possible that that is the case," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-asked-world-of-warcrafts-housing-team-about-couples-housing-more-neighborhoods-hidden-secrets-decorating-contests-and-more">World of Warcraft housing lead Jesse Kurlancheek told IGN</a>. "We have a short-term, medium-term, long-term list of features and content that we want to add. We talk about what are we doing in 12.0 and 12.1 and 12.2 and beyond pretty regularly [...] We're thinking about things as not just a single feature release, [but as ] a very long-running thing."</p>
<p>Senior UX designer Joanna Giannullis added: "I think we've already always started wanting to make sure that we were kind of in it for the long haul. This is a feature that we know is going to live in the game for some time to come, and we're going to be adding more to it with every, not just every patch, but in future expansions, and we want to keep growing it."</p>

<p>The full player-housing release happens alongside new expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcraft-expansion-midnight-release-date">World of Warcraft: Midnight, which launches 2nd March</a>, but people who've pre-ordered it can dabble in a slimmer version of housing starting today. Incidentally, if you're planning to try housing out, there's <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24244464">a Getting Started explainer on the WoW website</a> you might find handy.</p><p>Housing is arguably the largest systemic addition to World of Warcraft ever, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-in-the-making-world-of-warcrafts-player-housing-the-most-ambitious-expansion-feature-ever-says-blizzard">housing has been in development for several years</a>. It's a system that allows players to not only own and customise houses, but also to organise themselves into neighbourhoods - an aspect <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-kind-of-a-sociological-experiment-for-blizzard-world-of-warcraft-neighbourhoods-azeroth-nimbys-and-curtain-twitching-drama-is-all-part-of-the-plan">Blizzard has talked about before as being a kind of "sociological experiment"</a>.</p>
<p>The main thing to remember about housing's soft-launch today, according to Kurlancheek and Giannullis, is that it's a start. There are many more things to come to it, both in the weeks and months to come, leading up to Midnight's launch, and beyond.</p>
<p>One of the most requested features, the housing duo revealed, is co-ownership of a house - or the ability to temporarily give someone edit access to it. "Yeah, one [that] comes up a lot is, 'I'm not especially creative or I'm not great with a toolset - can my friend come over and sort of deck out my apartment or deck out my house?' Yeah, it's certainly on our radar," Kurlancheek said. This could even give rise to a whole cottage industry of players who specialise in this work.</p>

<blockquote><em>"The idea of us building together is super compelling"</em></blockquote>
<p>This co-operative building could be developed even further into communal building. "The idea of us building together is super compelling, I think," Kurlancheek added. "As soon as players can build something themselves, we want to build things together. And so, what that ends up being depends on what people are trying to do or what is interesting for them. If it is just us coming together in the town square and hanging up balloons or whatever, because we're having a birthday party, what does that look like? Versus we want to build a racetrack for our mounts around the outside of a town and what does that look like? Versus we want to do prop hunts and duelling things and all of these different potential pieces of stuff."</p>
<p>But though there are many ideas, both from inside Blizzard and from the community, there is "a fairly hard line" drawn regarding things that can potentially increase a character's power. "You should never feel that, 'I have to go engage in a housing loop because if I don't, I can't attune to a raid, or I won't have a three percent DPS boost or whatever,'" said Kurlancheek. "So that sort of practical stuff is really not on the table."</p><p>Reactions to player housing from the alpha already seem very favourable, although there is some concern about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-microtransaction-crap-can-go-jump-in-a-lake-world-of-warcrafts-new-real-money-housing-currency-is-predictably-causing-a-stink">the new Hearthsteel currency Blizzard is introducing to World of Warcraft</a> to buy cosmetics related to it. This is the first real-money currency added to the game in 20 years, and while Blizzard assures us it'll only be used for housing specifically, and that the majority of house items you won't be able to buy that way, there's worry that these standards will gradually erode over time.</p>
