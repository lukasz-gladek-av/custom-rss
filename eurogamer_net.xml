            <p>How time flies. It only seems like yesterday we had the last State of Play, and yet here we are with Sony delivering a State of Play broadcast this evening from 10pm UK time. We'll be covering all of the announcements, as they happen, right here in this article, as we always do, in exactly the same way. The games will be different, though, I hope.</p>
<p>As always can chat along with us and let us know what you think of the games. Some people like to be mean, others are quite positive about everything - it really depends on if every other game is a soulslike or not.</p>
<p>What's in tonight's show is a bit of a guess at this point. It looks like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sorry-but-dont-expect-to-see-wolverine-at-tomorrows-playstation-state-of-play">Wolverine isn't going to be here</a>, but we expect to see Saros, and perhaps an update on Fairgames if it's still in development. Shall we say it? Worth a go, I guess... maybe there'll be a Bloodborne remaster too? Unlikely, but one day, maybe, if we all hope hard enough.</p>
<p><em>Anyway.</em></p>
<p>PlayStation at 10pm, then. Join us for what is bound to be an hour or so of at least mild entertainment.</p>

            <p>Fable creator Peter Molyneux has said there was a pitch document for Fable 4 at Lionhead Studios, but that he left the company before he could see what came of it.</p>
<p>"We did have a proposition for Fable 4," Molyneux told me this week in a video interview. "And again, it was the thought of moving through time a little bit more, a little bit further." What he means by that is Fable 4 would adhere to an overarching storyline that connected the Fable games together.</p>
<p>"When we were thinking about Fable 1, we were also thinking about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fable-2">Fable 2</a>," he explained. "We thought in Fable 1, it was the start of the Heroes Guild, and then Fable 2 will move time on. And we always had this notion that industry and technology were stamping out the magic in Fable, and you can see that with the three [games]."</p>
<p>So: "We had a pitch document," he said, "which I think was proposed at the time. But that was just at the time that I was leaving Lionhead so I wasn't there for the full exploration of it." In other words, he didn't get to pitch it, or see where it went. "No, no, I didn't."</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/peter-molyneux-exits-microsoft-lionhead">Peter Molyneux left Microsoft and Lionhead in 2012</a>, after being shunted up the hierarchy to become a high-ranking member of Microsoft Studios. The last Fable game he was involved in was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fable-the-journey-review">the on-rails Kinect spin-off Fable: The Journey</a>, in 2012, which wasn't bad actually, but felt like it had been created out of a necessity to have Microsoft studios make Kinect games. There was also a<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fable-heroes-review">n Xbox Live multiplayer Fable beat-'em-up that year called Fable Heroes</a>. Perhaps, in Microsoft's eyes, Fable had become oversaturated.</p>
<p>It has of course been many years now since we've had a mainline Fable game, hence the excitement around Playground's Fable series reboot, which is simply called Fable, and which we got <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SYbP7PGmfg">a first proper gameplay glimpse at earlier this year</a>. Molyneux told me he watched this so I asked what he thought of it, to which he replied, "Well, I cried, obviously." We had previously been talking about how emotional he can be.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you why," he added. "Because it just made me unbelievably proud that we created something which persists and that people care about. What they've done is they've taken that world and they made it far more graphically rich than we were ever capable of doing. I would say it looks a little bit antiseptically clean - that's a little bit of a tiny negative. But I love the idea that they're revisiting the original story. And I love the idea that it's somewhat like the original Fable was. It just makes me feel insanely proud that something we worked so hard on is going to continue to exist."</p>
<blockquote><em>"It just made me unbelievably proud that we created something which persists and that people care about"</em></blockquote>
<p>Molyneux went on to say that Playground Games hadn't contacted him to talk about Fable, which he completely understands. "They wanted it to be their own creation," he said. "And they come across as such wonderful fans." All of the quirky parts of the series seem to be present and correct in Playground's interpretation. It must be flattering to see, I said. "Incredibly flattering," he responded. "It all looked fantastic to me."</p>
<p>Playground's Fable reboot will be released in the autumn on PC and Xbox and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Peter Molyneux is going back to his god game roots with a new game of his own, Masters of Albion, which shares more than a few similarities with the Fable series. That game enters early access on 22nd April. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-going-to-be-a-very-long-goodbye-peter-molyneuxs-last-game-will-be-masters-of-albion-but-thats-not-necessarily-as-simple-as-it-sounds">Masters of Albion will also, apparently, be Peter Molyneux's last video game</a> - a claim I explored with him in a larger interview.</p>

            <p>
Yet more evidence pointing to the existence of Ubisoft's much-rumoured but still doggedly unannounced Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake has surfaced, this time in the form of an official art book currently set to release this March.
</p>
<p>
Reports of a Black Flag remake first surfaced in 2023, when it was claimed the celebrated 2013 open-world pirate game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-reportedly-remaking-rollicking-pirate-adventure-assassins-creed-black-flag">getting the do-over treatment from Skull and Bones developer Ubisoft Singapore</a>. At the time, the project was said to still be "at least a few years" away from release.
</p>
<p>
Since then, evidence of the remake's existence has continued to mount, despite Ubisoft's persistent silence. Last year, for instance, actor Matt Ryan - who played Black Flag protagonist Edward Kenway - hinted the remake was close to release, only for Ubisoft to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-threatened-with-legal-action-following-remake-slip-up">threaten him with legal action</a>.
</p>
<p>
Then, in December, something called Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">briefly appeared on the PEGI website</a>, rated 18 for violence, bad language, and in-game purchases. But it didn't stop there; January saw the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-statue-leaks">leak of a suspiciously timed Assassin's Creed Black Flag collectible figurine</a> featuring Kenway sat on a treasure chest, seemingly corroborating earlier word from statue maker PureArts that something Black Flag-y was "going on". We've also seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-music-upload">Black Flag sea shanties officially uploaded to YouTube</a>, later blamed on "technical issues", and even a sort of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-claims-assassins-creed-blag-flag-music-reuploads-were-due-to-technical-issues-and-nothing-more">acknowledgment-adjancet meme post</a> from Ubisoft's social media team.
</p><p>
And now, a Black Flag art book can be tossed onto the growing evidence pile. As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remaster-art-book-appears-at-amazon-now-up-for-preorder">spotted by IGN</a>, the tome (listed under the name Assassin's Creed Black Flag Remaster - Art Book) was <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1835417701?tag=i0e25-21&amp;ascsubtag=05aB1hBAYymJ9H38fEE0g5D">recently added to Amazon UK</a> with a recommended retail price of £39.99 - currently £29.95 - and a release date of 24th March, 2026. Titan, a company that's released numerous officially licensed Assassin's Creed art books over the years, is listed as the publisher.
</p>
<p>
Assuming the Black Flag art book is legit, its listed release would coincide with the original launch window for Ubisoft's conspicuous, and much-discussed, "unannounced game" - a title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-could-set-sail-before-april">widely believed to be the Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake</a>. However, as part of a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset" announced in January, the company pushed the title - alongside six other unspecified games - into its next financial year, starting April 2026, to "ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met".
</p>
<p>
That shakeup also saw the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">cancellation of seven games</a> - including Ubisoft's troubled and long-in-the-works Price of Persia: The Sands of Time remake - alongside the closure of two studios, the restructuring of several more, and the implementation of return-to-office mandates. This week, 1,200 Ubisoft workers <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/at-least-1200-ubisoft-workers-strike-in-response-to-recent-restructuring">began a three-day strike</a> in response to the company's recent moves.
