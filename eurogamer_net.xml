            <p>Distribution for the newly announced Steam hardware will be the same as the Steam Deck, Valve has confirmed, though it's working on improvements.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer, Kaci Aitchison Boyle from Valve's PR team discussed how distribution will work for the release of the new hardware. Essentially, Valve will be self-distributing just like it did with the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>However, players have criticised the distribution methods in the past, due to delays or missed deliveries across several regions, as well as a slow global rollout.</p>
<p>Aitchison Boyle has assured that Valve is making improvements.</p>
<p>"Right now, we are distributing the exact same way as Steam Deck," she said, adding customers can expect the same availability and partners across regions.</p>
<p>"For us, it's important to just keep making Steam distribution better and better - and distribute times, add regions and things like that.</p>
<p>"We've been working on that in the background. Even just from the Steam Deck launch, I think now the experience of buying one of our harder products on the West Coast is quite a bit better than it was a few years ago. We've also been adding regions like Australia last year.</p>
<p>"So we're continually working on improving Steam distribution for hardware."</p>
<p>Valve has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-valve-announces-standalone-steam-frame-vr-headset-plus-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-revival">today announced new Steam hardware</a>, namely a standalone Steam Frame VR headset, as well as Steam Machine console and Steam Controller. There's no release date yet, but they're expected next year.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how widely available they'll be.</p>

            <p>Valve's new Steam hardware has been developed based on the team's experience of PC gaming, rather than comparing to other console makers like PlayStation or Xbox.</p>
<p>The company has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-valve-announces-standalone-steam-frame-vr-headset-plus-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-revival">today announced new Steam hardware</a>, namely a standalone Steam Frame VR headset, a Steam Machine console, and Steam Controller. But rather than entering the console space to compete with established companies, Valve's new hardware is an evolution of PC gaming.</p>
<p>"We typically just work back from our own experience playing PC games and what we wish was possible to do and what we hear our users say as well," Kaci Aitchison Boyle from Valve's PR team told Eurogamer.</p>
<p>"PC gaming has a lot of value to offer. There are a lot of game genres that started on PC because it's an open platform where people could mod and experiment and do things that are not necessarily possible if the distribution of software is restricted in any way."</p>
<p>She added: "We don't really tend to work back from what's happening in other spaces and we try and focus on our audience."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rog-xbox-ally-x-review">Microsoft has just released its ROG Ally X handheld</a> in partnership with Asus, seemingly in direct competition with Valve's Steam Deck.</p>
<p>"If anything, we're kind of excited that other people are looking at the handheld space, the PC handheld space, because we see it as more options for people to play all of their games," said Aitchison Boyle.</p>
<p>"So we kind of see it as a sign of success that Steam Deck was actually something very meaningful and valuable for customers. If SteamOS lets the same dynamic apply to the kind of set-top box or living room form-factor, we'll be really happy with that as well."</p><p>Valve's new Steam hardware will be released next year, though release dates are currently unknown. If you're hoping to get your hands on it all, know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-confirms-its-continually-improving-how-it-distributes-hardware-ahead-of-the-release-of-its-new-steam-machines">Valve will continue to self-distribute hardware just as it did with the Steam Deck</a>.</p>
