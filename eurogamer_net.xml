Civilization 7 cross-play between PC and consoles is currently disabled, as developer Firaxis has launched a new update just for the PC, Max, Linux and Steam Deck versions of the game. 
</p>
<p>
"To expedite updates to the PC experience, we will sometimes deploy patches to PC at a different cadence than we do on consoles - including today's Patch 1.0.1," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1295660/view/508445806184891583">Firaxis wrote</a>.
</p>
<p>
"As a result, cross-play between PC players and console players is temporarily disabled. This will have no impact on console players attempting cross-platform play with other console players, nor on PC-to-PC multiplayer."
</p>
<p>
Fan feedback to Civilization 7's advanced access period is reflected in today's patch, Firaxis continued, with "some" of the initial issues raised by players addressed.

<p>
Civilization 7 is now generally available, after a week of advanced access which saw the game land with a "mixed" user response on Steam.
</p>
<p>
Today, Firaxis published its PC patch notes for Civilization 7 update 1.0.1 - and thanked fans who had flagged bugs so far. 
</p>
<p>
"We are reading and collecting all of your feedback, and will continue to do so as we roll out improvements going forward," Firaxis said, highlighting its previous pledge to turn the game around.
</p>
<p>
The patch includes a string of gameplay bug fixes, tweaks to the game's AI opponents, and some small improvements to the game's UI. 
</p>
<p>
From a quick scan, there's nothing too meaty here yet - and so it's worth also flagging the work currently being taken on by modders to improve the game themselves. 
</p>
<p>
Take, for instance, the <a href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/resources/sukritacts-simple-ui-adjustments.31860/">Simple UI Adjustments Mod</a>, which adds a series of handy floating tooltips that save you from having to dig through menus to find information about a particular tile. Handy!
</p>
<p>
Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firaxis-acknowledges-civilization-7-issues-fixes-incoming">Firaxis told fans it would "need some time to digest all of your feedback"</a>, but pledged to prioritise community-requested features such as being able to pick starting and ending Ages, and adding hotseat multiplayer.
</p>
<p>
"A competent entry with some poorly executed ideas and a striking lack of personality," Sin Vega wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review">Eurogamer's Civilization 7 review</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>Civilization 7 update 1.0.1 - Windows PC/Mac/Linux/Steam Deck patch notes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue causing Ages in Epic and Marathon speed games to be shorter than intended.</li>
<li>City States will now turn into Friendly Independent Powers on Age Transition instead of disappearing completely. They will also now start with more units in Exploration and Modern Ages.</li>
<li>Fixed inconsistencies with Naval Combat.</li>
<li>Naval Units will use the correct Combat Strength values when attacking another Naval Unit in all instances.</li>
<li>Naval Units will properly take reciprocal damage after attacking another Naval Unit.</li>
<li>Naval Units will more consistently move into the attacked tile after defeating another Naval Unit.</li>
<li>Completing the final milestone of a Legacy Path no longer adds Age Progress in the Modern Age to ensure you have more time to complete a Victory.</li>
<li>Towns will now switch their focus back to Growing town automatically if they are no longer eligible for their chosen Focus (for example, if their population decreases) until they are eligible again.</li>
<li>Future Civic is now repeatable in all Ages. The cost of Future Tech and Future Civic will now increase more when repeated.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue after too many bonuses to Growth where Food needed for the next growth event became negative.</li>
<li>Improvements to Rail Networks aimed at increasing the reliability of Settlements connecting to the Rail Network over water by building Ports. This should apply as long as the Capital either has a Port or is connected by rail to a settlement with a Port.</li>
<li>Made improvements to the Loyalty Crisis in the Antiquity Age, including giving the ability to purchase Villas in towns during this crisis, giving another way to manage the happiness of your settlements.</li>
<li>A note about cross-play multiplayer: To expedite updates to the PC experience, we will sometimes deploy patches to PC at a different cadence than we do on consoles - including today's Patch 1.0.1. As a result, cross-play between PC players and console players is temporarily disabled. This will have no impact on console players attempting cross-platform play with other console players, nor on PC-to-PC multiplayer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>AI will now offer high-value Cities less often during Peace Deals.</li>
<li>In Modern, AI will now declare war less often at the start of the age.</li>
<li>In Modern, AI will now consider Ideology more before Declaring War or offering Peace.</li>
<li>Other Leaders now have a decreased desire for war if neither party has an Ideology.</li>
<li>Other Leaders now have an increased desire for war with players of Opposing ideologies.</li>
<li>Other Leaders now have a decreased desire for Peace with players of opposing Ideologies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Camera</strong></p><p>

Fixed an issue on native-resolutions where the camera would focus on the lower end of the map when clicking on the minimap.

</p><p><strong>UI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Replaced the Simplified Chinese font with the font used in Civilization VI while we work on additional improvements for future patches.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Settlement menu fails to open when clicking on a non-player's Settlement Banner in gameplay.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where yield icons fail to populate on the now available buildings when converting a town to city.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where some text was cut off on the Global Yields Breakdown screen.</li>
<li>Added a notification for completed Espionage actions, so that you can more easily check the results of their Espionage actions.</li>
<li>City projects no longer appear to be purchasable.</li>
<li>Your current religion is now displayed first in the belief picker tabs.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a Districtâ€™s health bar would remain on-screen after being fully healed.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Leaders fail to have a portrait when the relationship has changed during gameplay.</li>
<li>Improved the alignment of leader names and portraits on the Age Summary, when viewing the Overview screen of the Victories Rankings.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the background color remains the default color when the user changes it in the Player Customize tab.</li>

</ul>

PUBG: Battlegrounds maker Krafton has said it generated record sales and profit last year - which was its best in the history of the company.
</p>
<p>
Originally launched in 2017, battle royale PUBG shifted to a free-to-play model in 2022 and has seen continued growth ever since. 2024 saw the game hit its best-ever concurrent peak - of 890,000 players.
</p>
<p>
Spending in PUBG across PC and consoles globally last year totalled "nearly" a 1tn korean won - around Â£556m - breaking Krafton's own record for the game.

<p>
On smartphones, PUBG's breakout spin-off Battlegrounds Mobile India saw its sales rise by 35.7 percent year-on-year, meanwhile.
</p>
<p>
Next up for Krafton is its plan to secure a new big franchise IP,  while continuing to update PUBG and grow the game's Indian mobile spin-off. 
</p>
<p>
The company will launch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gorgeous-sims-like-inzoi-delayed-into-next-year-to-give-it-a-stronger-foundation">inZoi, a visually-impressive Sims-like game, on 28th March via Steam early access</a>, following a delay from last year. Could this be Krafton's next big franchise?
</p>
<p>
Other upcoming titles include fantasy extraction RPG Dark and Darker Mobile, underwater survival sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>, and pioneer life simulation game Dinkum Together.
</p>
<p>Last year, Krafton hit the headlines when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton-following-microsofts-studio-closure-in-may">scooped up Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks</a>, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Microsoft effectively closed the studio</a>. There's no official word - yet - on what that team is up to next, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/krafton-acquired-tango-gameworks-to-maintain-its-legacy-rather-than-cash-in">Krafton has acknowledged the fan desire for a Hi-Fi Rush sequel</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Robert Yang's next game is Tryhard, a turn-based RPG in the world of rugby described as part of the "sportslike" genre.</p>
<p>Yang is known for his controversial games exploring explicit queer themes of sexuality, from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/robert-yangs-the-tearoom-appeals-to-censors-by-swapping-cocks-for-glocks">bathroom simulator The Tearoom</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/play-as-a-burly-sexy-lumberjack-in-this-forestry-sim">sexy lumberjack game Logjam</a>.</p>
<p>Tryhard is decidedly more tame, though judging by its trailer it still includes LGBT+ representation with its relationships.</p>

<p>Set in New Zealand, players will be tasked with managing an underdog rugby club. "Everyone expects you to fail," the Steam description reads. "You've never even played rugby before! But you'll prove them wrong, challenge the champs, and win the Ramphorlie Shield." How very Ted Lasso!</p>
<p>There will be management sim elements, a branching story, relationships to manage and - perhaps most interestingly - rugby matches based on turn-based battles between mixed gender teams.</p>
<p>There's even a dog who can join your team.</p>
<p>Tryhard will be the first full release from Grapefruit Games, a studio co-founded by Yang that has previously worked on artistic and support projects.</p>
<p>As part of the game's announcement, the studio has released its <a href="https://grapefruitgames.com/sportslike/">"sportslike manifesto"</a> to establish the genre. "The sports game is too busy," it reads. "Everyone expects franchise-career modes, motion captured stadiums, sweaty grass physics, and the latest microtransactions."</p>
<p>By contrast, a sportslike game focuses on the way people interact with a sport - not just playing the sport itself, but the people behind the scenes, its news and history, and the lives of players.</p>
<p>The studio suggests a number of already-released games that could be considered sportslikes, including 2017's Golf Story and 2023's Roller Drama. Presumably the RPG mode of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-golf">Mario Golf</a>'s Game Boy outing would count too.</p>
<p>Tryhard is yet to receive a release date, but is available to wishlist now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3443270/Tryhard/">Steam</a>.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a> developer Sloclap is another studio attempting to redefine the sports genre, as its next game - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-developers-next-game-will-give-football-a-fresh-perspective">Rematch</a> - is a fresh take on football action.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> developer Shift Up expects the forthcoming PC release of its action game to exceed sales of the console release.</p>
<p>As part of its latest financial report, the company was asked about the expected results of Stellar Blade on PC, where it noted the "higher market share" for PC over consoles. It follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-coming-to-pc-in-2025-sales-expected-to-exceed-console-release">similar comments from its previous financial report</a>.</p>
<p>"In the AAA game market, PC devices have a higher market share than consoles, so we expect the performance of the PC version to exceed that of the console version," the company said. "We are particularly observing trends such as the significant expansion of the single-player action game market in the Asian gaming industry."</p>

<p>That "significant expansion" is presumably due to the success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>.</p>
<p>The company is analysing the market for comparison and also promised an optimised experience, even on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>"We have identified and analysed both successful and underperforming cases of console exclusives released on PC, and we are preparing to release the game in a way that ensures continued success in the PC market," the company continued.</p>
<p>"This will include optimisation, enhancing user convenience, adding supplementary content, and tailored marketing strategies unique to Shift Up. In particular, we plan to optimise the game to ensure smooth gameplay even in UMPC (Steam Deck) environments."</p>
<p>The release of Stellar Blade on PC, expected at some point this year, will follow other PlayStation exclusives like God of War, Horizon: Zero Dawn, and most recently <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>.</p>
<p>However, these releases have seen diminishing returns in terms of player numbers. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">Helldivers 2 remains Sony's biggest success on PC</a>, released simultaneously across PC and console.</p>
<p>Other companies are also looking at PC releases of console games. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> in particular has launched a multiplatform strategy, with the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth both released on PC in the last year following PS5 exclusivity.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, meanwhile, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick teased a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-pc-version-teased-by-take-two-boss-acknowledges-platforms-growing-importance">possible PC release for GTA 6</a>, though Rockstar is officially focused on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S for launch.</p>
<p>While Shift Up didn't reveal further sales figures for Stellar Blade, it previously announced it had sold over a million copies in its first couple of months. As a result, Shift Up has now recorded its highest annual revenue with a 30 percent year-on-year increase.</p>
<p>"Despite being a narrative-based single-player game with a defined ending, it has been continuously updated like a live-service game, and has steadily built a strong global fandom for the Stellar Blade IP," the company said.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-stellar-blade-on-ps5-pro-a-simple-but-hugely-effective-upgrade">game received a PS5 Pro patch</a> in time for the new console's release, which Digital Foundry described as a "hugely effective upgrade".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Marvel Rivals has quickly U-turned on plans to reset player ranks twice per season, after an outburst of fan feedback against the idea.
</p>
<p>
Developer <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250210/40954_1210988.html">NetEase last night announced</a> it would implement a mid-season rank reset "to shake up the battlefield" on 21st February.
</p>
<p>
Alongside this, the addition of Fantastic Four members The Thing and Human Torch were also confirmed, completing the superhero family's addition to Marvel Rivals' roster (and tying in nicely with Marvel's newly-released trailer for the Pedro Pascal-starring reboot).

<p>
But feedback to the sudden reveal of a mid-season rank reset was swift, and decidedly negative. 
</p>
<p>
"This is an extremely demotivating idea to rank reset every 45 days," <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1889003952877740498">one fan wrote on social media</a>. "This game is not a battle royale."
</p>
<p>
"No rank resets," wrote another. "It's not a fun and engaging mechanic stop resetting the ranks. I will stop playing this fkn game if you use this cheap tactic to grip players."
</p>
<p>
Roughly 12 hours later, and <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250211/40954_1211177.html">NetEase has this morning issued a fresh update</a> - confirming that the mid-season ranked reset had been scrapped.
</p>
<p>
"We received a wealth of feedback from the community," NetEase confirmed. "A common concern was the pressure associated with having a rank reset every half-season, which has made participating in competitive mode less enjoyable. In light of the community's input, we have decided to make some changes.
</p>
<p>
"When the second half of the season begins, there will be no rank reset," the developer continued. "Players will retain their ranks and scores from the end of the first half. To earn new rewards, players simply need to complete 10 matches in Competitive mode and meet the relevant conditions by the end of the season."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://x.com/itskyoji/status/1889208880174907838">Said one fan in response</a>: "A dev team that makes adjustments almost immediately, unlike my teammates."
</p>
<p>
Marvel Rivals debuted late last year and quickly found an audience, despite an initially mixed criticial response. "NetEase's spin on the hero battler is complex and moreish, but rarely much actual fun," our Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-review">Eurogamer's Marvel Rivals review</a>.

            <p>As is tradition at this point, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will have a poison swamp just like previous Souls games.</p>
<p>That said, it's a little different this time. Nightreign will feature "large-scale changes to terrain in the form of procedurally appearing volcanos or swamps or forests".</p>
<p>That's according to director Junya Ishizaki, who spoke to PC Gamer (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-nightreigns-map-will-sometimes-see-large-scale-changes-to-terrain-including-procedurally-appearing-volcanos-forests-and-yes-swamps/">GamesRadar</a>) to discuss these changes to the game's map.</p>

<p>"We wanted the map itself to be a giant dungeon, so players have the chance to traverse and explore a different way every time they play," he says. "You have to choose the boss you want to face at the end of the third day.</p>
<p>"Once you've made that choice, maybe you have an idea of how you want to strategize against that boss, and this might change how you approach the map. We wanted to offer players that agency, to decide 'I need to go after a poison weapon this time to face this boss'."</p>
<p>It certainly seems inspired by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s map changes, that altered familiar locations with the addition of volcanoes and swamps over time, albeit here with the possibility of happening - or not - each match. As previously announced, Nightreign also features a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-is-making-more-elden-ring-after-all-with-the-co-op-elden-ring-night-reign">battle royale-style shrinking zone, as players outlast its day and night cycle</a> over three in-game days. The procedural nature of these terrain changes also fits with what seems to be a roguelike-esque structure to the game.</p>
<p>Indeed, the reveal trailer for the game appears to show a variety of environments we can now assume are procedurally generated, including a seemingly poisonous area and a lava-filled cave.</p>

<p>Swamps aren't the only returning feature either, as Ishizaki previously confirmed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-will-feature-enemies-from-dark-souls-director-confirms">"small number" of enemies from across the Dark Souls series will appear in Nightreign</a>. Eagle-eyed fans already spotted The Nameless King from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a> in the trailer, but presumably more will be included, perhaps as part of these randomised events?</p>
<p>It won't be long before we can find out more about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-beta-test-dates-times-register">Nightreign as its beta test takes place this weekend</a> for those who previously registered. The test will last from Friday 14th February to Monday 17th February as a series of three hour long sessions.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
