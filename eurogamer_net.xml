            <p>
Craig Mazin, the showrunner behind HBO's acclaimed live-action TV adaptation of The Last of Us, has confirmed the team is working to a four season plan, insisting there's "no way" the narrative can be wrapped up in three seasons.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time the magic number four has been floated in regard to The Last of Us' TV adaptation, of course. Mazin started the chatter all the way back in 2023, suggesting the show could "end up being three or five [seasons]. But four seems like a good number. Some seasons, because of the story we're telling, will need fewer episodes and some will need more."
</p>
<p>
Then earlier this year, HBO exec Francesca Orsi mirrored those comments, saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbo-expects-the-last-of-us-to-run-for-four-seasons">it was "looking like four seasons" for the adaption</a>, but stressed HBO didn't have "a complete or final plan". Instead, she appeared to defer to Mazin, adding, "I wouldn't want to confirm that, but it's looking like this season and then two more seasons after this and we're done."
</p>
<p>
And now Mazin has seemingly <a href="https://collider.com/the-last-of-us-series-length-season-3-showrunner-craig-mazin/">made that official in an interview with Collider</a>. Discussing the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/joel-dominates-headlines-but-its-tommy-who-shines-in-the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-two">big Joel moment that kicked off season two</a>, Mazin explained, "It's so impactful. It's such a narrative nuclear bomb that it's hard to wander away from it. We can't really take a break and move off to the side and do a Bill and Frank story. I'm not sure that will necessarily be true for Season 3. I think we'll have a little more room there."
</p>
<p>
"There's a decent chance that Season 3 will be longer than Season 2," he elaborated, "just because the manner of that narrative and the opportunities it affords us are a little different... but certainly, there's no way to complete this narrative in a third season. Hopefully, we'll earn our keep enough to come back and finish it in a fourth. That's the most likely outcome."
</p>
<p>
As for season two, there's just one episode to go following this week's sixth instalment. Opinions on the second season have been a little more mixed compared to the widely acclaimed original, with Eurogamer's The Last of Us superfan Victoria Kennedy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-six-recaptures-some-much-needed-levity-but-with-only-one-episode-left-have-the-showrunners-bitten-off-more-than-they-can-chew">recently pondering if Mazin and team might have bitten off more than they can chew</a>.

            <p>
It feels like we've only just been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">introduced to Naughty Dog's sci-fi action-adventure Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, but studio boss Neil Druckmann has now reiterated there's a second game in development too.
</p>
<p>
Druckmann shared the news in <a href="https://audioboom.com/posts/8721579-the-last-of-us-neil-druckmann-talks-to-press-x">conversation with the Press X to Continue podcast</a>, explaining that alongside Intergalactic - where's he's serving as writer and creative director - "there's another game that's being worked on at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> where I am more of a producer role."
</p>
<p>
"And I get to mentor and watch this other team, and give feedback and be, like, the executive in the room," he continued. "I enjoy all those roles, and the fact that I jump between one to the next, it makes my job very exciting and always feeling fresh. I'm never bored."

<p>
This isn't the first time we've heard multiple games are in development at Naughty Dog; the studio said it had "more than one ambitious, brand-new single player game" in the works back in 2023, when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">announced the cancellation of The Last of Us Online</a>, and Druckmann <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-neil-druckmann-says">used similar phrasing in an interview last summer</a>. His latest statement is, however, the first confirmation multiple projects are still underway since then.
</p>
<p>
As to what this second project might be, Druckmann offered no hints, but it's possible it's being helmed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted-the-lost-legacy">Uncharted: The Lost Legacy</a> director Shaun Escayg - who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-avengers-creative-director-moves-back-to-naughty-dog">rejoined Naughty Dog back in 2021</a> after serving as creative director on Crystal Dynamics' Marvel Avengers.
</p>
<p>
Druckmann has, of course, been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-3-could-be-one-more-chapter-to-this-story-says-co-creator-druckmann">teasing a third The Last of Us game</a> in recent years, but he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-boss-says-dont-bet-on-there-being-a-the-last-of-us-part-3">seemingly backtracked on that in March</a>, telling fans, "Don't bet on there being more." For now, his main focus appears to be Intergalactic, which is currently expected to arrive in 2027. And while details on the game are currently limited, Druckmann recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-actor-lands-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-role-after-impressing-neil-druckmann-on-set">named another actor who's been cast in Intergalactic</a> after their appearance in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-six-recaptures-some-much-needed-levity-but-with-only-one-episode-left-have-the-showrunners-bitten-off-more-than-they-can-chew">The Last of Us' television show</a>.

        <p>Company is taking complaints "seriously."</p>

            <p>
Board game company WizKids has apologised for its recent line of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> miniatures, acknowledging the melty faced monstrosities "missed the mark" and offering full refunds.
</p>
<p>
WizKids announced the range - officially known as Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Icons Of The Realms: Baldur's Gate 3 - at the end of last year, and US customers began receiving their £50/$49.99, seven-character sets earlier this month. However, rather than the crisply detailed renditions of Astarion, Karlach, Gale, Shadowheart, Wyll, Lae'zel and Withers featured in WizKids' promotional material, customers instead received <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/1ko1rb6/apparently_bg3_miniatures_from_wizkids_started_to/">pre-painted miniatures that wouldn't have looked out of place in a Borja church fresco</a> - and complaints were swift.
</p>
<p>
And now, with more and more images of the squishy faced disappointments being shared online, WizKids has been forced to concede that, yes, its Baldur's Gate 3 miniatures are in fact rubbish. "As a company, WizKids seeks to create products that enhance and add to the enjoyment of game play," it wrote <a href="https://wizkids.com/recent-announcements-2/baldurs-gate-3-character-boxed-set-update/">on its website</a>. "We want our customers to build long-lasting, fond memories around game nights with friends and family using our products."
</p>

<p>
"Unfortunately, we missed the mark on this goal with the D&amp;D Icons of the Realms: Baldur's Gate 3 Character Boxed Set," it continued. "If you purchased this set through our online stores, we will be offering a full refund to those who are unsatisfied with their set... We're aware of the recent reports and complaints and are taking them seriously. Our team is currently investigating these issues and taking action to make this right for those whose purchases were negatively affected and to ensure these issues do not recur in future products and reprints."
</p>
<p>
WizKids notes anyone who purchased the box set from a third-party retailer should contact them directly for a refund, while those wishing for a replacement - one that "meets the standards expected" - can do so <a href="https://win.wizkids.com/replacements/">via its website</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Please accept our sincerest apologies for the frustration and disappointment these quality issues caused our customers," WizKids concluded. "We, too, feel the same as the final product did not meet our expectations or that of our Wizards of the Coast partner. Our teams are working to find the best solutions to resolve this for all involved and to work with you, our customers, to fix this. We appreciate your patience as we focus on getting back to those affected and helping them with their refunds in a timely manner."
</p>
<p>
It's hardly a fitting celebration of developer Larian's acclaimed 2023 RPG, but with the studio's work on the game now largely at an end following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-bids-final-farewell-for-real-this-time">April's massive Patch 8</a>, Astarion, Karlach, and friends are now entirely at Dungeons &amp; Dragons owner Hasbro's mercy. And if that means licensing them out to be turned into unrecgonsisable bits of plastic, then so be. Hasbro has, of course, already confirmed it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-wants-baldurs-gate-4-but-isnt-in-a-hurry">keen to find a studio to make Baldur's Gate 4</a>, but with Larian now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-boss-says-studio-didnt-do-dlc-because-it-was-the-boring-option">working on its own mysterious projects</a>, it's unclear how far off that may be.
