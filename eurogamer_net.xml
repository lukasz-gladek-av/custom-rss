            <p>As we prepare for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/007-first-light">007 First Light</a>, set to finally launch in May, and celebrate <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-3-world-of-assassination-all-time-classic">Hitman 3's five-year anniversary</a>, we've received news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman: World of Assassination</a> is, at long last, getting cross-progression support.</p>
<p>We figured this would happen at some point, especially after last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> port and with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/hitman/new-game-after-world-of-assassination-co-op">more content set to arrive this year</a>, but with all eyes on James Bond's game right now, it was hard to predict its arrival. Today, 20th January, <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman/blogs/2026/cross-progression-coming-to-hitman-woa-and-new-look-to-ioi-account">IOI confirmed</a> the feature will be available starting 3rd February. Additionally, a "brand-new, fresh look launches today" for the IOI Account service on browsers and mobile phones.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://ioisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/32645592211229-HITMAN-World-of-Assassination-Cross-Progression-Guide">full cross-progression guide</a> with FAQ was shared, but the gist of the news is that players will be able to take their Hitman: WoA (the combination of Hitman 1, 2, and 3 under a single roof) progress with them no matter what device they play on. For example, you could launch your PC save on the PS5 in your living room and later continue your killing sprees on the go with the Switch 2 version... as long as you have access to an online connection.</p>
<p>IOI also revealed that a Steam patch (3.250.1) will be arriving next week, which will ensure everything is working for the new cross-progression functionality. Players will have to select, after logging on their IOI Account, a "primary platform" the other devices will follow. Game licences, DLC purchases, and unlocks tied to DLCs aren't shared, meaning you'll have to own all required content on each platform where you want to use cross-progression. That's how the feature has always worked, but it's good to remind the more casual crowd of its limitations.</p><p>On the matter of the saves themselves, IOI also notes "old save games created on a non-primary linked account will not be loadable while Cross-Progression is active." In summary, the system will only recognize saves tied to the IOI Account system, so we recommend making sure everything's properly updated and connected if you intend to embrace this feature.</p>
<p>As a footnote, IOI has also reminded players the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-2">Hitman 2</a> to 3 "carryover" process will close come 3rd February so all progress is locked to the latest iteration of the three-part sandbox game. The company's approach to progression and upgrades has always been slightly too convoluted and often led to confusion, so it makes sense the devs are being extra careful ahead of this major feature drop.</p>
<p>If you're waiting for news on Hitman's future, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/of-course-there-will-be-more-hitman-after-007-first-light-io-interactive-assures">IOI hasn't shied away from teasing there are plans in place</a>, but don't expect a reveal until World of Assassination's co-op mode and 007 First Light are out.</p>
