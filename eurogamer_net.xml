<p>"Yooka-Replaylee is built to shine on every platform, and we're chuffed to bits it's on Switch 2 from day one, it holds a special place in our hearts (and hands)," said Gavin Price, studio director at Playtonic."It's bigger, brighter, bolder, and packed with all the little touches we always dreamed of. We can't wait for players to jump in."</p>
<p>"It's rare to see a game get this kind of second life - not as a remaster, but as a true reinvention," added Ami Blaire, chief marketing officer at PM Studios. "It's the kind of release that reminds you why I fell in love with platform games in the first place."</p>

<p>On Yooka-Replaylee's release, fans can expect the following key features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><strong>REFINED STORY</strong> - The events of the first game are relived and retold by the main characters, Yooka and Laylee. New sequences and plot points have been added throughout the adventure at key milestones too.</li>
<li><strong>MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER</strong> - With an art and animations overhaul and enhanced performance and resolution, the favourite buddy duo has never looked or moved better.</li>
<li><strong>BRAND-NEW REXTRO'S ARCADE</strong> - The old minigames are no more! Instead you'll jump into the feet of Rextro the dinosaur and undertake brand-new isometric platforming challenges for collectible rewards.</li>
<li><strong>NEW COLLECTIBLE CURRENCY</strong> - Capital B's inept minions have dropped their hard-earned coins all over the place. Collect the official currency of the Hivory Towers to spend on video games' most beloved sentient vending Machine.</li>
<li><strong>VENDI HAS PLENTY TO OFFER</strong> - Tonics are back with all new flavours! With the option to equip multiple game-changing enhancements, you can truly customise your playstyle. And as if that wasn't enough, Vendi has new lines of merchandise for the modern fashionable adventurer.</li>
<li><strong>NAVIGATING THE WORLD</strong> - Yooka-Replaylee introduces a brand-new map and collectibles tracker, making it easier for you to traverse the environments, track NPC and Pagie locations along with tracking their progress. We're also introducing a new character in the form of (book)Mark who acts as your warp point and guide.</li>
<li><strong>REVISED CONTROLS &amp; CAMERA</strong> - The buddy-duo now has access to their entire move set from the start of the game and can sequence the moves together a lot smoother than in the original game. This combined with the revamped camera controls makes Yooka-Replaylee feel like a lot more modern, snappier experience while also directly addressing player feedback on the original game.</li>
<li><strong>A DREAMY ORCHESTRAL SOUNDTRACK</strong> - The original score from famed video game composers Grant Kirkhope (Banjo-Kazooie) and David Wise (Donkey Kong Country) returns but as a beautifully arranged orchestral score. Now seriously, clean out those ears.</li>
</ul>

<p>"Right now, and after only a short time with it, Yooka-Replaylee is something I can absolutely picture children perhaps a little younger than my own - who are 12 and 10 - whiling away some pleasurable hours with," I said in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/has-playtonic-done-enough-to-entice-players-back-to-the-world-of-yooka-replaylee-i-think-it-depends-on-the-price">Eurogamer's Yooka-Replaylee preview</a>.</p>
<p>"There are items to collect, secrets to discover, baddies to bop and the colours are a kaleidoscope of joy. Even though overall it was relatively simple, it made me chuckle and smile."</p>
