            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> is pretty sure plenty of people will hate his upcoming release OD, but he is ok with that in the short term.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">Xbox horror game OD was first announced back in 2023</a>, though Kojima stopped short of actually telling us all that much about it. Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer and Udo Kier are all tied to the project, and there is also some involvement with director Jordan Peele, who is known for his films Get Out and Nope.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Kojima said it's "a game and at the same time a movie and at the same time a new form of media", so make of that what you will.</p>

<p>The game creator has now shared a little bit more about OD, though I really do mean a little. In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-interview">Ssense</a>, Kojima said OD was "something totally different", and people are going to either "love it or hate it".</p>
<p>The publication added Kojima will of course digest all the various reactions to OD when it comes out, citing platforms like YouTube and X, but as for the actual reception to the game when it releases? Well, apparently that won't matter to Kojima, at least for another decade or so.</p>
<p>"The real evaluations come after - 10 or 20 years from now," Kojima told the publication. This attitude isn't new for Kojima. Earlier this year, following positive playtests for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-isnt-interested-in-appealing-to-the-mass-market-but-death-stranding-2-playtests-proving-popular">Kojima said he wasn't "interested in appealing to the mass market"</a>.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting, the critical reception to the first Death Stranding has warmed since its release, so perhaps we'll see the same with OD in future.</p>

<p>As well as OD on Xbox, Kojima also has an action-espionage game in the works with PlayStation known as Physint. This game came about when the designer - who is among many things known for his part in bringing the Metal Gear games to life - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-says-he-decided-to-make-physint-for-fans-after-sickness-made-him-reconsider-his-priorities">experienced a period of sickness and surgery which when combined with thoughts of his own mortality convinced him to reassess what his priorities are</a>, and instead do something fans had been asking him to do for years.</p>
<p>"Every day on social media, from users all around the world, people have been asking me to create another Metal Gear and stuff like that," Kojima said last year.</p>
<p>More recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">Kojima released Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, to wide acclaim. As for Konami's upcoming remake of the third Metal Gear Solid game, no, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-hideo-kojima-wont-be-playing-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Kojima will not be playing it</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/like-marmite-hideo-kojima-says-you-will-either-love-or-hate-od]]></content:encoded>
