            <p>
With <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> now less than a week away, Microsoft has announced it'll be the latest to title to join Xbox's steadily growing "Stream your own games" service.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-insiders-can-now-play-select-games-they-own-on-their-console-using-cloud-streaming">launched the ability for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers to play "select" games they already own via streaming</a> last November, some five years after announcing the feature was in the works. It's a service distinct from the ability to play Xbox Game Pass titles via streaming, and one that currently only supports a limited number of games.
</p>
<p>
At launch, 50 titles featured on Microsoft's "Steam your own games" list - including the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> - and that's since expanded to encompass more than 70 games. Ubisoft already has a big presence on the list (many of its more recent titles including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown are on there), so it's perhaps not to surprising to hear Assassin's Creed Shadows is up next.

<p>
Microsoft announced Shadows' upcoming inclusion on Xbox's "Stream your own games" list in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xbox.com/post/3lkdwjnalz22p">message shared on social media</a>. The company hasn't yet specified exactly <em>when</em> it'll be available for streaming by Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers - it's only said "soon" so far - but hopefully it won't be too long after its release next week. And if it's launch information you're after, Ubisoft has already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-global-launch-times-detailed-pre-load-live-now-on-xbox">detailed Shadows' global release times</a>.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows, of course, whisks the series to 16th-century Japan, with players witnessing events through the eyes of two new protagonists: shinobi Fujibayashi Naoe and samurai Yasuke. Eurogamer's Katharine Castle reckoned Shadows was "shaping up to be one of the most promising [series entries] so far" when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-should-work-on-steam-deck-after-all-says-ubisoft">she took a look earlier this year</a>. And if you're contemplating other platforms, you might like to know Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-details-ps5-pro-enhancements-including-extended-raytracing">confirmed PS5 Pro enhancements</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-should-work-on-steam-deck-after-all-says-ubisoft">Steam Deck support</a> after doing a bit of a U-turn.
