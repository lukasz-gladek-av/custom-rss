            <p>Australian pressure group Collective Shout has claimed responsibility for the recent Itch.io and Steam developments that have seen the platforms change how they deal with - and in some cases remove - NSFW games and content from their respective platforms.</p>
<p>The group had already been closely linked with the situation, which has seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-introduces-vague-new-rules-banning-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-to-appease-credit-card-companies">Itch.io and Steam scramble to appease payment providers like Visa</a> as they suddenly took an interest in the kind of games available on the platforms, especially those which contravened rules and "standards" the payment providers apparently had. It led to Itch.io deindexing all NSFW content from its browse and search pages, and Steam introducing vague new rules about adult content, while removing a slew of games.</p>
<p>"In response to false claims and misinformation about our campaign, we're setting the record straight," <a href="https://www.facebook.com/collectiveshout/posts/pfbid0To1Tp69DJ3P39utywXrMbFwGERcnWmcSBmQMZoUhL9EDu9sZjXBgAgrMDRJFs46Kl">wrote Collective Shout in a Facebook update</a>. "Some have asked why we involved payment processors, and others have claimed we are responsible for Itch.io removing all NSFW content.</p>

<p>"We raised our objection to r*pe and incest games on Steam for months, and they ignored us for months. We approached payment processors because Steam did not respond to us.</p>
<p>"We called on Itch.io to remove r*pe and incest games that we argued normalised violence and abuse of women. Itch.io made the decision to remove all NSFW content. Our objections were to content that involved s*xualised violence and torture of women."</p>

The group's actions - a mixture of petitioning, emailing, and lobbying - began in early April and led to the game being removed from sale later that month.</p>

</figure>
<p>The group continued to send hundreds of emails to Valve about problematic games that remained on Steam, but said it wasn't until it began lobbying payment processors such as Visa, PayPal and MasterCard that change began to happen.</p>
<p>This rush to appease payment processors has met with pushback from parts of the gaming community. There have been collective efforts, for instance, to counter-lobby payment companies like Visa in an effort to turn them around.</p>
<p>An open letter template to Visa, shared on Reddit (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/steam-gaming-industry-visa-payment-processors-adult-games-banned/">TheGamer</a>), reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am concerned customer about Visa's recent efforts to censor adult content on prominent online game retailers, specifically the platforms Steam and Itch.io. As a long-time Visa customer, I see this as a massive overreach into controlling what entirely legal actions/purchases customers are allowed to put their money towards.</p>
<p>"Visa has no right to dictate my or other consumers' behavior or to pressure free markets to comply with vague, morally-grounded rules enforced by payment processing providers. Unless these Draconian impositions are not reversed, I will have no choice but to stop dealing with Visa and instead swap to competing companies not directly involved in censorship efforts, namely Discover and AmericanExpress."</p></blockquote>
<p>Some people have reportedly had responses from Visa to this letter, which insist the company is not moderating content, does not make "moral judgements" about content, and supports the sale of all content considered "legal". Visa's alleged response reads (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1m9ly2j/so_i_got_a_response_from_visa/">via Reddit</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While we explicitly prohibit legal activity on our network, we are equally committed to protecting legal commerce. If a transaction is legal, our policy is to process the transaction. We do not make moral judgements on legal purchases made by consumers.</p>
<p>"Visa does not moderate content sold by merchants, nor do we have visibility into the specific goods or services sold when we process a transaction. When a legally operating merchant faces an elevated risk of illegal activity, we require enhanced safeguards for the banks supporting those merchants."</p></blockquote>
<p>No one will lament the removal of No Mercy from sale on Steam, but whenever a net like this is thrown over an entire area of perceived problematic content, there will be well-intentioned games caught in the net too. Specifically, LGBTQ+ games are under threat - games that don't align with the Christian values underpinning the pressure group Collective Shout.</p>

            <p>PlayStation 5 owners are reportedly getting two more Xbox-published titles added to their roster.</p>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-gears-of-war-e-day-and-state-of-decay-3-are-coming-to-ps5">MP1st</a>, both Gears of War: E-Day and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/state-of-decay-3">State of Decay 3</a> will be coming to PS5.</p>
<p>The publication cited resumes of developers working on each game, with both listing the PS5 as a target platform for their respective titles.</p>

<p>Xbox has been steadily adding more of its games to additional platforms. Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-xbox-exclusive-games-heading-to-ps5-and-switch-according-to-phil-spencer">Microsoft confirmed its plans to bring four previously Xbox-exclusive first-party titles to PlayStation 5 and Switch</a>, with more to follow. And follow, they have.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-published-sea-of-thieves-reportedly-surpasses-1m-sales-on-playstation-5">successful release of Grounded, Sea of Thieves and Hi-Fi Rush across additional platforms</a>, Microsoft has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-forza-horizon-5-is-ps5s-highest-selling-game-of-the-year-so-far-says-analyst">since released the likes of Forza Horizon 5</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-selling-faster-on-ps5-than-steam-and-xbox">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on PlayStation</a>. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-coming-to-playstation">original Gears of War has been confirmed to be coming to PlayStation later this year</a>, as part of the revamped "Reloaded" edition of the game.</p>
<p>It therefore would not be surprising to see Gears of War: E-Day pop up on PlayStation 5, even if not as a day one release. The next new entry in the series is a prequel title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marcus-fenix-returns-in-gears-of-war-prequel-e-day">set 14 years before the events of the original game</a>. Gears of War: E-Day is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bulletstorm-studio-confirms-project-maverick-is-a-gears-of-war-game">being co-developed with People Can Fly</a>. Late last year, it was revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-is-so-back-as-original-voice-talents-are-confirmed-for-gears-of-war-e-day">John DiMiaggio and Carlos Ferro will be reprising their roles as Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago</a> in Gears of War: E-Day.</p>
<p>As for State of Decay 3, this leads one to wonder whether the first two games in the series may eventually arrive on PlayStation as well. State of Decay 3 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-decay-3-announced">initially announced</a> during Microsoft's 2020 Xbox showcase. Things went dark for a little while, and there were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-decay-3-report-details-troubled-development">reports alleging sexism and mismanagement at developer Undead Labs in 2022</a>. The game subsequently reappeared last year, with a new trailer.</p>
<p>To accompany the trailer, studio head Philip Holt teased some of the ideas driving State of Decay 3's development. "The first thing that I hope people pick up [from the trailer] is that there's four player characters we're highlighting," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-decay-3-resurfaces-after-four-years-with-new-cinematic-trailer">he explained at the time</a>, "three of them start in different places in the world - so we're implying this idea of a shared world experience, not just a ride-along, and that the boundaries in which you can go off independently are going to be much, much greater than they were in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/state-of-decay-2">State of Decay 2</a>."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-state-of-decay-3-and-gears-of-war-e-day-heading-to-ps5-report-claims]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The showrunner behind Amazon's live-action God of War TV series has shared some new details about what we can expect from Kratos and co on the show's release.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://collider.com/god-of-war-series-adaptation-prime-video-update-ron-moore/">Collider</a> at San Diego Comic-Con, series showrunner and former Battlestar Galactica executive producer Ronald D. Moore confirmed Amazon's God of War adaptation will remain largely faithful to Sony Santa Monica's 2018 game, though it won't be a frame-by-frame remake.</p>
<p>"This world and this universe are really rich, and it's interesting, and it's really been fun to adapt," Moore explained. "It's an adaptation, so it's an adaptation-slash-interpretation as you go into live-action, and it's been really fun to sort of go, 'Wow, there's a lot here we can play with. Okay, we want to keep the story. We want to keep the characters and the spirit of it'. There's all this stuff that you can keep turning to for inspiration. </p>
<p>"It's really been interesting."</p>

<p>The showrunner also added that game director Cory Barlog is actively involved with the project, with Moore calling Barlog - who also helmed 2022's God of War sequel Ragnarök - a "genius".</p>
<p>"I've had several meetings with Cory, and you ask Cory, 'Well, tell me about the backstory of this or how this works', and he just can talk because he holds it all in his head," Moore said. "And I usually pride myself about, as a showrunner, I can hold the season in my head. I know what the 10 episodes are, and I can tell you about them. Cory can tell you the whole thing in every possible way - all the mythology, how it connects one to the other, what the puzzles were, why they did this, and what that artifact did. It's really impressive.</p>
<p>"I mean, it is like a gigantic novel, even bigger than the Outlander novels, which is a lot to digest."</p>
<p>
In a separate interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjRM2TFvekQ">IGN</a>, Moore hinted that some of Kratos' previous escapades prior to Santa Monica's God of War reboot may also make an appearance. "You'll have to wait and see," Moore teased. </p>
<p>At the present time, those 10 episodes of Moore's God of War adaptation are still in the "scripts" phase. Filming may begin in 2026 at the earliest, Moore said.</p>

<p>Moore hasn't always been involved with the God of War TV show, only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer">joining the project towards the end of last year</a> following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-reportedly-starting-from-scratch-as-showrunner-departs">departure of the original team</a>. Despite the shakeup, PlayStation Productions' Asad Qizilbash, Carter Swan, Sony's Hermen Hulst, Vertigo's Roy Lee and of course Barlog remain involved with the project. Santa Monica's Jeff Ketcham is also a co-executive producer on Amazon's God of War adaptation.</p>
