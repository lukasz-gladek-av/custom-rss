            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakenings-early-2025-release-date-is-looser-than-you-might-think<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I went to see Funcom's survival MMO <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> last week and one thing I expected while there was a specific release date. The game has an "early 2025" date, currently, which is the time period we're in. So a major press event held within that period of time would be a perfect place to make a release announcement. But no such announcement was made.</p>
<p>It raised questions about how near to release Dune: Awakening actually is. I put these questions to the game's executive producer Scott Junior, and his reply feels like a much more accurate estimation of when to expect it. "I guess it depends how you define early," Junior said. "It could be the first half of '25 - that could be 'early'. So I'll leave it there. It could be the first half of 2025."</p>
<p>Incidentally, Junior's referring to a PC (Steam) release. Console versions are part of the plan but they're coming later at an unspecified date. Also, in case there's any confusion, that's a full 1.0 release - there's no early access. The game has been in closed beta testing already for about a year.</p>

<figcaption>This video is from Gamescom last year so a few things have been altered and tweaked since then, but it's still a solid and very detailed look at the game.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J18oH_FBDYM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another question mark surrounds the game's business model, which again, Funcom hasn't announced. Naturally, there are assumptions of free-to-play and battle pass monetisation methods - Funcom having used an in-game shop in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/conan-exiles">Conan Exiles</a> - but I saw no evidence of a shop in the Dune: Awakening build I played at all.</p><p>Again, I put this to Junior. "We will announce our monetisation strategy a little bit closer to launch," he said. "There will not be any subscription, though - I can say that." He was also happy to clarify, "It will not be free-to-play." Chances are Dune: Awakening will be a premium-priced game.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening is a significant bet for Funcom. It's been in development for five years and more than 400 people have worked on it. It's the studio's biggest ever game, Junior said - bigger than The Secret World and Age of Conan, and an order of magnitude larger than the 30-person team that turned the company's ailing fortunes around with Conan Exiles in 2017. Will it work?</p>
<p>I was impressed by what I played. Dune: Awakening is what a lot of MMOs aren't, necessarily, and that's interesting - conceptually interesting. In bringing survival concepts into a persistent, massively-multiplayer space, Funcom has made something that feels subtly but fundamentally new. It's also the closest recreation we'll get of the filmic world of Dune that's so popular right now.

            <p>
Dragon Age and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> veteran Trick Weekes is among a group of BioWare veterans who have announced they are now looking for work, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-confirms-many-staff-moved-elsewhere-in-ea-as-core-team-focuses-on-mass-effect-5-in-downsized-studio">following the news that BioWare is downsizing</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Posting on social media, Weekes <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/trickweekes.bsky.social/post/3lgw2zbjhfc2v">said</a> they were now seeking a fresh writing position after two decades at BioWare, culminating in work on last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, BioWare publicly confirmed what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-isnt-ready-to-suddenly-have-a-team-of-250-300-people-working-on-it-now-dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-done">former studio veteran Mark Darrah had previously noted</a> - that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a> was still early in development and that the studio had therefore shifted a large number of its staff onto other projects within publisher EA while a small "core team" continued to build the project up. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams">IGN</a> later reported that a smaller group of BioWare employees had been told their roles had been terminated, and been given time to apply for new positions within EA.
</p>
<p>
This was reflected in half a dozen posts on social media from staff impacted by the redundancies, who had held senior positions on Dragon Age: The Veilguard.
</p>
<p>
"I'm now looking for a new writing/narrative position," Weekes wrote. "It's been a privilege to work with so many amazing devs over my 20 years at BioWare, and I will cherish the memories of the wonderful folks in the community I've met along the way. Thank you all."
</p><p>
Weekes served as a writer on Mass Effect 1 and 2, before being promoted to a senior writer on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a>. Weekes contributed to that game's brilliant genophage story arc, and also wrote for many of the series' best DLCs, including Lair of the Shadow Broker, Leviathan and Citadel.
</p>
<p>
More recently, Weekes served as a writer on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>, and then as a lead writer on Dragon Age: The Veilguard.
</p>
<p>
Other BioWare staff who have publicly said they are looking for work include editor <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/karinww.bsky.social/post/3lgw2z5u3js2z">Karin West-Weekes</a> and narrative designer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ryancorm.bsky.social/post/3lgw7ga2li22x">Ryan Cormier</a>, as well as producer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jencheverie.bsky.social/post/3lgw5mb2srs27">Jen Cheverie</a> and systems designer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kaieta.bsky.social/post/3lgvksfm67k2v">Michelle Flamm</a>. 
</p>
<p>
According to a social media <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:tflvwodepuhh3xoi43fvvjua/post/3lgw5bffuqc26">post</a> by former BioWare writer Ann Lemay, who worked at the studio between 2011 and 2016, the studio now no longer employs any writers or editors from that period, following this week's cuts and a number of previous departures.
</p>
<p>
For better or worse, then, it looks like Mass Effect 5 will be written by a completely separate team of people from those who worked on Dragon Age: The Veilguard.
</p>
<p>
BioWare's next big project is being helmed by Mass Effect veteran Mike Gamble, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-developer-bioware-highlights-crack-team-of-trilogy-veterans">alongside a team of returning staff who worked on the original Mass Effect trilogy</a> such as Preston Watamaniuk, Derek Watts and Parrish Ley.
</p>
<p>
This group is now set to continue BioWare's early work on Mass Effect 5, which - despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-teases-mass-effect-5-title-plus-answers-to-trilogy-ending-questions">numerous teases of what's in store</a> - is still several years away.
