            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s horror game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-medium">The Medium</a> is set to be adapted for film, courtesy of It and Annabelle writer-producer Gary Dauberman.</p>
<p>Dauberman has secured the screen rights to the game and will produce the film alongside Mia Maniscalco, the president of Coin Operated - the production company he founded (thanks <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/gary-dauberman-spooky-video-game-the-medium-exclusive-1236333819/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>).</p>
<p>"With its compelling story and incredibly cinematic visuals, The Medium is a natural for a feature film adaptation," said Dauberman.</p>

<p>"When I talked to Piotr [Babieno, Bloober CEO] about it, we immediately connected on our mutual love of horror and his vision for where the genre is headed," he continued. "I have no doubt anything Bloober develops is going to push horror forward in unique and terrifying ways, and I'm excited to be working alongside them."</p>
<p>The search for a writer and director for the film adaptation has now begun.</p>
<p>"Adapting games into films often involves balancing many interests, but with The Medium, I have a deep sense that Gary is the perfect partner for us," said Babieno. "From our very first conversation, I felt we were completely in sync. And every conversation since has only reinforced that feeling."</p>
<p>This won't be the first game adaptation Coin Operated has worked on, after the company co-produced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/full-until-dawn-film-trailer-shows-plenty-of-gruesome-deaths">Until Dawn film</a> with PlayStation Productions.</p>
<p>Dauberman himself is known for writing The Conjuring Universe films Annabelle and The Nun, as well as the 2017 film It and its sequel (based on Stephen King's novel).</p>
<p>The Medium, released in 2021, followed Bloober's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/layers-of-fear">Layers of Fear</a>, Observer and Blair Witch. Set in Poland, it's a psychological horror with a protagonist who's able to travel between two terrifying realms.</p>
<p>Bloober has since seen success with its remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> and is now preparing for the release of Cronos: The New Dawn later this year. According to our preview, it pilfers liberally from other survival horror games.</p>
<p>"In the crudest terms possible, Cronos: The New Dawn is a survival horror game about going back in time to steal things from the past," wrote Eurogamer's Ian Higton in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cronos-the-new-dawn-feels-like-a-combination-of-every-other-survival-horror-game-ive-played-before-it-which-isnt-always-a-good-thing">Cronos preview</a>. "I say this because its developers, Bloober Team also seem to have gone back in time and stolen almost every aspect of Cronos' gameplay from past survival horror titles and more."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/bloobers-the-medium-will-be-adapted-to-film-courtesy-of-it-and-annabelle-writer-producer-gary-dauberman]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Xbox Game Pass made Microsoft almost $5bn in annual revenue last year, proving the company is in a healthy state despite last month's shock layoffs.</p>
<p>During the company's latest earnings call, CEO Satya Nadella stated "Game Pass annual revenue was nearly $5bn for the first time" and Microsoft has 500 million active users across multiple gaming platforms and devices.</p>
<p>Indeed, Microsoft overall has seen an 18 percent increase in revenue (up to $76.4bn) and 23 percent increase in operating income (up to $34.3bn). As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/30/microsoft-q2-2025-earnings">The Guardian</a> has reported, the company's stock rose by more than seven percent on Wednesday, as it remains the world's second-most valuable company.</p>
<p>Said Nadella: "Cloud and AI is the driving force of business transformation across every industry and sector.</p>
<p>"We're innovating across the tech stack to help customers adapt and grow in this new era, and this year, Azure surpassed $75bn in revenue, up 34 percent, driven by growth across all workloads."</p>
<p>The news follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-is-thriving-claims-ceo-doubling-down-on-ai-after-9000-employees-lost-jobs-in-latest-layoffs">a statement from Nadella last week</a>, where he claimed "Microsoft is thriving" and doubled down on the importance of AI.</p>
<p>"What does empowerment look like in the era of AI?" he said. "It's not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It's about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools. That's the shift we are driving - from a software factory to an intelligence engine empowering every person and organisation to build whatever they need to achieve."</p>
<p>But this success comes at a human cost. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">Over 9000 employees were laid off from Microsoft earlier this month</a>, including across its gaming divisions. The likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">The Initiative's Perfect Dark reboot, and a new ZeniMax MMORPG were all cancelled</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/candy-crush-developer-king-reportedly-replacing-laid-off-staff-with-ai-tools-they-helped-to-build">roughly 200 staff from Candy Crush developer King were laid off</a> and reportedly replaced by the AI tools they helped to build.</p>
<p>Microsoft told Eurogamer the layoffs were "necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace".</p>
<p>This Game Pass success is alongside Microsoft's success as a third-party publisher on PlayStation. As we reported earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-games-made-up-most-of-playstations-top-sellers-in-the-us-last-quarter">the majority of PlayStation's top-selling games in the US over the last quarter were published from Microsoft</a>, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, and The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion Remastered.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-hits-almost-5bn-in-annual-revenue-and-microsoft-profits-grow-despite-thousands-laid-off]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Join us today to watch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-direct-announced-for-tomorrow-3">the 31st July Nintendo Direct</a>, live at 2pm UK time (that's 6am PT or 9am ET for those of you watching in the USA, and 3pm CEST for our European readers).

<p>You can watch all the action as it happens via the embedded video below.</p>

<p>Nintendo has already revealed that today's stream will be roughly 25 minutes long, and that it will be specifically targeted at its third-party partners - don't expect anything first-party from Nintendo here (so that's no Fire Emblem, Mario, Pokémon, Smash Bros. and so on). </p>
<p>Maybe we will hear something about Level-5's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/professor-laytons-new-adventure-turns-him-into-lukes-protege">Professor Layton and the New World of Steam</a>, though - it's been a few years since we first saw that game, and I'm hoping it's nearly ready for another blowout, now.</p>
<p>Personally, given that we recently<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-gets-one-final-early-access-patch-before-full-10-release"> saw (two!) 'final updates'</a> for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, I'm praying for a shadow-drop of the highly-anticipated sequel - especially since we know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-is-coming-to-switch-1-2-as-a-timed-console-exclusive">it's going to be a timed console exclusive on Switch and Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>The world and its partner is also holding its collective breath for more news on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> Silksong, though given<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-has-laid-out-its-gamescom-plans-and-they-include-a-playable-demo-of-hollow-knight-silksong"> the game's relationship with Microsoft</a>, I do wonder if all announcements are going to be tied into Xbox-related showcases for the near future.</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the Direct yesterday, a lot of internet chatter has been kicked up, referring to the showcase as the 'game card Direct' - a cynical nod to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-unveils-virtual-game-cards-thatll-let-you-share-you-digital-switch-and-switch-2-games">the controversial rollout of Nintendo's virtual game card system</a> that prevents games from being loaded onto (and played) on more than one Switch system at a time. It appears Nintendo has undermined a lot of the goodwill it generated since the launch of the Switch with this move, and I anticipate comments like this only getting louder and more dismissive in the official chat channels and social media during the presentation proper.
</p>
<p>As ever, we're planning on watching and bringing you all the news as it's revealed. Is there anything you're particularly excited for as part of today's Nintendo Direct?

            <p>The majority of PlayStation's top selling games this last quarter in the US came from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Data <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lv6vqqhmyc2w">shared by Circana analyst Mat Piscatella</a> revealed that between April and June of this year, six out of PlayStation's top 10 selling games in the US were Microsoft published titles, with the likes of The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion Remastered, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and Minecraft all making the cut.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a>, which was released on PlayStation 5 back in April, took the number two spot, coming only behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s co-op spinoff <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a>. Earlier this month, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-forza-horizon-5-is-ps5s-highest-selling-game-of-the-year-so-far-says-analyst">Forza Horizon 5 was the highest-selling game on PS5 this year so far</a>, and had surpassed 3m copies sold.</p>
<p>Sony, meanwhile, only had two titles in PlayStation's top 10 US selling games last quarter - MLB: The Show 25 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>The top 10 selling Playstation games last quarter in the US were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Elden Ring Nightreign (Bandai Namco Entertainment)</li>
<li>Forza Horizon 5 (Microsoft)</li>
<li>The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion Remastered (Microsoft)</li>
<li>MLB: The Show 25 (Sony)</li>
<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 (Microsoft)</li>
<li>Doom: The Dark Ages (Microsoft)</li>
<li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach (Sony)</li>
<li>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (Microsoft)</li>
<li>Minecraft (Microsoft)</li>
<li>Assassin's Creed Shadows (Ubisoft)</li>
</ol>
<p>Xbox's own top sellers differ slightly from PlayStation's. While once again Elden Ring Nightreign takes the top spot for Microsoft's own consoles, the likes of EA's Split Fiction also made it into the top 10. In fact, only four Microsoft published games made it into the Xbox top 10 last quarter.</p>
<p>To compare, the best 10 selling Xbox games for the last quarter in the US were as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Elden Ring Nightreign (Bandai Namco Entertainment)</li>
<li>The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion Remastered (Microsoft)</li>
<li>The Elder Scrolls Online (Microsoft)</li>
<li>Minecraft (Microsoft)</li>
<li>NBA 2K25 (Take-Two Interactive)</li>
<li>WWE 2K25 (Take-Two Interactive)</li>
<li>Assassin's Creed Shadows (Ubisoft)</li>
<li>PGA Tour 2K25 (Take-Two Interactive)</li>
<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 (Microsoft)</li>
<li>Split Fiction (EA)</li>
</ol>
<p>Many big Microsoft titles are notably missing from Xbox's own list, including the likes of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, however it is worth noting that both this game and Doom: The Dark Ages are available via Microsoft's Game Pass subscription service.</p>
<p>In an earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella noted that Microsoft is now the "top publisher" on both Xbox and PlayStation. The company executive also stated "Game Pass annual revenue was nearly $5bn for the first time", adding that the company has 500 million monthly active users across various gaming platforms and devices.</p>
<p>Today's earnings come just weeks after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">over 9000 employees were laid off from the company</a>, which Microsoft told Eurogamer was "necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace". While the total number of laid off employees in gaming positions is unknown, the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">The Initiative's Perfect Dark reboot, and a new ZeniMax MMORPG</a> were cancelled.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Nadella released a statement to say "Microsoft is thriving", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-is-thriving-claims-ceo-doubling-down-on-ai-after-9000-employees-lost-jobs-in-latest-layoffs">before the CEO doubled down on the importance of AI</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-games-made-up-most-of-playstations-top-sellers-in-the-us-last-quarter]]></content:encoded>
