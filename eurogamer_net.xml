            <p>
You've heard it in your dreams - the soundtrack to Tetris is now available on the Switch Online subscription's Nintendo Music app.
</p>
<p>
Almost 30 music tracks from the Game Boy and NES versions of Tetris are now available to stream, if you're a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber.
</p>
<p>
Who knew Tetris had so many tunes? For so many of us, the game's main theme is all you need - and it's a banger.

<p>
This week's bumper Nintendo Music update also brings a third set of songs to the service, from Dr Mario on the NES - which has its own another catchy melody.
</p>
<p>
But nothing beats that classic Tetris track, remixed and resampled countless times over the years in other Tetris sequels, such as the Switch's own <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tetris-1999">Tetris 99</a> and the brilliant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tetris-effect">Tetris Effect</a> Connected.
</p>
<p>
Remember that, if you're a Switch Online subscriber, you can download the Nintendo Music app on your iPhone or Android device at no extra charge. 
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-music-track-list-every-game-song-system">full list of every soundtrack already available on Nintendo Music</a>, with thousands of songs from franchises such as Mario, Zelda and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin">Pikmin</a>.

            <p>Amazon's God of War series already has a second season ordered, even though the first hasn't even aired. In fact, the last I checked, the first season doesn't even have a release date yet.</p>
<p>Confirmation that we'll get at least two God of War seasons comes from showrunner and former Battlestar Galactica executive producer Ronald D. Moore.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Moore appeared on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu704p568-Y">The Sackhoff Show</a> with Battlestar Galactica's Katee Sackhoff, and this is when the topic of God of War's TV adaptation came up.</p>
<p>"Right now I'm working on an adaptation of this video game called God of War - it's a big title in the gaming world - that Amazon has ordered two seasons of and they asked me to come in," Moore said. "I'm literally in the writers room and working on that. That's my new thing." </p>
<p>Moore admitted he isn't a "a gamer", and hadn't done something like this before - but had at least tried to play the God of War games, albeit rather unsuccessfully. </p>
<p>"I took a stab at it," Moore continued, before joking he "grew up in the arcade era" of gaming.  "I can do that... Astroids? Bring it on baby," he quipped.</p>
<p>"The controllers now..." Moore continued with a laugh. "Press R1, which one's R1, oh I'm dead! I can't quite get a hold of that." It sounds like Moore's family have a better handle on modern gaming, though, as the showrunner noted his wife was a fan of Skyrim. </p>

<p>Moore hasn't always been involved with the God of War TV show, only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer">joining the project towards the end of last year</a> following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-reportedly-starting-from-scratch-as-showrunner-departs">departure of the original team</a>. Despite the shakeup, the likes of Cory Barlog from God of War studio Sony Santa Monica remain an executive producer on the upcoming TV series, as does PlayStation Productions' Asad Qizilbash, Carter Swan, Sony's Hermen Hulst and Vertigo's Roy Lee.</p>
<p>Santa Monica's Jeff Ketcham is also a co-executive producer on Amazon's God of War adaptation.</p>

            <p>
Remember <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a>? Announced back at The Game Awards 2020 with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-revealed-with-preposterous-van-diesel-starring-trailer">preposterous CGI trailer starring Vin Diesel</a>, the dino-riding sequel has been rarely seen since.
</p>
<p>
Now, however, there's a big expansion for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a> - one that's designed to connect the series to it still missing-in-action sequel, whenever it arrives.
</p>
<p>
Ark developer Studio Wildcard announced the expansion, dubbed Ark: Lost Colony, last night with an animtated trailer that features the character played by Michelle Yeoh from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-the-animated-series-surprise-releases-in-us-and-canada-ahead-of-april-debut-elsewhere">the Ark animated series</a>.

<p>
Studio Wildcard said the expansion will follow Yeoh's character, alongside others from the animated series, in a story that "directly connects the storylines of Ark's Extinction and Genesis expansions and leads into the events of Ark 2".
</p>
<p>
Ark: Lost Colony expansion will arrive in June for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S priced $30 (UK price TBA). As for when Ark 2 will turn up? Who knows.
</p>
<p>
In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-survival-evolved-gets-new-cinematic-trailer-with-vin-diesel-coming-2023">Studio Wildcard said Ark 2 would launch the following year</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-delayed-survival-evolved-official-servers-to-shut-down-later-this-year">a delay in 2023 until "the end of 2024"</a> - which evidently did not happen.
</p>
<p>
Back in January, Studio Wildcard shared a content roadmap for Ark: Survival Evolved with updates scheduled up to and beyond December 2026 - with no mention of Ark 2 in sight, leading some fans to wonder whether it had been cancelled. The announcement of Ark: Lost Colony suggests this is not the case.

            <p>The CEO of Saber Interactive has some pretty damning words to say about 2022's poorly-received Saints Row reboot, and its developer Volition.</p>
<p>As part of an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/saber-embracer-savvy-games-space-marine-russia">Game File</a> (paywalled), Saber's Matt Karch spoke about studio closures and layoffs. Volition, you may recall, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-studio-volition-has-been-closed-down-effective-immediately">shuttered in 2023 as part of then-parent company Embracer Group's previously announced "restructuring" programme</a>.</p>
<p>Reflecting on this, Karch - who worked under the Embracer umbrella for a period of time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embattled-publisher-embracer-sells-off-saber-assets-withdraws-from-russia">before the sale of Saber assets</a> - stated while "it would be nice in an ideal world for everyone to have a job", the Saints Row team "were so expensive for what they were" and, therefore are "gone".</p>

<p>"They didn't know what they were building. They didn't have any real direction. It couldn't last," Karch said. "And so, who's going to fund them for the next game after that disaster?"</p>
<p>He added: "The days of throwing money at games other than maybe the GTAs of the world [are] over... It's over." Karch stated "this business needs to mature", and if it doesn't it's "in trouble".</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, that means layoffs," the Saber exec continued. "If I were running a team in California, my goal would be: 'Okay. Who are the absolutely must-haves in this group? And they exist. We have American talent [at Saber.] And who could do this for, you know, a quarter of the price in Poland?'"</p>

<p>2022's Volition-developed Saints Row reboot was met with disappointing critical and commercial reception.Following its release, Embracer admitted the game "did not meet the full expectations and left the fanbase partially polarised" in a <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q2-july-september-2022-net-sales-increased-by-190-to-sek-9569-million-35-organic-growth/">financial update</a> shared in the November of that year.</p>
<p>We called Saints Row a "snappy but slightly uneven reboot" on its release. "Volition's Saints Row reboot won't set the world alight, but there's a punchy game here with some pleasant surprises," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-2022-review-a-snappy-but-slightly-uneven-reboot">Eurogamer's Saints Row review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Soon after The Last of Us' first season aired the showrunners said when the time came for series two, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-promise-a-lot-more-infected-next-season">there would be "a lot more infected"</a>. And, well, they appear to be making good on their word. </p>
<p>Along with those infected hordes advancing upon Ellie and co in the trailers - not to mention <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-new-hbo-the-last-of-us-part-2s-trailer-is-here-and-april-cant-come-quickly-enough">Tommy using a flamethrower to toast a Bloater</a> - The Last Of Us' Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann have confirmed Stalkers will be featured in season two.</p>

<p>"All I'll say is that for the people who want to see more of the infected... Buckle up!" Mazin teased in conversation with <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-bigger-far-more-ambitious-pedro-pascal-exclusive/">Empire</a>.</p>
<p>"You get to see a different evolution of this infection," added Druckmann. "It's kept certain parts of their brain alive, so they are smarter. They coordinate and hide and do things that we've never seen any other infected do on this show."</p>

<p>And, it is not  just Stalkers that will bring a change when the second season of The Last of Us airs next month. The showrunners have confirmed spores are also making a return.</p>
<p>The Last of Us' spores are depicted as particle mists, but while a key feature in both games, the showrunners refrained from adding them to the first season of the show. Back in January 2023, it was revealed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbos-the-last-of-us-will-have-tendrils-instead-of-spores-spreading-infection">Cordyceps infection would instead be spread by "tendrils"</a> in series one.</p>
<p>In season two, however, there will be "an escalation of numbers and types of infected", as well as "an escalation of the vector of how this thing spreads" Druckmann said during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/vjLYIVh6Dwc?si=wl_qxgq7Zv7ZdL1P">SXSW 2025</a>.</p>
<p>"The reason [we're doing spores now], I mean, we really wanted to figure it out, and again, everything has to be drama. There had to be a dramatic reason of introducing it now," Druckmann said, teasing:</p>
<p>"And there is."</p>
