            <p>EA and Battlefield Studios have confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has sold over 7m copies since launch, breaking records for the series.</p>
<p>In an official press release from EA, interesting stats are featured prominantly. In addition to sales, over 172m online matches have been played across all platforms. On top of that, the game was watched for over 15m hours on streaming services like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> and YouTube during its launch weekend.</p>
<p>This official statement <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-sold-over-seven-million-copies-in-five-days-data-analyst-company-claims">confirms estimates laid out by an industry analyst earlier in the week</a>. These analysts from Alinea Analytics also believed that roughly 55 percent of players came from Steam alone.</p>

<p>Alongside the celebratory press release, quotes from senior Battlefield 6 leads were included that offer a peek into the sentiment at EA and from Battlefield's developers.</p>
<p>Battlefield general manager Byron Beede wrote: "First and foremost we want to thank our players. Battlefield 6 was built with our fans. From the initial concept through to the implementation of Battlefield Labs and into the record-shattering Open Beta we have been obsessed with player feedback. Together, with our players we've had a singular goal: to craft the best Battlefield ever. And this is just the beginning - our first season of new content is just 12 days away."</p><p>Executive vice president Vince Zampella added his own thoughts, writing: "We never take moments like this for granted, so I want to express our sincere gratitude to our global Battlefield Studios and passionate community that has helped get us to this point. We appreciate you joining us for Battlefield 6's momentous launch. We have so much more to come in the weeks ahead."</p>
<p>It's a milestone moment for EA, especially given the history of Battlefield and its lesser presence over recent years. If you've not played it yet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">why not read Eurogamer's Battlefield 6 review</a>! In it, Rick Lane writes: "Battlefield 6 delivers a thrilling multiplayer reset and a decent, if derivative single-player. But it still displays nagging doubts about what makes Battlefield special."</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how Call of Duty compares this year, especially given the feud between both Battlefield 6 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> that has been continuously bubbling away this year. Who knows? Maybe the tide is turning on the king of mass-market FPS games.</p>
