            <p>Microsoft has announced its next wave of Game Pass titles for May and into June.</p>
<p>Day one releases with this batch include Monster Train 2, To a T, and Spray Paint Simulator. To a T is a charming looking game from the creator of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/katamari-damacy">Katamari Damacy</a>. It follows the story of a teen whose body is stuck in a T-pose, as they navigate life in a small town with their cute dog companion.</p>
<p>Here are the list of Xbox Game Pass additions for late May 2025:</p>

<p>Our Ed has already had some time with To a T, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/katamari-damacy-creators-to-a-t-is-full-of-colour-and-joy-but-is-also-a-serious-and-affecting-depiction-of-living-with-disability">spoke to its creator Keita Takahashi</a>. "The concept of the character being in a T-pose came from another small game idea I had," Takahashi told Ed. "I hadn't linked the T-pose to disability until someone pointed it out in feedback. I was more focused on daily life challenges, which could be categorised as disabilities, but the inspiration was primarily drawn from game design."</p>
<p>Metaphor ReFantazio is a particular highlight from this batch of incoming Game Pass games. We awarded it five stars on its release, with our Ed saying "what it lacks in subtlety, it makes up for in grandeur and heart," in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-review">Eurogamer's Metaphor ReFantazio review</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, Game Pass Ultimate members can look forward to more games coming to the Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta) library on 23rd May. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brütal Legend</li>
<li>Costume Quest 2</li>
<li>Day of the Tentacle Remastered</li>
<li>Full Throttle Remastered</li>
<li>Grim Fandango Remastered</li>
<li>Max The Curse of Brotherhood</li>
<li>Neon Abyss</li>

</ul>

Note that while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii">Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2</a> is included in the image as a Standard Tier addition, this has since been removed from the list.</p>
<p>If you want to keep playing these games after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to purchase them. On the plus side, Game Pass subscribers get a 20 percent discount.</p>

            <p>Ninja Theory's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hellblade">Hellblade</a> sequel is heading to PS5 this summer as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii">Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2</a> Enhanced Edition.</p>
<p>The previously Xbox console-exclusive is celebrating its one year anniversary, so will now come to Sony's console with new features and haptic feedback implementation. Those new features will also be added in a free update to the Xbox and PC versions of the game.</p>
<p>"We have such incredible fans of Ninja Theory on PlayStation going all the way back to the days of Heavenly Sword," said studio head Dom Matthews in a video shared on social media. "And we're so pleased that we can welcome PlayStation fans back to Senua's story."</p>

<p>The first Hellblade, Senua's Sacrifice, was released in 2017 across PS4 and PC, followed by an Xbox One release in 2018 and Switch in 2019.</p>
<p>Ninja Theory was then acquired in 2018 by Microsoft, hence the sequel skipped Sony's console - until now.</p>

            <p>A Skibidi Toilet adaptation from Michael Bay is officially in production.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skibidi-toilet-made-using-half-life-2-assets-reportedly-in-talks-for-michael-bay-movie">project was first floated last year</a>, when it was reported there had been talks to launch a Skibidi Toilet film and TV franchise, with The Rock and Armageddon director attached. It left me scratching my head a bit, to be honest.</p>

<p>But fast forward to today, and those talks are now firmed up, with the news that yes, we are indeed going to be getting a Skibidi Toilet adaptation from Michael Bay.</p>
<p>Media Company Invisible Narratives - of which Bay serves as a chief creative advisor - will be producing, developing, and financing the project. You can see an image of its Skibidi Toilet project on the <a href="https://www.invisiblenarratives.com/">company's website</a> (or you can look at the screenshot I took below).</p>
<p>Bay along with partner Jeffrey Beecroft have reportedly been working on their Skibidi Toilet project since last summer, with a <a href="https://filmstories.co.uk/news/michael-bay-skibidi-toilet-film/">press release stating</a> it is "an early creative take on the franchise", which will bring "Bay's signature visual intensity to one of the internet's most unlikely breakout IPs".</p>

<p>Skibidi Toilet, for those still mercifully unaware, is an enormously-popular online animation series made using Valve's Source Filmmaker software and featuring assets from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> and Counter-Strike. It features a race of evil toilets with human heads, and has clocked up a whopping 65bn views on YouTube, another 15bn on Tiktok, and is ubiquitous on Roblox, where countless spin-off games lie.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in adaptation news, yesterday <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clash-of-clans-latest-video-game-to-get-the-netflix-animated-treatment">Netflix announced it was gearing up to release a Clash of Clans animated series</a>, which will feature a "determined but in-over-his-head Barbarian who must rally a band of misfits to defend their village and navigate the comically absurd politics of war".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
