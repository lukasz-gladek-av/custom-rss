            <p>Dispatch developer AdHoc has no interest in using AI to replace voice actors or game development.</p>
<p>AI is still a hot topic within the gaming community, with many developers using the technology in their own releases. However, AdHoc has no intention to use AI for its own games, especially not when it comes to voice acting.</p>

<p>AdHoc's creative director Nick Herman and executive producer Michael Choung recently sat down with Eurogamer's sister site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dispatch-is-on-course-to-beat-its-three-year-sales-target-in-three-months-heres-how">GamesIndustry.biz</a> to chat all things Dispatch. The studio's episodic superhero workplace comedy has been a hit since its release earlier this year, with many (myself included) praising Dispatch's voice cast for elevating the experience. The cast includes Aaron Paul of Breaking Bad fame, as well as The Last of Us and James Bond actor Jeffrey Wright as retired superhero Chase, among others.</p>
<p>So, where does AI come into it? Well, speaking on Wright's performance as Chase earlier this month, Herman stated: "No AI is going to do what he did."</p>
<p>"He brought something to that character that we weren't expecting," Herman continued. "I mean, his performance and Aaron's performance and our whole cast are bringing performances and elevating the material in a way that you're just not going to get [with AI]. You're not going to be surprised because it's built on something you've heard before if you go the AI route.</p>
<p>"So, yeah, honestly, AI feels like a production solution, not a creative one. Maybe it's a creative one if you <em>aren't </em>creative."</p>
<figure>

<p>"Whatever we're building, it has to connect," Choung added. "It's got to be made by people. It's got to connect to people. We're looking at AI, we're monitoring the stuff that AI is doing, like everybody else. But... it seems to be having a lot of trouble trying to get to a 'good enough' spot. And 'good enough' for us is the enemy.</p><p>"Also we're not getting up every morning and talking to ourselves like, 'hey, what if we did this with less people? What's the lowest number of people we can use to make this thing?' This is like not anything that we're too concerned with!"</p>
<p>The developers added they aren't going to judge others for their own use of AI, and they can "speak for themselves" should they feel it necessary to do so. But, for AdHoc, AI, "right now, it just doesn't make a ton of sense".</p>

<p>Earlier this year, AdHoc announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">Dispatch had sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to this success, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-dispatch-getting-a-second-season-well-thats-something-the-developer-is-definitely-going-to-think-about">the studio is now considering a second season</a> (perhaps one with more sex scenes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">given the "ravenous" response to the first season</a>).</p>

            <p>Activision's own response to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>'s release seems more muted than previous years.</p>
<p>Last night, the official Call of Duty social media account shared a post, congratulating developers Treyarch and Raven on the latest Call of Duty release, and thanking the community in the process.</p>

<p>"Across the opening weekend, we've seen a great response to the quality and depth of gameplay in Black Ops 7," it wrote, adding there will be more to come.</p>
<p>However, many have pointed out that the tone in this latest release post, which Activision acknowledges every year, is a little less enthusiastic than previous examples. </p>
<p>Last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a>, for example, received a post boasting about the game's stats. "#1 Total Players, #1 Hours Played, #1 Total Matches," it read, with Activision thanking the fan base for making Black Ops 6 "the biggest Call of Duty ever".</p>
<p>You can see the two <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> posts side by side below.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, according to The Game Business' Chris Dring, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 had "a smaller UK retail launch (physical sales) than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>" based on GfK data. Black Ops 7 also has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-the-lowest-metacritic-user-score-ever-for-a-call-of-duty-game">the lowest metacritic user score for a Call of Duty game ever</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-underperforms-on-steam-during-launch-weekend-but-does-that-mean-the-games-sold-badly">Steam player numbers have been lower than other series entries</a>.</p><p>Black Ops 7 has also come under fire for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-players-call-out-awful-apparent-use-of-generative-ai-for-in-game-calling-cards">apparent use of generative AI</a>. This matter was recently brought up by US Congressman Ro Khanna who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-members-of-the-us-congress-are-pushing-back-against-call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-ai-use">responded to Activision Blizzard's AI use in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 by highlighting the need for AI regulations in the United States of America</a>.</p>
<p>"A shift away from single-player leaves Call of Duty with its most lopsided and homogenous entry in decades, though what it does offer is consistently good fun when accepted on its own terms," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Eurogamer's Black Ops 7 review</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>'s CEO believes the gaming industry is heading towards PC dominance, despite the company's upcoming publishing juggernaut <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> so far only slated for Xbox and PlayStation.</p>
<p>Strauss Zelnick made the comments earlier this week, while chatting with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/take-two-ceo-gaming-consoles-pc.html">CNBC's Squawk Box</a>. "I think [the industry is] moving towards PC, and business is moving towards open rather than closed," Zelnick said.</p>
<p>"But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours that you play on a big screen - that's never going away," the CEO furthered.</p>

<p>Zelnick's comments come one week after Valve announced its own range of gaming hardware, notably the Steam Machine, which is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-steam-machine-preview-a-powerful-customisable-mini-pc-for-couch-gaming">console/PC hybrid which will be able to run PC games on a television or as a normal gaming computer</a>.</p><p>Zelnick also touched on the mobile gaming market, which he said is growing more rapidly than the console market. "Mobile, of course, is taken with you, it's repeatable, and it's enjoyable," Zelnick said. "And I do think because it appeals to the broadest possible audience, it will probably continue to grow more rapidly."</p>
<p>During an earnings call, Zelnick stated Take-Two expects the mobile business to increase by roughly 10 percent in the next quarter.</p>

<p>Many publishers have moved to release their games on PC as well as consoles. PlayStation, for example, has steadily been making its once-console exclusives available via the likes of Steam over recent years. Earlier this year, former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida admitted porting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-games-on-pc-is-almost-like-printing-money-says-former-exec-shuhei-yoshida">PlayStation-exclusive games to PC is "almost like printing money"</a>, and provides an opportunity to invest in further games.</p><p>There is still <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-pc-version-teased-by-take-two-boss-acknowledges-platforms-growing-importance">no word on a GTA 6 PC release from Rockstar and Take-Two</a>, though. Earlier this year, Zelnick teased a PC release of GTA 6 will be on the way, but added the company tends not to "go across all platforms simultaneously". At this time, Take-Two's head noted the PC version of a multiplatform game can generate 40 percent of overall sales.

            <p>Nintendo has told Eurogamer it has no intention of hindering the use of third-party <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> docks following its latest console update.</p>
<p>Last week, update 21.0.0 was issued that makes a number of software tweaks, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-latest-update-for-switch-consoles-finally-indicates-if-your-games-are-digital-or-physical">addition of symbols to indicate if software is physical or digital</a>. However, some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/third-party-switch-2-docks-reportedly-no-longer-compatible-after-nintendos-latest-console-update">Switch 2 owners reported third-party docks no longer worked</a> following the update.</p>
<p>Nintendo has now issued a response. "Nintendo Switch 2 outputs audiovisuals once it detects that it is docked into a Nintendo Switch 2 Dock," the company told Eurogamer. "Nintendo Switch does the same, outputting audiovisuals once it detects that it is docked into a Nintendo Switch Dock. Nintendo does not have any intention to hinder or invalidate legal third-party dock compatibility."</p>

<p>The Switch 2, of course, comes with a dock in the box, but some users have purchased additional docks to play in other rooms or for travelling, for example.</p>
<p>An official dock from the Nintendo store will set you back £92.99, however, so many users have purchased third-party options instead.</p>
<p>It would appear, following Nintendo's statement, that any incompatibility issues caused with third-party docks are unintentional.</p>
<p>Outside of games, Nintendo has two big films in the works. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-breakdown-of-the-super-mario-galaxy-movies-first-trailer-with-the-easter-eggs-weve-spotted">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie got its first official trailer</a> last week, while the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-think-these-set-photos-are-telling-us-a-lot-more-about-the-legend-of-zelda-movie-than-nintendo-is-letting-on-analysis">Legend of Zelda movie has now begun filming</a>.</p>
