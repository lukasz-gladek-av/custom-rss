            <p>Remember that trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a> 4, which made the rounds last week? Well, I am sorry to say it was indeed unofficial after all, and Ys Net is now considering legal action against the uploader.</p>
<p>In a post on social media, Ys Net said last week's trailer - which clocked in at over four minutes - has "absolutely no connection" to the studio. Its logo was used "without permission", Ys Net said, "falsely giving the impression that it is an official Shenmue 4 related video produced by us".</p>

<p>"We recognise that the unauthorised use of our logo, and any act that misleads viewers into believing such content is official, constitutes a serious issue that may amount to trademark infringement and unfair competition," Ys Net continued.</p>
<p>"We are currently working with relevant parties and preparing appropriate measures, including potential legal action".</p>
<p>While Ys Net does not actually own the Shenmue IP, with that honour belonging to Sega, the studio apologised to its community for the confusion last week's trailer may have caused. Let's be honest, it surely raised more than just a few hopes (I mean, last year fans of the series went so far as to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-fans-rent-times-square-billboard-campaigning-for-fourth-game">rent out a billboard in New York's Time Square to campaign for a fourth game</a>).</p>
<p>"We will continue to ensure the proper and accurate dissemination of information, and we ask for your understanding and cooperation," Ys Net's statement on the fake trailer closed.</p>
<p>As for the offending trailer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/real-or-ai-fake-suspicious-off-screen-shenmue-4-trailer-sparks-excited-debate">it followed Shenmue protagonist Ryo as he went about various around-the-town jobs</a>, such as washing dishes and arm wrestling. Many were sceptical about its legitimacy from the off, though, with the video coming from an unknown and unvalidated YouTube source with very few followers.</p><div>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue-3">Shenmue 3</a> resurrected the RPG series in 2019, and our former editor Martin Robison was rather taken with it all. "A bewitching time capsule that transports us to late 80s China, and to turn-of-the-century video games," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-3-review-a-faithful-follow-up-to-an-all-time-classic">Eurogamer's Shenmue 3 review</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s Xbox published horror game OD sure does sound odd.</p>
<p>As part of a new interview, the Death Stranding creator not only said he can't tell us "exactly" what OD actually is yet, he also doesn't even know "if it will work out" in the end.</p>

<p>"We've created stealth games and delivery games which were unlike anything before, but system-wise, they were similar to other games," the Kojima Productions head told <a href="https://ananweb.jp/categories/entertainment/74735">ananweb</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hideo-kojima-says-od-is-something-completely-different-from-a-standard-horror-game-we-still-dont-know-if-it-will-work-out/">Automaton</a>). As well as Death Stranding 1 and 2, the developer is also best known for the Metal Gear series.</p>
<p>But for the horror-flavoured OD, he continued, the studio is "trying to change the service model from the ground up", with Kojima adding "it should be quite challenging".</p>
<p>That all being said, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kojima-and-xbox-team-up-to-show-off-more-od-knock">OD developer did say the recent trailer was "packed" full of hints</a>. "So if you keep thinking about it, you might figure it out", he closed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">OD was first announced back in 2023</a>, though Kojima stopped short of actually telling us all that much more about it at the time. Sophia Lillis and Hunter Schafer are both tied to the project, and there is also some involvement from director Jordan Peele, who is known for his films Get Out and Nope.</p><p>Otherwise, Kojima said it's "a game and at the same time a movie and at the same time a new form of media", so make of that what you will. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-marmite-hideo-kojima-says-you-will-either-love-or-hate-od">Kojima recently admitted he was sure plenty of people will hate OD</a>, but he is ok with that in the short term.</p>
