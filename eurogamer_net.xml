            <p>
Remember Balatro's free Friends of Jimbo collaboration update back in August, which saw the acclaimed poker-themed rogue-like adding a bunch of card cosmetics inspired by popular video games? Well it turns out there was more where that came from, and players can now adorned their desks with cameos from the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>.
</p>
<p>
Balatro's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatros-free-collaboration-update-adds-the-witcher-vampire-survivors-among-us-more">original Friends of Jimbo update</a> gave players the option to swap out the game's usual Kings, Queens, and Jacks with characters from The Witcher, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/among-us">Among Us</a>. So if fancied bolstering your deck with a beaming Jaskier, for instance, or a little red space-pal, then you were well and truly catered for.
</p>
<p>
And now, Balatro developer LocalThunk is doing it all again with the free Friends of Jimbo Pack 2, featuring cameos from The Binding of Isaac and Slay the Spire, alongside Cyberpunk 2077 and Stardew Valley. That means you can now set Johnny Silverhand as your ice-cool King, Isaac's Mother as your varicose-veined Queen, even Stardew Valley's general store manager Pierre as your Jack - with all 12 new card faces getting an airing in the trailer below.

<p>
And beyond that, there's not a lot more to report - other than the fact Balatro's free Friends of Jimbo Pack 2 update is available now on PC, PlayStation, Switch, Android, and iOS. As for what's next, LocalThunk previously confirmed he's working on a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-passes-2m-sales-with-free-major-update-due-in-2025">major free content update</a> - promising to "bring new ideas and strategies to the game" - that'll launch sometime next year.
</p><p>
And if you've yet to play the absurdly compelling Balatro, it's definitely work a look. Christian Donlan had good things to say about its rogue-like spin on poker in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-review">four star review</a> earlier this year, calling it, "So striking and so brilliantly constructed, and something that has given me such pleasure for the last week".

            <p>
Following Blizzard's announcement earlier this year it was considering bringing 6v6 matches to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>, having ditched them when it transitioned from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> 1 to its sequel, the studio has now made their reintroduction official: 6v6 will come to Overwatch 2 in the form of two test modes next season, and Blizzard says it'll be 'watching the results closely'
</p>
<p>
When Blizzard <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2-exploring-reintroduction-of-6v6-in-a-series-of-upcoming-tests">revealed it was mulling over 6v6's return</a> back in July, it explained the original mode could have "really high, highs, but reaaaally low, lows" in Overwatch 1, and that 5v5 was ultimately selected for Overwatch 2 in a bid to "raise that floor, even though it was at the expense of some of some of those high moments." However, the studio acknowledged the changes had come "at the cost of match variety and player freedom" and so it was looking at how 6v6 could potentially be reintroduced.
</p>
<p>
And now, four months on from that announcement, Blizzard has confirmed 6v6's imminent return. In <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/news/24151413/director-s-take-continuing-the-6v6-discussion">new post on the Overwatch website</a>, game director Aaron Keller said the studio will be introducing "two different 6v6 tests" as part of Overwatch 2's upcoming Season 14. The first of these is set to launch a week into the season and will be a variation of Open Queue - requiring each team to have at least one of each role but no more than three, with players able to switch roles on the fly during a match as long as the limit isn't broken.

<p>
Blizzard's second 6v6 test will arrive as part of Season 14's mid-season refresh, offering the classic 2-2-2 team composition while incorporating some of Overwatch 2's "new principles", such as less crowd control and hero rework. Both test modes will feature rebalancing specific to 6v6 - such as a reduction in the power and survivability of tanks - but they'll still have their own card in Unranked alongside other modes. Keller says the goal of Season 14's 6v6 format tests is to understand if it "can make the core game even stronger", adding that it'll be "watching the reception and results of these tests closely."
</p><p>
"In the world where a surge of players join this mode and continuously play it, then we have the signal we need to do more with it," Keller continued. "I think what that 'more' is depends on the level of excitement. Is there a world where both 5v5 and 6v6 exist permanently in Overwatch 2? If you had asked me a few months ago, I would have said no. As we've discussed Overwatch 2's future... we know our players can want more than one experience, and it would be something we'd need to consider moving forward."
</p>
<p>
Notably, Blizzard isn't stopping at experimenting with a potential 6v6 mode. It also plans to test variants of Overwatch 2's existing 5v5 mode as part of Season 13, examining the "flexibility within this format". There's a Quick Play: Hacked variant called Limit 2 coming soon, which caps each role per team at two, and there's a mid-season mode called Kingmaker that'll feature Limit 2's role cap while giving a bonus to the player not sharing a role.
</p>
<p>
Blizzard says it'll have more information on all the above "closer to their launches".
