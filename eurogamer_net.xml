            <p>Popular gaming peripheral manufacturer Dbrand has acknowledged a defect affecting a small number of its Project Killswitch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2?page=2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> cases.</p>
<p>This defect impacts the lip attaching the joycons to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> screen, disconnecting when the console is held up by a singular joycon. Speaking to influencer Nintendo Prime, the company has stated it's in the process of fixing the issue.</p>
<p>"Yep, we're definitely working on it. Ultimately, this is a manufacturing tolerance issue on the small lip keeping the Joy-Con Grips attached to the Joy-Cons (some were a hair too thick)," Dbrand told Nintendo Prime. "We've got a replacement program set up already, where anyone who is affected is able to email robots@dbrand.com with 'July Joy-Cons' in the subject to be added to the list for replacement stock in July."</p>

<p>According to Nintendo Prime, Dbrand also acknowledged this problem was replicable among a "small number of units from their run". Nintendo Prime didn't share the exact number he was told, but reemphasised any defective Killswitch cases could be replaced for free in July.</p>
<p>There are plenty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-accessories-deals-third-party-jsaux">great third-party accessories for the Nintendo Switch 2</a> - Dbrand's Killswitch included!

            <p>"Major job cuts" are set for Xbox as part of a company-wide reorganisation.</p>
<p>That's according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/microsoft-plans-major-job-cuts-at-xbox-gaming-division">Bloomberg report</a>, which states these cuts will begin next week. While Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier said it is currently unclear how many people will be affected by the alleged job cuts, "it's expected to be big".</p>
<p>According to the report, sources famaliar with the company's plans said managers within Xbox are expecting "substantial cuts across the entire group".  </p>
<p>This would not be the first time Microsoft and Xbox have made headlines for layoffs in the last 18 months. Back in January 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">1900 people from across Microsoft's video game teams were laid off</a>. A further <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">650 staff were then let go that September</a>.</p>

            <p>Drag x Drive - the 3 v 3 wheelchair basketball game coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> - just landed itself a release date.</p>
<p>As shared via Nintendo's Today app, Drag x Drive will make its debut on 14th August. Previously, we just knew the game was coming at some point this summer.</p>
<p>Drag x Drive will be an eShop exclusive, with no physical release currently on the cards (quite literally).</p>

<p>On its release this August, Drag x Drive players will use both Joy-Con 2 controllers as mice to compete in games of wheelchair basketball. The controllers will both need to be used at the same time in order for players to "intuitively steer, speed up, perform tricks and make plays such as dunks," Nintendo says.</p>
<p>As the release date was announced over on the Today app, I don't currently have a new trailer I can embed into this article. When it is made live across YouTube, though, I will add one in.</p>
