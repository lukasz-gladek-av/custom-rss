            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a> 1999 will release in December.</p>
<p>Whilst developer Digital Extremes' latest livestream stopped short of confirming a precise release date, at least we now know which of the two months left in 2024 will debut Warframe's highly anticipated throwback update.</p>

<p>"Our biggest update of the 20th century arrives this December when Warframe: 1999 launches on all platforms!" the studio said, before inviting players to "get your account ready" for launch day… whenever that may be.</p>
<p>For anyone struggling to wait that long, don't forget that a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.warframe.com%2Fget-ready">playable demo</a> is still available.</p>
<p>"Get a feel for Arthur's Weaponry and turbo-charged Atomicycle as you battle Scaldra through the streets of Hӧllvania," DE teases. "December just can't come soon enough…"</p>
<p>As our resident Warframe expert Matt summarised for us recently, we've known 1999 was likely to be an "odd 'un" ever since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframes-next-big-expansion-whispers-in-the-walls-gets-weird-with-necramechs-and-retro-earth-tech">tease at last year's TennoCon</a>.</p>
<p>As TennoCon 2024 revealed earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframes-1999-expansion-has-a-shopping-mall-romance-system-and-you-even-get-to-fight-a-boyband">it's really set in 1999 (New Year's Eve, to be exact)</a> and no, this isn't quite the Earth we know - but it's close enough, full of extremely familiar era-appropriate artefacts that feel gleefully incongruous within Warframe's wider world. And that starts with 1999's new hub area: an abandoned 90s shopping mall full of artificial palm trees, arcade machines, and screens belching out cheesy infomercials.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Call of Duty <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> is currently sitting on a "mixed" Steam user score as players on PC report performance issues and crashes.</p>
<p>Threads on the game's Steam <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1938090/discussions/">discussion</a> pages and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/top/">subreddit</a> show players are trying all kinds of things to ameliorate the issue, from uninstalling other applications, removing auto-start apps, and disabling the anti-cheats of other games.</p>
<p>"Even <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1938090/discussions/0/4693406471885458077/">deleting all folders</a> off [the] pc and re-downloading everything" hasn't worked.</p>

<p>"Every time I click start campaign my game crashes to desktop. No problem's playing multiplayer though," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1938090/discussions/0/4693406471885457921/">commented</a> one player.</p>
<p>"My campaign starts. I can play for a few minutes and THAN [sic] crash to desktop without any error messages, driver all new!" said one respondent.</p>
<p>"I bought it yesterday and haven't been able to play one single game," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1938090/discussions/0/4693406471885476188/">added</a> another unhappy player. "It always closes when I try to start the game. I reinstalled it and still, I cant even load into the menu. What in the actual ****."</p>
<p>Responses include "same, hecking stupid", "still the same for me", and "it's gotta be a[n] Activision issue I hope they fix it fast it’s unfair".</p>
<p>"Same here - rubbish. Why do nobody test their games anymore before releasing them," opined one particularly unhappy commenter.</p>
<p>Another simply <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Shulby/recommended/2933620/">wrote</a>: "Call of Crashes 6".</p>
<p>As yet, there's been no formal word on Call of Duty's social media channels acknowledging the issues, but of 2200+ Steam reviews posted so far, almost half have been negative, and most negative reviews seem to reference performance issues. Others are chiefly unhappy with the Call of Duty launcher.</p>
<p>Did you see <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-arachnophobia-mode-is-arguably-more-terrifying-than-actual-giant-spiders">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's new arachnophobia mode</a>? Activision's solution somehow makes everything even more horrifying, by robbing its zombie spiders of legs and turning them into something arguably worse.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
