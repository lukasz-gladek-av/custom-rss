            <p>The next Call of Duty installment was announced over the weekend, along with its release platforms: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 is slated to debut across Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4, and PC.</p>
<p>Black Ops 7's omission of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a> release (at least presently) from the launch platform line-up has raised some eyebrows due to the fact that, back in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-and-nintendo-sign-binding-10-year-agreement-for-call-of-duty">Microsoft announced a deal with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to its platforms</a> on "the same day as Xbox, with full feature and content parity".</p>
<p>However, while for now there is no word of a Switch 2 release for Black Ops 7, the team is "committed" to bringing the Call of Duty series to Nintendo, Activision has told Eurogamer.</p>

<p>In a statement shared with Eurogamer, Activision confirmed: "We're committed to getting the franchise on Switch. Both teams [are] working on it. Will share details when ready."</p>
<p>On its release, Black Ops 7 will be able to be played solo or with friends "in a thrilling and innovative" co-op campaign, while also having the series' "signature" multiplayer experience. This will include new maps and more from Zombies.</p>
<p>The upcoming game is being helmed by Treyarch and Raven Software, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-promises-to-be-most-mind-bending-black-ops-ever">developers promising the "most mind-bending" Black Ops release yet</a>. It stars Heroes and Gilmore Girls' Milo Ventimiglia as David Mason.</p>
<p>We can expect further details on Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 later this summer, the team has said, so stay tuned for more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Here's a new date for your bumper summer line up of video game showcases: Konami has today announced its own livestream, which will give us all a fresh look at both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>.</p>
<p>The showcase - known as Konami Press Start - is scheduled for this coming Thursday, 12th June. It will air at 2pm here in the UK, so that's 6:00am PT / 9:00am ET / 3:00pm CEST.</p>
<p>The whole thing is expected to last for around 37 minutes, Konami has said. While the studio namechecked both Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill f, it also promised "and more" during that time. </p>

<p>"This live event offers a unique opportunity to hear directly from the creative minds behind some of Konami's most iconic franchises," the developer said, promising us all "insights into the development process", as well as "exclusive content".</p>
<p>As for those games mentioned above, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is scheduled for release on 28th August, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-announced-complete-with-a-butt-slapping-ape-escape-monkey">complete with the Ape Escape-themed minigame from the original game</a>.

<p>Silent Hill f, meanwhile, is slated for launch later this year, on 25th September. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-will-be-more-action-oriented-than-silent-hill-2-remake-coming-september">It will be "more action-oriented" than last year's Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, but still feature puzzles that are "grounded in psychological anguish and suffering".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
