            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has received a selection of new map conditions that are mixing up the typical experience significantly for players. As part of these new conditions, an underground bunker on Spaceport has been introduced, with a mysterious puzzle that still appears unsolved.</p>
<p>First introduced over the weekend the three major map condition additions are night raids for Blue Gate, Electromagnetic Storms (across Dam Battleground, Spaceport, and Blue Gate), plus the Hidden Bunker on Spaceport. You can also now see the Harvester event on the Blue Gate map, which previously was locked to Dam Battlegrounds.</p>
<p>Now, all of these are cool, but the Hidden Bunker is the particularly intriguing one. This event requires several antennas to be turned on across the map by players, which in turn opens doors in the South West portion of the map.</p>

<p>There's good loot in this bunker, sure. However, more intriguingly are data upload terminals and other odd objects that have a portion of the community certain that there's more to find in the Hidden Bunker. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/hidden_bunker_mega_thread/">A Reddit Megathread on the Arc Raiders Hidden Bunker</a> started picking apart the bunker, pointing out strange machines and wiring spread across the bunker with seemingly no purpose.</p><p>As for the data terminals, people also believed that there was more to this part of the bunker. However, it's worth noting that as of this morning there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-trials-are-the-perfect-way-to-do-ranked-in-extraction-shooters#:~:text=Rather%20than%20some%20kill%2Dfocused,world%2C%20or%20even%20gathering%20plants!">a weekly trial</a> for data uploads, so it's entirely possible that all they're for is a nice bump in XP when used and weekly challenges.</p>
<p>Whether or not players will uncover more secrets in the Hidden Bunker is something to keep an eye on. Meanwhile,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-breaks-another-concurrent-record-as-player-count-soars"> Arc Raiders broke yet another concurrent player record last weekend</a>, showing continuing growth post-release and remaining at the top of Steam's top playing charts.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has once again smashed its own concurrent peak user count on Steam, topping 400,000 for the first time this weekend.</p>
<p>Last week, we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-passes-250000-concurrent-players-on-steam-alone-breaking-records-for-the-extraction-shooter-genre">Arc Raiders had surpassed a peak concurrent player count of 250,000 on Steam just a day after its release</a>, and then again on 1st November when it topped 328,062 simultaneous players, making it the most popular Steam release for a PvP extraction shooter ever.</p>

<p>Now, over the weekend period, Arc Raiders has broken its own record once again, hitting a new high of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">416,517 concurrent users</a> on Steam, making it the fifth biggest game on Steam over the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>Based on data from Alinea Analytics, market analysts believe around 69.2 percent of the game's playerbase is on Steam. That means roughly 30 percent of its playerbase - 17.3 percent on PlayStation, and 13.5 percent on Xbox - are not accounted for in that figure.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-may-have-already-sold-25m-copies-according-to-industry-analyst">As for why Arc Raiders is so popular</a> when other extraction shooters haven't reached such highs in terms of sales or player count? As Connor reported earlier in the week, market analyst Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics believes that "Arc Raiders is great because it focuses on community - NOT because it's an extraction shooter".</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-40-hours-and-counting-arc-raiders-has-me-convinced-extraction-shooters-are-brilliant">Eurogamer's Arc Raiders' preview</a>, we wrote: "Arc Raiders is, simply put, a third-person extraction shooter. It is a factory that mass produces tense moments, by its own nature a source of intense anxiety: high stakes, devastating losses, rapturous victories. Pulling back, it's a game of gradual self-refinement, both of your inventory full of resources and your characters abilities, and likewise your own know-how."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> has struck down co-op survival horror shooter Misery with a DMCA alleging copyright infringement.</p>
<p>After Valve said it had no option but to take down the game before it too was subject to a copyright claim, the Misery team - chiefly consisting of a solo developer called Maewing - <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2119830/announcements/detail/598542531394798467">claimed</a> it was "under attack!", insisting Misery is "a completely different concept, happening in the fictional Republic of Zaslavie, and it has nothing to do" with GSC's Stalker 2.</p>
<p>"It has nothing to do with the Stalker universe, Chernobyl, etc. Misery uses no characters, plot, storyline, assets, monsters, music, code, etc., from their games. It is all either originally created or legally licensed. We also think that this is an abuse of power against small independent developers by a large corporation, and it should not be a thing," the team wrote of its game, which released on Steam on 23rd October.</p>
<p>"We do not pose any threat to GSC or their IP, we do not compete with their games, nor do we use any of their IP. Of course, Misery was inspired by many things, including games, movies, and books, but filing a DMCA strike for that is wrong. We also want to remind GSC that their games draw heavily from Roadside Picnic and the Stalker movie by Tarkovsky, and they do not own the copyright on depressive Soviet-era buildings, playing guitar, vodka, radiation, or abandoned locations, or even the poo."</p>

<p>As a consequence of the claim, the game has disappeared from the Steam storefront.</p>
<p>"We are 100% sure this misunderstanding will be resolved, Misery will be back on Steam very soon, and we will see many amazing updates and new content," the team added. "This is very unfortunate and painful for us, both mentally and financially, but the development continues, all the updates will be delivered on time, and soon we can play Misery again."</p><p>The message from Valve included screenshots comparing Misery to Stalker 2, including side-by-side comparisons of a gloomy, Soviet-era neightbourhood from Stalker: Call of Prypiat and a similar environment in Misery. Another side-by-side comparison shows characters in both games sitting around a fire wearing gas masks, playing guitar.</p>

<p>The team closed on imploring people not to review-bomb GSC, writing: "do not insult them or other people in comments, especially for their nationality! We do not want or support that".</p>
<p>However, in the privacy of its members-only Discord channel, the developer was considerably less polite <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1or39zs/comment/nno4g7j/">and posted a screed of pejorative slurs</a>, prompting a follow-up apology.</p>
<p>"[After the DMCA strike], some people found my old posts and comments that included inappropriate and offensive statements," the developer said (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/stalker-dev-gsc-game-world-dmcad-a-stalker-inspired-indie-off-steam-and-the-devs-are-crying-foul-this-is-an-abuse-of-power-against-small-independent-developers-by-a-large-corporation/">PC Gamer</a>). "Many are rightfully upset, and I completely understand why. First of all, I want to acknowledge and take full responsibility for my past words. What I wrote was immature, thoughtless, and wrong. It does not represent who I am today or what I believe in, and I deeply regret posting it.</p><p>"I do not support any form of extremism, violence, or discrimination against any group of people. I truly value and respect our players and friends from all countries and backgrounds. As for the DMCA strike we will handle it calmly and professionally. There is no basis for it, and I believe Valve will review the situation fairly."</p>
<p>Since then, Reddit investigators believe they've <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1or39zs/comment/nnu3vzk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">found unsubstantiated evidence that assets from Stalker 2 were indeed used to create Misery</a>, which may be why GSC has cracked down particularly on this developer and not other copycat titles. Others purport it may be because the developer, and seemingly some elements of the game's fanbase, allegedly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1or7deo/few_screenshots_from_the_misery_discord/?share_id=4SZ6WdPDMY2KDFHNmrF88&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">supports</a> Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-reportedly-target-of-russian-disinformation-campaign-claiming-its-used-to-draft-players-into-ukraine-war">GSC is a Ukranian studio</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-roadmap-for-2025-includes-a-life-updates-and-an-upgrade-to-a-new-version-of-unreal-engine-5">GSC Game World announced its plans for updates to Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl for the remainder of 2025</a>. Big ticket updates include tweaks and changes to the A-Life system, Unreal Engine 5 performance gains, and new night vision devices to play with.</p>
