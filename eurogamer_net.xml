Ubisoft has some good news for Steam Deck owners looking to sink into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> later this month: after previously saying the game wouldn't be compatible with Valve's gaming handheld, it's now done a bit of a U-turn.
</p>
<p>
Back in February, as part of a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4XbPPtFyQEtIMWrA9xVDmZ/assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa">lengthy tech Q&amp;A</a>, Ubisoft revealed Assassin's Creed Shadows would "not be compatible with Steam Deck [at launch], due to the fact it is below our minimum specs for PC." That, then, suggested it wasn't just a case of Shadows failing to tick some boxes to pass Valve's verification process, but rather that it simply wouldn't run well at all.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, with Assassin's Creed Shadows' release just weeks away, Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1j9og39/assassins_creed_shadows_we_are_happy_to_say_that/">shared an update for Steam Deck users</a> - confirming Valve's device will, in fact, be supported at launch. The publisher didn't explain what had led to the change, but presumably - hopefully - it's managed to eke out a few performance gains in the time since its original announcement.

<p>
Ubisoft adds it's still awaiting the results of Valve's verification process, so doesn't currently know which of Steam Deck's compatibility classifications Assassin's Creed Shadows will receive (Valve <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/verified">grades games</a> as either Verified, Playable, Unsupported, or Unknown on the device) . "More info to come soon," its message concludes.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (including Steam Deck!) on 20th March, and will also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-details-ps5-pro-enhancements-including-extended-raytracing">receive a range of PS5 Pro enhancements</a>. And if you're looking for more granular release information, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-global-launch-times-detailed-pre-load-live-now-on-xbox">global launch times have also been revealed.</a> As for the game itself, it's "shaping up to be one of the most promising [series entries] so far", as Eurogamer's Katharine Castle <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">wrote earlier this year</a>.

            <p>
Bethesda's long-rumoured The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake is reportedly due to be formally unveiled very soon, with signs pointing to a possible release before June.
</p>
<p>
Word of an Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake first surfaced in 2023, when a former employee of Chinese studio Virtuos posted to Reddit claiming it was in the works. And while references to an Oblivion <em>remaster</em> were later spotted in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-bethesda-roadmap-reveals-unannounced-releases-including-dishonored-3">leaked internal Microsoft document from 2020</a>, more talk of a remake emerged earlier this year - again from a former Virtuous employee.
</p>
<p>
But despite all this chatter, Bethesda's lips have remained firmly sealed. That might be about to change, however, according to multiple reports. NatetheHate - an insider with a strong track record of accurate Microsoft leaks - took to social media to <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1899604247978840406">say they expect an official announcement</a> "either this month or next month."

<p>
Additionally, they offered a revised release window, having previously claimed the Oblivion remake would launch this June. "[It's] likely to be sooner than the original June target," they wrote, "but still working to get details on an updated release date." Lending further credence to NatetheHate's claims, VGC says it's <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bethesdas-oblivion-unreal-engine-5-remake-could-be-releasing-sooner-than-you-think/">corroborated the report</a> with its own sources, adding it's heard the game may even release as early as next month.
</p>
<p>
As to what players can expect, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-details-surface-as-leaker-suggests-its-coming-in-june">most recent Virtuous leak</a> called it a"fully remade" version of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, developed in Unreal 5. It's also said to features various system overhauls, including reworked stamina, sneaking, blocking, archery, hit reaction, and HUD. And with Oblivion's birthday looming - it originally released on 20th March 2006 - now seem like a good moment for Bethesda to finally revel its hand.

            <p>
There's a lot of buzz around Inzoi, the upcoming Sims-like from developer Krafton - partly because it's a promising new contender in a genre that's so far been dominated by a single series, and partly because it's a bit of a looker. And if you were wondering exactly what sort of PC you'll be needing in order to crank Inzoi up to the max, those details have now been revealed - alongside a video showing how the game'll look at different tiers.
</p>
<p>
Inzoi (or InZOI as Krafton would have it) is described as "complete community simulation" where "every character [acts] on their free will". It promises to give players the tools to "alter any aspect of their world to create unique stories and experiences", alongside the likes of jobs and "deep relationships through interactions". It's also leaning hard on the customisation side of things, showcasing remarkably detailed characters and elaborate homes.
</p>
<p>
Inevitably, its Unreal Engine 5 powered reality - which takes a far more photorealistic approach compared to something like The Sims - isn't going to run on any old potato. And Krafton has now revealed exactly what hardware players will need to have stuffed inside their gaming PCs if they want to play Inzoi at either Minimum, Medium, Recommended, or High settings without risking the chance of a weird small and/or small house fire.
</p>

<p>
In fact, Krafton's gone a little further than that, <a href="https://playinzoi.com/en/news/8303">providing eight different preset options</a> giving players an easy way to choose between better graphics or better performance across its four hardware tiers. Even more handily, all this is accompanied by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFzk45yOjkY">video demonstrating the impact these various setting will have on the game</a>. And while the differences are certainly evident, Inzoi still looks to put on a decent show on lower-end hardware.

<p>
Inzoi initially comes to PC as an early access release - it'll be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/">available on Steam from 28th March</a> - and Krafton says it'll "continue working on optimisations to improve performance while finding ways to lower system requirements without compromising overall quality." 
</p>
<p>
"Our team is committed to enhancing the Inzoi experience for creators," it concludes. "We truly appreciate your patience and continued support, and we look forward to seeing you in early access." Oh, and in case you were wondering, yes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/want-to-know-what-inzois-woohoo-equivalent-will-be-like">Inzoi <em>does</em> have its own form of WooHoo</a>.
