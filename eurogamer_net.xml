            <p>
Motor company Honda has unveiled a glimpse at a Pokémon motorbike themed around Legendary creature Koraidon, star of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-scarlet-violet-walkthrough-tips-9015">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a>.
</p>
<p>
Koraidon, along with his buddy Miraidon, are dragon-like creatures which can be used as motorbikes in the games. So the theming is appropriate. 
</p>
<p>
But is this motorbike practical for the real world? Well, that's another matter. With spikes on its wheels and actual feet (although maybe that's a stand?), it seems like not. And that's before you get to the lack of license plate. Still, if you had the money and the space for it, you would. Wouldn't you?

<p>
Honda's sneak peek of the Koraidon motorbike, made in conjunction with The Pokémon Company, is available to watch above. A full unveiling - when we're likely to find out how much this beast might cost - will come next month. 
</p>
<p>
"Honda has realised an almost life-size reproduction of the shape of Koraidon in both weight and size, down to the finest details," the company wrote.
</p>
<p>
"Honda will use its proprietary self-balancing technology to enable Honda Koraidon to walk on all four legs, and self-stand on two-wheels which is unseen in the game. This balance technology... was developed by applying the self-balancing technology cultivated in ASIMO humanoid robot research. Honda will apply this technology to realise Koraidon's 'Sprinting Build'.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time a Pokémon has been transformed into a motorbike. Last year, Toyota took the reigns on a Miraidon prototype - though it's unclear if that design was ever proven road-worthy (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/random-honda-teases-real-life-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-motorbike">Nintendo Life</a>).

Ubisoft has detailed the list of achievements for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and said the game won't require you to play twice or pick a particular character at certain points in order to unlock every award.
</p>
<p>
The full list of achievements lies below - and they're the same across Steam, Xbox and for Trophies on PlayStation. There are no spoilers.
</p>
<p>
Not requiring multiple playthroughs is probably for the best - Shadows looks like another Assassin's Creed epic, following previous games like Odyssey and Valhalla where I clocked up playtime in the 100s of hours.

</figure>
<p>
Having to finish the game once to then unlock a harder difficulty and grind for another achievement after completing that? No thank you.
</p>
<p>
"Available on day one, these Steam achievements (which are the same as the Xbox achievements and PlayStation trophies) can all be earned in a single playthrough, meaning no achievement can be missed regardless of what story choices you make," Ubisoft wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3159330/view/535468672209128051?l=english">blog post on Steam</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"And don't worry - your Leap of Fail will look just as spectacular whether you're playing on story mode or on expert level, as all achievements are unlockable regardless of difficulty level."
</p>
<p>
(At a guess, I'd say Leap of Fail will likely pop when you try to perform the iconic Assassin's Creed dive as samurai Yasuke - who is not trained for the purpose.)
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows' two protagonists offer two different gameplay styles (quiet assassin, or all-out samurai) and can be swapped between frequently - or not, if you so choose.
</p>
<p>
The game also features dialogue choices, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-has-a-canon-mode-story-option-without-narrative-choices">Ubisoft has also confirmed Assassin's Creed Shadows' canon story mode option</a> for those who want a strictly linear narrative.

            <p>Details on the forthcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach are scarce at the moment, but as new details slowly emerge it sounds a lot like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> - though there's plenty still to come.</p>
<p>Ahead of creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s SXSW livestream at which the release date is expected, Sony has updated the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">PlayStation website listing</a> for the sequel with fresh details hinting towards how it will play.</p>
<p>"Expect the unexpected," it reads, which is just par for the course with Kojima games.</p>

<p>"Sam - with companions by his side - sets out on a new journey to save humanity from extinction. Join them as they traverse a world beset by otherworldly enemies, obstacles and a haunting question: Should we have connected?"</p>
<p>Until now, we've only seen an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr2yB93pIGw">initial teaser trailer of Death Stranding 2</a> at The Game Awards in 2022 and an announcement trailer at last year's PlayStation State of Play (above).</p>
<p>The website update essentially hints to what has already been inferred from these trailers.</p>
<p>"The large open-world environments of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach are full of secrets to be found," it reads, describing the "unique and explorable world". "They are also incredibly varied and pose unique challenges to navigate."</p>
<p>That tracks with the announcement trailer, in which we see Sam Bridges exploring a desert, a cityscape, and more beyond the first game's Icelandic-inspired highlands.</p>
<p>The game also promises "exciting and adaptable combat" where players can be aggressive, stealthy, or avoid combat, much like the first game.</p>
<p>It also confirms, as expected, the "social strand gameplay" will return, as "your actions can affect how other players interact with the game's world, and vice-versa".</p>
<p>More specifically: "Death Stranding 2: On the Beach supports asynchronous multiplayer in the same way as the original game. Actions of other players, such as the creation of roads or structures and the routes they have travelled, will become visible and usable to the player once they have successfully connected areas of the map." PS Plus is not required to access these elements.</p>
<p>Of course, there's plenty more to Death Stranding 2, even just by the trailers. How is Higgs back? Why does he battle with an electric guitar? And what the hell is with the talking puppet?</p>

<p>Kojima skipped the PlayStation State of Play earlier this month, but on 9th March he will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-skipped-playstation-state-of-play-but-kojimas-sxsw-panel-will-bring-new-details">host a panel at SXSW where we'll find out more about the game</a>. Sony has also confirmed the game is still on track for a 2025 release.</p>
<p>At SXSW Kojima will be joined by actors Norman Reedus and Troy Baker, as well as musician Woodkid (who contributed to the Arcane soundtrack).</p>
<p>Kojima is also drip-feeding hints on his social media account - stay tuned!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The co-creator of the original Xbox console, Seamus Blackley, said VR still doesn't have a "killer app" yet and that's why the technology hasn't taken off.</p>
<p>Blackley spoke on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4z0BGj2zmTceUpoQ8WL2qr">VideoGamer Podcast</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcguide.com/news/xbox-creator-claims-theres-still-no-killer-app-for-vr-yet/">PC Guide</a>) and had some strong words to say about VR and AR gaming.</p>
<p>"We've seen VR and AR not really take off, and if you're a big fan, I'm sorry, but it's just the fucking fact," he said. "There is no killer app and nobody can put their finger on what a killer app could be."</p>

<p>He continued: "Everybody has a different kind of personal fantasy and then, at least in my experience, when you are given the environment that you sort of fantasised about you're like 'OK' and you just want to take the headset off, because it's this hot, heavy thing. It's weird and disappointing."</p>
<p>Blackley said one of the key issues with VR "from a narrative standpoint" is that it offers "too much freedom", and that illusion of freedom is undermined by the need for developers to provide narrative control.</p>
<p>"When you lower the structure so much for the player that they are in the headset and they look around everywhere, in principle as an elevator pitch that sounds great," he said. "In practice, when we want to be entertained, we want a storyteller to control the narrative and to entertain us.</p>
<p>"To some extent you need [developers] to be able to control what you're looking at," he continued. "You need them to constrain you to the narrative which is not the thing you're going to do. And there's a small minority of guys who are going to scream and yell at them and want full control and that's great, super cool, fine, guys but they enjoy having that control because they're getting off on breaking that narrative control and they wouldn't be getting off on it if it wasn't there already, so it's paradoxical."</p>
<p>There have certainly been some great technical showcases for VR: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-call-of-the-mountain-review-a-visually-spectacular-introduction-to-the-psvr2">Horizon Call of the Mountain</a> launched with Sony's PSVR2 to show off its capabilities, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-alyx-review-a-legend-returns-in-elegant-form">Valve's Half-Life Alyx</a> has been celebrated by the few who have played it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/synapse-a-pure-power-fantasy-that-epitomises-everything-great-about-virtual-reality">Synapse</a> is another great VR game that "epitomises everything great about virtual reality", as reads our review, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beat-saber-out-now-on-psvr2">Beat Saber</a> - available on almost every headset - is arguably VR's "killer app".</p>
<p>Yet Sony in particular is failing to support its PS VR2 headset - its recent PlayStation State of Play had no mention of the platform whatsoever. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> creative director Nicolas Doucet said last year there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-chance-of-astro-bot-coming-to-ps-vr2-says-creative-director">"no chance" of the game coming to PS VR2</a>, and as Eurogamer's Ian Higton wrote "it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-hard-to-stay-excited-about-the-playstation-vr2-if-even-astro-bot-wont-wear-one">hard to stay excited about the PlayStation VR2</a> if even Astro Bot won't wear one", after starring in PS VR1 game Astro Bot: Rescue Mission.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Eternal Strands, the well-received action-RPG from Dragon Age boss Mike Laidlaw's Yellow Brick Games studio, has shared its latest roadmap, promising - among other things - free DLC created in collaboration with Final Fantasy concept artist Yusuki Mogi and, separately, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-more-heroes">No More Heroes</a> studio Grasshopper Manufacture.
</p>
<p>
Eternal Strands, if you're in need of a refresher, launched last month, inviting players to follow the adventures of Brynn - a member of a dwindling group of magic users known as the Weavers - who sets out across a fantasy kingdom ravaged by a cataclysmic magical event to uncover its mysteries and recover her people's cultural home.
</p>
<p>
In gameplay terms, it borrows bits from the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, with a bit of Monster Hunter thrown in - a mix Christian Donlan reckoned made for a "combustible and hilarious sandbox" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eternal-strands-review">four star Eurogamer review</a>.

<p>
And now, with Eternal Strands' first month of release almost behind it, Yellow Brick Games is ready to start discussing its post-launch plans. And that begins with a "Day 30 Patch" coming in March and promising a range of enhancements. There's talk of improved character movement to reduce its "slippery" sensation, for instance, as well as improved combat responsiveness, reduced Umbral Darter presence in certain areas, bug fixes, and more.
</p>
<p>
Then it's onto the fun stuff. Sometime this "spring", Eternal Strands will receive its first free DLC. This'll see Yellow Brick teaming up with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a> and XVI concept artist Yusuke Mogi to design and introduce a new in-game epic, a new armour set, and new weapon skins. Eternal Strands' spring update also promises a new map and magic power, a weapon and armour dying system, Oria's tips and tricks, plus further bug fixes.

<p>
That'll eventually lead into summer, when Eternal Strands' second free DLC update arrives. This is a collaboration with No More Heroes studio Grasshopper Manufacture, and is set to deliver currently unspecified "new content", among other things.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of March's first major patch release, Yellow Brick has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1491410/announcements/detail/506195909797741133">shared developer notes</a> outlining its key changes in more detail. Additionally, the studio is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EternalStrands/comments/1iuunkp/ama_with_the_devs_feb_27_11am_et/">set to hold an Eternal Strands Ask Me Anything on Reddit</a> this Thursday, 27th February at 4pm GMT, where it'll be nattering about everything from the game's lore to the future features and content it has planned.
