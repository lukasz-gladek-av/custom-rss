            <p>
Some 35 years after experiencing an overwhelming sense of mild disappointment thanks to Ocean Software's Terminator 2: Judgment Day on the ZX Spectrum 128K, I get to tell you a new video game adaptation of James Cameron's movie hit is coming this September. But despite the furious march of technology, this one's also going to be 2D.
</p>
<p>
Terminator 2D: No Fate is the work of developer Bitmap Bureau - the studio behind the likes of Xeno Crisis and 88 Heroes - and it's looking to deliver some good old-fashioned arcade-style side-scrolling action inspired by "iconic scenes from Terminator 2" and "original scenarios".
</p>
<p>
Its obvious selling point is its rather strikingly animated pixel art, but - as per Terminator 2D's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkMFYMG3QLw">announcement trailer</a> - it's also got a bit where you get to wander around a bar as the T-800, smashing up baddies while unabashedly in the nude. As it happens though, the T-800 (nude or otherwise) is just one of several characters you can play as in Terminator 2D.

<p>
Bitmap Bureau say the T-800 has been designed to emphasise his weight and power, with moves including a devastating shoulder barge. And while he's slower than Terminator 2D's other playable characters - Sarah Conner and John Connor - he also has high durability. As for Sarah, she's agile and reactive, excelling at melee combat with a sliding attack. However, she can also deploy her laser sight, locking her in place but significantly boosting damage.
</p>

<p>
John Connor, meanwhile, will be playable as an adult during the game's Future War missions. He's not as agile as Sarah, but can evade attacks with a tactical roll, and also emphasises mid-to-long-range combat, with a plasma rifle, pipe bombs, and three ammo types. And, of course, the iconic T-1000 is back as the game's main adversary - liquid metal abilities included.
</p>
<p>
Terminator 2D: No Fate - which also includes multiple endings, leaving players to decide humanity's future - launches for PlayStation 5, Playstation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam and Epic) on 5th September.
