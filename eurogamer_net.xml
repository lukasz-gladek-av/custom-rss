            <p>Developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> is developing a co-op mode for Hitman: World of Assassination.</p>
<p>Announced last night, this mode is still relatively under wraps, but does feature two names you may recognise: Stone and Knight. These two popped up in the Hitman Sniper mode.</p>
<p>On this co-op mode's release, players will be able to pop into "exciting missions" from the Hitman world with their pal by their side. These missions will "challenge" players to rethink how they approach things now they are going in as one of a pair. Someone once said to me a good friend will always help you hide the bodies, so I guess that is very fitting for this story.</p>

<p>IO noted it was "early days" for its upcoming Hitman co-op mode, but it would share more news about it all with us "soon", so stay tuned.</p>
<p>In addition to this little nugget, IO has also announced that Hitman: World of Assassination has now reached the 25m units sold milestone. The developer added the game has registered 80 million players, which takes into account players from World of Assassination, as well as its Free Starter Pack.</p>
<p>"Agent 47 continues to resonate with audiences around the world, proving the enduring appeal of the franchise as it approaches its 25th anniversary," said IO head Hakan Abrak.</p>
<p>"Everyone at IOI extends its sincere thanks to the global community of players, and we look forward to delivering many more hours of stealth, creativity, and signature assassinations in the years to come."</p>

<p>IO also recently lifted the lid on its upcoming Bond game. Earlier this week, we got a reveal trailer which introduced us to the young Bond at the start of his life as an agent. But, while it may be an origin story, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-may-be-an-original-story-but-you-might-have-missed-plenty-of-homages-to-the-bonds-that-came-before">007: First Light already has plenty of nods to the Bond books and films that came before</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
