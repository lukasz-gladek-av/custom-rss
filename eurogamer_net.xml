We've learned an awful lot about Switch 2 over the last 24 hours or so, but not so much - as is Nintendo's usual way - when it comes to the technology driving the thing. Now, though, Nvidia, which designed the console's GPU, has talked a little about Switch 2's abilities, claiming it has "10x the graphics performance" of the original Switch.
</p>
<p>
Nvidia discussed Switch 2 - and confirmed various bits of information which have circulated following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-reveals-a-proper-generational-upgrade-though-its-biggest-new-idea-remains-unproven">Nintendo's recent hands-on event for press</a> - in a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nintendo-switch-2-leveled-up-with-nvidia-ai-powered-dlss-and-4k-gaming/">post on its website</a>, referring to the console's processor as a "custom" design featuring "dedicated RT Cores and Tensor Cores", alongside AI-driven enhancements. Those Tensor Cores, it claims, "boost AI-powered graphics while keeping power consumption efficient", while the RT Cores "enhance in-game realism with dynamic lighting and natural reflections".
</p>
<p>
Nvidia also reiterated HDR and AI upscaling - via DLSS - are supported on Switch 2, and that the console's GPU is capable of 4K visuals (at an unspecified maximum frames per second) while docked, and up to 120fps at 1080p in handheld mode. Variable refresh rate via G-Sync is also supported while in handheld mode for "ultra-smooth, tear-free" gameplay. "With 1,000 engineer-years of effort across every element - from system and chip design to a custom GPU, APIs and world-class development tools," it continued, "Switch 2 brings major upgrades."

<p>
Some of the Nvidia's chatter was either confirmed or hinted at during yesterday's Switch 2 Direct, of course - with the likes of 4K and 120fps both referenced during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-will-have-paid-upgrades-for-certain-switch-games-bringing-enhanced-frame-rates-and-more">Nintendo's announcement enhanced upgrades for various original Switch titles are coming</a>. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, for instance, supports 4K and 60fps with HDR in Quality Mode, and 1080p/120fps with HDR in Performance mode.
</p>
<p>
As for Nvidia's claim Switch 2 has "10x the graphics performance" of the original Switch, it certainly sounds impressive, but Digital Foundry was perhaps more cautious in its evaluation of Switch 2's potential real-world performance when sharing its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-switch-2s-full-reveal-analysed-how-powerful-is-nintendos-new-hardware">initial analysis of the console</a>. "As an opener for the deluge of games to come, Switch 2 lands where I would expect it to based on what we've seen so far," Richard Leadbeatter wrote. "Personally, I went into the presentation expecting a machine with overall performance in line with Steam Deck, but early indications do suggest something more potent - at least in docked configuration."
</p>
<p>
It'll be a while yet before Digital Foundry gives Switch 2 the full hands-on treatment, but until then there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">plenty more to read about and plenty more to see</a>, particularly as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-treehouse-live-presentations-announced-featuring-hands-on-gameplay-of-switch-2-titles">Nintendo delves deeper into some of the console's launch window titles</a> over the few days. Switch 2, of course, arrives on 5th June, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-are-now-live">some stores have already begun taking pre-orders in the UK</a>.
