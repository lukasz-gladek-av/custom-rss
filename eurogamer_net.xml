            <p>
The developer of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-snap">Marvel Snap</a> has confirmed it has landed a new publishing partner in the wake of this month's outage that saw the game suddenly become unplayable in the US.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1884400415925817429?s=46">statement</a>, Second Dinner said it had "already signed agreements and started the work to bring almost all operational and publishing responsibilities in-house", with support from Skystone Games, a US-based indie games publisher.
</p>
<p>
Second Dinner had previously pledged to ditch its current publisher, Nuverse, in order to avoid any further disruption.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-snap-gets-surprise-us-suspension-as-stateside-tiktok-ban-takes-effect">Marvel Snap went offline in the US for over 24 hours</a> and was pulled from app stores in the country as a result of Nuverse's parent company being ByteDance - the Chinese owner of social meda app TikTok. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-in-talks-to-buy-tiktok-us-president-says">TikTok has officially been banned in the US</a> due to security concerns around how it handles user data, and similarly went offline for a brief period. For now, the ban has been paused while negotiations continue over an expected sale - with Microsoft reportedly one of the interested parties.
</p>
<p>
At the time of Marvel Snap's sudden outage, US users were greeted with a message apologising that the game "isn't available right now" as "a law banning Marvel Snap has been enacted in the US".
</p>
<p>
As players reacted in shock, the game's developers issued a statement which suggested they had been given no warning the downtime was set to occur.
</p>
<p>
"This outage is a surprise to us and wasn't planned. Marvel Snap isn't going anywhere," Second Dinner said in a defiant statement. "We're actively working on getting the game up as soon as possible."
</p>
<p>
After the game returned, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-snap-reveals-staggering-compensation-to-all-players-after-tiktok-ban-unexpectedly-took-it-offline">Second Dinner announced an enormous package of in-game rewards as an apology</a> to players, and pledged to find a new publisher "to make sure this never happens again".

            <p>
Hideaki Nishino has become Sony Interactive Entertainment's sole CEO, after a period of joint rule with PlayStation studios boss Herman Hulst. 
</p>
<p>
Sony's reshuffle also comes with a new boss for the overall company, with veteran exec and former CFO Hiroki Totoki now the company's overall CEO and president. 
</p>
<p>
Hulst, meanwhile, will remain the boss of PlayStation Studios - now reporting in to Nishino rather than running Sony's gaming arm alongside him.

<p>
Both men had shared leadership of PlayStation since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-is-retiring-in-march">last year's departure of former boss Jim Ryan</a>, with Nishino focused on the company's business side while Hulst focused on overseeing its game development studios.
</p>
<p>
Hulst will continue to look after "the development, publishing and business operations of SIE's first-party content" and further work with Sony Pictures to adapt key PlayStation franchises into films and TV series.
</p>
<p>
"I am truly honored to take the helm at Sony Interactive Entertainment," Nishino said in a statement. "Technology and creativity are two of our biggest strengths as we continue to focus on developing experiences that deliver entertainment for everyone. 
</p>
<p>
"We will continue to grow the PlayStation community in new ways, such as IP expansion, while also delivering the best in technology innovation.
</p>
<p>
"I want to thank Herman for his expertise and leadership as he continues his role as CEO, Studio Business Group," Nishino concluded. "I am deeply grateful for the PlayStation community and their continued support and I am very excited for what the future holds."
</p>
<p>
Sony has had mixed success over the past year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-console-sales-top-65m-as-astro-bot-sells-15m-copies-in-first-month">continued strong sales of PlayStation 5 hardware</a> but also the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reflects-on-concords-failed-launch-and-removal-after-two-weeks">high-profile failure of live-service shooter Concord</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">reported cancellation of other live-service projects</a>.

            <p>
There's some good news for PC players who spent the end of last year casting jealous glances at PlayStation owners, following the surprise re-release of Capcom's beloved survival horror game Dino Crisis; not only is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dino-crisis">Dino Crisis 1</a> now available on PC, it's sequel has also been re-released, meaning PlayStation owners might be feeling a little green eyed now too.
</p>
<p>
Dino Crisis, if you're unfamiliar, originally released for PlayStation 1 back in 1999. It was created by legendary Capcom director Shinji Mikami, giving the B-movie survival horror template established in his earlier Resident Evil a jungle-based, dinosaur-themed twist. A more action-focused sequel released in 2000, followed by the Xbox-exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dino-crisis-3">Dino Crisis 3</a> in 2003, and that was it for the series - leaving it to develop something of a cult following in the years since.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, according to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dino-crisis-is-the-series-most-capcom-fans-want-to-see-get-a-new-game">Capcom poll last year</a>, Dino Crisis is the series fans want to see the developer revisit the most. To date, that hasn't happen - creator Shinji Mikami later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-space-for-dino-crisis-when-monster-hunter-exists-says-shinji-mikami">told Eurogamer</a> he doesn't "feel like there's a whole lot of space" for a new Dino Crisis game thanks to the success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> - but Capcom did at least attempt to appease fans with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/octobers-playstation-plus-extra-and-premium-games-include-dead-island-2-dino-crisis">surprise PlayStation Plus re-release of Dino Crisis 1 last October</a>. Since then, Dino Crisis 1 has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-dino-crisis-is-now-available-for-all-to-purchase-on-playstation">made available for general purchase on PlayStation</a>, and now - in partnership with GOG - Capcom has launched the game and its beloved sequel on PC.

<p>
Both Dino Crisis GOG releases are DRM-free and include all content included in the originals, alongside a range of enhancements for modern-day machines. Dino Crisis 1, for instance, is now playable on Windows 10/11, and includes Original mode, Arrange mode, and the Operation Wipe Out mode exclusive to the game's original PC port back in the day. It also features enhanced DirectX rendering, 4K resolution support, plus new in-game options including V-sync, gamma correction, and anti-aliasing. That's in addition to support for modern controllers, and fixes for stability, transparency, and save issues.
</p><p>
Dino Crisis 1 &amp; 2 launch for PC via GOG today (<a href="https://www.gog.com/game/dino_crisis">here</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/dino_crisis_2">here</a>, specifically), and there's a <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/dino_crisis_bundle">two-game bundle</a> for anyone wanting to pick up both. Their arrival coincides with the launch of GOG's new Dreamlist tool - a "next generation" version of its Community Wishlist - intended to show IP owners community interest in old games and help bring them back to life.
