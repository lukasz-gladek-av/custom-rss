            <p>The Last of Us season two is under way, and this weekend we were treated to the second episode. 'Treated' is, perhaps, the wrong word to use here. After all, there were some pretty major story beats in this episode, and well, you know voices on the internet have opinions on what happened.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of major spoilers for The Last of Us below. </strong></p>

<p>We knew it was coming, but it happened perhaps sooner than many of us expected. In the second episode of The Last of Us season two, Joel is killed by Abby.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no bad blood at all between Pedro Pascal and Kaitlyn Dever, who play Joel and Abby on the show. Soon after the episode aired, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIsnfw9uzpL/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">Pascal shared a heartwarming picture of the two on set</a>, captioning the image: "Thank you, scene partner. You little miracle."</p>

</figure>
<p>But, while Pascal and Dever are smiling in the photo, there is no denying that the moment of Joel's death was tough, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/joel-actor-pedro-pascal-discusses-the-last-of-us-season-twos-most-shocking-moment-yet">for the cast and viewers</a>. Perhaps it was harder for those coming to the show without any prior knowledge of the source material. This user seems to think so.</p>

<p>But, then again, even those who already knew Joel is killed by Abby in The Last of Us Part 2 are still pretty upset.</p>

<p>Some have said they will <a href="https://x.com/B3ARZATTO/status/1914157825669976290/photo/1">never emotionally recover from seeing Ellie lying next to Joel's dead body</a> at the end of the episode.</p>
<p>"Ellie crawling to Joel’s body and cuddling up next to it.. that was way worse than the game," <a href="https://x.com/giannaispunk/status/1914137102511415581">wrote one viewer</a>.</p>
<p>"Does it ever keep y'all up at night knowing how Joel was ready to end it all? to accept his fate in death, until he heard Ellie yelling for him to get up? What little energy he had left was used in trying to push himself to live for her," <a href="https://x.com/pascalfanatic/status/1914528859787039152">another viewer wrote</a>, referring to the way Joel lifted his fingers while lying on the ground in a beaten bloody mess.</p>
<p>"THE WAY HIS FINGERS TWITCH. HE WANTED TO REACH OUT TO HER. OH MY GOD," <a href="https://x.com/lcvespascal/status/1914161545593983060">reads yet another post</a>.</p>
<p>Here's another user so upset by the whole ordeal that full caps lock was the only way to write. "ELLIE LAYING ON TOP OF JOELS BODY WAS THE MOST FOUL THING I’VE EVER SEEN," <a href="https://x.com/xkimberlynx/status/1914136143781671400">they wrote</a>.</p>

<p>Some viewers have just decided to go into denial, and as far as they are concerned Joel is absolutely fine, thank you very much.</p><p>

"I'm still convinced Joel'ss death scene was a mass hallucination like no that actually did not happen," <a href="https://x.com/dayasrussell/status/1914330722610864196">wrote one hopeful viewer</a>. 

</p><p>"Guys he got up !! He listened to Ellie !! im so glad hes alright that was a close one," <a href="https://x.com/troianns/status/1914397799715672203">one person said</a> with an image of Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal on set.</p> <div>

<p>"He's working in his office with a nice cup of coffee, already halfway in on rebuilding his connection  with Ellie. They're watching a movie together in the next episode, actually."</p>

<p>Others shared photos of Pascal's Joel with his daughter Sarah, played in series one by Nico Parker. "25 long years later, they’re finally together," wrote one viewer with a collection of images.</p>

Also, as pointed out by several viewers online, Tommy still doesn't know his brother is dead. And, let's be honest, he already isn't exactly having the best day. </p> <div>

<p>I think <a href="https://x.com/wizardjarin/status/1914266574346658117">this user</a> has summed things up quite well for all of us watching The Last of Us season two. They captioned an image of Pascal bobbing about in the ocean while on holiday as this: "New photo of Pedro Pascal swimming in our tears."</p>
<p>Agree, we have probably all cried an ocean's worth since episode two aired earlier this week. At least he's still alive to look after Grogu in The Mandalorian, I suppose…</p>

<p>On the plus side, though, at least Joel knew he was handsome before he was beaten to a pulp. Abby said it both this episode and the first episode.</p>

            <p>
A developer who worked on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney</a> has commented on recent research that pitted various AI models against the classic courtroom series' first installment.
</p>
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ace-attorney-dev-reacts-to-the-game-being-used-to-test-how-smart-ai-models-are-maybe-this-kind-of-deductive-power-is-the-strength-of-humans/">Automaton</a>, Hao AI Lab used Ace Attorney to try and benchmark four AI models' memory, reasoning skills, visual understanding and strategic decision-making - with some performing better than others.
</p>
<p>
While none of the AI models managed to beat the game, Google Gemini and Open AI's o1 managed to reason their way through to its penultimate episode.
</p>
<p>
"This index uses Ace Attorney to evaluate the AI's practical ability to 'find inconsistencies in testimony, select appropriate evidence to support them, and refute them most effectively'," AI researcher K Ishi <a href="https://x.com/K_Ishi_AI/status/1912330532274483213">wrote</a>. "As a result, the best 'lawyer' was o1."
</p>
<p>
The research was designed to test each AI's ability to consider "the entire flow of the case and make decisions without being limited to current testimony", Ishi added, as well as having the "ability to consider the timing of 'meaningful' situations and create the most effective strategy". 
</p>
<p>
Each AI's understanding would also have to remain flexible enough to react to fresh evidence coming to light mid-trial, he continued. You can watch each of the four AI models tested play the game via the video in the embed below.

"How should I put this, I never thought the game I worked on so desperately 25 years ago would come to be used in this way, and overseas at that (laughs)," <a href="https://x.com/m_sugimori/status/1913719762762477685">wrote Ace Attorney developer Masakazu Sugimori</a>, who composed the game's soundtrack and voiced antagonist Manfred von Karma.
</p>
<p>
"I find it interesting how the AI models get stumped in the first episode," Sugimori continued, in response to seeing the research. "[Ace Attorney director Shu] Takumi and [executive producer Shinji] Mikami were very particular about the difficulty level of Episode 1 - it's supposed to be simple for a human. Maybe this kind of deductive power is the strength of humans?"
</p>
<p>
"The reason why Takumi and Mikami were so particular about balancing the difficulty level of Ace Attorney's first episode was because 'there was no other game like it in the world at the time'," Sugimori added. 
</p>
<p>
"It had to be a difficulty that would be acceptable to a wide playerbase, but it had to avoid being insultingly simple too. They were going for the kind of difficulty that gives you a sense of satisfaction when the solution hits you."
</p>
<p>
And as far as we know, no AI has been programmed to feel that same sense of satisfaction - yet. Come back in five years, though, and it'll be interesting to see whether the AI models of 2030 can beat the game.
