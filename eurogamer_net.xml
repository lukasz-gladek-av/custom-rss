            <p>For many, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-review">Borderlands 4</a> was a return to form after a so-so third entry. For others, it was more of the same. All in all, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/borderlands-4/">critics largely liked it</a> while players had hotter takes. The FPS <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6t4pndwc2w">broke into 2025's best-selling list</a>, and that's what ultimately matters to the powers that be. Thus, we're now looking at plenty of new content coming to the looter shooter soon.</p>
<p>A stacked <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/2026-roadmap/">Borderlands 4 roadmap</a> was revealed on 29th January, with detailed plans that go up to Q3 2026. The game's "first major update" introduces a Photo Mode and is now live, but content and other substantial additions won't start pouring in until later this month. Before we give you a quick rundown on everything set to arrive, you can check out the full thing below:</p>

<p>In February, Bounty Pack 2: Legend of the Stone Demon introduces a new mission with extra Legendary loot and more cosmetics to unlock. It's important to note this second Bounty Pack will be paid, unlike the first one. Alongside this piece of DLC, Pearlescent gear, a rarity superior to even Legendary, will arrive to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> and for all players. Later, the first of the planned Story Packs, Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned, will introduce "an all-new region of Kairos, new story missions, and the first new Vault Hunter" for the game.</p><p>C4SH is the name of the new playable character, "a former casino dealer bot turned drifter who chases the probability-breaking highs of cursed eldritch artifacts." I haven't played the game yet, but that sounds like really playful and off-beat game design for a subgenre in dire need of innovation, so thumbs up.</p>
<p>Though more pieces of content, both free and paid, are listed on the roadmap, Gearbox isn't ready to discuss all of them yet. That said, highly requested quality-of-life changes will come "as soon as possible" too. Those include a level cap increase, cross-platform saves, shared progression (world progress and other non-class unlocks) across all Vault Hunters, and more free events to spice things up.</p>
<p>Last but not least, endgame content appears to be set to receive meaty additions with more raid bosses (starting in Q2 2026), new Takedown missions, and other endgame activities in both small and big sizes. We're used to looter shooters taking a while to fully come together by now, but considering the Borderlands series refuses to fully embrace a live-service DNA, this all feels like a notable effort to keep it going for years to come.</p>

            <p>Hypergryph, the developers of Arknights Endfield, has today explained the cause and full scope of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arknights-endfield-paypal-problem">last week's player mischarge problem</a>. According to a newly released statement, all players impacted by the unauthorized charges have been refunded.</p>
<p>The company has revealed that the single highest mischarge to a player's PayPal account was $5,289, with roughly $80,000 in total unauthorized charges being made across the playerbase. PayPal, the payment-option at the heart of this problem, remains disabled in Arknights Endfield as further tests are conducted to make sure no future issues with</p>
<p>A representative of Hypergryph provided Eurogamer the following statement: "The issue was caused by a payment processing glitch affecting certain PayPal transactions made via the official launcher and topup.gryphline.com. Based on our review, the issue affected 3,429 orders across servers, involving around 1,800 players. The total value of the affected orders was approximately $80,000, with the highest single affected transaction amounting to $5,289.</p>

<p>"After confirming the issue, PayPal payments were disabled within hours to prevent further impact. All affected transactions were identified on the same day, and full refunds were issued to all impacted players. In addition, no purchased items were revoked during this process -- players retained all items associated with the refunded transactions.</p><p>"Over the past week, we have completed a comprehensive internal review and implemented improvements to our order validation and monitoring processes. We have also introduced additional safeguards around third-party payment providers to further reduce the risk of similar issues occurring in the future.</p>
<p>"At present, PayPal payments remain disabled as a precautionary measure. This is not due to an unresolved issue, but a deliberate decision to allow for extended testing and verification before the payment option is re-enabled."</p>
<p>Now that this problem has seemingly been resolved, players should be good to hop into Arknights Endfield worry-free.

All three of its best aspects work in tandem to create a game that's worth playing for anyone with a hunger for a new action title."</p>

            <p>The Game Awards 2025 gave us plenty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">juicy reveals</a>, but few were as surprising as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-galactic-racer-puts-pod-racing-back-on-the-menu">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a>, a spiritual successor of sorts to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-episode-1-racer">Episode I: Racer</a> and the overlooked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-jail-break-star-wars-racer-revenge">Racer Revenge</a>. It looked stunning, but fans had one fear following its reveal: there were no old-school podracers to be found in the trailer.</p>
<p>While that last-second Sebulba tease already rekindled our hopes and dreams, <a href="https://fusegames.com/">Fuse Games</a> CEO and co-founder Matt Webster has now confirmed podracing will return alongside all sorts of other vehicles: "You can’t really make a Star Wars racing experience and not have podracing, can you? The core fantasy of the game is becoming an elite racing pilot in the Galactic League, and podracing is a pinnacle of speed and racing in the Star Wars galaxy," the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-criterion-leaders-set-up-new-aaa-games-studio-fuse-games">Criterion</a> vet <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/the-outer-rim-is-your-highway-in-star-wars-galactic-racer-but-its-more-than-burnout-in-space-you-cant-make-a-star-wars-racing-experience-and-not-have-podracing/">told GamesRadar</a> following the exciting reveal.</p> <figure>

<p>The question now is whether an older Sebulba, Anakin Skywalker's first nemesis, is the exception among a highly varied roster of racers or he'll be joined by other known faces that we saw in The Phantom Menace's lengthy Boonta Eve Classic scene. Galactic Racer takes place after the fall of the Empire, so it's been decades since podracing's glory days, but it's time to speak up, Ben Quadinaros stans.</p>
<p>What we know for sure is that Fuse Games was looking to reinvent Star Wars racing games without forgetting about their legacy: "We wanted to do more – to lean into multiple vehicle types and multiple expressions of speed to give players a breadth of experiences. Galactic Racer offers players the ability to pilot vehicles they know and love, alongside ones they won’t have experienced before, across a range of solo and multiplayer modes." The mention of several solo and multiplayer modes is interesting here, as we'd only read about a unique runs-based "<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4078430/STAR_WARS_Galactic_Racer/">story-driven campaign</a>" and regular PvP multiplayer via the materials released so far.</p><p>As much as we'd love to know more, it's likely we won't be hearing from Fuse Games for a while following Galactic Racer's big announcement, as the studio is now focusing on getting it ready for a tentative 2026 launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, but with Burnout and Need for Speed pedigree, we have a really good feeling about this.</p>
