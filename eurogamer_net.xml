            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> has tightened its rules around broadcasts that include debates about "political" and "sensitive social issues".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Content-Classification-Guidelines?language=en_US#7VII:PoliticsandSensitiveSocialIssues">statement</a>, Twitch said that whilst it is a place "for people to express themselves and discuss the world around them", from now on, any stream that includes discussions about war, religion, or "reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, or immigration" needs to be labelled.</p>

<p>"Twitch is a place for people to express themselves and discuss the world around them," Twitch explained.</p>
<p>"We require streams to be labelled when the focus of the stream includes discussions and debates about political or sensitive social issues such as discussions about elections, civic integrity, war or military conflict, and civil rights."</p>
<p>Examples of content that require a classification label include streams featuring former or current political officials if the content includes discussions with these individuals around public policies, live coverage or commentary on elections, civic processes, or election-related disputes, and livestreams of protests, rallies, or civil unrest related to civil rights issues or government policies.</p>
<p>Also subject to further labelling are discussions about military conflicts, foreign policy decisions, or national security matters, and discussing ideological or socio-political views on topics like gender, race, sexuality, or religion.</p>
<p>"Discussing legislation related to a sensitive social issue such as reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, or immigration" is also subject to labels.</p>
<p>"Streams containing informational or educational content that aim to share knowledge in a neutral, fact-based manner, rather than engaging in any kind of advocacy for an issue or candidate" are not subject to labelling, however.</p>
<p>"For example, sharing the history of how votes in the US presidential election are counted to determine the next President, or merely encouraging individuals to vote or register to vote," Twitch explained. "Intermittent mentions of politics, politicians, or sensitive social issues are not required to have the Politics and Sensitive Social Issues label."</p>
<p>The changes come after a trying few weeks for the livestreaming giant, which has found itself fielding accusations of islamophobia and anti-semitism.</p>
<p>"There is no place on Twitch for racism, hatred, or harassment of any kind, including antisemitism and Islamophobia," CEO Dan Clancy said in a <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2024/11/01/hate-and-harassment-have-no-place-on-twitch/">complementary statement</a>. "As our community has grown, we’ve endeavoured to build Community Guidelines to prohibit these harms."</p><p>"Twitch is, and will always be, about belonging. Each day, people come together on our service to build communities around shared interests, and to express themselves authentically. For this to be possible, we work hard to ensure that our community is a safe place."</p>
<p>"Millions of streamers, with a wide variety of views and perspectives, spend time on Twitch. We recognise that some content, while allowed on our service, may be objectionable to some members of our community. The views shared by streamers on Twitch are not the views of Twitch nor are they my personal views."We’re grateful for the feedback and input from our community," Clancy concluded. "Our safety approach continues to build and evolve, as our service grows. We want to ensure that anyone can find their place on Twitch, and remain committed to ensuring that hate and harassment have no place here."</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-apologises-for-issue-preventing-account-sign-ups-in-israel-and-palestine">Twitch issued an apology for preventing new account sign-ups from Israel and Palestine due to the ongoing conflict</a>. It said sign-ups were temporarily disabled following the attacks on 7th October 2023 to "prevent uploads of graphic material related to the attack and to protect the safety of users". However, until recently, this verification had not been re-enabled.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté has discussed the recent shock decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">delay the launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows until February 2025</a>, just a month before its originally intended release.
</p>
<p>
The move means Shadows will miss Assassin's Creed's typical pre-Christmas sales window, and comes amidst much <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-acknowledges-buyout-reports-stating-it-regularly-reviews-options">scrutiny of publisher Ubisoft's ongoing fortunes</a>, as well as a culture war that has erupted over Shadows' main characters.
</p>
<p>
Speaking at a BAFTA event attended by Eurogamer in London last night, Coté reflected on the reasons for delay, and the crucial importance of the game to Ubisoft at such a pivotal moment for the company and the Assassin's Creed brand.

<p>
"Players can afford to be selective, choosing only the best, and they rightfully demand excellence," Coté said. "Ubisoft's portfolio has faced criticism in recent years for a perceived inconsistency in quality. 
</p>
<p>
"Players expect more polish, more innovation and deeper engagement from the games we release, and they're not shy about letting us know when they feel we have fallen short. This environment pushes us to do better and to be better. 
</p>
<p>
"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> represents our opportunity to change that narrative, not just for Assassin's Creed, but I think for Ubisoft as a whole."
</p>
<blockquote>"In today's market, being amongst the best is just not enough anymore."</blockquote>
<p>
Shadows marks the beginning of a bold new push for the Assassin's Creed brand, and comes after a lengthy wait since the series' last fully-fledged blockbuster, 2020's Viking-fuelled Valhalla. (2023's Mirage was deliberately a smaller game, that began life as a Valhalla expansion.)
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft is priming Shadows to be the launch of a new era of Assassin's Creed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-explains-what-assassins-creed-infinity-actually-is">underpinned by a central game launcher/hub</a>, a more accessible ongoing narrative, and technological advances made possible by finally ditching the last generation of consoles. 
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Ubisoft's other 2024 blockbuster - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> - underperformed commercially, and the company once again finds itself the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-considering-buyout-taking-the-company-private-report">subject of speculation on its ongoing corporate independence</a>. The stakes have never seemed higher.
</p>
<p>
"We know this game has the potential to be one of the best in the franchise's storied history, set in one of the most anticipated settings we've yet to explore," Coté said. "But we also know that in today's market, being <em>amongst</em> the best is just not enough anymore." 
</p><p>Coté reflected on the infamous 2014 launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-unity">Assassin's Creed Unity</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-on-what-created-the-perfect-storm-behind-assassins-creed-unity">an ultimately too-ambitious technical leap for the series</a> set during the French Revolution. Ahead of launch, Ubisoft boasted that the game - the series' first installment for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles - would be where the "next generation started". Ultimately, Unity's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-addresses-every-known-assassins-creed-unity-glitch-and-workaround">graphical issues</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-unity-patch-removes-need-to-play-companion-app">convoluted online systems</a> wrecked first impressions, and the brand took a huge hit.
</p>
<blockquote>"We only have one shot at launching this game, and it has to exceed expectations."</blockquote>
<p>
"[Unity] was meant to be a major milestone for the series, but its reception at launch, marred by technical issues, left a deep impact on all parts of the company, from production to publishing, especially given Ubisoft's roots as a French company," Coté said. "This low point affected all of us, but it also served as a wake up call, reminding us how crucial it was to maintain the quality and integrity of the player experience from day one, a lesson that lives with us to this very day."
</p>
<p>All these years later, the spectre of Unity's launch still haunts the brand, it seems - and both Coté and Ubisoft bosses are keen to ensure it is never repeated.</p>
<p>
"After much reflection and analysis, I recommended to our top management to delay the release of Assassin's Creed Shadows," Coté continued. "Our playtests and team feedback made it clear Shadows had immense potential, but I felt we needed more time to ensure it fully meets the high expectations of our players. 
</p><p>
"We only have one shot at launching this game, and it has to exceed those expectations. Shadows is our most ambitious and complex project yet, with interconnected mechanics, narrative and technology all releasing across the largest number of platforms with the most options we've ever, ever supported. 
</p>
<p>
"Taking this extra time allows us to polish every aspect and set a new standard for the franchise, one that I hope will carry us forward for years. This decision reflects our commitment to delivering an experience worthy of our players' time and attention on day one. We believe Shadows will shine as a true showcase of Ubisoft's talent and dedication, setting a new benchmark in quality for the franchise."
</p>
<p>
Last night, Eurogamer reported on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-discusses-devastating-impact-of-shadows-diversity-and-inclusivity-backlash">Coté's lengthy and impassioned defence of Assassin's Creed Shadows' narrative choices and characters</a> - the reaction to which has involved a wave of backlash and online abuse aimed at the game's developers this year.

            <p>Assassin's Creed franchise boss Marc-Alexis Coté has addressed the online backlash which has swirled around the main characters of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, the subsequent  impact it has had on the game's development staff, and the attempts by bad faith commenters to disrupt and dissuade creative teams from telling stories featuring diverse and inclusive characters in general.</p>
<p>Speaking tonight in London, at an event organised by BAFTA and attended by Eurogamer, Coté offered a full-throated defence of his team's work on Shadows which has come under such notable criticism this year, particularly over the inclusion of Black samurai Yasuke as one of the game's two protagonists. Coté has addressed the subject previously, in particular <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-explains-why-he-ignored-elon-musk-after-backlash-over-african-samurai-yasuke">when the subject was commented on negatively by X owner and billionaire Elon Musk</a>, but never before in such an impassioned manner, in so much detail, at such length.</p>
<p>Discussing the current "shifting cultural landscape", Coté described the current "discussions around representation and inclusivity in media" as an additional and previously unforeseen challenge. "These conversations can influence how our games are perceived, but rather than shy away from those conversations, we should see them as an opportunity," he explained.</p>

<p>"Assassin's Creed has always been about exploring the full spectrum of human history, and by its very nature, that history is diverse. Staying true to history means embracing the richness of human perspectives - without compromise. For example, in Assassin's Creed Shadows, we highlight figures, both fictional like Naoe, a Japanese woman warrior, and historical, like Yasuke, the African born samurai. While the inclusion of a Black samurai in feudal Japan has sparked questions and even controversy, Naoe, as a fictional character, has also faced scrutiny for her gender.</p><p>"But just as Yasuke's presence in Japanese history is fact, so too are the stories of women who defied societal expectations and took up arms in times of conflict," Coté continued. "So while both Naoe and Yasuke's stories are works of historical fiction, they reflect the collision of different worlds, cultures and roles, and their inclusion is precisely the kind of narrative that Assassin's Creed seeks to tell, one that reflects the complexity and interconnectedness of our shared history.</p>
<blockquote>"We've consistently introduced protagonists from diverse racial, ethnic and gender identities."</blockquote>
<p>"And this isn't new ground for the franchise," he noted. "From Altaïr to Aveline de Grandpré to Ratonhnhaké:ton [the protagonists of Assassin's Creed 1, Liberation and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-iii">Assassin's Creed 3</a> respectively], we've consistently introduced protagonists from diverse racial, ethnic and gender identities. History is inherently diverse, and so is Assassin's Creed and the stories we tell. So to be clear, our commitment to inclusivity is grounded in historical authenticity and respect for diverse perspectives, not driven by modern agendas."</p>
<p>Coté's tone seemed notably different to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">Ubisoft's last, vague mention of "polarised comments" by company boss Yves Guillemot</a>, who raised eyebrows in September when he told investors that Ubisoft was "an entertainment-first company, creating games for the broadest possible audience, and our goal is not to push any specific agenda". Guillemot's comments followed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-team-acknowledges-elements-that-have-caused-concern-among-japanese-fans">similarly vague blanket apology by Ubisoft</a> for "some elements in our promotional materials [that] have caused concern within the Japanese community" which also stated that "while Yasuke is depicted as a samurai in Assassin's Creed Shadows, we acknowledge this is a matter of debate and discussion". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-condemns-malicious-developer-abuse-after-assassins-creed-shadows-reveal">Guillemot had previously condemned</a> the "malicious and personal online attacks" directed at Shadows' development team in the wake of the game's reveal.</p><p>"Alongside these deep-rooted franchise values is our commitment to recognise and listen to legitimate criticism as an essential part of the creative process," Coté said tonight. "Our community helps us grow, evolve and deliver better games. Today, we all however face the added challenge of distinguishing between genuine feedback and attacks driven by intolerance.</p>
<p>"The current climate is tough on our creative teams," he continued. "They face lies, half truths and personal attacks online. When the work they pour their hearts into is twisted into a symbol of division, it's not just disheartening, it can be devastating. What keeps me going is the resilience born out of conviction that I see in our teams every day. I am especially proud of the Shadows team for staying true to their creative vision and the core tenets of Assassin's Creed.</p>
<blockquote>"Our creative teams face lies, half truths and personal attacks online."</blockquote>
<p>"By choosing Naoe and Yasuke as protagonists, we are expanding the narrative landscape, offering new points of view that challenge established norms found in many works of fiction, while staying true to the history that shaped them. At the end of the day, Assassin's Creed is not just a franchise, it's a platform for entertainment, dialogue, discovery and understanding. Our commitment isn't just about reflecting on the past, it's about ensuring that the stories we tell continue to unite, inspire and challenge players, regardless of their background, and we'll continue to stand by these values because they are central to the heart of the franchise, and I believe, to the future of storytelling itself. Ultimately, we believe that the diversity and richness of the human experience is what helps Assassin's Creed resonate with players across the globe, and we're committed to standing firm on that foundation."</p>
<p>Coté noted that Assassin's Creed has featured universal themes "like resistance to tyranny and the preservation of knowledge and identity" since its outset, and that it has always featured an opening message acknowledging the game as a work of fiction created by a team diverse in both its backgrounds and beliefs. "From the very beginning, Ubisoft has embraced this diversity," Coté said. "Assassin's Creed is more than just a game. It can be a platform for meaningful exploration and reflection wrapped in the excitement of unforgettable gameplay, and it is that fusion of creativity, diversity, immersion and fun that continues to define the franchise and connect it with players around the globe."</p>
<p>Coté closed with a broader reflection on the stifling of creative freedoms more generally, as cultural differences become ever more divisive.</p>
<p>"Today, the stakes are higher," Coté said. "The stories we tell, the characters we create and the game worlds we build are instrumentalised by those who seek to silence creativity, to stoke fear and incite hatred. I believe we are facing what [author] Fareed Zakaria calls an 'Age of Revolution', a time when the real conflict is not between the left and the right, but between societies that close themselves off and those that open themselves up to the world. Throughout history, it's the open societies that have always eventually prevailed. While there may be setbacks over years or even decades, it is openness that has continually pushed humanity forward.</p>
<blockquote>"When we self-censor in the face of threats, we hand over our power, until freedom and creativity wither away."</blockquote>
<p>"This echoes the selfless bravery of our Assassin's Creed protagonists," he continued. "They fought for freedom, knowledge and the right to chart their own paths, just as we, as creators, fight to tell stories that matter in a world that grows increasingly divided. As the authors of 'How Democracies Die' so powerfully stated, democracies crumble when good people decide to stay silent. The same is true, I think, of our creative freedom when we allow fear to stifle our voices. When we self-censor in the face of threats, we hand over our power, piece by piece, until freedom and creativity both wither away. We cannot let that happen. It's time for us as creators to stand firm on our commitment to our values, by telling stories that inspire, that challenge and that help people connect. Our silence cannot become complicit.</p>
<p>"To our players - the ones who have stood by us, supported us and celebrated our work over the years with enthusiasm and constructive feedback - this stance is for you," Coté concluded. "You are the heart of our journey. We create for you, and your support fuels our creativity and strengthens our resolve to keep pushing boundaries, to tell stories that matter. This journey is yours as much as it is ours, and I thank you for being with us every step of the way. I'm an optimist and a dreamer. I believe that the answer to hate is to continue creating experiences that celebrate the richness of our world and capture the magic of our collective imagination, because in the end, creativity is stronger than fear, and together, we are creating the future of entertainment."</p><p>Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-developer-on-adapting-japanese-culture-social-media-pressures-and-ubisofts-controversial-apology">previously sat down with Assassin's Creed Shadows' art director</a> Thierry Dansereau to discuss the game's adaption of Japanese culture, social media pressures and Ubisoft's controversial apology. "Of course we're making creative choices," Dansereau told me. "It's a video game."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
