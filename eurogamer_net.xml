            <p>Comcept, the studio behind Mighty No.9, has shut down for good. This corporate dissolution was announced via Kanpo, the Japanese business newspaper-of-record earlier today.</p>
<p>The company, which was founded in 2010 by Mega Man lead  Keiji Inafune, was eventually merged into Level 5 Comcept in 2017.</p>
<p>Years later in 2024, Level 5 Comcept was taken over entirely by Level 5 following Inafune's departure from the company, becoming part of Level 5's Osaka office. This final destruction of the Comcept brand today marks a true death for the ill-fated studio.</p>

<p>Despite its illustrious pedigree, Comcept was best known for the poorly-received Mighty No.9, which was funded via Kickstarter in 2013. Upon release, critics and fans alike had issues with its gameplay, narrative, technical performance, and lack of content among other things. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mighty-no-9-review">You can read Eurogamer's review of Mighty No.9</a> for a blast from the past.</p><p>This news does spit on the foolish hopes of those still betting on receiving their Mighty No.9 3DS copies, for some reason. This was a Kickstarter stretch goal that was reached, but never actually produced despite over $4m in funding. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1ht1lk7/the_dream_is_dead_preorders_of_mighty_no_9_for/">Pre-orders for 3DS copies of Mighty No.9 were canceled last year</a> so the chances of actually receiving this were close to nil. If you were praying for a miracle though, put your hands down.</p>
<p>Comcept wasn't all bad. As part of Level 5 Comcept, the studio created Recore, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/recore-review">which received middling reviews too</a>. Ah well, rest in piece Comcept.</p>

            <p>Keeley Hawes - known for the likes of Spooks, Bodyguard, Line of Duty, Ashes to Ashes and many, <em>many </em>more - has been spotted on the set of Amazon's upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to her extensive film and television career, Hawes voiced Lara Croft for over a decade, with mainline entries Tomb Raider Legend, Anniversary and Underworld, as well as spin-offs Lara Croft: Guardian of the Light, Temple of Osiris and Reloaded, all featuring her crisp English accent and grunts of exertion.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Now, Hawes looks primed (pun intended) to star in Amazon's upcoming Tomb Raider series, with many speculating she will play Lara's mother, Lady Amelia Croft. While at the time of writing nothing has been officially announced by Amazon, if this does prove to be the case it would be a rather charming little Easter egg for series fans.</p>
<p>In Hawes' Tomb Raider Underworld, Lara is searching for her mother, who following a plane crash many years prior was supposedly sent to Helhiem, an afterlife location in Norse mythology. Having her now play Lara's mother would feel rather like a touching passing of the torch.</p>
<p>As for how her character looks in the show, British tabloid <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/38027622/keeley-hawes-amazon-prime-lara-croft/">The Sun</a> took a photo of Hawes on the Tomb Raider set, where she was being flanked by two figures in dark clothing and masks (see below).</p>

<p>Other cast members confirmed for Amazon's Tomb Raider include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sophie-turners-lara-croft-is-so-unashamedly-capable-tomb-raider-actor-says">Sophie Turner as Lara Croft</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-traitors-celia-imrie-and-more-announced-for-amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Jason Isaacs as Lara's Uncle Atlas, Martin Bobb-Semple as Zip, Bill Paterson as Winston and Celia Imrie as Francine</a> (that is to say, the Head of Advancement at the British Museum, who is "focused solely on raising funds and glasses of champagne").</p>
<p>Phoebe Waller-Bridge - who along with Fleabag is also known for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Killing Eve and Crashing - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">will serve as the show's creator</a>, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner.</p>

            <p>Bloober team has teased something mysterious on a brand-new website, leading the horror-enthusiasts on the internet scratching their heads.</p>
<p>The website, <a href="https://remosdneulserorehsoovamceyerd.com/">which you can see yourself here</a>, doesn't contain much. It has a countdown to Valentines Day, a jumbled URL, a rose that bleeds when you hover your mouse cursor over it, an audio reading of the William Blake Poem 'The Sick Rose', and the following words: "Some things never leave the walls. They only learn to wait.”</p>
<p>This has spurred speculation in a variety of directions. First, following a common interpretation of William Blake poem and its commentary on the corruption of innocence and beauty. This, as well as Bloober's prior work on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, has led some to believe this is a Silent Hill 1 Remake. The plot of that game, focusing on both Cheryl and the beauty of childbirth itself being corrupted / tarnished by the nasty Dahlia, could be applicable.</p>

</figure>
<p>Another theory is quite a simple one.<a href="https://x.com/BlooberTeam/status/2006515753176953244"> In a social media post</a> released by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> alongside this website, this phrase is written: "RemosdNeulSerorehsoOvamCeyerd". Taking the capital letters from that, you can spell the word Cronos, which some are taking as a hint that whatever will be announced in February will be a DLC for Bloober's latest game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>.</p><p>Alternatively, some have seen the rose and have immediately gone to Rule of Rose, the legendary and quite controversial horror game released back in 2006 was at the heart of a moral panic across Europe, and totally cancelled in the UK. Now, what governmental bodies assumed was an obscene experience was actually just a pretty okay horror game that has since grown to have a cult following.</p>
<p>Looking behind the curtain a bit, we know that Bloober Team is working on something dubbed "Project F" thanks to a business blog it posted last year. That's being created under the Broken Mirror Games brand, but aside from that we know sweet little about it. There's also Project M, also scheduled for a reveal some time this year.</p>
<p>So those are the three main theories: Silent Hill 1 Remake, Cronos DLC, and Rule of Rose Remake. It could, of course, be something totally different. Maybe a selection of spooky Valentines Day cards. Who knows. We'll have to wait until next month (or someone exceptionally smart) to learn the truth of it!</p>
