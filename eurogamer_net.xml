            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> didn't cause a commotion when it launched last year, but it quietly became a compelling alternative to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart World</a>'s offerings, which many felt were on the simpler (albeit extremely polished) side. Now, a little over a month since the native <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> version arrived digitally, we've got confirmation the physical release is coming in March.</p>
<p>Sega (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sonic-racing-crossworlds-physical-switch-2-release-wont-be-a-game-key-card-sega-confirms/">VGC</a>) dropped the long-awaited news on January 13, confirming the date you need to mark on the calendar is March 26. The suggested retail price is $69.99 / £64.99, same as the digital version of CrossWorlds. Perhaps more convincing is the fact the complete base game will be on a regular cartridge versus a game-key card. Mind you, patches and content updates still need to be downloaded, but we know many of you will celebrate.</p>
<p>Though some developers have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-dev-comes-out-with-first-actually-good-reason-for-using-switch-2s-controversial-game-key-cards">gone on to explain</a> game-key cards enable them to do true physical releases (better than codes in boxes for sure) while avoiding the "data streaming" limitations of the Switch carts, which are slower than Switch 2's internal SSD and microSD cards, there's been a vocal crusade against third-party releases that aren't 100% physical.</p>
<p>This has reportedly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-dev-says-nintendo-has-cheaper-cartridges-coming-as-alternative-to-game-key-cards-then-backtracks-but-either-way-its-title-will-now-be-a-proper-physical-release">pushed Nintendo to look into alternatives</a>, but for now, you can lend and sell game-key cards without issue, as they're rather similar to PlayStation and Xbox discs that only come with part of the games on them. It's more of a distant future-proofing issue.</p><p>In any case, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds' sales should see another boost with this physical release, as many fans of the off-beat racing series were waiting for a Switch 2 release they could add to their physical collection. (It's me, I'm fans.)</p>
<p>Since its September 2025 release, the game has welcomed free crossover characters like Hatsune Miku (really), Joker from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-30th-anniversary-boxing-fitness-more-announcements">Persona</a>, Ichiban Kasuga from Like a Dragon, and even NiGHTS from the underrated series of the same name. Paid content has included Pac-Man, Minecraft content, and even SpongeBob SquarePants. Up next, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mega-mans-finally-making-a-comeback-but-his-first-big-game-in-years-is-still-a-while-away">Mega Man</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>, and Avatar (the Nickelodeon one) will be making a splash too.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-was-abandoned-in-death-as-in-life-its-a-game-ea-and-bioware-would-rather-forget">BioWare's multiplayer shooter Anthem was terminated this week</a> because EA no longer wanted to maintain servers for people to play the game on, and without them, no one can play the game. But the former executive producer of Anthem has revealed that BioWare had technology working, close to the game's release, that would enable us to host our own servers to play the game on.</p>
<p>Mark Darrah, who left BioWare in December 2020, revealed the information at the end of a three-and-a-half hour video discussing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxwrCRdqZb8">"The Truth About What Happened on Anthem"</a>, which he posted on his YouTube channel. "Anthem actually had the code for local servers running in a dev environment right up until a few months up to launch," he said. "I don't know that they still work but the code is there to be salvaged and recovered."</p>
<p>This in theory presents a possible lifeline and future for Anthem, and local server hosting is a crucial part of Darrah's even bolder plan for what could be done with Anthem now. His idea? To re-release the game as single-player and remove the multiplayer component entirely.</p>
<p>Darrah, an experienced executive producer, outlined a plan for doing this. You'd need a budget of about $10m, he said, and step one would be to bring the game up to date. This wouldn't be hard. Shift it to current-gen consoles and enable the top-end PC game effects, and lock it at 60 frames-per-second. Step two: local servers. Get rid of EA's need to host servers for the game. Step three: "Pivot to something that's more about single-player storytelling."</p>
<blockquote><em>"Pivot to something that's more about single-player storytelling"</em></blockquote>
<p>Where players used to fill out groups in Anthem, you could instead have AI companions, as in other BioWare games. "And since this is BioWare," Darrah added, "go all the way into making them companions." You could use some existing characters for this and "promote" them, so to speak. "But I think you'll actually find there's a lower-friction route by making three-to-five new characters, with dialogue, with plot arcs, that are brand new to the series - that are people who'd go with you through the existing story of Anthem with their companion content," he said. "Writing those characters: not very difficult. Making those characters move with you: that's where a lot of the work is going to go."</p>
<p>What you'd have if you could do that is a game much more familiar to BioWare fans, Darrah said - people who potentially skipped Anthem because it was too looter-shooter for them. "What you've essentially re-engineered is a BioWare game," he said, "without romances, with a decent BioWare story, with companions, that can be played as a single-player game." You probably couldn't sell it for $70, he realises, but "for a pretty modest amount of work you could effectively create a brand new single-player game from what already exists for this game".</p>
<p>"Is EA going to do this?" he added. "Almost definitely not."</p>
<p>Darrah's full video covers a lot of ground, chronologically running through Anthem's development since conception in late 2011 or early 2012, through to release in 2019. It talks of the game's originating pitch as being a turning point in BioWare's history, and possibly the basis for all future live service problems to come. The video also highlights a project that crucially lacked a single unifying vision and identity - something ultimately born out in the finished game, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-review-shaken-apart-by-its-own-identity-crisis">Oli pointed out in our Anthem review</a>.</p>

            <p>Before 2026 heats up, we've got several small and mid-sized game releases coming our way fast, but unexpected arrivals like <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown">Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</a> could be making the coming weeks busier than initially anticipated.</p>
<p>Publisher Daedalic Entertainment has just unveiled a new 'combat deep dive' trailer (which you can watch below) and locked a February 18 launch for the game, which is now coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> too. As for the price tag, it's targeting $39.99 / £34.99 / €39.99, with a Deluxe Edition adding "five additional missions, two new recruitable heroes, and three new technologies" at $49.99 / £44.99 / €49.99.</p>

<p>Trapping the full experience behind the Deluxe Edition aside, this "story-driven survival strategy game" has been looking refreshing ever since it was first announced. Strategy games, narrative journeys, and survival experiences are all common nowadays, but it's stranger to see them all come together while using a famous sci-fi property to boot.</p><p>In many ways, Across the Unknown is taking cues from older Star Trek games that had players taking command of starships and entire crews, and that applies to the combat as seen in this trailer (surprisingly involved if you ask me). That said, the bigger scope and focus on what-if scenarios could set it apart from past strategy games set in the iconic universe.</p>
<p>Moreover, the full gameplay loop appears to be quite varied; players can expect scenes which are all about decision-making as well as exploration, management, research, and combat. For each section, <a href="https://www.gamexcite.de/">Gamexcite</a> has leaned on systems and mechanics which look familiar; hopefully, the final result will please trekkies and the more casual crowd alike.</p>
<p>Though the game seems like a perfect fit for Nintendo Switch 2's handheld mode given its chill and menu-heavy rhythm, don't forget it's coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S too. In fact, those platforms have received a demo you can check out before purchasing.</p>
