            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> will be set in the far northern region of Kovir, not yet seen in the previous games.</p>
<p>Earlier today, we saw a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-unreal-tech-demo-was-running-on-a-standard-ps5-at-60fps-with-ray-tracing">first in-game look at CD Projekt Red's forthcoming Ciri-starring sequel</a> at the State of Unreal livestream. It showed off how the studio is using Unreal's technology, but also hinted at the game's location.</p>
<p>The end of the trailer shows a first look at Lan Exeter, the winter capital of the Kovir region. In a press release, the studio has confirmed the sequel will take place in Kovir.</p>

<p>The kingdom of Kovir and Poviss is to the far north of the world, beyond the Dragon Mountains. It's fitting, then, that as Ciri peers out to the city beyond snow-capped mountains, a dragon flies overhead.</p>
<p>Earlier, the tech demo showed the city of Valdrest, which appears to be a new creation by the studio.</p>
<p>If Kovir sounds familiar, it's referenced in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> by Triss as she's asked to be court advisor to King Tancred in Kovir. Geralt is less keen to settle down in the region, though.</p>

<p>But perhaps he does ahead of The Witcher 4? Fans have speculated he may be the leader of the new Lynx Witcher school, from which Ciri learns her skills. And when that lynx medallion was first revealed it was in the snow, perhaps foreshadowing the cold northern region in which the game will take place.</p>
<p>The trailer also revealed Ciri's horse Kelpie, just like in the books.</p>
<p>CD Projekt Red stated the game was running on a base PS5 at 60fps with ray tracing turned on. Here's a look at some screenshots:</p>
