            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a>'s In the Jungle DLC has been delayed to 2026.</p>
<p>We saw our first peek of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-in-the-jungle-announced">In the Jungle at The Game Awards 2024</a>. Described as a new story DLC for the underwater exploration/sushi restaurant management game, the brief teaser confirmed at the time that In the Jungle will launch at some point in late 2025. Sadly, though, that timescale has slipped.</p>
<p>The update was part of a 10-minute video that covered DLC availability, pricing, and confirmed Dave the Diver is now available on the Epic Games Store worldwide. It also revealed a free upgrade for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a> owners was also on the way.</p>

<p>"The upcoming In the Jungle DLC takes place in a brand new region," explained director and head of Mintrocket Studio, Jaeho Hwang, "and we are working hard to make sure it brings fresh excitement to the game." Hwang then shared an all new peek, which you can see at 4m20s in the video above.</p>
<p>"The village here is where they'll be staying during their adventure. And this is a lake at the village. Here we are finally adding freshwater fish to capture and cook, just like many of you've been waiting for. We hope you guys are excited about it.</p>
<p>"One sad news, though. Although we announced it as late 2025, unfortunately, we might need to delay it a little bit to early 2026 to add more exciting content. There are still so many cool ideas that we don't want to miss floating around in the dev team. We'll share more soon and we'll keep you posted on the release date as soon as it's fixed."</p>
<p>Hwang also reflected on the pricing and limited-time exclusivity of the Ichiban's Holidays DLC.</p>
<p>"We know that recently we let some of you down," he admitted. "This kind of approach is sometimes requested when working with large IP holders to help protect the value of their IP. Still, we thought that it would be worth delivering cool new content, so we decided to release the DLC with a six-month time window. However, many players expressed disappointment with some riaising concerns about how it felt like 'FOMO' marketing.</p>
<p>"Although this was not our intention at all, we completely understand that perspective," Hwang added. "We want to apologise to everyone who felt let down."</p>
<p>Hwang said that after passing the feedback back to Sega, the IP holder, the team is now able to extend the DLC's availability. Now, the Ichiban's Holiday DLC will be available on all platforms until the end of not just 2025, but the end of 2026.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Godzilla DLC pack - which was free but only available last year - has also made a comeback. You can grab it right now across all platforms, and it'll stay "free and available" until the end of next year, too.</p>
<p>That's not all, though. Feedback also intimated to the team that the price "felt high for the amount of content provided".</p>
<p>"I admit that we were not thoughtful enough about the pricing," he said. "So we will be providing regular discounts to let you pick it up at a more reasonable price." Right now, at the time of writing, you can pick it up for 50 percent off.</p>
<p>Dave the Diver has previously seen DLC add-ons that add extra cosmetics, a free Dredge collaboration and... Godzilla. We previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-developer-confirms-story-dlc-in-the-works-and-talks-spin-offs-for-each-character">knew that bigger story DLC for Dave the Diver was coming</a> - but not what it was or when it would land.</p>
<p>"Wholesome, harmonious and completely unwilling to settle," is how our Christian Donlan described the game in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-a-dizzying-game-of-many-parts-and-a-journey-into-deep-wonder">Eurogamer's Dave the Diver review</a>, "this is one of the most generous games in years."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-delays-in-the-jungle-dlc-but-sure-knows-how-to-soften-the-blow-with-these-other-announcements]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Oh look, more Battlefield leaks.</p>
<p>Despite requiring participants to sign an NDA before they can get involved, players continued to share all manner of stuff last weekend, including clips of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhifj5/bf6_campaign/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">gameplay</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhnpdm/all_of_the_bf_labs_subfactions/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">factions</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhny43/gear_customization_heading_in_the_right_direction/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">gear customisation options</a>, its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lh7bzp/how_do_you_feel_about_battle_royale/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">battle royale</a> mode, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-single-player-campaign-details-leak-online">its single-player campaign</a>.</p>
<p>Today, it's Rush mode. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1llyrat/battlefield_6_alpha_leak_rush_game_mode_27_06_2025/">18 minutes of it</a>, to be precise. It was uploaded to the Chinese video site Bilibili, where it was picked up by eagle-eyed Battlefield fans and posted to the game's subreddit community.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, over 4000 fans have upvoted the post, sharing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1llyrat/comment/n03f2qb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">comparisons to Modern Warfare 2019</a> - not <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1llyrat/comment/n041vp9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">necessarily a bad thing</a> - as well as post reflections on recoil (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1llyrat/comment/n03uio0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">or lack thereof</a>) and the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1llyrat/comment/n05di5z/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">speed of movement</a>. Some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1llyrat/comment/n03p24a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">wonder</a> if the time-to-kill could still require a little adjustment while others <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1llyrat/comment/n03vfi2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">think</a> "pre-alpha/alpha [footage] still looks more promising, than 2042 ever did. (I kinda... enjoy 2042 today)". </p>
<p>Despite branding the playtest as the "most ambitious community testing program in franchise history" and requiring participants to sign an NDA, plenty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefields-invite-only-playtest-has-just-begun-and-gameplay-is-already-leaking-online">gameplay footage popped up in various corners of the internet</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reminds-battlefield-players-things-taking-place-in-labs-may-or-may-not-make-their-way-to-the-final-game">EA was not happy</a>, eventually hitting back at a grumpy Reddit thread about an unsupported claim about skill-based matchmaking with "Okay, enough", and the publisher has seemingly been busy trying to plug the most recent leaks, too.</p>
<p>Pretty much all we officially know about the next Battlefield so far is that it's set in the modern day, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">bring back traditional classes and more focused maps</a> after the unpopular changes made in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>. Beyond that, it's all speculation - although one sleuth scoured the new game's concept art and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-sleuth-seemingly-identifies-location-teased-in-next-games-first-bit-of-concept-art">identified landmarks suggesting it could be set in Gibraltar</a>. EA confirmed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-expected-to-release-before-april-2026">expects the series' latest instalment to arrive before April next year</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-leak-confirms-return-of-fan-favourite-mode]]></content:encoded>
