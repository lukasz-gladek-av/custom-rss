            <p>Another one of Microsoft's key franchises will arrive on PlayStation this year, via a revamped edition of the original Gears of War game.</p>
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded's announcement comes almost 20 years since the series first made its Xbox debut.</p>
<p>This modernised version of the original Gears of War will launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th August. It will cost $40, and also be available via Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.</p>
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded has been developed by The Coalition in partnership with Sumo Interactive and Disbelief. It will feature faster frame rates and "deeper visual fidelity", with the studios promising "clarity, smoothness, and immersion that matches the power of today's hardware", Microsoft has said.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date/">laid out in an Xbox post</a>, Gears of War: Reloaded players can expect the following enhancements on the game's release this summer:</p>
<ul>
<li>4K resolution</li>
<li>60 FPS in Campaign</li>
<li>120 FPS in Multiplayer</li>
<li>High Dynamic Range (HDR)</li>
<li>Dolby Vision &amp; 7.1.4 Dolby Atmos</li>
<li>7.1.4 3D Spatial Audio</li>
<li>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)</li>
<li>4K assets and remastered textures</li>
<li>Enhanced post-processing visual effects</li>
<li>Improved shadows and reflections</li>
<li>Super resolution with improved anti-aliasing</li>
<li>Zero loading screens during Campaign</li>
</ul>
<p>Reloaded will also boast some platform specific features, and support cross-play and cross-progression.</p>

<p>Those who already own the digital version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gears-of-war-ultimate-edition">Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</a> will receive a free upgrade to Gears of War: Reloaded, but only if they purchased the game prior to this announcement. So, if you decide to plump for Gears of War: Ultimate Edition on Xbox now, you will not be eligible for that free upgrade when Reloaded releases.</p>
<p>"As we approach the 20th anniversary of Gears of War in 2026, we're reflecting on what this franchise means. It's about the stories we've told, the friendships we've built, and the unforgettable moments we've shared together," The Coalition studio head Mike Crump said yesterday. </p>
<p>"With Gears of War: Reloaded, we're opening that door to more players than ever."</p>

Gears of War: E-Day is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bulletstorm-studio-confirms-project-maverick-is-a-gears-of-war-game">being co-developed with People Can Fly</a>. </p>
<p>Late last year, it was revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-is-so-back-as-original-voice-talents-are-confirmed-for-gears-of-war-e-day">John DiMiaggio and Carlos Ferro will be reprising their roles as Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago</a> in Gears of War: E-Day. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
