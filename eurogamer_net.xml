            <p>
Just a day after its launch, the Gex Trilogy - which bundles together the cult-classic 90s platformer Gex and its two sequels - has officially been deemed a success. And publisher Limited Run Games is celebrating the occasion by reinstating a conspicuously absent audio feature that should please European series fans no end.
</p>
<p>
The Gex Trilogy, if you're unfamiliar, gathers together developer Crystal Dynamics' original 2D outing (which launched for PS1 back in 1995), plus its two fully polygonal sequels; that's 1998's Gex: Enter the Gecko and 1999's Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko. Limited Run's bundle isn't a remaster as such, but it <em>does</em> include a variety of modern-day niceties, including native widescreen support, save states, and the ability to rewind the action.
</p>
<p>
Throw in a whole bunch of artwork and archival material, and content-wise the Gex Trilogy is probably as close to a definitive release as fans of the ageing mascot platformer could hope for. With one notable exception: it only launched with Dana Gould's portrayal of suave lizard protagonist Gex, as heard in the US release, while the PAL version's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC_-wP92b2Y">very different vocal performances</a> were nowhere to be found. Until now that is.

<p>
"Thank you for making the launch of Gex Trilogy a huge success!," Limited Run wrote in an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/limitedrungames.com/post/3lrr2bt5xyd27">announcement on social media</a>. "It's been in the works for a while and we're finally able to announce that the PAL versions of Gex 2 &amp; Gex 3, featuring the voices of Leslie Philips and Danny John-Jules, respectively, will be added in an update!... We're excited for European Gex fans to relive these games the way they remember and for others to hear them for the first time!"
</p>
<p>
As it happens, anyone that owns the Gex Trilogy on Steam can enjoy Philips and John-Jules' portrayal of Gex right now. Once the newly released update has been installed, players can select the PAL versions of Gex by changing the regional flag on the menu before starting the game. Limited Run notes these European versions are entirely separate builds, and save data is not transferable. Today's update also remaps the default keyboard controls for all three games following complaints at launch, but Limited Run is yet to address other customer concerns, including audio issues and a lack of upscaling or anti-aliasing.
</p>
<p>
As for PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch, they'll be getting PAL voices just as soon as the patch "has completed certification".

            <p>
Bungie has announced an indefinite delay for its live-service extraction shooter Marathon, citing the community's "passionate" feedback following its reveal in April and a subsequent playtest.
</p>
<p>
Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-returns-to-its-roots-with-a-pvp-twist-on-classic-fps-series-marathon">formally unveiled its Marathon reboot</a> in May 2023, but the response wasn't an immediately enthusiastic one, given the decision to ditch the classic Marathon series' single-player focus in favour of PvP - and the reboot has largely remained in the news for all the wrong reasons since then. It's faced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-gets-new-director-as-part-of-creative-leadership-shakeup">leadership changes</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-responds-to-marathon-reboot-directors-200m-wrongful-dismissal-lawsuit-alleges-disturbing-communications-with-female-employees">substantial legal challenges</a>, it's seen ongoing reports of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">declining staff morale</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-management-vehemently-shut-down-destiny-2-subscription-idea-as-reports-of-toxicity-continue">accusations of toxicity aimed at Bungie management</a>, it's been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">embroiled in a plagiarism scandal</a>, and more.
</p>
<p>
April's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">big reveal</a>, then, was a chance for Bungie to shift the narrative to something more positive. But reactions weren't especially kind - some went as far as to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-concord-developer-hits-back-at-criticism-of-bungies-marathon-reveal">draw comparisons with Sony's ill-fated Concord</a> - and it seems Marathon's alpha playtest last month also generated substantial negative criticism, judging by <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon_update">Bungie's latest blog post</a>.

<p>
"Thank you not only for your passionate feedback around the Marathon reveal and Alpha playtest," the studio wrote, "but also for your patience while we took the time to listen closely and chart our next steps. Through every comment and real-time conversation on social media and Discord, your voice has been strong and clear. We've taken this to heart, and we know we need more time to craft Marathon into the game that truly reflects your passion."
</p>
<p>
As a result, and "after much discussion", Marathon will no longer launch on 23rd September as originally announced, and has instead been indefinitely delayed. "The alpha test created an opportunity for us to calibrate and focus the game on what will make it uniquely compelling," Bungie continued. "We're using this [extra] time to empower the team to create the intense, high-stakes experience that a title like Marathon is built around."
</p>
<p>
As it looks to get Marathon back on track, Bungie will hold more closed testing over the "next few months". These will bring new game updates and features, with the studio's "immediate focus" being on the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Upping the Survival Game</li>
<ul>
<li>More challenging and engaging AI encounters</li>
<li>More rewarding runs, with new types of loot and dynamic events</li>
<li>Making combat more tense and strategic</li>
</ul>
<li>Doubling down on the Marathon Universe</li>
<ul>
<li>Increased visual fidelity</li>
<li>More narrative and environmental storytelling to discover and interact with</li>
<li>A darker tone that delivers on the themes of the original trilogy</li>
</ul>
<li>Adding more social experiences</li>
<ul>
<li>A better player experience for solo/duos</li>
<li>Prox chat, so social stories can come to life</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Bungie says it'll provide a progress update, alongside a revised release date, some time this autumn. "Thank you again for your patience and - much more importantly - your passion," it concluded. "Your continued feedback will help us make Marathon the incredible gaming experience we all know it can be."
</p>
<p>
Today's delay announcement follows a wave of live-service project cancellations at Sony, as it continues to reassess the viability of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan's ambitious live-service strategy</a>. In 2023, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">pulled the plug on Naughty Dog's multiplayer The Last of Us game</a>, and it opted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">not to revive Concord after its disastrous launch last year</a>. The company has reportedly also cancelled a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">live-service adaptation of Twisted Metal</a> in development at Firesprite, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/footage-of-insomniacs-seemingly-canceled-live-service-spider-man-the-great-web-appears-online">live-service Spider-Man at Insomniac</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">live-service God of War at Bluepoint</a>, and an unknown live-service project at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> studio Sony Bend. Despite that, the company recently insisted it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-remains-committed-to-diverse-and-resilient-live-service-games-including-forthcoming-marathon-and-fairgames-despite-high-profile-failures">remains committed to "diverse and resilient" live-service portfolio</a>.
