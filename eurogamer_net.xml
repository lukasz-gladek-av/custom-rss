            <p>
Switch 2 might have been officially revealed, but there's still a whole lot we don't know about it. And while Nintendo is staying stubbornly tightlipped until April, a newly surfaced patent appears to confirm at least a few previously reported details the company has so far only teased.
</p>
<p>
Mostly, we're talking Joy-Cons here, with early reports having claimed Switch 2's detachable controllers would include a few new tricks not seen in those of the original console. That starts with magnets, with Switch 2's Joy-Cons have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-report-details-magnetic-joy-con">long been rumoured to use magnets</a> to attach to the console instead of the finicky rails system used previously.
</p>
<p>
Which brings us to Nintendo's <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025027801&amp;_cid=P22-M6TRNW-94344-1">newly unearthed game controller patent</a>, initially filed in August 2023 and published today. "This game controller is detachably mounted to a body device that has a recess," it reads, "that comprises a first magnet and a second magnet at the bottom of the recess, and that can execute game processing."
</p>
<figure><div>

<p>
Furthermore, the patent gives some additional insight into how the magnets have been implemented to avoid randomly dropping off at inconvenient intervals. "The first button and the second button are provided in the longitudinal direction in the top surface of the protrusion," Nintendo writes. "The first button and the second button are to be pressed by a user. The first button is attracted to the first magnet by a magnetic force. The second button is attracted to the second magnet by a magnetic force."
</p>
<p>
Admittedly, the inclusion of magnets isn't much of a revelation - Switch 2's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">reveal trailer</a> already suggested as much - but Nintendo hasn't actually made it official. And it's a similar story for built-in Joy-Con mouse functionality, another rumoured feature for Switch 2. January's reveal trailer certainly lent credence to those earlier reports, what with it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-trailer-appears-to-confirm-joy-con-mouse-functionality">including a controller sliding suspiciously around on its side</a>, but, again, it's a feature not yet made official.
</p>
<p>
Back over in the patent, however, and Nintendo has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lhjtpx27ja2b">included a diagram</a> of a right Joy-Con being used just like a mouse. Its detachable edge is face down on a surface while the user grips it mouse-style, one finger on the bumper - presumably for clicking input - and a thumb on the control stick. Other illustrations show a user dual-wielding two Joy-Cons mouse-style, like some sort of mouse-using ninja, while another shows a Joy-Con being deployed mouse-like in one hand and in standard formation in the other. Flexibility is apparently key.
</p>
<p>
It is, if nothing else, an interesting reminder that's there's still so much to learn about Nintendo's new console following a reveal that was light on just about everything. Beyond, that is, a general glimpse of Switch 2's Switch-but-more-so aesthetic, and a new Mario Kart that's managed to illicit chatter as wide ranging as 'Could this possibly be open world?!' right through to 'What on earth have they done to Donkey Kong?!'.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, no solid answers to the many questions we have about Switch 2 will likely come until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">April's Nintendo Direct</a> - which will hopefully finally include the Captain Rainbow revival we've all been waiting for. Until then, feel free to direct your gaze elsewhere on Eurogamer for a refresher of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">everything we currently know about Switch 2</a>. You can probably add 'almost definitely magnets' and 'mouse, eh?' to that list now too.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> has now sold a staggering 210m copies, publisher Take-Two announced this evening in its latest financial results. 
</p>
<p>
The new total means Rockstar's wildly-successful game has shifted another 5m copies over the last three months of 2024, up until 31st December. 
</p>
<p>
There's a fresh lifetime total for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, also. It now stands at 70m copies sold, up three million units on last quarter - which would be jaw-droppingly impressive in comparison to pretty much any other game out there, other than GTA 5.
</p>
<p>
New content is still being pumped out for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a>, such as December 2024's Agents of Sabotage update, and the multiplayer portion of Rockstar's aging game continues to be one of Take-Two's biggest earners. 
</p>
<p>
This year will see GTA 5 mark its 12th anniversary on sale (it originally launched in September 2013 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360). Red Dead Redemption 2, meanwhile, will turn seven in October.
</p>
<p>
It's around then that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">Take-Two has said GTA 6 will finally arrive</a> - during its launch window which has now been re-confirmed for sometime this autumn. 
</p>
<p>
"There's always a risk of slippage and I think as soon as you say words like absolutely, you jinx things," Take-Two boss <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">Strauss Zelnick told IGN</a> this evening, when asked about the likelihood of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> not making its current launch window. "We feel really good about it."
</p>
<p>
It's a busy year for Take-Two in general, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> 7 on 11th February, Mafia: The Old Country in the summer, GTA 6 in autumn and Borderlands 4 before the year's end.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> has had a bit of a bumpy start on PC, but with a couple of emergency hot fixes now under its belt, developer Insomniac, alongside porting partner Nixxes, has released its first major patch - targeting reports of crashing, among other things.
</p>
<p>
Marvel's Spider-Man 2 made its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-2-recommended-specs-and-pc-features-detailed">long-awaited PC debut</a> last Thursday, but reports from frustrated players soon surfaced, highlighting significant crashing issues, bugs, and poor optimisation. It didn't take long for the game to amass a "mixed" rating on Steam as complaints continued piling in, and Insomniac <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-2-steam-hotfix-hopes-to-address-pc-ports-stability-woes">responded quickly with a series of hot fixes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, the studio has released its first full patch for Spider-Man 2, primarily targeting "several crash fixes based on feedback from [players] and our crash reporting system." There's more beyond that, however, with update v1.205.0.0 also implementing a backup system for autosaves, fixing a number of visual bugs related to DLSS Ray Reconstruction and raytracing, and addressing a range of UI related bugs.

<p>
Menu toggles have also been introduced for Film Style Animation and Comic SFX, and there are interface improvements intended to simplify starting New Game+. 
</p>
<p>
Insomniac acknowledges not all reported issues have been addressed in its first patch, but says it's "committed to improving your experience and [will] continue to work on regular updates with more bug fixes, improvements and performance optimisations."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell had good things to say about Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on PlayStation 5, calling it "simple, familiar, and occasionally cluttered [but] still brilliant fun" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-review-1">his four star review</a>. Hopefully, Insomniac and Nixxes can resolve the PC version's current issues and give the game the port it deserves. For now, though, you'll find full patch notes below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Various crash fixes based on player feedback and data from our crash reporting system.</li>
<li>Improvements to crash reporting with screenshot support.</li>
<li>Film Style Animation and Comic SFX can now be toggled via Settings &gt; Game &gt; Camera.*</li>
<li>User interface improvements to simplify starting a New Game+</li>
<li>Implemented autosave backups. At key points in the story the game will create a backup of the autosave slot.</li>
<li>Added mouse scrolling to the manual load/save menu.</li>
<li>Various improvements and bug fixes to the user interface.</li>
<li>Reduced noise in character hair when using DLSS Ray Reconstruction.</li>
<li>Enemies webbed to surfaces no longer have a black background when using ray-traced shadows and ray-traced ambient occlusion.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug related to ray-traced reflections that could cause pixelation artefacts along water edges.</li>
<li>Settings for Subtitle Text Size, Closed Caption Text Size, Icon and Prompt Size and Audio Listening Mode are no longer synchronized between different devices.**</li>
</ul>
<p><em>*These options become available after obtaining the Across the Spider-Verse Suit. ** As a result of this change, these settings will be reset to their defaults after you install this update.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>' hugely anticipated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is still on track to launch this "fall" publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> has reiterated, despite persistent rumblings of a delay.
</p>
<p>
Take-Two recommitted to its release window as part of its <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/4d81f3f6-cf24-44fa-892b-8ace44767349">Q3 FY 2025 earnings report</a>, writing, "This calendar year is shaping up to be one of the strongest ever for [the company], as we plan to launch <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> 7 on 11th February, Mafia: The Old Country in the summer, Grand Theft Auto 6 in the Fall, and Borderlands 4."
</p>
<p>
Take-Two <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">announced an autumn 2025 release target</a> for GTA 6 last May, narrowing down what had previously only been a 2025 window at the time of the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-first-trailer-released-early">first trailer reveal</a>. However, rumours of a possible delay have continued to dog the game since then.

<p>
A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-release-may-slip-to-2026-as-development-has-reportedly-fallen-behind">report last March</a> suggested Rockstar had originally been targeting a "spring" 2025 release but that development had "fallen behind". An autumn launch was said to be more likely - just as 2K later announced - but it was claimed a 2026 release could happen as "fallback plan".
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-recommits-to-autumn-2025-launch-following-delay-rumour">later called the rumours unfounded</a>, and Take-Two has continued to stand by its autumn launch window, even if it still hasn't quite got as far as revealing the release date the entire games industry is waiting for.</p>
<p>
Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has acknowledged the mounting anticipation around GTA6 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">in an interview with IGN</a>. "I think the game is eagerly anticipated both internally and externally," he said. "We know that Rockstar seeks perfection. I never claim success before it occurs. I'm fond of saying arrogance is the enemy of continued success, so we're all running scared and looking over our shoulders and we know that the competition is not asleep. Our whole organisation is super excited."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
