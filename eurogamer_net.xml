Following a hugely successful launch that saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hits-1m-sales-in-just-one-day">over 1m people snapping up Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 in just 24 hours</a>, developer Warhorse Studios continues to plug away at its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-post-launch-roadmap-bringing-barbers-horse-riding-and-more">post-release roadmap</a>. And that brings us to today, and the release of the medieval action-RPG's 1.2 update, adding mod support, a barber shop, and "over a thousand" fixes and improvements.
</p>
<p>
According to Warhorse, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>'s 1.2 update features "a host of fixes, improvements, and rebalancing tweaks" designed to ensure "a smoother, more immersive medieval experience". These include combat refinements, enhanced NPC behaviour, more polished animations, and performance optimisations. The update also improves the physics of your parsnip, which (probably) isn't a euphemism.
</p>
<p>
The full list of changes is long enough that it's probably safer to <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/patch-notes-1-2">link to Warhorse's patch notes</a> rather than risk breaking this page. But the flagship additions include Kingdom Come Deliverance 2's aforementioned barber shops and PC-only mod support. Starting with the former, those looking for a natty follicular makeover will be wanting to visit Zhelejov and Kuttenberg. Here, they can change protagonist Henry's hairstyle or pick from a variety of facial hair options, including designer stubble, a full beard, or simply clean-shaven. Regardless, a fresh trim isn't just for aesthetics - it'll temporarily buff Henry's charisma.

<p>
As for mod support, it's described as a new suite of tools offering greater accessibility and direct Steam Workshop integration. "Whether you want to tweak mechanics, expand the world, or forge entirely new adventures, the tools are in your hands," writes Warhorse. "Get ready to create, customise, and bring your own vision to life in the medieval world."
</p>
<p>
Today's 1.2 update - which is available for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC - marks the first in a series of free post-launch additions for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, previously revealed to include horse racing and a new Hardcode Mode promising a "greater challenge". That's alongside three paid story expansions - Brushes with Death, Legacy of the Forge, and Mysteria Ecclesia - due this summer, autumn, and winter respectively.
</p>
<p>
"It is a hard and maddening slog at times," Eurogamer's Katharine Castle wrote of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review">her three star review</a>, "but one that still has its moments where it surprises and quietly delights. Like the original, this isn't an RPG designed to make you feel good - you continue to be little more than a passenger in this historical tapestry, following along behind the horse tails of Henry's betters, and clearing up the mess they leave behind. Some will revel in that work, but I for one won't be chomping at the bit for another sequel any time soon."
