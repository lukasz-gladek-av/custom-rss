            <p>YouTube personality and kinetic artist Joseph Herscher has created a real life Lego Mario Kart race track in his home using everyday items such as books, handheld weights and tupperware.</p>
<p>Herscher - who has over seven million YouTube subscribers and <a href="https://www.josephsmachines.com/">prides himself on being able to build Rube Goldberg machines</a>, chain reactions and "other completely useless contraptions" - used official Super Mario: Mario Kart Lego sets to get the race going, and then created a course around his (I presume) bedroom.</p>

<p>Sticking with what he is best known for, Herscher launched bricky racers such as Mario, Baby Peach and Luigi off on their way, setting off a chain of events that eventually sees one reign supreme on the podium.</p>
<p>In true Mario Kart fashion there are some - ahem - mishaps and shells on the way to victory, as the characters negotiate a chest of drawers and more. Whose victory? Well, you can watch and find out for yourself below.</p>

<figcaption>Just got my hands on the brand-new LEGO Super Mario: Mario Kart sets and built my very own real-life kart-racing machine. Letâ€™s-a-go! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cybSLWd0MH4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Needless to say, Herscher's followers have been left impressed with his Mario Kart creation, with comments such as "amazing!", "awesome!" and "so cool!" popping up underneath the video.</p>
<p>In related news, a new 18+ Lego Mario Kart set was recently announced. The upcoming set will release on 15th May, and features a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/18-lego-mario-kart-set-leaks-online">buildable Mario complete with a posable head and arms</a>.</p>
<p>As for the Mario Kart video game series, it seems very likely that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-9-fan-speculation-points-to-fuel-tank-gameplay">the next franchise entry will arrive with the Nintendo Switch 2</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Regular Eurogamer readers may know I am rather fond of The Last of Us, and if anything to do with the series is due to pop up online, I am already eagerly awaiting it. So it was with some surprise this morning that I saw a new trailer for HBO's The Last of Us series had dropped. I immediately Clicker-ed to watch.</p>
<p>It turns out this trailer isn't for the show's upcoming second season, however. Or more specifically, it is a handy recap of season one in advance of that second season, packaged up into a video that lasts a little over five minutes. As you would expect, it covers all the essential plot points to get you up to speed - you know, the start of the outbreak (and the emotional impact behind that fateful night), Ellie's immunity, David (shivers) and the hospital finale.</p>
<p>Oh, and yes, <em>that </em>kiss between Tess and an infected. Oh my word. It still makes me feel all funny even though I knew it was coming the moment the Capitol shots started showing up. Anyway, if you want to refresh yourself on the events of The Last of Us season one for yourself, you can do so below.</p>
