            <p>There is not long to go until you can rev your engines once more with an all new Tokyo Xtreme Racer game.</p>
<p>The upcoming release - which will mark the first series title in 18 years - will make its Steam early access debut later this month, on 23rd January. Developer Genki said it will use this early access stint to "utilise player feedback to elevate the game even further".</p>
<p>Early access is expected to last for around four months. Then, of course, the full release will launch. This version will include the remainder of the story, along with additional cars, additional rival characters, and "new features and improvements". Genki added those who plump for the early access version will have access to the full release version upon launch, at the discounted early access price (for now, that price is "TBA", so stay tuned). </p>

<p>Capcom officially announced the nine million sales figure earlier today, which has since been compared to previous games in the series.</p>
<p>According to business development manager Alex Aniel and author of Itchy, Tasty: An Unofficial History of Resident Evil, by their eighth quarter, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a>, Resident Evil 7, and Resident Evil 3 had sold 500,000, 400,000 and 300,000 units, respectively, whilst Resident Evil 4 has topped over a million across the same time period.</p>

            <p>If you are one of the many who play Wordle every day (I still like to use it to flex the ol' mental muscles with my morning cup of tea), you may well be interested to discover the one word in 2024 that stumped so many of us, it broke a whopping 5.6m streaks.</p>
<p>In a recent conversation with <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/news/new-york-times-top-wordle-connections-2024-rcna185738">Today</a>, editorial director of NYT Games Everdeen Mason revealed that 11.1bn puzzles were solved via the New York Times in 2024. Of those, Wordle accounted for 5.3bn plays.</p>

<p>The most played day for the New York Times' Wordle puzzle was 23rd April, when the word was Rover. But the word that left the most players scratching their heads arrived later in the year, on 15th October. That word was Corer. Like I said, this chap caused 5.6m Wordle streaks to come to an end.</p><p>In addition to sharing these little titbits, Mason revealed 2.8 million of us are creatures of habit and routine, and use the same starting word every day. As Eurogamer reported previously, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wordle-now-has-an-in-app-bot-to-analyse-how-good-your-guesses-are">the most popular starting word for Wordle is Adieu</a>, which is actually what my mother uses (for general interest, I always start with Ouija. My sister-in-law starts with Ocean).</p>
<p>I also learned a few weeks ago that Epona - Link's wonderful horse from the Legend of Zelda series - can not be used as a guess. I was quite upset by this, and took a screenshot to document this sad moment (and now, finally, I have somewhere to share it - so, hurrah!).</p>

<p>Along with Wordle, other New York Times puzzles also remain popular. In 2024, the Mini Crossword and Strands accounted for 2.1bn and 1.3bn plays respectively. I recently discovered Strands - which is a kind of themed word search - along with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-york-times-responds-to-only-connect-resemblance">Only Connect clone Connections</a>, and have added these to my daily puzzle time. Anyone else?</p>

            <p>The Sonic film franchise has now surpassed $1bn at the global box office, following the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> prior to Christmas.</p>
<p>The latest film earned over $187m in the US, for a worldwide total of $336.3m. It debuted globally with $211.5m in its first week.</p>
<p>The previous two films collectively grossed $725.2m globally, following releases in 2020 and 2022 respectively. In addition, they generated $181m in consumer spending on home rentals and purchases, while the Knuckles TV spin-off on Paramount+ was the number one Kids and Family series ever on the platform with 11m global hours watched in its first 28 days of streaming.</p>

<p>Sonic 3 has certainly been a success, then, earning franchise-best critics ratings, aided by the inclusion of Keanu Reeves as Shadow the Hedgehog.</p>
<p>"We are so overjoyed with the amazing response to the Sonic the Hedgehog films from audiences and fans around the world and are proud to be part of the incredible, world-class filmmaking team that has come together to build this franchise," producers Neal H Moritz and Toby Ascher said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>"We make these movies for the fans; and their passion, support and love for these characters is what drives us every day to continue creating the fast, funny and action-packed stories that make up the ever-expanding Sonic Universe."</p> <div>
