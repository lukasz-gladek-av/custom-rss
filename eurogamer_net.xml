            <p>Japanese racehorse Haru Urara, who inspired a character of the same name in popular gacha game Umamusume: Pretty Derby, has passed away.</p>
<p>Haru Urara was 29 when she passed. In human years, she would have been around 90 years of age. According to Japanese outlet <a href="https://friday.kodansha.co.jp/article/438213">Friday Digital</a>, the cause of Haru Urara's death was colic.</p>

<p>"It is with heavy hearts that we share that Haru Urara passed away," the official X account for Umamusume: Pretty Derby wrote today, calling her a "legendary" racehorse despite her not having a particularly strong track record. In fact, she never won a single race.</p>
<p>"We share our condolences to all the staff involved in Haru Urara's care," the Umamusume: Pretty Derby account said.</p>
<p>Haru Urara was a fan-favourite in Umamusume: Pretty Derby. As our Connor reported earlier this year, Uma Musume: Pretty Derby fans recently came out en masse to send <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/so-why-exactly-are-uma-musume-pretty-derby-players-are-sending-massive-amounts-of-grass-to-a-retired-japanese-race-horse">packages of delicious ryegrass to the real-life inspiration of their favourite horse from the game</a>.</p> <div>
