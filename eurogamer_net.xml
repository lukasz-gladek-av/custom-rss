            <p>Publisher Take-Two fully supports <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> following its decision to delay <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> into next year.</p>
<p>GTA 6 was initially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-highly-confident-of-autumn-2025-release-window">slated for an unspecified release this Autumn</a>. However, just this afternoon, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">developer announced it was delaying the release until 26th May, 2026</a>. "With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto 6 is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve," Rockstar said today.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250502895390/en/Take-Two-Interactive-Software-Inc.-Reiterates-Expectations-to-Achieve-Sequential-Increases-in-and-Record-Levels-of-Net-Bookings-in-Fiscal-2026-and-2027">Take-Two's head Strauss Zelnick has responded to the delay</a>, stating the company supports "fully Rockstar Games taking additional time to realise their creative vision", adding on its release GTA 6 will be "a groundbreaking, blockbuster entertainment experience that exceeds audience expectations".</p>

<p>Said Zelnick: "While we take the movement of our titles seriously and appreciate the vast and deep global anticipation for Grand Theft Auto 6, we remain steadfast in our commitment to excellence. As we continue to release our phenomenal pipeline, we expect to deliver a multi-year period of growth in our business and enhanced value for our shareholders."</p>
<p>The Take-Two head added he still expects the company to have a prosperous 12 months, even with GTA 6 being a little further off on the horizon, now releasing during the company's 2027 fiscal year.</p>
<p>In a press release, Take-Two said the expectation is that "the company will achieve sequential increases in, and record levels of, net bookings in fiscal 2026 and 2027".</p>
<p>Take-Two is slated to release its next financial results on 15th May.</p>

<p>In March, several years after the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>'s enhanced edition on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-5s-next-gen-upgrades-finally-arrive-on-pc">the game's next-gen features finally arrived on PC as part of a free update for all existing users</a>.</p>

            <p>
Apple has formally updated its App Store guidelines to reflect the dramatic decision laid down by a US judge around alternative app store payments. 
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">fiery injunction passed this week</a>, Apple was told it could no longer dissuade app makers from offering other payment methods by applying a 27 percent commission on their proceeds. The move allows apps and games to offer direct - and potentially cheaper - options for in-app purchases, at least in the US.
</p>
<p>
Apple said it disagreed with the judgment and would appeal the decision, though would comply as instructed in the meantime. The company has now updated its App Store rules, and developers are rushing to take advantage.
</p>
<p>
"On the United States storefront, there is no prohibition on an app including buttons, external links, or other calls to action, and no entitlement is required to do so," Apple's rules now state (thanks, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/05/01/apple-app-store-guidelines-external-links/">9to5Mac</a>). 
</p>
<p>
"The prohibition on encouraging users to use a purchasing method other than in-app purchase does not apply on the United States storefront," Apple continues. "The External Link Account entitlement is not required for apps on the United States storefront to include buttons, external links, or other calls to action."
</p>
<p>
Last night, music streaming service Spotify said it had already submitted an app update to Apple which directs users to its website, bypassing payment via the App Store where Apple takes its 30 percent cut. 
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-05-01/following-landmark-court-ruling-spotify-submits-new-app-update-to-apple-to-benefit-u-s-consumers/">blog post announcing its move, Spotify said</a> users would finally be able to "see how much something costs in our app", such as subscriptions and information on promotions - and in the future, potentially easier-to-buy audio books.
</p>
<p>
Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney has stated that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> will return to the iPhone App Store in the US next week, after an absence of five years. 
</p>
<p>
The company has also offered a "peace proposal" to Apple, and suggested it would "drop current and future litigation on the topic" if Apple rolled out these changes worldwide. Seems unlikely, but you never know.
</p>
<p>
Sweeney previously said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-sweeney-no-regrets-on-fortnite-app-store-drama-as-epic-game-store-launches-on-mobile-in-europe">Fortnite had lost around $1bn in missed revenue from taking on Apple</a> and getting kicked off its app store for deliberately breaking the rules - but that it had been worth it.
