            <p>Sega is now the official gaming partner of McLaren Racing, in a multi-year collaboration with Sonic the Hedgehog.</p>
<p>In a press release shared with Eurogamer, the partnership promises to "fuse the worlds of motorsport and gaming and engage audiences of all ages both on the grid and screen". It's unknown exactly what this will entail, but it's all part of Sonic Team's 2025 "<a href="https://www.sega.com/sonic-the-hedgehog/racing-around-the-world">Racing Around The World</a>" campaign.</p>
<p>The partnership will continue into 2026, Sonic's 35th anniversary year, as well as the McLaren Formula 1 team's 1,000th Grand Prix race.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this isn't the first time the two companies have joined forces. Back in 1993, the European Grand Prix was held in Donington Park in the UK and was known as the Sonic Grand Prix. McLaren F1 driver Ayrton Senna won the race and received a Sonic the Hedgehog trophy.</p>
<p>"We're thrilled to welcome Sonic the Hedgehog to the McLaren Racing family," said Louise McEwen, chief marketing officer of McLaren Racing. "This partnership brings together two iconic names in speed, and opens up our team to a wider, younger global audience. Sonic is a character with incredible heritage and a passionate fanbase, and we are very excited to celebrate our partnership at McLaren Racing Live: London."</p>
<p>The McLaren Racing Live event will take place in Trafalgar Square from 2nd - 3rd July.</p>
<p>The collaboration underlines Sega's key release for the year, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds. The next in the racing series, it features mid-race portals to other worlds to shake up gameplay, as well as including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hatsune-miku-personas-joker-and-minecrafts-steve-join-the-roster-for-sonic-crossworlds">Hatsune Miku, Persona's Joker, and Minecraft's Steve in its roster of racers</a>.</p>
<p>"This is a Sega Arcade racer, with the mechanical depth and tightened controls you'd expect from that lineage," wrote Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson after going <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-might-be-the-most-mechanically-rich-kart-racer-ever-made-hands-on">hands-on with Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>. "It's also a mad party game to boot."</p>
<p>The partnership also proves the brand power of Sonic and Sega, as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-ago-we-were-fighting-to-survive-its-totally-different-now-segas-franchise-guru-on-sonics-redemption-arc">blue blur's star has risen over the past decade</a> through well-received games and films.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Sega has partnered with an F1 team, either. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bizarrely-atlus-will-sponsor-haas-for-this-weeks-f1-singapore-grand-prix-in-honour-of-metaphor-refantazio">Atlus sponsored F1 team Haas last year</a> to celebrate the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>. Why? Both the team and the game share a Hulkenberg.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-joins-mclaren-racing-in-historic-partnership-with-sega]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Nintendo's 3 v 3 wheelchair basketball game Drag x Drive doesn't appear to have support for local multiplayer.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Nintendo announced a release date for Drag x Drive, and now more details about the upcoming release have come to light via the game's store page on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>'s eShop.</p>
<p>While specific multiplayer modes aren't listed, the page reveals the game will retail for Â£16.99 here in the UK, and support up to 12 players online - online being the key word here. Drag x Drive can only be played by one player per console, meaning split-screen local multiplayer seemingly won't be an option.</p>

<p>This means even if you have an additional pair of Switch 2 Joy Con, you won't be able to participate in a spot of basketball with your friends and family at home. This seems like quite a missed opportunity, if you ask me. Eurogamer has asked Nintendo to comment on Drag x Drive's multiplayer support, and will update when we know more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-first-dual-mouse-mode-game-is-wheelchair-basketball-drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive was first announced back in April</a>, during Nintendo's dedicated Switch 2 Direct. The game will make use of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-good-are-switch-2s-mouse-controls-eurogamers-verdict-from-the-big-reveal-event">Switch 2's mouse functionality</a>, with players using the console's Joy Con to "intuitively steer, speed up, perform tricks and make plays such as dunks".</p>
<p>Drag x Drive is set to arrive on 14th August <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/drag-x-drive-wheels-onto-switch-2-as-an-eshop-exclusive-this-august">as a Switch 2 eShop exclusive</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-game-drag-x-drive-appears-to-not-support-local-multiplayer]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-endgame-gets-better-dune-awakening-vastly-expands-pve-portion-of-the-deep-desert-in-its-new-public-test-server.1228863/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> now has a public test client, which offers players an early peak at upcoming changes coming to the game. One of these is a substantial change to the endgame Deep Desert - a vast expansion to the shielded PvE section.</p>
<p>Right now in the live game, the shielded PvE areas of the mostly-PvP dominated Deep Desert covers zones A and B. However in the Public Test Client version of the game, this has been pushed far out into the sands, covering zones A through half of E.</p>
<p>This comes in reaction to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-early-meta-helicopter-infested-nightmare">community-uproar around the Deep Desert</a>, as a substantial chunk of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-changes-next-update">game's huge playerbase</a>. In response, Funcom ceded ground on its original vision, with creative director Joel Bylos stating: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-studio-is-adding-partial-warfare-endgame-zones-to-address-pve-player-woes">Our goal is not to force PvE players to interact with a PvP system [they] have no interest in</a>."</p>

<p>What this means for the dynamic of the Deep Desert is all of the highest tier resources will still be found in PvP-flagged areas, valuable goodies like titanium and stravidium, will still be risky to farm. However PvE players will now be able to venture out into the Deep Desert, farm large spice blows, and explore a selection of challenging bio labs and crashed ships without worrying about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-early-meta-helicopter-infested-nightmare">swarms of enemy ornithopters</a>.</p>
<p>The spirit of PvP still remains strong in the Deep Desert however, especially where the Landsraad is concerned. House control points, a way of winning the weekly Landsraad, are always PvP zones in the Public Test Client.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-worms-its-way-past-one-million-sales-funcoms-best-performing-game-to-date">Funcom's biggest release in its history</a>, has proven popular yet divisive in its later hours. The developers have also stated they intend to release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-new-maps-hagga-basin">more substantial PvE maps to give those ardent anti-PvPers something to do</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-deep-desert-pve-expansion]]></content:encoded>
