            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-edition-zelda-games-wont-support-cloud-saves-to-backup-your-data<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> Editions of both Zelda games won't support cloud saves for data backup, and it's currently unclear why.</p>
<p>On the store pages for both <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Breath-of-the-Wild-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787250.html">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Tears-of-the-Kingdom-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787249.html">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> on Switch 2, a disclaimer reads: "Please note: this software does not support the Nintendo Switch Online paid membership's Save Data Cloud backup feature."</p>
<p>This same disclaimer is not present for other Switch 2 Edition games - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>, or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> - so it's unclear why this is only impacting Zelda games.</p>

<p>What's more, this disclaimer is only on the US and EU store pages. The <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000096248">Japanese page</a> still states the Nintendo Switch Online paid membership is required for the use of the save data storage service (machine translation).</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Nintendo for clarification.</p>
<p>Why does this matter? As a user on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-nintendo-switch-2-editions-of-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-do-not-support-cloud-saves.1166340/">ResetEra</a> noted, players can import their save file from the original Switch to continue using the Switch 2 Edition of the game, but then won't be able to create a new cloud save file as they continue.</p>
<p>What's more, it seems even if players start a fresh save using the Switch 2 Edition, they still won't be able to backup their save file.</p>
<p>But why exactly would this only be the case for Zelda and not other games? For now, the reason is unknown.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 Editions of original Switch games do bring plenty of upgrades. The Zelda games, for instance, have improved visual performance as well as an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/achievements-can-be-earned-in-switch-2-editions-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom">updated app with achievements</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-zelda-ports-let-players-repair-equipment-using-accompanying-app">new method to repair equipment</a>.</p>
<p>In the UK, these <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-edition-ports-of-og-switch-games-cost-65-in-uk">complete updated editions for the new console will cost £65</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-edition-games-will-be-complete-on-the-card-without-a-download-nintendo-confirms">all data included on the game card</a> - something Nintendo clarified following confusion.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-clarifies-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-switch-2-edition-doesnt-include-its-paid-dlc">Breath of the Wild won't include the original game's DLC on Switch 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bethesda is yet to officially announce its highly-anticipated The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake, but we all know it's real. Along with those  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">screenshots on developer Virtuos' website</a>, references to the project have also been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-references-now-found-on-bethesdas-website">spotted on Bethesda's own website</a>. It is safe to say with this remake it's just a case of when, not if.</p>
<p>So, where does that leave the team working Skyblivion, the volunteer-based project by TESRenewal seeking to remake Oblivion in the Skyrim engine? Has news of an official remake caused the bounce to go from their collective bungee? (To paraphrase Wallace and Gromit, there.)</p>

<figcaption>Our Jim has thoughts on the Oblivion remake, or rather, the lack of a Morrowind remake. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH0bzE6hGhE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Well, no, this is not the case at all. <a href="https://x.com/rebelzize/status/1912175393148199140">Writing on social media</a>, project lead Rebelzize said Bethesda's impending announcement "changes nothing" as far as the team working on Skyblivion are concerned.</p>
<p>Rebelzize said the "real remake is the friends we made along the way", before stating the Skyblivion mod was and remains "a passion project".</p>
<p>In fact, Rebelzize sees it as a "win-win" for the Oblivion community which will get "twice the amount of Oblivion this year".</p>

<p>"All love and no hate towards the people who made the official remaster," Rebelzize wrote.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Rebelzize/status/1912505305163792886">subsequent post</a>, Rebelzize added: "Since this got a lot more attention [than] I expected, let me just say I hope you will enjoy either the official or our remake. Either way thanks for the support and be kind to one another."</p>
<p>Team Folon - the group behind the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-closes-in-on-1m-downloads-as-team-folon-gears-up-for-next-fix">ambitious Fallout London mod for Fallout 4</a> - shared Rebelzize's post, writing: "We stand by you. All our love Skyblivion team."</p>

<p>As mentioned, Skyblivion is a voluntary project that fans of The Elder Scrolls games have been working on quite some time. The Skyblivion team has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-a-video-of-skyblivion-which-is-oblivion-in-skyrim">steadily documenting its progress for over a decade now</a>, and I think I just felt myself age as rapidly as that chap in The Last Crusade.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a <a href="https://skyblivion.com/">Skyblivion blog post</a> shared a roadmap for the mod's release, affirming it will "close shut the jaws of Oblivion in 2025".</p>

<p>Earlier this month our Jim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">called upon Bethesda to remake Morrowind rather than Oblivion</a>. "You cowards," Jim wrote, calling Morrowind a "special game, where a beautifully unique fantasy setting is locked away behind technology and interface design that has aged particularly badly".</p>
<p>Think he's on to something?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
While we may still have questions around <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s pricing and mouse controls, extensive hands-on time with Nintendo's new console has left us in no doubt of one thing: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">Mario Kart World is an absolute banger</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Join us today as we hear more directly from Nintendo on its biggest Switch 2 launch title, and - if you're not sold yet - maybe you'll see something that ultimately helps justify <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s standalone £75/$80 cost.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's Mario Kart World Direct kicks off at 2pm UK time - that's 9am Eastern, or a 6am Pacific if you're over the pond - and is set to last for around 15 minutes. We'll be reporting live - let us know what you want to see!

    <p>
What are you looking to see revealed today? For me, it's the situation with Rainbow Road - perhaps the series' most iconic track. 
</p>
<p>
When shown previously, Mario Kart World's map omitted all mention of the location - but an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-leak-confirms-iconic-tracks-return">early reveal from Nintendo's own website</a> has shown it will be present somehow. Today it seems likely we'll hear more.

<p>One thing I've wondered about today is whether we'll see Mario Kart World's post-launch support detailed, and whether the price is designed to include access to all of that - rather than a season pass. Time will tell.</p>

It is clearly the console's killer app - and a bold reinvention of the series' familiar gameplay.</p>
<p>"Mario Kart World's reinvention of the series may be a gamble, but it's absolutely one I think will pay off," I wrote earlier this month. "With a web of possible routes and hours of time likely to be spent exploring every corner of its highways, deserts and mountains - or racing to stay ahead of the competition in Knockout Tour - it's just as well the game's a Switch 2 launch title. I absolutely can't wait to play more."</p></div>

            <p>When <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> arrives on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, owners of the original Switch will also be able to play thanks to the GameShare feature.</p>
<p>As previously announced, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-is-a-switch-2-launch-title">Split Fiction on Switch 2 will support the Friend's Pass</a>, which allows owners to invite a friend to play with them for free. It will also have Cross Play, meaning a Switch 2 player can enjoy the co-op capers of Mio and Zoe with those on PC, Xbox and PlayStation.</p>
<p>And welcomely, it will also be able to be enjoyed by those on the OG Switch, even though the game isn't launching on the platform.</p>

<p>This little nugget was casually tucked away in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/news/nintendo-switch-2-features">Split Fiction blog post</a> about Switch 2's features. "GameShare will enable Nintendo Switch 2 owners to invite another player to play together over a local wireless connection using just one copy of the game," the post reads.</p>
<p>"This 'other player' can be not only a Nintendo Switch 2 owner but a Nintendo Switch owner as well."</p>
<p>Well, I'll be, that is pretty neat! Perhaps it isn't a surprise to many, but I will admit I just assumed that Split Fiction would only be playable for those using an available release platform.</p>

<p>Nintendo gamers are really in for a treat, I have to say. Split Fiction is absolutely brilliant! And, I am far from the only one to think so. "Fantastic from start to finish, Split Fiction is one of the most inventive and joyful co-op games to date, and a testament to the power of human imagination," Katharine Castle wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">Eurogamer's five star Split Fiction review</a>.</p>
<p>Split Fiction will be released on Switch 2 on the console's launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">which is 5th June</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Bethesda is still to announce its highly-anticipated The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake, but there's no denying the project is real and ready to launch.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">screenshots and details of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake were dug up from developer Virtuos' website</a>. Now, references to the project have been found on Bethesda's own website too - including code for a "Buy Now" button that has since been removed. 
</p>
<p>
As Eurogamer previously reported, it's understood that Bethesda's current plans are to shadow drop the game next week on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including via Xbox Game Pass. But nothing has been officially announced - for now.

<p>
Still, Bethesda is clearly readying for next week behind the scenes, with some overly-eager website updating that - of course - caught the eye of fans. 
</p>
<p>
"I was digging through the source code of bethesda.net and found a reference to 'oblivion-remastered' in the Google Tag Manager setup," a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k0o68n/just_found_reference_to_oblivion_remastered_on/?share_id=ZJgIC8zrHuGnKCtKH6nH5">fan posted on reddit</a>, showing a screenshot of the code in situ. 
</p>
<p>
"It points to this URL: https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/oblivion-remastered The page isn't live yet, but what's interesting is that I checked the Google Tag Manager container on the Wayback Machine, and this reference wasn't there as of April 10th. So it looks like it was added very recently!"
</p>
<p>
The code has now been removed - just as the screenshots from Virtuos' website were too. But, of course, copies are now all over the internet, and you can still see the original files in place via an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250415122013/https://www.virtuosgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/">archived version of Virtuos' website</a>.
</p>
<p>After years of leaks and an even lengthier wait for a new entry in The Elder Scrolls series (don't look up how long ago Skyrim landed), fans don't have long to go now. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, Eurogamer's Jim Trinca called on Bethesda to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">"remake Morrowind, not Oblivion, you cowards"</a>. Maybe that could come next?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
