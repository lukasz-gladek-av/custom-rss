            <p>Google has developed a new AI tool that can generate a fully playable 3D game world from a single image prompt.</p>
<p>Genie 2, as the tool is known, is described as a "world model". So where Genie 1 generated 2D worlds, this subsequent tool can create 3D worlds in a variety of perspectives and includes the consequences of taking actions like jumping or swimming.</p>
<p>Google stresses the tool can be used for "rapid prototyping" as it "enables artists and designers to prototype quickly, which can bootstrap the creative process for environment design, further accelerating research".</p>

<p>It works using a single image prompt, with Google of course using examples from its own text-to-image AI tool Imagen 3, though real world images can be used too.</p>
<p>From there users can jump in and interact with the world, with the AI overcoming challenges like understanding control inputs and remembering the world it's created as the camera pans elements in and out of view. It then generates new plausible content on the fly for up to a minute of gameplay.</p>
<p>It can further generate NPCs and interactions with them; the physics of water or gravity; lighting models and reflections; and multiple animations.</p>
<p>"While this research is still in its early stage with substantial room for improvement on both agent and environment generation capabilities, we believe Genie 2 is the path to solving a structural problem of training embodied agents safely while achieving the breadth and generality required to progress towards AGI [Artificial General Intelligence]," reads a <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-2-a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/">blog post on the tool from Google</a>.</p>
<p>So while the tool can be used for prototyping, it's also being used to train further AI models.</p>
<p>Discussing how Google developed the technology responsibly, the blog post reads: "Genie 2 shows the potential of foundational world models for creating diverse 3D environments and accelerating agent research. This research direction is in its early stages and we look forward to continuing to improve Genie's world generation capabilities in terms of generality and consistency.</p><p>"As with SIMA [Scalable Instructable Multiworld Agent], our research is building towards more general AI systems and agents that can understand and safely carry out a wide range of tasks in a way that is helpful to people online and in the real world."</p>
<p>As such it's purpose as of yet doesn't seem to be directly in video game development, though the potential is clear.</p>
<p>Indeed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">AI is changing video game development</a> with its use in multiple areas, from NPCs to scriptwriting and voice acting.</p>
<p>Multiple studios have already stated their interest in AI technology, both for and against it. Most recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-boss-says-ai-will-revolutionise-gaming-but-must-be-balanced-with-human-touch">PlayStation co-CEO Hermen Hulst</a> stated AI technology has the capacity to "revolutionise" the games industry, but it won't replace the "human touch".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ananta, the free-to-play open world anime RPG formerly known as Project Mugen, has now been officially revealed with a full trailer.</p>
<p>The game was originally announced at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> last year but this slick trailer shows a first proper look at its Grand Theft Auto meets Spider-Man gameplay.</p>
<p>There's certainly a lot to take in: from its pop aesthetic and fake social media reports, to swinging and driving through futuristic streets, beating up oddball bad guys with eccentric moves and sneaky stealth, and looking cool in the process. At one point there's a man riding a toilet with legs. Check it out for yourself below.</p>

<p>Ananta comes courtesy of Chinese developer Naked Rain and will be published by NetEase. There's no release date yet, though fans can <a href="https://www.anantagame.com/preview/">pre-register for details</a> already.</p>
<p>There's also no word on its monetisation: it's free-to-play, but unknown as of yet if it will include gacha or microtransactions.</p>

<p>As for the weird plot, players will "take on the role of an elite Agent within the A.C.D. (Anti-Chaos Directorate) embarking on an exhilarating adventure through a world that breaks all the rules", according to the developer. "Nova City has plunged into Chaos, from spooky paranormal phenomena to toilets racing through traffic in the streets, the game promises to offer a unique blend of humor, adventure, and mystery."</p>
<p>The trailer certainly has shades of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> to it and the stealth combat seems heavily inspired by Insomniac's Spider-Man series. The aesthetic also seems to sit somewhere between MiHoYo's work and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pearl-abyss-delays-creature-collecting-game-dokev">DokeV from Pearl Abyss</a>.</p>
<p>Still, even with its obvious allusions to other games, it looks like a fun romp - and the music is a bop.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone has confirmed work on his next game, Haunted Chocolatier, is still ongoing, despite pausing development to focus instead on Stardew Valley updates.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2024/12/04/update/">new blog post</a>, the creator noted it had been "a little sad to see Haunted Chocolatier getting dusty on the shelf", but as he got involved in the Stardew Valley 1.6 update as it grew from technical changes to content additions, it "kind of snowballed" and pulled him away from the next game.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-latest-update-adds-a-new-friend-to-retrieve-lost-items-and-more">1.6 update arrived on consoles last month</a>, meaning Barone is now free to continue development of Haunted Chocolatier.</p>

<p>Barone explained his "strong sense of duty and obligation" to Stardew Valley players, but said he has a "strong desire to make more games".</p>
<p>"I like making games, and I have a lot more that I want to share, with Haunted Chocolatier and beyond," he wrote. "And even though Haunted Chocolatier has only been revealed publicly to a tiny degree, in my own private world it's a special place, and I'm very attached to the characters, themes, and ideas."</p>
<p>Before the release of 1.6, Barone had a "vertical slice" of Haunted Chocolatier, with the skeleton and most of its bones in place.</p>
<p>"My next task will be to tweak the existing bones until I'm happy with them, add all the rest of the bones, and then flesh it all out with all the content that will need to be in the game," he wrote. "Yes, it's going to be a lot of work still, but it's okay, I'm addicted to the grind."</p>
<p>The release of Haunted Chocolatier is still quite a way away, then, but Barone won't be doing any early access, crowdfunding, or pre-orders ahead of its full launch.</p>
<p>"I will not release a game unless it is complete and I am very happy with it, and I think that's what most people would want, anyway," he surmised, though he will still be releasing development updates on occasion.</p>
<p>Barone <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">first revealed Haunted Chocolatier in October 2021</a>, with Stardew Valley fans eager to find out more on his next project.</p>
<p>While similar to Stardew Valley in aesthetic, the game will see players running a haunted chocolate shop, along with monster hunting and life sim elements.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
With the season of giving now officially upon us, Jingle Jam has unveiled its latest PC charity bundle - this year featuring the stellar likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a>, Shadows of Doubt, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>, which can all be snapped up in support of a bunch of good causes.
</p>
<p>
In total, the Jingle Jam 2024 Games Collection feature 18 titles (all supplied as Steam codes), and there's a lot of good stuff to be found. For the most part we're in the realm of indies, although Sega and Two Point Studios' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-point-campus-review-university-was-never-this-fun">enormously enjoyable Two Point Campus</a> sneaks in too.
</p>
<p>
Also up for grabs are ColePowered Games' wildly ambitious procedurally generated detective noir Shadows of Doubt (which we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadows-of-doubt-review-an-unmatched-detective-similation-when-it-works">gave three stars</a> back in October), superb sci-fi narrative adventure Citizen Sleeper (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-review-a-gentle-cerebral-game-of-belonging-and-survival">Recommended</a>), survival city builder Frostpunk (also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frostpunk-review-a-thrilling-but-thin-frozen-city-building-game">Recommended</a>), and minimalist puzzler Patrick's Parabox (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/patricks-parabox-review-a-simple-minimalist-puzzler-with-recursive-depths">four stars</a>!).

<p>
But there's more: roguelike card battler Widlfrost is in there (this one <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/our-personal-top-five-games-of-2023">made Bertie's Games of 2023 list</a>), as is wonderfully engaging sci-fi construction sim Mars First Logistics, sticker store management game Sticky Business, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-crabs-treasure-feels-a-natural-evolution-for-an-underwater-soulslike">crustacean-themed Souls-like Another Crab's Treasure</a>, and the sequel to acclaimed 2018 tabletop-style RPG adventure, For the King 2.
</p><p>
Also included is the well-received blackjack roguelike adventure Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/scorn-review-beautifully-grotesque-puzzle-horror-that-doesnt-quite-congeal">Geiger-esque horror Scorn</a>, action-tower defense game Orcs Must Die 3, dystopian racer Death Sprint 66, dating sim action-RPG Eternights, card-battling rogue-like Hadean Tactics, hand-drawn puzzle adventure Submachine: Legacy, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fights-in-tight-spaces-review-a-strategical-secret-agent-beat-em-up-thats-almost-there">Fight in Tight Spaces</a> - a "stylish blend of deck-building, turn-based tactics, and thrilling animated fight sequences in classic action-movie settings". And if you prefer you lists in bullet point form:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers</li>
<li>Wildfrost</li>
<li>Two Point Camps</li>
<li>Shadows of Doubt</li>
<li>Patrick's Parabox</li>
<li>For the King 2</li>
<li>Citizen Sleeper</li>

<li>Fights in Tight Spaces</li>
<li>Death Sprint 66</li>
<li>Eternights</li>
<li>Frostpunk</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Jingle Jam 2024 Games Collection is a bit of corker, then, and if you're sufficiently swayed, all the above can be acquired for a very reasonable donation of £35. Or rather, for a minimum donation of £35 - with more appreciated if you're able, seeing as organisers are hoping to raise as much money as possible for this year's eight selected charities.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, money accrued though Jingle Jam 2024's charity bundle will go to Autistica, Campaign Against Living Miserably, Cool Earth, Sarcoma UK, The Trevor Project, Wallace &amp; Gromit's Grand Appeal, Whale and Dolphin Conservation, and War Child. You can read more about each charity - and purchase this year's games bundle - over on the <a href="https://jinglejam.tiltify.com/">Jingle Jam website</a>. At the time of writing, it's successfully raised £1,277,979.
