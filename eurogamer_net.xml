<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> is the second-highest-grossing game adaptation movie ever by grossing $491m (£379m).</p>
<p>"I left feeling that The Minecraft Movie, something weirder and trickier and perhaps less formally careful, is out there somewhere, its bright potential untouched," our Chris Donlan wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-review">Minecraft movie review</a>, awarding it 3/5 stars.</p>
<p>"Minecraft hardly needs a film in the first place - it's already a phenomenon, a Pandora's Box, an essential formative aspect of the childhoods of millions of people around the world. Even so, perhaps the film this game truly deserves is, like so much else in Minecraft, still waiting to be made."</p>
<p>Lead actor Jack Black believes A Minecraft Movie is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-is-just-what-the-world-needs-right-now-says-jack-black">just the tonic the world is in need of right now</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking at the film's premiere, Black said: "What the world needs now is love, sweet love."</p>
<p>Black was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecrafts-jack-black-was-initially-going-to-play-a-talking-pig">originally going to portray a talking pig</a> in the upcoming film.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
