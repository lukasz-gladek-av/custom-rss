            <p>
Xbox consoles will now be more expensive worldwide, including in the UK, mainland Europe and the US, Microsoft has confirmed.
</p>
<p>Here in Europe, Xbox Series X will cost £499.99 / €599.99 - an increase of £20 / $50. The 512GB Xbox Series S will meanwhile cost £299.99 / €349.99 - an increase of £50 / €50.  If you're splashing out on the 2TB Xbox Series X model, that's up £40 or €50 to £589.99 / €699.99.</p>
<p>In the US, Xbox Series X will cost $599.99, up a whopping $100. The 512GB Xbox Series S will meanwhile cost $379.99, up $80. The 2TB Xbox Series X is now $729.99, up $130, and now more expensive than Sony's $699 <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>
The prices of some upcoming Xbox games will rise to $80 (UK price TBA) at the end of this year, though existing games will not increase be impacted. Still, expect this fresh pricing to roll out in time for Call of Duty 2025 and whatever else Microsoft has out this Christmas. 
</p>
<p>"We will adjust the pricing of some of our new first-party games starting this holiday season to $79.99," a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">Microsoft Q&amp;A on the changes</a> states. "This update will apply to physical and digital versions. That said, different games and expansions will continue to be offered at a variety of price points."</p>

</figure>
<p>The cost of certain controllers - and in the US, also headsets - will see small increases, too. The cost of Xbox Game Pass is staying the same, however.
</p>
<p>In a statement to Eurogamer, a Microsoft spokesperson acknowledged the price changes were "challenging" but claimed they were a reflection of "market conditions" and rising development costs.</p>
<p>"As of 1st May, we have adjusted recommended retailer pricing for our consoles and controllers worldwide," a Microsoft spokesperson said. "We also expect to adjust the pricing of some of our new, first-party games starting this holiday season to $79.99. Those titles purchased on the Xbox store have the benefit of Xbox Play Anywhere, allowing players to buy once and play on console and PC at no additional cost. </p>
<p>"We understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development. Looking ahead, we continue to focus on offering more ways to play more games across any screen, and ensuring value for Xbox players."</p>
<p>Last night, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-hardware-revenue-continues-to-tumble-but-gaming-revenue-is-up-microsoft-reports">Microsoft reported a further fall in sales of its Xbox hardware</a> during its latest quarterly financial results, and suggested it was looking to tighten its margins there.
</p>
<p>
Still, revenue from Microsoft's gaming division continues to grow overall, thanks to money made primarily by money spent on Call of Duty, Minecraft and Game Pass subscriptions. Indeed, Microsoft said it was the top publisher on both Xbox and PlayStation for the quarter.</p>
<p>The news follows a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-price-increased-at-major-european-retailer-prompting-fears-of-wider-rises">retail leak earlier today that revealed a €50 price hike for Xbox Series X/S in Europe</a>, and months of speculation around Microsoft quitting some smaller markets worldwide. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo's partnership with Lego is continuing this summer with a fresh wave of Super Mario and Animal Crossing sets, including the first appearance of some fan-favourite characters.
</p>
<p>
In Nintendo's general Super Mario range, you'll be able to add Captain Toad via a new playset featuring the intrepid explorer at his campsite. Very cute. 
</p>
<p>
The Mario Kart range, meanwhile, adds an interactive Lego Mario and Standard Kart set, as well as a set containing Wario and King Boo (thanks, <a href="https://jaysbrickblog.com/news/lego-super-mario-summer-2025-sets-include-wario-captain-toad-prince-florian-and-more/">Jay's Brick Blog</a>).
</p>
<p>
Other Mario sets include a Toad House and a Bowser's Castle playset. For those looking to splash a bit more cash, there's a 1251-piece Prince Florian and Castle Bowser set inspired by Super Mario Wonder to tempt you.

<p>
Three more Lego sets also join the Animal Crossing range, bringing a pair of houses with villagers Fuschia, Stitches and Fang, plus a further house with Goldie. 
</p>
<p>
But the star of the show here is clearly Blathers' Museum, a 543-piece set that features the building's facade, as well as a fountain and dinosaur skeleton exhibit. Oh, and Blathers himself of course, hoo.
</p>
<p>
All of the above sets are due to go on sale from 1st August, with pre-orders live shortly via Lego.com. Anything take your fancy?
</p>
<p>Further down the line, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-boy-is-the-next-nintendo-console-officially-getting-the-lego-treatment">Lego has already announced a Game Boy set due later in 2025</a>, and a full <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-pokemon-announced-coming-2026">Lego Pokémon range that's coming in 2026</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Evil Dead: The Game is being removed from sale on PC, PlayStation and Xbox, publisher Saber Interactive has announced. 
</p>
<p>
The multiplayer horror game's online servers will remain online for the time being for those who have bought and played Evil Dead: The Game already, Saber continued, but no new players will now be able to join.
</p>
<p>
Launched in May 2022, today's announcement comes just ahead of Evil Dead: The Game's third anniversary. But development on new content for the game had already ceased, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/last-years-multiplayer-evil-dead-game-wont-get-new-content-switch-version-canned">planned port for Nintendo Switch was scrapped</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We can confirm we've begun the process of removing the game from digital storefronts," Saber wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1493750/view/501697399294526021">statement on Evil Dead: The Game's Steam page</a>. "Anyone who has purchased the game will still be able to play it as we plan to keep our servers online for everyone.
</p>
<p>
"We want to extend a sincere thank you to our community, to those who have been part of the game from the very beginning, and those who have recently joined us. We appreciate all of your support."
</p>
<p>
Evil Dead: The Game is an asymmetrical multiplayer game featuring characters from the Evil Dead movies, including Bruce Campbell's Ash Williams, facing off against the Deadite hordes. 
</p>
<p>
The project was supported by additional maps, modes, classes and characters, though this soon fizzled out as it became clear the game had not found enough of an audience. 
</p>
<p>
"Evil Dead: The Game works best when it allows you to be the demon, which also means allowing you to be the director," Christian Donlan wrote, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/evil-dead-the-game-understands-evil-dead-the-movies-better-than-i-expected">saying it reflected the franchise's films better than expected</a>. "Gimme some sugar, baby."

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> has been played by over two million people, Ubisoft has announced, while hinting at more from the franchise to come.</p>
<p>The Lost Crown, released in January 2024, was the first new game in the series since 2010's middling The Forgotten Sands, arriving alongside The Rogue Prince of Persia from Evil Empire that remains in early access.</p>
<p>"You've revived the legend," reads a post on social media. "The Prince is back, and believe us - he's just warming up."</p>

<p>The Lost Crown sold 1.3m copies in its first year, with overall players now reaching over two million thanks to its inclusion on Ubisoft's subscription and PS Plus, as well as its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-comes-to-mobile-next-month">recent mobile release</a>.</p>
<p>However, French outlet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HgkIyq0emY">Origami</a> reported last October the team behind the game had been disbanded and it would not receive a sequel, owing to its commercial performance.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-development-team-disbanded">follow-up statement to Eurogamer</a>, the game's senior producer Abdelhak Elguess confirmed "most" of the team had "shifted to other projects that will benefit from their expertise".</p>
<p>He added: "We know players have a love for this brand and Ubisoft is excited to bring more Prince of Persia experiences in the future."</p>

<p>As The Lost Crown has reached the end of its post-launch roadmap, it's unclear precisely how the prince is "just warming up", as per that social media post.</p>
<p>Presumably, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-the-second-act-update-effectively-relaunches-the-game-makes-prince-no-longer-purple">more updates are on the way to The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> ahead of a supposed full release out of early access.</p>
<p>There's also the forthcoming, and much-delayed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-now-targeting-2026-gets-briefest-of-trailers">Sands of Time remake that's now targeting a 2026 release</a>.</p>
<p>But will there be more sidescrolling Metroidvania action from The Lost Crown team?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
