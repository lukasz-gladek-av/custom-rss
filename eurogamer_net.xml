            <p>EA and Battlefield Studios has made sweeping changes to challenges today, reducing the required milestones for class assignments,  weapon assignments, gameplay and mastery assignments, and more.</p>
<p>This was revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1986065315906695229?t=hLk3LaaiyV47LOqtvFCxKQ&amp;s=19">Battlefield Community Update post</a>, which notes that over 90 challenges in total have been tweaked to be easier. The post states that this came following ongoing player feedback.</p>
<p>The post states: "As we continue to build on the improvements we mentioned previously, we are also delivering a major overhaul of Challenges and Assignments, guided by gameplay data and your feedback. Some of the adjustments in this update are substantial, and we wanted to share more context on how we arrived at them.</p>

<p>"This update makes significant reductions to challenge requirements, cutting down on time investment while maintaining a focus on skill-driven progression that rewards consistent play. Challenges and Assignments are tuned around defined playtime targets, and these changes bring their requirements in line with those goals to make them more achievable within a reasonable session length."</p><p>Changes have gone live today, and progress across affected challenges have been retained post-update. That means that for many players, they'll boot up the game and find a suite of previously incomplete challenges have been mysteriously accomplished. There will, according to the post, be additional updates addressing challenges in the near future in which further adjustments to completion requirements will be made.</p>
<p>Challenges in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> <em>have</em> proven exceptionally grating for a subset of the playerbase since the game's release. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1oms515/these_challenges_can_absolutely_suck_the_will_out/">Take this post by user AwkwardSoldier</a>, who posted a screenshot of support healing and LMG suppression challenges, titling the post: "These challenges can absolutely suck the will out of you". So players have been suffering big time trying to finish these, which is likely where the aforementioned feedback has come from.</p>
<p>It's yet another tweak to Battlefield 6 made following its release, following a nerf to aim assist as well as updates <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-next-patch-will-address-the-games-most-frustrating-problem-ahead-of-season-ones-release">addressing weapon bloom</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-makes-temporary-adjustments-to-xp-earned-in-strikepoint-mode-to-maintain-fair-and-consistent-progression">removing Strikepoint XP exploits</a>. Whether or not this will tame the increasingly loud Battlefield 6 community throughout Season 1 remains to be seen.</p>
