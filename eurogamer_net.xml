            <p>Sega and Sports Interactive, developer of the Football Manager series, have announced that the next and highly anticipated version of the game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/football-manager-2026">Football Manager 26</a>, will release on 4th November.</p>
<p>The initial roll-out of the game will be on PC/Mac (full-fat version), alongside Football Manager 26 Console for PS5 and Xbox Series consoles. On 4th December Football Manager 26 Touch will release digitally for Nintendo Switch. All these versions of the game are built on the Unity Engine for the first time and offer save game compatibility with Football Manager 2024 and Football Manager 2023.</p>

<p>"Setting Sports Interactive up for the next 20 years and beyond was an enormous undertaking but I couldn't be prouder of the efforts of the whole team over the past two years" said Sports Interactive Studio Director Miles Jacobson.</p>

            <p>
Nintendo has been granted a new patent in the US, following its ongoing patent infringement lawsuit with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair.
</p>
<p>
The new patent, granted last week by the US Patent and Trademark Office, covers the gameplay mechanic of summoning a sub-character to let it fight another. The patent application was filed in March 2023 and has been granted without objection (thanks <a href="https://gamesfray.com/last-week-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-received-a-u-s-patent-on-summoning-a-character-and-letting-it-fight-another/">Games Fray</a>).
</p>
<p>
Such a patent would not only implicate Palworld with its monster summoning and battling, but many similar games from long-standing rival Digimon, to the forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/honkai-nexus-anima-revealed-a-spin-off-creature-collector-from-genshin-impact-studio">Honkai: Nexus Anima</a> and DokeV, as well as indies like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/temtem">Temtem</a> and Cassette Beasts.
</p>
<p>
There are a number of steps in the patent pertaining to the gameplay mechanic, as follows:
</p>
<blockquote><ol>
<li>A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having stored therein a game program, the game program causing a processor of an information processing apparatus to execute:</li>
<li>performing control of moving a player character on a field in a virtual space, based on a movement operation input;</li>
<li>performing control of causing a sub character to appear on the field, based on a first operation input, and</li>
<li>when an enemy character is placed at a location where the sub character is caused to appear, controlling a battle between the sub character and the enemy character by a first mode in which the battle proceeds based on an operation input, and</li>
<li>when the enemy character is not placed at the location where the sub character is caused to appear, starting automatic control of automatically moving the sub character that has appeared; and</li>
<li>performing control of moving the sub character in a predetermined direction on the field, based on a second operation input, and, when the enemy character is placed at a location of a designation, controlling a battle between the sub character and the enemy character by a second mode in which the battle automatically proceeds.</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p>
All of these steps must be followed for Nintendo to have a case, but in theory it could launch an infringement lawsuit against a number of games with this patent now in place.
</p>
<p>But is this patent enforceable through further lawsuits from Nintendo?</p>
<p>
Don McGowan, former chief legal officer at The Pokémon Company, believes the patent will likely be ignored. "I wish Nintendo and Pokémon good luck when the first other developer just entirely ignores this patent and, if those companies sue that developer, the developer shows decades of prior art," he told Eurogamer, adding: "This isn't <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-now-allowed-auxiliary-mini-games-during-loading-screens">Bandai Namco with the loading screen patent</a>".</p><p>"The filing for such patent protection indicates that Nintendo does intend to pursue a legal strategy in defending itself against entrants in the pocket monster genre," games industry lawyer Richard Hoeg told Eurogamer. "But that strategy may or may not involve lawsuits, as the 'muddying of the waters' effected by the patents existence may be enough to deter investment in and creation of competitors.  That is, if Nintendo looks like it <em>could</em> pounce, that may be enough. No actual pouncing required."</p>
<p>What's more, the patent is broad and Nintendo won't want to jeopardise seeing it narrowed in the context of a legal challenge, Hoeg explained.</p>
<p>"So yes, it's enforceable in so far as it has been granted," said Hoeg, "but Nintendo likely knows it 'got away with one' here and would prefer not to make a court actually sign off."</p>
<p>What's more worrying for Hoeg is whether the USPTO is "up to the task" when it comes to games patents. "Law and technology are often strange bedfellows, and in my opinion the patent office has appeared out of its depth on evaluating video games for quite some time," said Hoeg. "It may be time for reform there."</p>
<p>
At the least, the patent is certainly worrying for the games industry in the face of creativity and developer freedom.
</p>
<p>
Already Pocketpair has altered gameplay in Palworld as part of its ongoing lawsuit with Nintendo, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-says-pokemon-lawsuit-will-prompt-more-disappointing-changes-as-it-continues-to-dispute-claims">disputing the claims of copyright infringement</a>.
</p>
<p>The patent is also well-timed ahead of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Nintendo's forthcoming Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, due out on 16th October.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' DLC Claws of Awaji will be ready to dive into very soon, and in anticipation Ubisoft is issuing a new update for the base game.</p>
<p>This update, which is scheduled to go live later today, will include a level cap increase, upgrades for your hideout, the ability to fast-forward the time of day (hurrah!) and new Ezio themed Project Rewards.</p>
<p>As for Claws of Awaji, that's coming on 16th September, as paid DLC (though those who pre-ordered Assassin's Creed Shadows will get it for free). On its release, Claws of Awaji will introduce a new region, a new weapon and abilities, new outfits and legendary gear, a new enemy faction and bosses, and a new chapter of Shadow's story. The expansion is said to be adding over 10 hours of content to the game.</p>

<p>You can check out the full patch notes for Assassin's Creed Shadows Title Update 1.1.1, to give it its full name, below:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>PATCH SIZES: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>PS5: 12.94 GB</li>
<li>Xbox Series X|S: 33 GB</li>
<li>MAC: 24 GB</li>
<li>PC: 42 GB</li>
<li>Steam: 17 GB</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PATCH HIGHLIGHTS </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New expansion: Claws of Awaji </li>
</ul>
<p>A storm is coming.</p>
<p>A new threat rises from across Osaka Bay as rumors surface of a hidden blade wielding shinobi, and of a long-lost relic. Naoe and Yasuke journey to a new land in search of answers, but find themselves surrounded by danger, ensnared in the Claws of Awaji.</p>
<p>In this expansion to Assassin's Creed Shadows, discover a new island region dominated by the Sanzoku Ippa, a nefarious faction intent on uncovering the final Regalia. Avoid traps and ambushes as you track the legendary Fujibayashi Tsuyu, and as Naoe, master the new Bo staff to eliminate enemies with tactical efficiency. New legendary gear, skills and abilities also await across more than 10 hours of additional content.</p>
<p><em>We also would like to inform MacOS users eligible for the Claws of Awaji DLC that the content may not be accessible immediately after launching the game for the first time following the release of the DLC.</em></p>
<p><em>To resolve this, please launch the game while connected online, then close it and reboot—either online or offline—to ensure the DLC becomes available.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>New free story quest: Go with the Bo</li>
</ul>
<p>Join Junjiro in his quest to meet a legendary Bo Master and learn more about the Bo staff, a dynamic new weapon type perfectly suited to Naoe's acrobatic fighting style. Upon finishing the quest, you will receive a Bo to use across your adventures.</p>
<p>Originally developed exclusively for the Claws of Awaji expansion, we thought this weapon was way too cool not to share with everyone... for FREE! You get a Bo! And you! And you at the back! Everyone gets a Bo, coming September 16th.</p>
<ul>
<li>Level Cap Increase</li>
</ul>
<p>To support the launch of the Claws of Awaji expansion we've raised the level cap to 100, giving players more room to grow and more options to customize their builds.</p>
<ul>
<li>New Hideout Upgrades</li>
</ul>
<p>With the new update, each unique building now includes two additional upgrade levels, bringing a total of 20 new enhancements, alongside three new Hideout levels.</p>
<p>These upgrades introduce valuable bonuses that accelerate Hideout growth, improve crafting capability by making Gold more accessible, and directly enhance Naoe, Yasuke, and their allies, making them more effective in both combat and exploration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Advance Time of Day</li>
</ul>
<p>By upgrading the Nando to level two, the player will gain the ability to meditate and skip time forward to the next 6 o'clock (AM or PM). To activate meditation, find a safe location and hold the up button (L on keyboard). This allows Naoe and Yasuke to prepare for nighttime assault and be ready to strike [#@!%&amp;*] Castle at night.</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved Scouts</li>
</ul>
<p>Upgrading the Study to level four now allows Scouts to reveal both Viewpoints and Safehouses. Discovering Safehouses is especially valuable, as it enables Naoe and Yasuke to join the action more quickly by reducing their travel time.</p>
<p>And with the Kakurega upgraded to level four, uncovering all Viewpoints within a province will also reveal the entire province automatically, giving players full visibility of its terrain and strategic locations. No more fog!</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced Gear Quality</li>
</ul>
<p>By upgrading the Forge to level six, Naoe and Yasuke gain the ability to enhance their gear to new quality tiers: Mythic and Artifact. Once an item reaches a new quality, it can be further upgraded through eight additional levels to unlock its full potential.</p>
<p>Epic items can be transformed into Mythic items, which improve their stats with each level, add a Boosted Stat if one wasn't present, and boost non-legendary perks, including the one in the engraving slot, by 50 percent at level five and 100 percent at level nine. (For perks related to damage reduction, refill ration, ammo, or tools, this bonus is halved, capping at a 50 percent increase at level nine.)</p>
<p>Legendary items, on the other hand, can evolve into Artifact items, which not only increase their stats with each level but also receive additional Boosted Stats at levels three, seven, and twice at level nine. Engraved non-legendary perks are also boosted like the Mythic items.</p>
<p>These powerful enhancements are designed as long-term goals, supporting players through the increasing difficulty of subsequent New Game+ cycles and other upcoming challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li>New Project: Sanctuary</li>
</ul>
<p>We are releasing a new Project available in the Animus HUB, called Sanctuary, in which you can get Ezio themed gear, kusarigama, and much more! Activate the new Project, complete Anomalies and progress through the rewards like previously released ones.</p>
<ul>
<li>New Anomalies in Awaji</li>
</ul>
<p>With the release of the Claws of Awaji expansion, we added new Anomalies available in that region, with one available in every schedule. These Anomalies are only available for players who have the expansion installed.</p>

<p>Ubisoft recently celebrated welcoming five million players to Assassin's Creed Shadows. Along with those five million assassins, at the time there had also been 2bn stealth kills and 38 million animals petted. Meanwhile, players have travelled 1bn kilometers since the game was released in March. And it sounds like Assassin's Creed Shadows may soon be welcoming more players to Japan, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-ubisoft-hints">with a Switch 2 port seemingly being on the cards</a>.</p>

            <p>Early start today! One of those mornings where my mind woke up before my body. We're back with another day of video games, gathering all of the news and events here, while talking about them with you.</p>
<p>By the way, thank you for your feedback yesterday. We're gathering it to help shape and drive change.</p>
<p>But onto today, and a question that formed in my brain this morning, while sipping coffee and looking at my dormant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> beside my television. How many of you are using your Switch 2? Does it get frequent use or occasional use? Or, perhaps, none at all.</p>
