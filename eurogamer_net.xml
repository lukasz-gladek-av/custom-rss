            <p>The Last of Us Part 2 made its PC debut just yesterday, but already the game has been cracked.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-last-of-us-part-2-pc-steam-playstation-cracked/">The Gamer</a>, video game pirates have found a way to get the game off Steam - its legitimate PC storefront - for torrenting, less than 24 hours since its release. Posts on social media reveal that the game is available from unofficial sources.</p>

</figure>
<p>This means that while The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered itself has 15,885 players on Steam at the time of writing, there are likely some players elsewhere given its unofficial PC availability - though it's hard to tell how much pirating has impacted sales so far.</p>
<p>The Last of Us 2 Remastered <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?compare=1888930,2531310">currently has a concurrent player peak of 23,350</a> on Valve's platform. To compare, The Last of Us Part 1 - which was released on PC in 2023, in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-knows-the-last-of-us-part-1-on-pc-hasnt-delivered-the-naughty-dog-quality-you-expected">rather sorry state</a> - has a Steam concurrent player peak of 36,496.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry took The Last of Us Part 2 out for a spin on PC ahead of its release. "It's a better game on launch than Part 1, but with some frustrating elements and a buggy feeling that's hard to shake," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-the-last-of-us-part-2-a-better-pc-port-but-not-a-great-one">Alex Battaglia wrote following his time with The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered on PC</a>.</p>
<p>"Beyond the disappointingly high GPU requirements, the biggest complaint here are the frame-time spikes that occur even on high-end kit, which seems incongruous with the game's cinematic presentation."</p>
<p>Still, it doesn't look like any of Part 2's issues are going to get memed in the same way <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-many-pc-glitches-are-being-turned-into-memes">The Last of Us Part 1 did on its own PC release</a>.</p>

            <p>Nintendo's upcoming Switch 2 console doesn't actually run the original Switch's games natively, as the two hardwares are incompatible.</p>
<p>One of the first things that we knew for absolute certain about the Switch successor was that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">it would be backwards compatible</a>. "At today's Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch," company president Shuntaro Furukawa said in November.</p>
<p>But, while this means Switch 2 owners will still be able to play most of the games from the original Switch's library, this isn't possible because the two consoles are compatible at a hardware level, which would have been handy. Rather, it's all possible thanks to a workaround Nintendo has managed to implement.</p>

<p>During a recent <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4/">Ask the Developer Q&amp;A</a>, Nintendo's Kouichi Kawamoto said the Switch 2 team always wanted the new system to play the original console's games, but "were told there'd be technical challenges" getting it to work.</p>
<p>"When we first started Switch 2 development, the focus was on enhancing its performance as hardware, namely, expanding its capacity," added Takuhiro Dohta. "So, compatibility was a lower priority."</p>
<p>But, it was still something the team wanted to ensure, and in the end the Switch 2 developers settled on "the challenge of using new technology to run Switch games".</p>
<p>Said Dohta: "If we tried to use technology like software emulators, we'd have to run Switch 2 at full capacity, but that would mean the battery wouldn't last so long, so we did something that’s somewhere in between a software emulator and hardware compatibility."</p>
<p>The team goes through many checks to make sure original Switch games run smoothly on Switch 2, but the developers noted "it might not be that all Switch games run perfectly" in time for the console's launch this summer.</p>
<p>This method of playing older games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-and-other-games-have-compatibility-issues-with-switch-2">explains why a few titles have some compatibility issues</a>, though fixes are in the works. And while only one Switch game is completely unplayable on Switch 2, others will still require the use of original Joy-Con due to specific controls or peripherals.</p>
<p>"But we will continue our efforts so that we can support as many Switch games as possible," Kawamoto said.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">InZoi</a> - the early access life-sim game from Krafton - debuted at the end of March, and has since passed a record breaking sales milestone for the company.</p>
<p>In its first week of release, InZoi crossed the 1m sales mark. This lofty figure marks the fastest sales milestone ever achieved by a Krafton published title.</p>

<p>"We are grateful and excited to present InZoi to players around the world through Early Access," said CEO CH Kim, adding: "We will continue to actively communicate with players and foster InZoi as Krafton’s long-term franchise IP."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://x.com/PlayinZOI/status/1908082411906449478/photo/1">writing on social media</a>, the team said this is a "number that still feels unreal to us and a milestone we could not have reached without each and every one of you".</p>
<p>
"Your excitement, your creations, your feedback, your content, and your support have brought InZoi to life in ways we never could have imagined."</p>

<p>Despite this impressive start, InZoi's launch hasn't been without its issues. Last week, Krafton had to patch out a bug in its early access release, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inzoi-developer-resolves-to-strengthen-internal-review-processes-following-bug-which-allowed-players-to-run-over-and-kill-children">allowed players to run over children in InZoi with a car and kill them</a>.</p>
<p>"This issue was caused by an unintended bug that has been resolved in the latest patch. These depictions are highly inappropriate and do not reflect the intent and values of InZoi," a Krafton spokesperson told Eurogamer. </p>
<p>
"We understand the seriousness of this matter and age-appropriate content and we are strengthening our internal review processes to prevent similar incidents in the future."</p>

            <p>The Marvel Rivals team has admitted it's feeling "pressure" to keep the game exciting as it prepares its second season, which boasts a Hellfire Gala theme.</p>
<p>"Since the launch of season one, we've been deeply contemplating how Marvel Rivals can continuously deliver fun and engaging experiences for you all," Marvel Rivals creative director Guangyun Chen shared in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOuv0tO_aLI">accompanying Dev Vision video</a>. The developer noted that "discussions on social media have certainly added some pressure on us to keep the game as exciting as it has been since December", but the team wants to ensure it fulfills "everyone's fantasies about Marvel Super Heroes".</p>
<p>Hellfire Gala was initially a 12-part X-Men comic book storyline, and is now making its way to the free-to-play shooter. "After the intense Eternal Night saga and defeat of Dracula, Emma Frost has prepared a lavish celebration, inviting everyone to don their best attire and venture to the Mutant haven of the Living Island Krakoa for the annual Hellfire Gala," the Marvel Rivals team teases.</p>

</figure>
<p>Of course, things don't go to plan, and Ultron eventually pops up and crashes the festivities. "Attending heroes must spring into action to protect Krakoa's greatest treasure from his grasp."</p>
<p>Season two kicks off on 11th April. Following this season, players will notice the developer shifting to a "two-month format", and each month a new hero will make their debut.</p>
<p>As for the second season specifically, you may have surmised given that official blurb, when it launches, Emma Frost will join the roster of heroes, in a Vanguard role. She is a telepathy master, and can "adeptly utilise her telepathic and diamond abilities as the situation demands, standing at the forefront to shield her allies and obliterate her foes". Ultron will also be arriving as a playable hero, but later in the season.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as far as maps are concerned for the second season of Marvel Rivals, the first one coming is - understandably - Hellfire Gala: Krakoa. This map will feature the gala itself, which the development team describes as "grand" and full of "dreamy botanical landscapes and beautiful fireworks" (which, honestly, every party should have).</p>
<p>This season will also introduce some adjustments to the Marvel Rivals' Team-Up Abilities, while the developer is "implementing weekly missions alongside the existing daily missions and challenges, which will help active players fully claim all rewards from the Battle Pass by the end of the season".</p>
<p>You can check out the various <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/">patch notes for Marvel Rivals here</a>. Meanwhile, you can watch a teaser for season two below.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the GameCube Nintendo Classics collection will be 3.5GB, though this only includes three games to begin with: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-gamecube-games-coming-to-switch-2-via-switch-online-along-with-purchasable-gamecube-inspired-controller">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Soul Calibur 2, and F-Zero GX</a>. This suggests each new game added to the collection will likely be just over 1GB each.</p>
<p>Then there are the upgraded Switch games for the new console: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> will total 7.7GB, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> will be 5.7GB.</p>
<p>Nintendo is known for keeping its game sizes relatively low, which at least means it will be a while until an expansion of the internal storage is required.</p>
<p>This will be through <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-best-micro-sd-express-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2">microSD Express cards</a>, as explained in the Direct, which offer high speed data transfer. However, it does mean microSD cards used in the original Switch won't be compatible, so is an extra cost to consider.</p>
<p>What's more, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-switch-2-actually-cheaper-than-the-original-console-cost-in-the-uk-and-whats-the-situation-with-switch-2-pricing-globally">physical games will be more expensive than digital</a>, which feels like a push from Nintendo towards a digital future. Ultimately, that's going to require more storage space.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-has-10x-the-graphics-performance-of-the-nintendo-switch-claims-nvidia">Nvidia has also detailed the tech specs of the new console</a>, claiming it has "10x the graphics performance" of the original Switch. It also supports DLSS for AI-enhanced upscaling - perhaps another reason for the relatively low game sizes.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
