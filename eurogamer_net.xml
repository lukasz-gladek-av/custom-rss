            <p>People Can Fly is working with The Coalition on the next Gears of War game, Gears of War: E-Day.</p>
<p>In a brief statement today, People Can Fly said it was "honoured" to return to the world of Gears of War after it was lead developer on Judgment and co-developer on Gears of War 1, 2, and 3.</p>

<p>"Returning to collaborate on the next chapter of this legendary saga is both a privilege and an exciting opportunity to build upon the intense, visceral action and rich storytelling that fans have come to love. We are deeply grateful for our partners' trust and support on this journey," said PCF's CEO, Sebastian Wojciechowski.</p><p>"Gears of War: E-Day is not just our next major game; it's a return to what makes Gears of War games special and authentic," Coalition studio head Mike Crump added. "We're pleased to be partnering with the talented folks at People Can Fly who have been a part of our franchise's legacy for so long."</p>
<p>Late last year, we learned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-is-so-back-as-original-voice-talents-are-confirmed-for-gears-of-war-e-day">John DiMiaggio and Carlos Ferro are reprising their roles as Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago</a> in Gears of War: E-Day.</p>
<p>The announcement - which was posted to the official Gears of War X account on the 18th anniversary of the third-person shooter series last November - also appended a photo of DiMaggio and Ferro reunited.</p>
<p>Gears of War 6's development <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-gears-of-war-game-in-the-works-according-to-new-job-listings">hadn't been much of a secret</a>, but it was finally made official in June, with confirmation that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marcus-fenix-returns-in-gears-of-war-prequel-e-day">Gears 6 will be a prequel titled Gears of War: E-Day</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a> and Brothers developer Hazelight has given us a fresh peek at the studio's next co-op game, Split Fiction, including a look at its Side Stories.</p>
<p>First revealed during the The Game Awards last year, today's trailer now pops some off its focus on these "optional one-off adventures", which are nestled within the different levels of Split Fiction's main story.</p>
<p>This optional content is accessed via portals which Mio and Zoe can hop through, and includes moments where you can surf through a desert on the back of a giant sandfish or water ski behind a train. You know, as you do. In the words of studio founder Josef Fares, "this is side content you don't want to miss". You can check out the latest Split Fiction trailer below.</p>

<figcaption>Here's another look at Split Fiction, the upcoming coop game from the studio that bought us It Takes Two. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TlySOphMuo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Side Stories are anomalies that occur as a consequence of Mio and Zoe being stuck in the same simulation," <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/news/an-introduction-to-side-stories">Hazelight furthered in a blog post</a>. "These portals are attempts by the simulation to steal unfinished stories and ideas that Mio and Zoe wrote when they were younger, leading to some truly weird, wonderful, and chaotic situations.</p><p>
"As these stories have been deeply influenced by our authors' pasts, they will experience long since forgotten ideas and secrets about themselves. Once a Side Story has been completed, our characters return back through the portal to the main level where they first entered the encounter, filled with even greater determination to escape from Rader’s machine with their memories and stories intact… so, going back to our original question, are you up to the challenge?"</p>

<p>Split Fiction was first teased by Hazelight in 2024, with a mysterious image showing a stack of papers and a collection of post-it notes. Josef Fares then teased the game was "a BRAND NEW IP called S*** ******N", which as we all now know is Split Fiction (alas, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-takes-two-developer-teases-next-project-s-n">not Sexy Bassoon</a>).</p>
<p>Split Fiction is set to arrive on 6th March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/self-proclaimed-cocky-man-josef-fares-debuts-all-new-coop-adventure-split-fiction-with-kick-ass-dragons-and-more">across PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
