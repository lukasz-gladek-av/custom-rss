Stop Destroying Videogames - the European campaign inspired by the Stop Killing Games movement - says it's "confident" its petition will progress to the legislative phase now that 15 EU countries have successfully verified almost half of its 1.4m signatures between them.
</p>
<p>
Stop Destroying Videogames is looking to convince the EU to pass regulations preventing "the remote disabling of video games by the publishers, before providing reasonable means to continue functioning of said video games without the involvement from the side of the publisher." Its European Citizens' Initiative - an official EU mechanism designed to provide a way for citizens to propose a legal act to the European Commission - surpassed the required 1m signatures before the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/eci">petition</a> closed in July, meaning it can be presented to the EU for either a public hearing or full debate session at the European Parliament provided those signatures can be successfully verified.
</p>
<p>
Writing in September, Stop Destroying Videogames said it expected the verification process to take around three months, and it's now shared a progress report in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/comments/1og0kb3/stop_killing_games_announcement/">new post to the Stop Killing Games campaign's subreddit</a>. "Out of 1,448,270 signatures, 689,035 are already verified, and 15 countries have met their thresholds," petition organisers explained. "We are still missing the two largest countries - Germany and France - but based on our current progress, we are confident we have surpassed the required thresholds." They added only about 3 percent of signatures have failed verification so far.
</p>
<p>
According to the update, Stop Destroying Videogames organisers have been engaged in "intense discussions" with Members of the European Parliament, national governments, political parties, and the European Commission throughout the verification process, ready for the legislative phase. It's also been working to secure expert backing from academics, explaining, "Having politicians, lobbyists, and developers in our ranks is invaluable, but we must credibly address the tough questions." Organisers <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-stop-destroying-videogames-petition-verification-continues-in-eu-organisers-preparing-to-counter-misinformation-and-industry-lobbying">previously said</a> they were taking steps to counter "misinformation and industry lobbying".
</p><p>
"Our fight is not against a united CEO front," the update continues. "It's against a handful of companies holding our favourite games hostage... Let's not just talk about developers but with them, big and small, who are already resisting these awful practices. We can't undo past damage, but we can stop what's coming. If we allow these few bad actors to dictate the future, we will continue to lose ground on issues that should never have arisen."
</p>
<p>
Stop Destroying Videogames' update concludes with a call for EU citizens to reach out to their governments, local consumer protection groups, and favourite studios in order to spread the word. It also encourages developers to make their voices heard. "We are already in talks with many in the industry," it explains. "If weâ€™ve missed you... please reach out to us... We are planning public events and want to bring some of you in front of parliament to demonstrate how things could be."
</p>
<p>In July, EU industry body Video Games Europe - whose members include Ubisoft, Take-Two, Warner Bros., Riot Games, Activision Blizzard, Microsoft, and Nintendo - insisted the initiative's proposals <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-proposals-for-game-preservation-prohibitively-expensive-major-publishers-insist">would make games "prohibitively expensive to create"</a>.</p>

            <p>The US government's use of AI-generated Halo imagery on social media has absolutely been a power-play to appeal to like-minded American gamers.</p>
<p>As if there were any doubt, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/exclusive-white-142217261?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link">White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai told journalist Alyssa Mercante</a> overnight: "Yet another war ended under President Trump's watch - only one leader is fully committed to giving power to the players, and that leader is Donald J. Trump. That's why he's hugely popular with the American people and American Gamers."</p>
<p>Desai's comments were made in relation to <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1982819431894901043">an image tweeted by the Department of Homeland Security</a>, which showed a picture of a Halo ring world and two spartan soldiers in a Warthog jeep - one driving it and the other on top of it, operating the machine-gun turret. The soldiers appear below the words "Destroy the Flood" and a call to join the Immigration Customs Enforcement group, ICE.</p>
<p>The Flood are the primary antagonists in the Halo franchise - a parasitic lifeform which overran the galaxy. The reference here in the ICE promotional image, then, is depressingly clear: the Flood represents the immigrants ICE seeks to forcefully detain.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>The US government's use of AI-generated Halo imagery started at the weekend, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-mascot-and-long-time-microsoft-exclusive-halo-is-coming-to-ps5-for-the-very-first-time-this-is-halo-for-everyone">Microsoft announced a remake of the Halo: Combat Evolved campaign</a> will be coming to PC, Xbox and - for the first time - PlayStation. In response, <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982213786221109263">US games retailer GameStop posted a memey statement declaring the console wars dead</a> - the inference being that now Halo, the series that epitomised the rivalry between Xbox and PlayStation, was heading to Sony's machine, the console wars were effectively over.</p><p>The White House X account responded to this <a href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1982638578913206632">with an AI-generated image of Donald Trump as Master Chief</a>, holding a blue energy sword and saluting in front of an American flag, which doesn't have the correct amount of state-stars on it. "Power to the Players," the tweet read.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982654845166428607">GameStop replied with another AI-generated Halo image</a> showing Trump's face in Master Chief's helmet, and holographic AI companion Cortana as Vice President JD Vance nearby. GameStop hasn't tweeted since.</p>
<p>All eyes now are on Microsoft and whether it will do anything about the unsanctioned use of AI-generated Halo imagery to promote political causes such as this. Microsoft has not commented on the matter and I expect never will, though I've asked through official channels all the same.</p>
<p>However, we can find depressing precedent in the recent lack of action (or effect) by Nintendo's legal team to do anything about the US Department of Homeland Security using imagery and music from PokÃ©mon to promote ICE causes. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-pokemon-company-confirms-that-no-its-imagery-was-not-granted-for-use-in-disturbing-us-department-of-homeland-security-video">The PokÃ©mon Company even publicly confirmed it had not sanctioned the use of PokÃ©mon  assets in this way</a>, further underlining its apparent powerlessness to change the situation.</p><p>That, then, is what I expect this latest Halo-related display is: another power-play. Another demonstration that as unsanctioned and abhorrent as the use of the Halo imagery is, and enormously powerful as Microsoft is, it probably won't be able to force the US government to take it down.</p>
