            <p>Hideki Kamiya is still interested in developing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/scalebound">Scalebound</a>, after the PlatinumGames and Microsoft action game was cancelled back in 2017.</p>
<p>Kamiya has now founded a new studio, Clovers, and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-announcement-had-hideki-kamiya-crying-with-the-fans">developing a sequel to Okami</a>. A new post on the Clovers account includes a video showing "some excitement around Kamiya's desk".</p>
<p>"He was reminiscing about the development of Scalebound while watching YouTube videos," reads the post. "It never made it to release, but even now, he still feels proud of it."</p>

<p>Kamiya is quoted as saying: "I'd love to make it again someday.ðŸ˜Š"</p>
<p>He also shared the video on his own social media account, adding: "Let's do it, Phil!"</p>
<p>Scalebound was planned to be an action game with a human protagonist in a fantasy world, with a sidekick dragon.</p>
<p>"He's got his own headphones and smartphone," Kamiya says in the video.</p>
<p>"Just like an isekai reincarnation," a developer responds, referring to the trend in Japanese anime for stories about characters being transported to other worlds (think Spirited Away).</p>
<p>"Yeah, exactly! That's the big trend right now," replies Kamiya.</p> <div>

<p>After more than four years of development, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sources-microsoft-and-platinum-part-ways-on-scalebound-development-ceased">Xbox One exclusive game was cancelled</a> and Microsoft and PlatinumGames parted ways on the project.</p>
<p>That's not the last we've heard of the game, though. In 2021 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sources-microsoft-and-platinum-part-ways-on-scalebound-development-ceased">Kamiya publicly apologised to Microsoft for Scalebound's cancellation</a>, after discussing the development challenges and admitting: "We weren't experienced enough."</p>
<p>Then in 2022, Platinum president Atsushi Inaba revealed in an interview with IGN <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platinumgames-would-love-to-resurrect-scalebound-and-wants-to-discuss-it-with-microsoft-properly">Kamiya had been "talking about wanting to work on Scalebound again for a while"</a>. Kamiya himself added: "I'd like to appeal to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> directly! Let's do it, Phil!"</p>
<p>It seems Kamiya is once again trying that tactic to appeal to Xbox boss Phil Spencer. Will it work this time? Is Kamiya now free to resurrect Scalebound with Clovers?</p>
<p>Or maybe he's just jealous that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ninja-gaiden-4s-two-protagonists-will-honour-the-series-legacy">PlatinumGames is working with Team Ninja on Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, with the backing of Spencer. Can Phil work his magic this time?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-accused-of-ai-slop-yet-again-this-time-for-new-guitar-hero<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Call of Duty publisher Activision has been blasted over its use of cheap AI once again, this time for a clearly-generated piece of artwork designed to announce a new Guitar Hero game for smartphones.
</p>
<p>
You'd think that the announcement of a new entry in the legendary Guitar Hero series would be worth... I don't know, paying an artist to put something original together.
</p>
<p>
Instead, the first announcement of Guitar Hero Mobile, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGn9-qkAR3F/">posted to Activision's Instagram</a>, comes with its logo splashed over some weird AI backdrop, where four suspiciously-similar silhouettes hold red guitars in identical poses surrounded by towers of amps that look like washing machines. 
</p>
<p>
But clearly this is fine now, apparently, because it's only been a week since Activision admitted it had begun using cheap-looking AI artwork for its flagship Call of Duty franchise. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-admits-call-of-duty-includes-generative-ai">Players spotted a note from Activision confirming Call of Duty "uses generative AI tools to help develop some in-game assets"</a> that was belatedly added to the Steam page for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a>.
</p>
<p>
As well as AI-generated in-game calling card 2D art assets, Black Ops 6 promotional artwork used last Christmas featured a Santa Claus zombie with six fingers. Maybe they should get him in Guitar Hero, he might be pretty good at it.

Response to Activision's new Guitar Hero Mobile ad is as you'd expect. 
</p>
<p>
"AI Hero looks awesome ðŸ”¥" reads one comment. 
</p>
<p>
"I was actually excited, but then I saw the cover it's made out of AI, so I won't touch this, sorry," wrote another. 
</p>
<p>
"Ruin my fav game with AI slop," said a third, "I hope Activision falls over dude."
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, Microsoft unveiled its new Muse AI tool designed to aid "gameplay ideation" and the preservation of older video games, supposedly - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-generative-ai-model-muse-isnt-creating-games-and-its-certainly-not-going-to-solve-game-preservation-expert-says">a claim one expert branded as "idiotic"</a>.
