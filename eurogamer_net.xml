            <p>A video has been released by the US Department of Homeland Security promoting ICE, set to the Pokémon theme from the '90s anime.</p>
<p>The video, posted to social media yesterday, includes disturbing footage of people being arrested by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) alongside imagery from the Pokémon anime and its theme song, as if protagonist Ash Ketchum is involved.</p>
<p>Shared with the caption "Gotta Catch 'Em All", the video ends with Pokémon card-style graphics featuring criminals arrested for crimes such as murder, pedophilia, and human smuggling. Each has a weakness to ice.</p> <div>

<p>ICE has received increased funding as part of President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed into law back in July. It's intended to conduct criminal investigations, enforce immigration laws, and preserve national security, but has been criticised for using excessive force.</p>
<p>The post has been rapidly responded to with calls for Nintendo to sue for copyright infringement.</p>
<p>The Japanese games company is known for being particularly litigious, but is yet to comment on the video.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted both The Pokémon Company and Nintendo for a response.</p>
