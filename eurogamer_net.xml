            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> has had its early access release date pushed back until December.</p>
<p>Grinding Gear Games' take on Diablo was expected to release this November. However, due to some "server-side infrastructure work" that still needs sorting out, Path of Exile 2 will now be released in December.</p>
<p>"I'm really sorry about this one. People plan time off and things like that around our launches, but we just have to do it," Path of Exile 2 game director Jonathan Rogers said in a video announcing the delay.</p>

<p>Path of Exile 2 itself is in good shape, the director stated, though to ensure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mercenary-class-unveiled-for-path-of-exile-2-and-it-plays-like-shooter">microtransactions work seamlessly across both Path of Exile and the sequel</a>, a little more time is needed.</p>
<p>"We have to integrate the account systems for not only <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile">Path of Exile</a> 1 and 2, but also for the console realms as well," Rogers explained. "This meant changing a lot of things. Not only do we have to create a bunch of new systems, we have to make sure that all the old data is backwards compatible with them as well."</p><p>The Path of Exile 2 team wants to ensure everything is "perfect" on the game's early access launch, Rogers continued, so "nobody loses anything they paid for and nobody has their account broken". This means "a lot of load testing to make sure the whole thing doesn't fall over" on Path of Exile 2's debut, he added, as Grinding Gear is expecting a "huge number" of players.</p>
<p>Rogers admitted things had been left too late to get everything up to snuff for Path of Exile 2's November release date. "I'm really sorry," he apologised again, "this one really hurts".</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 will now be released in early access on 6th December. Ahead of this, the developer plans to host a live stream in roughly four weeks time, with an exact date still to be confirmed. Rogers promised the team will share more on what kind of content players can expect on Path of Exile 2's launch during this stream.</p>
<p>"Until then, thank you very much for your support," Rogers concluded.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/niantic">Niantic</a> has announced changes to its big new Gigantamax battles feature, in response to this weekend's initial launch.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-launches-gigantamax-raids-to-mixed-response-as-developer-bans-countless-players-by-accident">Fan feedback to Gigantamax has been decidedly mixed</a>, as Eurogamer reported yesterday, with concerns over the difficulty level of being able to beat the skyscraper-high monsters, and the ease of then actually catching one afterwards.
</p>
<p>
Niantic has responded swiftly, and in a statement to Eurogamer last night a company spokesperson detailed a number of changes for the game's next set of Gigantamax raids this weekend, against Gigantamax Gengar. 
</p>
<p>
Most notably, the difficulty of Gigantamax Gengar will be lowered "slightly", to make the battle easier when compared to other Gigantamax battles. 
</p>
<p>
"While we want Gigantamax to be the new high bar for a meaningful challenge in Pokémon Go, we want to make sure that players have a reasonable chance to defeat Gengar," a Niantic spokesperson told Eurogamer. "You'll still need to strategise and coordinate with your group and go in powered up to a degree, but we think this tuning will make things slightly easier to help a range of Trainers jump into Gigantamax."
</p><p>
Here, Niantic seems to agree with a common complaint I heard this past weekend - that the feature could have benefited from giving players more of a leg-up to get started. Once you have your first Gigantamax Pokémon (and after a battle or two to learn the ropes), the whole thing becomes easier. 
</p>
<p>
Other changes to Gigantamax Gengar include a bonus 25k Stardust reward for beating the boss, and an improved capture rate for snagging it afterwards.
</p>
<p>
"We want players to feel rewarded for accomplishing such a huge feat, and right now the catch rate didn't match the experience we wanted," a Niantic spokesperson said. "We'll be increasing this for Gengar and will continue to monitor other Gigantamax encounters."
</p>
<p>
There's no changes to the game's Max Particle limit, which effectively caps the amount of Gigantamax raids you can complete at two without purchasing more of the currency from Pokémon Go's shop. And there's certainly no suggestion you will be able to complete Gigantamax Gengar battles without still forming a large group of players.
</p><p>
Also, it's worth highlighting that these changes are specifically for Gigantamax Gengar this weekend, in a manner that suggests Niantic realises it needs to throw the game's community something of a bone to encourage participation in the feature once again. 
</p>
<p>
Could these changes stick? "Other Gmax encounters are unaffected for now," a Niantic spokesperson said, "but we MAY make changes to them in the future."

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> is finally here, and lots of people are liking it. And one person liking it very publicly is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian's outspoken director of publishing, Michael Douse - who's been praising BioWare's new RPG, calling it, among other things, "the first Dragon Age game that truly knows what it wants to be."
</p>
<p>
Douse isn't one to shy away from sharing his opinions on social media, of course, having recently fired shots at Ubisoft following <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a>'s underperformance, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-director-of-publishing-calls-out-baldurs-gate-3-ce-scalpers-for-making-people-sad">called out scalpers</a> for "making [people] sad", and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-boss-blasts-publisher-greed-behind-layoffs">spoken candidly</a> about the games industry's current layoff culture, noting, "None of these companies are at risk of going bankrupt... they're just at risk of pissing off the shareholders." But following the launch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Douse is singing a rather more positive tune.
</p>
<p>
"I've been playing Dragon Age: The Veilguard in complete secrecy (behind my backpack at the office in front of a giant window, in the kitchen)," he <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1850949592667590700">wrote on X</a>. "From me, you may be wondering, 'Is this a game compatible with my experience during BG3' so I'll tackle it from that perspective. The answer is yes. It is to a heavy, nine-season-long show what a well-made, character driven, binge-worthy <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> series is. It has a good sense of propulsion and forward momentum. The combat system is honestly brilliant (to me, a mix of Xenoblade and Hogwarts which is giga-brain genius). It knows when it needs a tentpole narrative moment, and it knows when to let you toy around with your class and exploit some of its stronger elements."

<p>
"More important," Douse added, "to me, it feels like the first Dragon Age game that truly knows what it wants to be... If you want some character-driven romping with a strong combat system in a universe you know, love, or have heard of, it is much better than the average action game, and much less heavy than the gargantuan RPGs that may intimidate at times. In a word, it's fun!"
</p><p>
"I'll always be a [<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age: Origins</a>] guy," Douse continued in a <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1850951012053295168">follow-up post</a>, "and this is not that. But at least it's something it wants to be, and not a mishmash of everything. I respect that. I like action games, like RPGs, I like it when they collide. I like shooting baddies with mage magic. Your mileage may vary!"
</p>
<p>
It's a positive outlook on The Veilguard shared by Eurogamer's Robert Purchese, who slapped Dragon Age's latest outing with five shiny gold stars in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">his enthusisatic review</a>. "What BioWare has managed to accomplish here," he wrote, "in the face of all the pressure it's faced since Dragon Age: Inquisition came out 10 years ago, is extraordinary. From head to toe, wing to wing, The Veilguard is exquisitely realised and full of sophistication across systems and storytelling. It's warm and welcoming, funny and hopeful, gentle when it needs to be, and of course it's epic - epic in a way I think will set a high bar not only for BioWare in years to come but for role-playing games in general. This is among the very best of them."
</p>
<p>
But back to Douse for one last observation: "I'm extremely happy BioWare gets to stick around - presumably - in these uncertain (because of moronic corporate greed) times," he concluded. "[The Veilguard is] an existential game, and a fun one at that."

            <p>
Almost exactly a year since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-reportedly-delays-destiny-2s-final-shape-expansion-and-marathon">it was reported</a> Bungie had delayed its sci-fi extraction shooter Marathon into 2025, the studio has released a gameplay free developer update saying the game is "on track", albeit a "little early to show" - and that it'll "reveal a lot more" next year.
</p>
<p>
The news comes via a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8WgMQuPwRE">nine-minute developer video</a> presented by Marathon game director Joe Ziegler, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-gets-new-director-as-part-of-creative-leadership-shakeup">took over the role</a> from former project lead Chris Barrett earlier this year, after the latter was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-former-marathon-reboot-director-chris-barrett-reportedly-ousted-following-inappropriate-behaviour">reportedly ousted from Bungie due to inappropriate behaviour</a>.
</p>
<p>
In his update, Ziegler began with a brief overview of Bungie's Marathon reboot, outlining the extraction shooter's basic loop (complete quests, find loot to upgrade abilities, then get it out of the extraction zone to keep it), alongside a few other gameplay details. Playable Runners, for instance, are each said to have a "small subset" of abilities that can be further customised with gear, depending on what players want to achieve. That's alongside promises of "lots of tools, "lots of objectives" and lots of ways an individual run can unfold.

<p>
Ziegler also touched on Marathon's connection to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungies-original-sci-fi-shooter-marathon-hits-steam-for-free">Bungie's 90s sci-fi shooter series of the same name</a>, saying the reboot uses a lot of "familiar elements" from the original - including the "mysteries, eeriness, and psychological creepiness" - then layers on elements that help "modernise" it, such as a new story and world Bungie can continue to update.
</p><p>
In terms of progress, Zeigler explained there'd been a "lot of aggressive changes to the game" over the last few years, and that Bungie has been "iterating pretty heavily". As such, there are a "variety of different things in different states" right now; environments, for instance, are said to be "coming together in a really beautiful way", while character models are "coming together but not fully there yet", and enemy models are still "kind of a little bit in an early state".
</p>
<p>
"It's a little early to show you all of it as one piece," Ziegler said, "but all of these things are on-track. They're not all together but when they all do come together, we really are looking forward to showing you what that looks like, especially in play." But while Bungie isn't yet ready to show any gameplay, Ziegler did share a couple of bits of concept art, one showing a Runner with the codename Thief, and another "deception" based character called Stealth.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
And while Bungie has nothing else to show right now, it plans to "reveal a lot more... in the midst of 2025". Next year will also see the studio expand its playtesting, with Ziegler revealing the team wants to add a "significant amount of players to each of our milestones as we're going forward". The studio will let the community know "when that happens".
</p><p>
"The interest that you've shown engaging with all the content we've created... really fuels us on a daily basis," Ziegler concluded in his video update. "We're excited to engage with you more in 2025 and beyond as we bring this game to all of you to play."
</p>
<p>
Today's update is the first time Bungie has talked about Marathon in any real detail since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-returns-to-its-roots-with-a-pvp-twist-on-classic-fps-series-marathon">unveiling the project in 2023</a>, and the first promotional push since the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">laid off 220 staff</a> - roughly 17 percent of its workforce - back in July.
