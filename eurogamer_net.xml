            <p>A Skibidi Toilet bundle is now available in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, if you're keen to flush away your V-Bucks.</p>
<p>The bundle, priced at 2,900 V-Bucks but currently discounted to 2,200, includes Skibidi Toilet back bling, a Plungerman outfit, and his plunger as a pickaxe.</p>
<p>News of the bundle leaked earlier this week, with the <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1869050071574024652">official Fortnite account then teasing its inclusion</a> with some easily deciphered emojis. Now it's officially available in the item shop.</p>

<p>For the unaware, Skibidi Toilet is an animated web series created by Alexey Gerasimov on his YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DaFuqBoom">DaFuq!?Boom!</a>. The series is known for its absurd humour and its creation in Garry's Mod using assets from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> and Counter-Strike.</p>
<p>The series has since become a popular meme, which Epic is now leaning into with this addition to Fortnite. I guess anything goes these days.</p>

<p>The bundle has received a mixed response on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/">FortNiteBR reddit</a>, from surprise to horror, but mainly more memes.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has quietly released a new game based on its Captain Laserhawk animated series, which features beloved mascot Rayman and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a>.</p>
<p>Captain Laserhawk: The G.A.M.E., as spotted by Game File's Stephen Totilo (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/500114/ubisoft-nft-game-captain-laserhawk-game-file">Polygon</a>), is a PC top-down multiplayer shooter that uses cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Though it's technically in early access, Totilo described it as "the most basic top-down shooter imaginable".</p>
<p>Players require an NFT Niji Warrior ID card to play, which itself requires a crypto wallet to purchase (the NFT costs $25.63).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-wild-far-cry-blood-dragon-anime-captain-laserhawk-welcomes-rayman-in-new-trailer">Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix</a> was created by Ubisoft for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> and released last year. It's based on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-3-review">Far Cry 3</a> spin-off Blood Dragon and features multiple characters from across Ubisoft's games, including Rayman.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://edenonline.ubisoft.com/faq">FAQ</a> for this game based on the series, it's a "transmedia gaming adventure where the community drives the narrative through innovative governance".</p>
<p>It continues: "Eden Online is the layer which gives power to the community when it comes to decision making for the game updates each season.</p>
<p>"Eligibility to play the game in early access will be reflected by ownership of a Citizen ID Card. Eden Online has a limited capacity of 10,000 seats for citizenship."</p>
<p>Once an ID has been purchased, which Totilo stated is a convoluted process, it's customised with a cartoon headshot and further details to make it unique. Then, as a <a href="https://medium.com/@UBISOFT-CAPTAIN-LASERHAWK/the-niji-warrior-id-your-gateway-to-elite-gaming-privileges-in-captain-laserhawk-6fff29b24f23">Medium post</a> on the game reads, your "Niji Warrior NFT is dynamic", meaning it "evolves by capturing your in-game accomplishments, growing in uniqueness and value, and showcasing your dedication and skill".</p>
<p>You can then sell your ID as an NFT, though it's unclear why anyone would wish to.</p>
<p>Rayman, meanwhile, features as the announcer of the game's deathmatches.</p>
<p>Back in 2021, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-quartz-is-an-energy-efficient-nft-platform-for-aaa-games">Ubisoft announced Quartz</a>, its "energy-efficient" NFT platform for AAA games, though it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-appears-to-have-sold-a-grand-total-of-15-nfts">didn't appear to be a success</a>.</p>
<p>Despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-to-continue-with-nft-platform-quartz-despite-criticism">criticism</a>, Ubisoft has ploughed on. Back in October this year it quietly released its first-ever blockchain game,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-first-ever-blockchain-game-with-nfts-costing-up-to-50k"> tactical NFT battler Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles</a> where players purchase NFT figurines to battle using cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Now it's added Captain Laserhawk: The G.A.M.E. to its growing NFT portfolio.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
