            <p>The CEO of Saber Interactive has some pretty damning words to say about 2022's poorly-received Saints Row reboot, and its developer Volition.</p>
<p>As part of an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/saber-embracer-savvy-games-space-marine-russia">Game File</a> (paywalled), Saber's Matt Karch spoke about studio closures and layoffs. Volition, you may recall, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-studio-volition-has-been-closed-down-effective-immediately">shuttered in 2023 as part of then-parent company Embracer Group's previously announced "restructuring" programme</a>.</p>
<p>Reflecting on this, Karch - who worked under the Embracer umbrella for a period of time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embattled-publisher-embracer-sells-off-saber-assets-withdraws-from-russia">before the sale of Saber assets</a> - stated while "it would be nice in an ideal world for everyone to have a job", the Saints Row team "were so expensive for what they were" and, therefore are "gone".</p>

<p>"They didn't know what they were building. They didn't have any real direction. It couldn't last," Karch said. "And so, who's going to fund them for the next game after that disaster?"</p>
<p>He added: "The days of throwing money at games other than maybe the GTAs of the world [are] over... It's over." Karch stated "this business needs to mature", and if it doesn't it's "in trouble".</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, that means layoffs," the Saber exec continued. "If I were running a team in California, my goal would be: 'Okay. Who are the absolutely must-haves in this group? And they exist. We have American talent [at Saber.] And who could do this for, you know, a quarter of the price in Poland?'"</p>

<p>2022's Volition-developed Saints Row reboot was met with disappointing critical and commercial reception.Following its release, Embracer admitted the game "did not meet the full expectations and left the fanbase partially polarised" in a <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q2-july-september-2022-net-sales-increased-by-190-to-sek-9569-million-35-organic-growth/">financial update</a> shared in the November of that year.</p>
<p>We called Saints Row a "snappy but slightly uneven reboot" on its release. "Volition's Saints Row reboot won't set the world alight, but there's a punchy game here with some pleasant surprises," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-2022-review-a-snappy-but-slightly-uneven-reboot">Eurogamer's Saints Row review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Soon after The Last of Us' first season aired the showrunners said when the time came for series two, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-promise-a-lot-more-infected-next-season">there would be "a lot more infected"</a>. And, well, they appear to be making good on their word. </p>
<p>Along with those infected hordes advancing upon Ellie and co in the trailers - not to mention <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-new-hbo-the-last-of-us-part-2s-trailer-is-here-and-april-cant-come-quickly-enough">Tommy using a flamethrower to toast a Bloater</a> - The Last Of Us' Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann have confirmed Stalkers will be featured in season two.</p>

<p>"All I'll say is that for the people who want to see more of the infected... Buckle up!" Mazin teased in conversation with <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-bigger-far-more-ambitious-pedro-pascal-exclusive/">Empire</a>.</p>
<p>"You get to see a different evolution of this infection," added Druckmann. "It's kept certain parts of their brain alive, so they are smarter. They coordinate and hide and do things that we've never seen any other infected do on this show."</p>

<p>And, it is not  just Stalkers that will bring a change when the second season of The Last of Us airs next month. The showrunners have confirmed spores are also making a return.</p>
<p>The Last of Us' spores are depicted as particle mists, but while a key feature in both games, the showrunners refrained from adding them to the first season of the show. Back in January 2023, it was revealed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbos-the-last-of-us-will-have-tendrils-instead-of-spores-spreading-infection">Cordyceps infection would instead be spread by "tendrils"</a> in series one.</p>
<p>In season two, however, there will be "an escalation of numbers and types of infected", as well as "an escalation of the vector of how this thing spreads" Druckmann said during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/vjLYIVh6Dwc?si=wl_qxgq7Zv7ZdL1P">SXSW 2025</a>.</p>
<p>"The reason [we're doing spores now], I mean, we really wanted to figure it out, and again, everything has to be drama. There had to be a dramatic reason of introducing it now," Druckmann said, teasing:</p>
<p>"And there is."</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>Spores could be spotted in the most recent trailer for The Last of Us season two.  | <span>Image credit: <cite>HBO</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The second season of The Last of Us is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">set to kick off in the US on 13th April</a>, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">comprise seven episodes</a>, with one of those episodes being "quite big" in length. It remains unclear where the second season of The Last of Us will wrap up, but the showrunners have already confirmed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-discusses-series-overall-length">will not cover the entirety of Part 2's narrative</a>.</p>
<p>Returning cast members include Pedro Pascal as Joel, Bella Ramsey as Ellie, Gabriel Luna as Tommy and Rutina Wesley as Maria. New faces for season two, meanwhile, include Kaitlyn Dever as Abby and Joe Pantoliano as Eugene, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-additions-reveal-how-show-is-expanding-upon-the-game">a role that has been expanded upon from the game</a> in the style of the first season's award winning Bill and Frank episode.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-twos-abby-kaitlyn-dever-wants-to-do-this-character-justice-and-make-the-fans-proud">Dever spoke more about her role as The Last of Us' Abby</a>, stating she wants "to do this character justice and make the fans proud" on the second season's debut.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/zenless-zone-zeros-latest-update-adds-cat-testicle-jiggle-physics<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Well here's a story I wasn't expecting to write when I got up this morning: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenless-zone-zero-tier-list-best-characters">Zenless Zone Zero</a>'s notorious jiggle physics have struck again, only not like <em>that</em>. Eagle-eyed fans have discovered that, following the gacha game's latest update, its ambient cats now stroll gamely about the place with their testicles wiggling majestically from side to side.
</p>
<p>
Zenless Zone Zero's new 1.6 update - AKA Among the Forgotten Ruins - launched last week, with its <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/news/154662">various additions</a> including "enhancements to pedestrian behaviour in Lumina Square to make it more dynamic and diverse". Only, it turns out pedestrian behaviour wasn't the only thing that had suddenly been enhanced to become a lot more "dynamic".
</p>
<p>
Fans were surprised enough when HoYoverse decided it was going to <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/30609455">bless every in-game feline with large round testicles</a> last summer. And now the developer - which very much appears to live by the motto, "If it <em>can</em> jiggle, it <em>will</em> jiggle" (see also <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>'s Tartaglia and his quivering crotch) - has taken things to their perhaps inevitable conclusion.
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ZZZ_Official/comments/1j9as1j/they_added_jiggle_physics_to_cats_balls/">They added jiggle physics to cat’s balls 🌚</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Cold_Mundane/">u/Cold_Mundane</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ZZZ_Official/">ZZZ_Official</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

"They added jiggle physics to cat's balls", one fan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ZZZ_Official/comments/1j9as1j/they_added_jiggle_physics_to_cats_balls/">declared on Zenless Zone Zero's official subreddit</a>, before chucking in a side-eye moon-face emoji and a 22-second video highlighting the discovery by aggressively zooming in on a passing cat's independently swinging bollocks and situationally adjacent butthole. Is this really news?, you may well be asking yourself around about now. To which I respond by laughing maniacally and then evaporating into thin air.
</p>
<p>
Alongside Zenless Zone Zero's anatomical enhancements, last week's 1.6 update introduced new characters, a new area, and new events. Less positively, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-zenless-zone-zero-actors-lose-jobs-over-ai-dispute-without-notice-finding-out-alongside-players">recast two voice actors</a> - who both discovered the change when its patch notes went live.
