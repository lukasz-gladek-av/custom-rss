            <p>It seems like four seasons of HBO's The Last of Us adaptation may be on the cards.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/francesca-orsi-the-white-lotus-season-3-season-4-2025-drama-slate-1236285269/">Deadline</a>, HBO exec Francesca Orsi said the service doesn't currently have "a complete or final plan" when it comes to The Last of Us' duration, but said "it's looking like four seasons" for the adaption.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't want to confirm that, but it's looking like this season and then two more seasons after this and we're done," Orsi told the publication.</p>

</figure>
<p>This is in line with what showrunners Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin have previously suggested.</p>
<p>In August 2023, Mazin confirmed the team would need more than one season to tell The Last of Us Part 2's narrative. When asked about how many seasons of The Last of Us he expected at that time, Mazin said: "It can end up being three or five. But four seems like a good number. Some seasons, because of the story we're telling, will need fewer episodes and some will need more."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-2-trailer-teases-two-of-the-games-most-impactful-scenes">second season of The Last of Us is set to debut in April</a>, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">comprise seven episodes</a>, with one of those episodes being "quite big" in length.</p>
<p>"The story that we're telling is much bigger than the story of season one, there's just a lot more going on, it's a lot harder to produce but we want every episode to feel like its own blockbuster to be honest with you," Mazin said in June.</p>
<p>It remains unclear where the second season of The Last of Us will wrap up, however we do know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-promise-a-lot-more-infected-next-season">it will feature a lot more infected than the first season</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of season two's debut, a The Last of Us panel has been confirmed for SXSW 2025. Panelists include Craig Mazin, Neil Druckmann, Pedro Pascal, Bella Ramsey, Gabriel Luna, Kaitlyn Dever, Isabela Merced, and Young Mazino.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the showrunners revealed why <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-twos-abby-isnt-as-muscular-as-part-2s-because-it-doesnt-play-as-big-of-a-role-in-this-version">actor Kaityln Dever did not have to bulk up for her role as Abby in the upcoming second season of The Last of Us</a>, despite her counterpart in Part 2 being known for her muscular physique.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach may not have featured in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced">last night's PlayStation State of Play</a>, but news on the game is expected soon.</p>
<p>On 9th March, director <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> will speak at a special panel event on the game at South by Southwest (SXSW), sharing new details. Could we finally get a release date?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1WtK_6q2P4">YouTube stream</a> for the event is already published, with the description stating the game will arrive "exclusively on PlayStation 5 later this year". That mirrors <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-has-now-sold-75m-ps5-consoles-and-has-record-monthly-users">Sony's latest financial report</a>, which also confirms a 2025 release.</p>

<p>SXSW "celebrates the convergence of tech, film, music, education, and culture", so is a fitting setting for Kojima's next game.</p>
<p>Indeed, Kojima's brand and that of his games is enough to star in a standalone panel event, away from Sony's own State of Play.</p>
<p>Footage of the game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-officially-titled-on-the-beach-coming-2025">first shared at a Sony event</a>, though, back in January last year. This was followed by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-footage-sees-creepy-puppet-dollman-steal-the-show-in-unexpected-dance-number">Death Stranding 2 panel at the Tokyo Game Show</a> in September.</p>
<p>Since then, further details are eagerly anticipated - especially the release date.</p>
<p>Kojima has certainly been very active recently on social media, sharing posts suggesting he's busy working on a trailer for... something.</p>
<p>He also admitted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-ponders-advancing-age-and-how-long-he-can-stay-creative-as-death-stranding-studio-enters-crunch">Kojima Productions has entered "crunch time"</a>, as Death Stranding 2 nears completion.</p>
<p>"At this age, I can't help but think about how much longer I'll be able to stay 'creative'", he wrote. "I want to keep going for the rest of my life, but is it 10 more years? 20? Every day feels like I'm racing against the clock."</p>
<p>After Death Stranding 2, Kojima has the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">Microsoft-backed OD</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-making-new-metal-gear-solid-style-game-and-movie-for-playstation">Metal Gear Solid spiritual successor Physint</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Activision Blizzard staff have hit back at the eyebrow-raising claim made this week by former boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/bobby-kotick">Bobby Kotick</a> that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bobby-kotick-says-activision-blizzard-fake-lawsuits-were-simply-a-union-plan-to-drive-up-membership">the company's harassment lawsuits - and an employee petition seeking the CEO's removal - were "fake"</a>.
</p>
<p>
The high-profile ABetterABK workers group, which spearheaded much of the company's employee activism at the time, <a href="https://x.com/ABetterABK/status/1889787591056052523">responded to Eurogamer's coverage of Kotick's comments via social media last night</a> and stated that "the executives of our company did not protect us, and often made the situation worse or directly perpetuated the harm".
</p>
<p>
"The trauma, discrimination, and abuse that our coworkers and former coworkers endured is not fake or a 'plan to drive union membership'," the group stated. "Our unions were born from the very real and harmful way executives reacted when made aware of these situations."
</p>
<p>
Speaking via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo&amp;ab_channel=KleinerPerkins">Grit podcast</a>, Kotick had suggested the legal action Activision Blizzard had faced under his tenure, from multiple US government agencies, had been a "plan" by the Communication Workers of America (CWA) union to drive up membership.
</p>
<p>
"A common misinformation tactic used by companies during a union campaign is to assert that a union is a third party that comes in and makes changes," ABetterABK's statement continued. "This is not true. The workers are the union.
</p>
<p>
"We are not a third party looking for companies to prey on. We are workers with a vested interest in making our company the best it can be."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/judge-prepared-to-approve-activision-blizzards-usd18m-sexual-harassment-settlement-with-eeoc">Activision Blizzard ultimately settled</a> all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-settles-sex-discrimination-lawsuit-for-44m">of the legal action</a> - meaning payouts to staff who faced harassment at the company, and no evidence of systemic patterns of employee abuse ever proven in court.
</p>
<p>
Valentine Powell, a former senior UI engineer who led several employee walkouts, additionally responded with a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/valentineirl.bsky.social/post/3lhziyzv2oo2j">lengthy social media thread</a> commenting on Kotick's comments, and sharing their perspective on life at the company.
</p>
<p>
"During my time at Blizzard I was loud and I was vocal about the issues facing our company, I helped spearhead multiple initiatives to remove systemic tools of harm, and I worked with the newly hired DE&amp;I crew to help form several ERGs, set up our first attendance at Pride, and the Inclusion Nexus," Powell wrote.
</p>
<p>
"There were money barriers, there were political barriers, there were bad actors, basically we were only allowed to make small changes, and most of us knew we needed large ones. One of my first forrays into collective bargaining at Blizzard was the salary spreadsheet.
</p>
<p>
"This was years before unionisation was ever discussed," Powell continued. "We gathered a list of about 50 ways people wanted to improve salary and promotions, and refined that list down to 10 bullets with the help of over 100 employees across Blizzard. We presented our list, and were told by leadership 'no'.
</p>
<p>
"We didn't discuss unionisation as a team until months after our first walkouts. We wanted to try to bring light to what was happening and try to fix it ourselves if we could. The first two walkouts were entirely employee run. It was terrifying and amazing and beautiful.
</p>
<p>
"After a couple months of us being loud, Activision Blizzard stopped being nice about it, especially Kotick. I was The One who started the petition to remove Bobby Kotick as CEO. I was the first name on the list, and that petition had nothing to do with CWA."
</p>
<p>
Powell concluded by noting that the CWA had offered support regardless of whether staff were part of the union or not - or whether they would ever join.
</p>
<p>
"Bobby Kotick is trying to paint a false narrative, but its unsurprising," Powell wrote, "he refused to listen to us for years when we tried to handle this stuff without unionisation, and only listened once we actually started unionising."
</p>
<p>
In the same interview, Kotick claimed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-activision-blizzard-takeover-sparked-by-both-companies-failing-to-buy-tiktok-kotick-says">Microsoft's Activision Blizzard takeover was sparked by both companies failing to buy TikTok</a>.

            <p>Sales of Sony's PS5 console have now reached 75m units, which is just shy of PS4 sales after an equivalent period.</p>
<p>By the end of the previous quarter, PS5 sales had passed 65m. Now, in the latest quarter (ending 31st December 2024), Sony has sold a further 9.5m consoles - the console's best ever quarter.</p>
<p>Overall sales of games and consoles have increased by 16 percent year-on-year, with profits similarly increasing by 37 percent.</p>

<p>Sony attributes these increases to an increase in available units, a boost in non-first-party games (and DLC), and an increase in sales from network services.</p>
<p>The number of monthly active users on PlayStation Network was 129m in the last quarter - that's a record high, and a 43 percent increase from December 2017.</p>
<p>What's more, 42 percent of PS5 purchasers in the last quarter were new PlayStation Network users, thereby showing an increase in the overall userbase.</p>
<p>PS Plus revenue also increased by 20 percent year-on-year, which the company attributed to users moving to higher tiers. Digital game sales have also increased: 74 percent of game sales this year, compared with 66 percent last year.</p>
<p>Sony also released the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> in this last quarter, and while it hasn't separated console sales in this report, this has likely contributed to the boost in hardware sales.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> was a strong release for Sony in this last quarter - it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-console-sales-top-65m-as-astro-bot-sells-15m-copies-in-first-month">previously stated 1.5m sales in its first month</a>. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> has also been an ongoing success for Sony in 2024. That compares to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> in 2023's equivalent period as the company's most prominent release.</p>
<p>Lastly, Sony confirmed that both Ghost of Yotei and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On the Beach are still on schedule to release this year. Neither game showed up in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced">last night's PlayStation State of Play</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
