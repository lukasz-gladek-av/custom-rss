            <p>Nintendo has announced a Direct, which is set for tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Direct will take place on 31st July, at 2pm UK time. It will be roughly 25 minutes long, and include information about games from Nintendo's publishing partners. This will include titles coming to both Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.</p>

<p>So, what can we either hope for or expect from tomorrow's broadcast? Well, we could always start prepping our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> Silksong summoning circles once again. It has to show up some time soon… right? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-has-laid-out-its-gamescom-plans-and-they-include-a-playable-demo-of-hollow-knight-silksong">Xbox has a playable demo for Silksong at Gamescom this year</a>, but we know that Team Cherry's sought after Metroidvania is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-both-switch-consoles">also primed for both Switch consoles</a>, so it could happen…</p>
<p>Personally, I would also love to hear or see more from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/professor-laytons-new-adventure-turns-him-into-lukes-protege">Level-5's Professor Layton and the New World of Steam</a>. This chap was first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-1">announced during a Nintendo Direct back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, we could perhaps hear about a release date for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> on Switch 2. FromSoftware's incredibly successful game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">announced for Switch 2 back in April</a>, though with no date attached to it. The edition coming to Switch 2 will be the Elden Ring Tarnished Edition, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">which includes the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC</a>, as well as new armour and a new Torrent appearance customisation feature. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-to-include-two-new-classes">Two new classes are also on the way as part of Elden Ring's Tarnished Edition</a>.</p>
<p>We also may hear more from Supergiant Games, which in April announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-is-coming-to-switch-1-2-as-a-timed-console-exclusive">Hades 2 would be a timed console exclusive on Switch and Switch 2</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> is still in early access on PC, but the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-gets-one-final-early-access-patch-before-full-10-release">developer is gearing up for its full fat release (hopefully) very soon</a>.</p>
<p>What do you hope to see during tomorrow's Nintendo Direct?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-direct-announced-for-tomorrow-3]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sandfall Interactive has released a new update for its widely-praised turn-based RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, adding among other changes a Battle Retry prompt.</p>
<p>This has been one of the "most requested" quality of life improvements, the developer said. This new feature does exactly what it says on the tin - if faced with a defeat, players will now notice that a pop-up window appears in the game, which will allow them to give things another go.</p>
<p>This is similar to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>'s retry mechanic, which was a popular inclusion to Atlus' fantasy RPG when it was released last year. This mechanic allowed players to restart a battle without any consequences if things weren't exactly going the way they had hoped they would. If only real life came with a button like that…</p>
<p>But, I digress. Other tweaks within Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's latest update include the Pictos menu now clearly displaying the Lumina cost of each ability, which the team said will allow for "better planning".</p>
<p>Sandfall Interactive has also added separate volume sliders, which means players can now independently adjust the volume for exploration and combat phases.</p>
<p>You can check out the full patch notes for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 below:</p>
<p><strong>Performance and Visuals</strong></p>

<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 released back in April, and in May the developer revealed it had passed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-a-fitting-sales-milestone">a fitting milestone of 3.3m copies sold</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Nintendo has listened to community feedback, and with its latest <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> update has "increased the frequency" of lap-type courses appearing on the selection screen when choosing the next course in both Vs Race and wireless races.</p>
<p>Why is this especially of note? Well, back in June, Nintendo made it more difficult for Mario Kart World racers to play lap-only tracks in the game's multiplayer modes. This led to a certain amount of outcry from players, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-updates-random-online-selection-but-what-fans-really-want-is-a-classic-mode">some even going as far as to say Nintendo had "killed" online versus in Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>"They saw players clamoring for a more traditional online mode and did... the exact opposite of what they wanted," one commentator said at the time.</p>

<p>However, Nintendo evidently heard those cries, and a new update known as Ver. 1.2.0 will now increase the frequency of those more traditional Mario Kart lap-type courses in World.</p>
<p>"NINTENDO LISTENED!!!!!!!" one very enthusiastic <a href="https://x.com/ItzVCiPz/status/1950375720716222751">social media user</a> wrote following the most recent Mario Kart World update. "Did Nintendo just [save] Mario Kart World?!!!" <a href="https://x.com/Rodjr129/status/1950370313616969952">another asked</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also made Mario Kart World's homing Boomerang weaker with this update, and decreased the probability of a racer getting hold of a Triple Dash Mushroom when in a low position, "whenever the item rules in a race are anything other than 'Frantic'."</p>
<p>As well as that, the team has added a Mushrooms only option for VS races, and much more. You can check out the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world">full Mario Kart World patch notes via Nintendo here</a>.</p>
<p>If you are still on the fence about giving Mario Kart World a spin, be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-review">sure to check out Eurogamer's review</a>, where our Tom said how the game "offers neat twists on the classic Mario Kart formula", calling it all "entertaining, snackable, fun".</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Nintendo news, the company recently gave us a look at its Lego Game Boy model, which it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-taps-into-nostalgia-with-1980s-inspired-lego-game-boy-trailer">showed off with an 80s-infused trailer laced with nostalgia</a>.
