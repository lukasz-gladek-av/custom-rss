            <p>
Back in November, relaxed garden puzzle game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/botany-manor">Botany Manor</a> was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gorgeous-horticultural-puzzler-botany-manor-comes-to-playstation-in-december">announced</a> as getting a belated launch for PlayStation 4 and PS5.
</p>
<p>
An impressive indie 3D puzzling effort, Botany Manor had already shone on PC, Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X - including Xbox Game Pass - earlier in 2024. 
</p>
<p>
But in December, publisher Whitethorn Games issued an <a href="https://x.com/WhitethornGames/status/1868687621217473001">update</a> to say Botany Manor had hit a snag, and would now launch in the new year. Well, here we are - and today brings a fresh (and hopefully final) PlayStation launch date for the game: 28th January.
</p>

<p>I can wholeheartedly recommend Botany Manor, as one of the few games I actually got around to fully completing last year. You're given the keys to a National Trust-style estate that slowly opens up over time as you uncover mysteries and grow long-lost blooms through increasingly brain-teasing ways.
</p>
<p>But things never get too taxing, the game is relentlessly chilled out, and the game's gentle story offers just enough of a glimpse at life within its Victorian-era surroundings to keep you intrigued.</p>
<p>
"Perhaps an afternoon in Botany Manor's company will inflame your own curiosity for nature," Matt wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/botany-manor-review">Eurogamer's Botany Manor review</a> last year. "Or perhaps you'll simply be content to explore its sun-dabbled corners, solve its few clever puzzles, and enjoy the timeless pleasures of an enchanting summer's day stroll."

            <p>In November last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-is-officially-getting-a-tv-adaptation-at-amazon">Amazon officially announced a Mass Effect TV show</a> is in development. Now, voice actor Jennifer Hale told Eurogamer she'd love to be part of it and believes the original cast should be involved too.</p>
<p>"You will always get a yes vote from me on Shepard coming back in any form," said Hale. "That was such a gift, and it's a gift I will always be extremely joyful to receive."</p>
<p>Of course, developing such a choice-driven narrative into a singular TV series would have consequences. For starters, would Shepard be male or female?</p>

<p>"I never suppose to tell creators what to do," said Hale. "The only thing I must say about that TV series is I want to play! Any capacity, I will be there with bells on!"</p>
<p>Hale confirmed she'd prefer FemShep to be canon in the show (obviously!), but she's also keen for the rest of the game's cast to join in some capacity.</p>
<p>"I think they'd be really smart to pull as much of the original cast into the show in cameos and Easter eggs and recurring and regular [roles] as possible," she said. "I think that would be an absolutely genius move."</p><p>She continued: "The voice acting community are some of the most brilliant performers I've ever met… they're the most gifted, hard working, adept, skilled people I've ever met in my life in the acting field. So I'm ready for the smart production company that stops overlooking that gold mine. I fully volunteer to be on the show."</p>
<p>What's more, there's a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> game in development that's set to continue the story of the original trilogy, with at least <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-development-proceeding-very-well-as-bioware-issues-fresh-tease">one fan-favourite character returning</a>. But would Hale like to see Shepard also return?</p>
<p>"I have no idea [what to expect]," she said, "except I'd love to be there. That's all I'm gonna say. Hey, team, hey, team, wherever you are in any capacity, I'd love to be there!"</p>
<p>Over the weekend, BioWare project director Michael Gamble responded to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-fans-think-this-official-image-hints-that-paragonrenegade-system-is-absolutely-returning">discussion of the Paragon/Renegade morality system</a>, with many fans speculating it will return in the next game.</p>

<p>Levine discussed his time at Irrational following the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a> and how this led to him parting ways with the studio.</p>
<p>"The closure of Irrational was complicated," he said. "I felt out of my depth in the role. You're this creative person, and all of a sudden, as your vision increases of what you want to do, you have to become a manager, in a way that you don't necessarily have any training or skill in. My mental health was a mess during Infinite. I was stressed out, a lot of personal things were going on in my life at the time, and then my parents both died. I just couldn't do it any more, and I didn't think I had the team's confidence."</p>
<p>That's when he left, leaving the studio in the hands of Take-Two.</p>
<p>"So my intention was to go and say, 'Look, I just need to go start a new thing, and Irrational should continue'," he said. "That's why I didn't maintain the name Irrational. I thought they were going to continue. But it wasn't my company - I sold the company, so I worked for Take-Two, and the studio was theirs.</p><p>"The decision was made at a corporate level that they didn't think they should continue with the studio as a going concern. My feeling was that it probably would have made sense. Take-Two did a BioShock remaster - that would have been a good title for Irrational to get their head around, build a new creative director structure, and then build off of that once they had the confidence to do the next BioShock game. I don't think I was in any state to be a good leader for the team."</p>
<p>Levine described trying to make the studio closure "the least painful layoff we could possibly do", but he didn't feel comfortable leading the team when his next project would have a long period of research and development. "The problem is - and you see this problem with big studios - what do you do with 300 people when you're going to have a multiple-year R&amp;D project?" he said.</p>
<p>Still, a "good chunk" of laid off developers returned to work on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-bioshock-developer-ramping-up">yet-to-be-revealed next BioShock game</a>.</p>
<p>Levine, meanwhile, will this year release Judas with his new studio Ghost Story Games, which he previously described as being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-finally-explains-judas-narrative-lego-concept">built from "narrative Lego"</a>.</p>
<p>Levine also discussed with Edge the development of BioShock Infinite, which he pushed to make more action-oriented. That led to the Sky-Lines - something he would have developed further in a potential sequel.</p>
<p>"The problem was that the Sky-Lines were so expensive to build that we couldn't build enough space to support the feature," he said. "The team did a great job of bringing that feature to life - there was just not enough of it in the game for it to really land.</p><p>"If we had done a sequel to Infinite, I think I would have spent more time on that. That thing was built on Unreal Engine 3, which is not an outdoor engine. Sky-Lines were a lot of spit and chewing gum and prayers. Players would be surprised how much of games are put together with spit and chewing gum - even the best ones that have worked really well."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levines-judas-glimpsed-again">Judas was last seen at Sony's PlayStation State of Play this time last year</a> and is yet to receive a firm release date beyond 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Disastrous fires burning across multiple districts of Los Angeles have shut down production across Hollywood, impacting the filming of Fallout season 2 and a raft of other projects.
</p>
<p>
Five people have so far been confirmed to have died and more than 130,000 have been evacuated as the city's worst ever wildfires continue to spread.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c5y81zyp1ext">BBC News</a> reported today that the famous Sunset Boulevard now lies "in ruins", as flames approach the city's iconic Hollywood sign.
</p>
<p>
Last night, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/la-fires-halt-production-fallout-greys-anatomy-1236269978/">Variety</a> reported on the impact of the fires on LA's production industry, with all major studios suspending work. 
</p>
<p>
Amazon's Fallout season 2 had been due to film within the Santa Clarita area this week.
</p>
<p>
NBCUniversal, CBS, Disney and Warner Bros. have also shut down their studios, impacting the filming of other shows such as Hacks, Ted, Suits: LA, NCIS, Grey's Anatomy and the Jimmy Kimmel Live show.
</p>
<p>
While in most cases there is no immediate threat to the studios themselves, the LA Fire Department has revoked all filming permits due to air quality being deemed dangerous to health, and the need to keep roads open for emergency vehicles. 
</p>
<p>
This week's disaster has prompted criticism of LA's mayor Karen Bass, who recent cut the city's fire department budget, and renewed calls for a greater focus on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-were-turning-our-attention-to-gaming-and-the-climate-crisis">impacts of climate change</a>.
</p>
<p>
Production on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-filming-begins-a-lot-sooner-than-expected">Fallout's second season began in November</a>, and was due to resume this week after a filming break over Christmas. 
</p>
<p>
Fallout's first season was a huge hit when it aired last year, with more than 65 million viewers in its first 16 days - Amazon's second-biggest launch ever, behind The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. A week after its debut, Amazon quickly announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">the series would return for more episodes</a>.

            <p>
The ongoing deluge of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> leaks continues today with purported retail listings for Switch 2 MicroSD Express cards, a report that Nintendo's new console won't be compatible with the Switch 1 dock, and speculation over the new handheld's mysterious optical sensor.
</p>
<p>
Let's begin with those MicroSD Express listings, which look to be have been spotted by a GameStop employee and posted to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1hx0wge/switch_2_skus_found_in_system_today/">reddit</a>. These include Switch 2-branded MicroSD Express card variants in the already-existing <a href="https://zdcs.link/QORwmO">256GB</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5YLvk">512GB</a> sizes, which sell for around £40 and £50 respectively. 
</p>
<p>
SD Express is a newer standard for SD cards with much faster transfer speeds, enabling performance not dissimilar to SSDs. If the Switch 2 is indeed adopting this standard, it'll be interesting to see how the console performs with multiplatform games versus current gen consoles with SSD memory.
</p>
<p>
Moving on to word of compatibility with the Switch 1 dock, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-didnt-expect-this-much-media-attention-we-saw-genkis-ces-nintendo-switch-2-mockup-heres-what-they-had-to-say">IGN</a> has been told by Switch 2 accessories manufacturer Genki that Nintendo's new console won't fit the older base.
</p>
<p>
While the Switch 2 itself can physically fit within the Switch 1 dock, "indentations" in its design have been added to ensure users don't actually plug it in. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">The Verge</a> has been told by Genki CEO Eddie Tsai that the Switch 2's mysterious new optical sensor - located on its Joy-Con - could offer mouse-like functionality when paired with another attachment. The concept sounds similar to Lenovo's Legion Go handheld, which also features Joy-Con like controllers.
</p>
<p>
When paired with a base, the Legion Go controllers can stand upright and act like a vertically-aligned mouse - almost akin to a joystick. 
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
Nintendo has so far kept schtum on all of its Switch 2 plans, other than stating the new console will be backwards compatible with Switch 1 games and will be fully unveiled before 31st March. 
</p>
<p>
The company has not responded to comment on the now-rampant Switch 2 leaks - many of which have been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-leaks-turn-into-deluge-as-dummy-units-shown-at-ces">fuelled by third-party accessory manufacturers who claim to have access to the console's final design</a>.

            <p>Marvel Rivals Season 1 launches later this week and will bring significant balance changes.</p>
<p>The online hero shooter has been in Season 0 since its release last month, and despite a perceived dominance of certain characters, NetEase's analysis reveals "significant shifts in team compositions" and "a vibrant diversity of lineups".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250108/41548_1205103.html">patch notes</a> continue: "However, as the skill level escalates, compositions centered around double shields and ranged have displayed considerable prowess. Despite this, players have continuously honed and experimented with new compositions and strategies, further enriching the battlefield."</p>

<p>As such, Season 1 will bring various balance changes to ensure a "richer, more engaging, and diverse" experience, although there will be no extensive changes to Team-Up abilities - redesigns and adjustments will arrive in Season 2.</p>
<p>The new season brings nerfs to some particularly dominant characters: Hulk's Indestructible Guard shield value has been reduced; Hawkeye's medium-long range damage has been decreased; and Hela has had her base health reduced.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, Black Widow has been buffed with increased range of her ultimate ability, Namor's egg-throwing will be more accurate, and Storm has received an overall increase to her damage capability.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, NetEase has released a <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/heroes_data/">Hero Hot List</a> to show the most frequently chosen heroes across PC and console in both Quickplay and Competitive modes.</p>
<p>In Quickplay, Jeff the Land Shark tops both lists surprising nobody - he was even the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-winter-celebration-features-splatoon-esque-arcade-mode-starring-jeff-the-land-shark">star of a Splatoon-style arcade mode over Christmas</a>.</p>
<p>In Competitive mode, Luna Snow is top for PC players while Cloak &amp; Dagger is top for console players. Black Widow and Storm are the least popular, hence the incoming buffs.</p>
<p>Season 1 will be released on Friday, 10th January.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-fantastic-four-arrive-in-marvel-rivals-this-week-as-part-of-vampiric-first-season">new season will bring the Fantastic Four as playable heroes</a>, although players are concerned the design of the Invisible Woman (Sue Storm) is too similar to Dagger, making them hard to tell apart in the heat of battle. Skins will likely be used to make them stand out.</p>
