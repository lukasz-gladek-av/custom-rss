            <p>
Bethesda has opened up suggestions for improvements to its hugely-popular The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remaster, and fans have begun weighing in via reddit and Discord with their requests. 
</p>
<p>
Among the top ideas, we've seen a few come up repeatedly - and those who've played the remaster already may well be able to guess what they are.
</p>
<p>
First off, is difficulty. "There must be a difficulty level between Adept and Expert!" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/1k96i47/bethesda_is_taking_suggestions_for_oblivion/?sort=confidence">wrote WheelsOnFire</a>, to the agreement of many others who believe Adept is too straightforward, but Expert is too much of a grind.
</p>
<p>
"I'm still having moments of actually having to try at level 19 if I'm ganged up on, but for the most part my health barely goes down on Adept," another fan noted. "Even going out of my way not to over-level constitution. While expert makes even single mobs a slog at times."

<p>
"It's truly ridiculous," wrote another fan. "After a while Adept is just too easy so I've been playing on Expert and I die eight times every dungeon and go through like 30 potions it's insane."
</p>
<p>
Speaking of dungeons, there are several popular requests regarding those, too. 
</p>
<p>
"[A] cleared tag on cleared dungeons on the world map like in Skyrim!" suggested Kalameet7, to much agreement. 
</p>
<p>
"Yes, also the world map automatically zooming in to your location when you're in a dungeon instead of having to manually do it from the over land view every single time," wrote the appropriately-named ITrageGuy. We've seen many similar requests from others about this too - and hopefully it's an easy thing to fix.
</p>
<p>
Other popular quality of life changes include the ability to see weight when looting, modify your character build later in the game, bundling the game's many keys onto a keyring, and better animations for the remaster's newly-added ability to sprint. 
</p>
<p>
Fans have also asked for a couple of other more modern features - a photo mode, and the ability to call your horse. Imagine seeing that gleaming horse armour trotting towards you!
</p>
<p>
We've seen a number of fans ask Bethesda to add proper mod support, especially on consoles, similar to that found in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-say-no-official-mod-support-for-its-oblivion-remaster">Bethesda has already said it will not be officially supporting Oblivion Remastered mods</a>, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-already-almost-100-mods-for-oblivion-remake-even-without-official-support-from-bethesda">that hasn't stopped fans from quickly getting to work on PC anyway</a>.
</p>
<p>
But with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-has-clocked-up-over-4-million-players-in-less-than-5-days">huge popularity of Oblivion now, with over four million players</a> - could Bethesda change its mind?
</p>
<p>
And finally, here's one that would be fun: "Change it so when you wake up after your first sleep, you wake up in the back of the wagon at the start of Skyrim," wrote JustSomeGuyThing. You were trying to cross the border, right?

            <p>Until Dawn is the latest video game to get itself a film adaptation, having made its cinematic debut on 25th April. At the film's close, its credits acknowledge the game it is inspired by, but no individual developer credits are highlighted.</p>
<p>Now, a former PlayStation narrative director has <a href="https://www.change.org/p/credit-the-until-dawn-game-creators">started a petition</a> "for the integrity of the Until Dawn creators", which they hope will see the film's credits updated so members of the original team "may be finally honoured".</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the petition has 167 signatures.</p>

<p>"As a former Sony Interactive Entertainment and PlayStation narrative director who was firmly told that the IP I personally created would NEVER be credited to me as I was salaried (no royalties, no control, no ownership , no acknowledgement) I am struggling with the difference between [The Last of Us creator] Neil Druckmann's favour and that of others in your company," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7321943561434796033?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7321943561434796033%2C7321958047344463872%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287321958047344463872%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7321943561434796033%29">Kim MacAskill wrote on LinkedIn</a> (please note, she is <em>not</em> talking about personally being a part of Until Dawn's creation, here).</p>
<p>"I've just left Until Dawn where the film director, writers etc were all credited but instead of you mentioning the leading game dev(s) who created this ICONIC game you're clearly proud of, you just wrapped it as 'based on the Sony game'."</p>
<p>MacAskill said members of the Until Dawn team had spent "years breaking their brains to make something incredible", and therefore "the world DESERVES to know their names" in the film's credits.</p>
<p>"Why should IP creators keep working for you? Film and TV, which is grotesque at the best of times, still own the need to note the importance of credit," MacAskill closed.</p>
<p>However, while there should absolutely be credit where credit is due, MacAskill fails to acknowledge that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-creator-neil-druckmann-curious-about-how-people-will-react-to-season-2-as-elephant-in-the-room-is-dodged">Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann also works on The Last of Us TV show as a writer and director</a>. In Until Dawn's case, meanwhile, the game's writers were not approached to consult on the film, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-movie-teaser-reveals-how-its-replaced-the-games-branching-narrative">differs from the source material significantly</a>.</p>
<p>As for The Last of Us, the wider studio is credited under the banner that the show is based on the video game series.</p>

<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/movies/news/why-until-dawn-video-game-writers-arent-credited-on-the-movie/ar-AA1DD96a">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Larry Fessenden and Graham Reznick - the pair who wrote 2015's Until Dawn video game release for PlayStation - have said they weren't surprised to see their names absent from the film's credits, and weren't seeking to be included now - although a nod would have been appreciated.</p>
<p>"I didn't assume anything, but I thought somebody would have bothered to throw in our names, even during the end credits," Fessenden said. "But there's no courtesy in show biz."</p>
<p>On this lack of credit, screenwriter and Writers Guild of America (WGA) member C. Robert Cargill - whose credits include 2016's Doctor Strange - pointed out this is common practice.</p>
<p>"This is one of those situations where credit is clear, but because the Guild doesn't know who to ascribe credit [for video games] in general, they don't have a hard and fast rule about how to do that," Cargill said.</p>
<p>"Technically, the studio's abiding by Guild rules."</p>

<p>The Until Dawn adaptation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-film-wont-feature-the-same-characters-or-even-the-same-story-as-the-game-its-based-on">features both a new cast of characters and a new story</a>.</p>
<p>As for the game itself, last year's PS5 remake introduced a new ending for Until Dawn, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-remake-leak-points-to-potential-sequel">which hints towards a sequel</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>'s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Edition has been beaten by a player with early access to the company's unreleased console.
</p>
<p>
Japanese speedrunner Ikaboze recently attended one of Nintendo's Switch 2 hands-on events, held in Tokyo, and used his familiarity with the game to beat Ganon with no fancy equipment (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintendo-insider.com/japanese-speedrunner-has-beaten-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition/">Nintendo Insider</a>).
</p>
<p>
Ikaboze had just 20 minutes to complete the feat, before his alloted time with the demo expired. Using a save file from outside Hyrule Castle, Ikaboze needed less than half that time to reach the game's end credits.
</p>
<p>
Watch Ikaboze battle his way through Hyrule Castle and ditch all of his main equipment before taking on Ganon:

<p>
Breath of the Wild's Switch 2 Edition will be available alongside the new Nintendo console launch on 5th June. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/achievements-can-be-earned-in-switch-2-editions-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom">Existing owners can pay to upgrade the game in order to play this fresh version with souped up visuals and a much smoother frame-rate</a>, as well as access to a mobile app with stats and achievements. Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack members get the upgrade free, at least. 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-clarifies-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-switch-2-edition-doesnt-include-its-paid-dlc">Switch 2 Edition does not include the game's two paid expansions</a>, however - you'll still need to buy the game's £18 Expansion Pass separately.

            <p>While there's been a lot of chatter about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">since it stealth-dropped earlier in the week</a>, Oblivion isn't the only Elder Scrolls game getting some love this week - The Elder Scrolls Online has confirmed its Scribing system is coming for free to all players.</p>
<p>It's still a little way off - an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/306130/view/502823294872846628">update</a> on the official Steam page suggests we'll get it sometime in July - but the team wanted to share the news now as Scribing will be available in the Crown Store from Monday for those playing on the test server, whereas previously, it had only been available to those who owned the premium Gold Road chapter.</p>

<p>"Scribing is coming to the base game, free for all players as a claim in the Crown Store, in mid-July with an associated Golden Pursuit! You will see Scribing in the Crown Store on the PTS on Monday as part of this testing," the team announced.</p>
<p>This means the ESO is "not selling Scribing in the Crown Store", and if you missed the associated Golden Pursuit, "you will still be able to claim Scribing from the Crown Store, as this is a permanent move for it to the base game".</p>
<p>"There will be a short window from June to July with the launch of Update 46 and the Gold Road zone moving to ESO Plus and the Crown Store where players who do not currently own Scribing will not be able to purchase/gain access to it," the update concluded.</p>
<p>Not everyone's happy about the news, however, particularly as Bethesda has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/306130/eventcomments/599650845622061974?snr=1_2108_9__2107&amp;ctp=2#c599650845622072180">confirmed</a> "nothing is planned at this time" to compensate players who've previously paid to access Scribing.</p>
<p>"What about the people who paid for it originally, though?" <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/306130/eventcomments/599650845622061974?snr=1_2108_9__2107#c599650845622070777">asked</a> one player. "Is anything getting added to the chapter for us? It's been less than a year and the new chapter is already getting depreciated."</p>
<p>"I just bought this the other month, do I get a refund?" <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/306130/eventcomments/599650845622061974?snr=1_2108_9__2107&amp;ctp=2#c599650845622071201">questioned</a> another.</p>
<p>In response, a Bethesda rep said: "No, nothing is planned at this time. However, the Scribing Golden Pursuit is rewarding AND equally available to both those who have already invested time into Scribing, and first-time Scribers. In fact, those who have used Scribing over the last year may find some tasks faster and easier to complete."</p>
<p>"So, why exactly are we still paying for stuff?" <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/306130/eventcomments/599650845622061974?snr=1_2108_9__2107&amp;ctp=2#c599650845622074789">said</a> one respondent. "Suddenly, everything will be available for free to everyone. First the dungeons are stripped from ESO+, now a system goes free that's not even been part of the game for a full year.</p>
<p>"Free stuff for everyone is great (I 100% support sub classes being free), but stripping all the advantages from paying customers, there's less and less incentive to actually buy anything."</p>
<p>ICYMI, Oblivion Remastered stealth-launched just five days ago, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-has-clocked-up-over-4-million-players-in-less-than-5-days">it's already clocked up over four million players</a>. Remade by port developer Virtuos' Paris studio, in collaboration with Bethesda, this new version is a ground-up remake built in Unreal Engine 5, designed to run at 4K 60fps. Earlier today, however, we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-microsoft-store-update-accidentally-deletes-upscaling-options-from-player-settings">a Microsoft Store patch, released "for a few backend tweaks", has inadvertently impacted UI and graphical settings</a> for some players.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is selling faster on PS5 than it did on Steam and Xbox, with over 100,000 copies sold since its launch last week.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://alineaanalytics.com/blog/indiana_jones_article/">Alinea analyst Rhys Elliott</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xboxs-indiana-jones-is-selling-fastest-on-ps5-despite-releasing-months-later/">VGC</a>), who quite rightly adds the caveat that the "overwhelming majority" of Xbox players "came in via Game Pass" and therefore didn't need to "buy" the game if they were members of Xbox's subscription service.</p>

<p>That said, it's thought that in less than a week, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has sold 28 percent faster on PS5 than PC, shifting 117.2K copies on PS5 compared with Steam's 91.2K in the same timeframe.</p>
<p>Alinea posits The Great Circle has been played by around five million players on Xbox.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-features-detailed">PS5 edition gets a handful of new features over Xbox</a>, including DualSense compatibility, which gives you a visual indicator if enemies are on the lookout for Indy. Performance wise, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle "benefits from frictionless loading", as well as "selective installation that prioritises your system language, and SSD optimisation, ensuring a seamless experience with faster streaming and loading".</p>
<p>The game also included a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> enhanced label on its release, which gives users higher and more consistent framerates when playing, as well as better image clarity thanks to its native 4K resolution and advanced ray tracing.</p>
<p>We awarded Indiana Jones and the Great Circle five stars on its release. "Indiana Jones really feels like he comes full circle (sorry) in this latest adventure. At long last, there's an Indy game that nails both the puzzles and the kind of action we know so well from the films, and it does so with wit, charm, and a real eye for spectacle," Katharine Castle wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Eurogamer's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review</a>.</p>
<p>"Indiana Jones and the Great Circle makes a successful leap on to PS5 platforms and despite its delayed release, everything we loved about the Xbox experience is intact," Digital Foundry's Thomas wrote in his review of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-ps5-excellent-game-solid-port">PS5 Indiana Jones and the Great Circle port</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
