            <p>
Nintendo's delightfully quirky <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomodachi-life">Tomodachi Life</a>: Living the Dream has been given the full reveal treatment ahead of its Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> release on 16th April. And amid the fresh deluge of information, Nintendo has confirmed same-sex relationships and non-binary options, fulfilling it's promise to be "more inclusive" following controversy around the game's 3DS predecessor.
</p>
<p>
When Tomodachi Life released for 3DS back in 2013, players disappointed at the absence of same-sex romances launched a social media campaign to encourage Nintendo to add them in a post-launch update. The company's initial response was dismissive, insisting Tomodachi Life was not a "real-life simulation" nor "trying to provide social commentary." Later, however, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-refuses-to-allow-same-sex-relationships-in-tomodachi-life">took a more conciliatory tone</a>, apologising and saying that while it was unable to make such a "significant development change" to the 3DS version of Tomodachi Life, it pledged to "more inclusive" if another instalment ever came.

<p>
Over a decade later, Nintendo has made good on that promise. As revealed in today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNtYngxAs1k">30-minute-long Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Direct</a>, players can choose from three gender identities when creating their Miis in the new game - male, female, or Non-binary - plus any combination of relationship preferences from the same list, effectively making it possible to create characters who're gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, or heterosexual. And because this is Tomodachi Life, you also get to pick facial features, body shape, personality, even the silly computer-synthesised voices they'll use.
</p>
<p>
And once your Miis are ready to descend on their new island home, it largely looks like business as usual. Rather than controlling Miis directly, you'll encourage their growth by feeding them, giving them gifts, and creating new neighbours for them to interact with and befriend. And you can help introduce those friends to other friends, acting as a sort of omnipotent matchmaker to create a network of not always blissful social bonds.

<p>
Some encounters might happen while you're away from the game - perhaps your Mii will meet someone they take a fancy to - and you can keep abreast of events via the island's News Channel. Elsewhere, you can buy your Miis outfits from the clothing store, food from the supermarket, apartment decor from the Renovation Centre, and more exotic items - a lion?? - from the market stall. There's also a photo studio if you want to take some daft snaps.
</p><p>
Tomodachi Life residents might also make requests for island improvements from time to take, and you can decorate its outdoor spaces with everything from fences and picnic benches to new houses and additional terrain, all purchased from the Island Design Centre. And if you want to have a little more impact on your Miis, you can bestow them with quirks and traits, or drop them down at points of interest, so they can, say, jiggle in a sprinkler. It all looks as delightfully ridiculous as its predecessor, and that's before we get to the Studio Workshop where you can doodle your residents a 2D pet, or customise food, clothing, the TV channels they watch, and more. And yes there's romance, awkward love triangles, and marriage. Even shared housing for up to nine Miis.
</p>
<p>
Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream launches for Switch and Switch 2 on 16th April, but there's currently no word on any Switch 2-specific enhancements.

            <p>Nintendo is introducing image sharing restrictions to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomodachi-life">Tomodachi Life</a>: Living the Dream in order to create experiences that are "welcoming and enjoyable for everyone".</p>
<p><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71317/">As seen on the Nintendo America website</a>, a statement laying out why these restrictions are in place have been included. They read as follows: "Nintendo aims to create experiences where players have the freedom to enjoy their Mii characters in their own way. In Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, this freedom can sometimes lead to humorous, surprising, or unpredictable moments during gameplay.</p>
<p>"While these moments are often fun for players, we recognize that out-of-context scenes may be misunderstood or may not reflect the spirit in which the game is intended to be enjoyed.</p>

<p>"Nintendo is committed to creating experiences that are welcoming and enjoyable for everyone.</p>
<p>"To support this commitment, and in consideration of the unique gameplay in Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, we have decided to place restrictions on certain image sharing features. These limits help to make the worlds players create in Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream remain fun and safe, and that the game can be enjoyed comfortably by all players.</p>
<p>"We understand that some players may find these restrictions limiting. However, they reflect Nintendo's ongoing philosophy of creating experiences that bring smiles to everyone who plays."</p>
<p>As for the extent of these restrictions, the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/blfga/index.html?modal=1">Japanese Nintendo website</a> lays it out clearly: "The following features are unavailable: image transfer to smartphones, direct posting to social media, and automatic image uploads (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> only)." You can still share images via the Switch 2 Game Chat function.</p><p>The reaction to these restrictions are, as you can imagine, negative. <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-is-restricting-image-sharing-features-for-tomodachi-life-living-the-dream.1419745/">Take Dal from ResetEra</a>, who described the decision as "wacky". Racoon, on the same ResetEra post covering the decision, stated their belief that Nintendo "killed the game", adding: "social media was going to shoot this into the stratosphere, instead they killed it". Another, Mullet2000, summed up their thoughts as such: "Nintendo gonna Nintendo".</p>
<p>It's clear that Nintendo is implementing such measures in order to prevent folks from sharing images from the game that could be considered a bit <em>naughty. </em>But given the funny, easily meme-able moments present in Tomodachi Life, it does feel a bit like throwing the baby out with the bath water.</p>

            <p>For those who have been hearing all about this little show called Fallout, but don't have an Amazon Prime account and therefore haven't been able to keep up with the various wasteland chaos, I have some good news for you:</p>
<p>Fallout season one is streaming for a limited time on YouTube.</p>
<!-- code from Primis - Eurogamer.net - eurogamer.net -->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span> </p>
</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>The first two episodes of season one - The End and The Target - are available now via Amazon's Prime YouTube channel, with the remaining episodes then releasing steadily over the coming days.</p>
<p>Here is the premier schedule for Fallout season one on YouTube:</p>
<ul>
<li>S1E1 - 28th January, 5pm PT</li>
<li>S1E2 - 28th January, 6pm PT</li>
<li>S1E3 - 29th January, 5pm PT</li>
<li>S1E4 - 29th January, 6pm PT</li>
<li>S1E5 - 30th January, 5pm PT</li>
<li>S1E6 - 30th January, 6pm PT</li>
<li>S1E7 - 31st January, 5pm PT</li>
<li>S1E8 - 31st January, 6pm PT</li>
</ul>
<p>For those in the UK, 5pm PT is 1am the following day, and so of course 6pm PT is 2am.</p>
<p>This means, if this is your thing, you could probably squeeze episodes three and four into your morning routine before heading off to work tomorrow (though I am not sure Fallout gore and breakfast are the best combination, but who am I to say what works for you).</p>
<p>As per Prime's YouTube description, these episodes will expire on 11th February, at 11:59 pm PT. Will you be giving season one a watch?</p>
