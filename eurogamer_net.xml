            <p>Devil May Cry is coming to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.</p>
<p>That's according to Fortnite leakers Loolo_Wrld and Wensoing, both of whom say the long-running rumours of a Dante-flavoured crossover - which first bubbled up in 2023 - are indeed correct, and there is one in the works.</p> <div>

<p>Whilst both are fairly established leakers in their own rights, their news was picked up and shared by noted Fortnite leaker ShiinaBR, adding credence - if not quite a cast-iron guarantee - to the claims.</p>
<p>When pressed for more information - such as well the collaboration may arrive - Loolo was coy, saying, "I can’t specify anything about that for now", appending the statement with a zipped-mouth emoji.</p>
<p>Wensoing similarly will only commit to "coming soon", but acknowledges that both leakers "have heard about [the Devil May Cry crossover] several times via [their] insiders".</p> <div>

<p>As for the details? Well, that's all still very much up for speculation. There's no doubting that Devil May Cry boasts several iconic outfits and weapons, though, so there's plenty to pick from.</p>
<p>ICYMI, Fortnite Festival, the concert-themed rhythm-action portion of Epic Games' free-to-play jack-of-all-trades juggernaut, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-festival-is-getting-local-co-op-support-rekindling-memories-of-rock-band">getting local co-op support next month</a> - conjuring nostalgic memories of countless evenings spent twanging away in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rock-band">Rock Band</a> with pals.</p>
<p>As Matt reminded us yesterday, Fortnite Festival is the work of Rock Band developer Harmonix - which Epic Games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-acquires-rock-band-developer-harmonix">acquired back in 2021</a> - and is extremely reminiscent of the studio's beloved earlier titles, right down to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rock-band-developer-harmonixs-new-fortnite-music-mode-will-support-instrument-controllers">support for guitar-shaped plastic peripherals</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Yesterday's Marvel Rivals update has seemingly wiped the ability to use mods on PC.</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals has been in Season 0 since its release last month, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-season-1-will-nerf-some-of-the-most-dominant-characters">yesterday the online hero shooter's first season launched</a>, bringing significant balance changes and the heroic Fantastic Four team: Mister Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, the Human Torch, and the Thing.</p>
<p>Since the update rolled out, however, players are reporting that asset hash checking has stripped the ability to use mods, such as custom skins or FPS boosts.</p>

<p>Asset hash checking compares what you're running on your PC to what the servers <em>believes</em> your code should be running, and if it finds any differences - mods, in other words - the account could be banned.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The latest Marvel Rivals update has introduced Asset hash checking. Due to this, Mods to NOT work anymore until a workaround is found.</p>— X0XLEAK (@X0X_LEAK) <a href="https://twitter.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1877665877526565049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Whilst some lament the loss - including a lot of talk about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1hy8pay/comment/m6jwd1z/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Venom's "19-inch stalk"</a> - others are more ambivalent about the changes, <a href="https://x.com/DGetox/status/1877831137914921063">pointing out</a> that Marvel Rivals is a free-to-play game that relies on battle pass and skin sales to generate profit.</p>
<p>Others <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1hy8pay/comment/m6fq8re/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">noted</a> that this decision could also help ameliorate cheats and hacks.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-opening-weekend-sees-10m-players-join-in">Marvel Rivals has proven incredibly popular</a> since its launch. Its opening weekend saw 10 million players join online to take part in the fray.</p>
<p>"NetEase's spin on the hero battler is complex and moreish, but rarely much actual fun," our Chris wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-review">Eurogamer's Marvel Rivals review</a>. "Its biggest impact is a renewed appreciation for the rivals that do it better." He awarded it two out of five stars.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
