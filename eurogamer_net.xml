            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> players have hit out at "AI slop" they believe has been used within the game and its promotional materials.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, players noticed a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h850ur/black_ops_6_loading_screen_look_at_the_hand/">six-figured zombified Father Christmas</a> had popped up on the loading screen, and whilst some fans simply attributed this as a nod to the fact this is the sixth Black Ops game, others alleged it was evidence that the art was machine-generated, as <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/future-technology/why-ai-generated-hands-are-the-stuff-of-nightmares-explained-by-a-scientist">AI typically struggles to generate realistic-looking hands</a>.</p>

<p>More generous fans suggested the rogue digit could be the curb of a pavement behind the spooky Santa, or indeed just loose skin from a degloved finger giving the <em>impression</em> of a sixth finger.</p>
<p>Santa's teeth and moustache have also come under scrutiny.</p>

<p>"It's very clear that the game is full of AI," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1h8m2qy/this_is_unacceptable_at_this_point/">said</a> one player in a thread entitled, "this is unacceptable at this point".</p>
<p>"This alone is fucked but the fact the the zombies crew is almost fully recasted because they want to use AI to replicate the actors' voices so they can STOP PAYING THEM.</p>
<p>"I don't care if this isn't read by many but it's needs to be know how fucked and inexcusable this shit is. They are feeding us slop because they want to pay their millionaire executives a little bit more. It's ridiculous."</p><p>Last week, Activision announced it'll be giving those few remaining Call of Duty fans who haven't already bought this year's Black Ops 6 or played it through Game Pass the chance to get stuck in for free next week, as part of a seven-day trial. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-having-a-7-day-free-trial-starting-next-week">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Free Trial starts next Friday, 13th December</a>, on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. It'll continue into the following week, wrapping up on Friday, 20th December.</p>
<p>"For a series built on high-octane thrills and explosive gratification, its withdrawal to the well-trodden formula echoes the wider industry's continued allergy to risk," Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">Eurogamer's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>And that's why Digital Extremes is "focused" on "new things like social hubs".</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a> developer Digital Extremes has given us another peek at its upcoming free-to-play fantasy action-MMORPG, Soulframe.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://youtube.com/live/dvLYxzGtfNc">developer stream</a>, Digital Extremes offered an update on the pre-alpha - known as Preludes - both at it currently stands, as well as "a glimpse at Preludes to come".</p>
<p>Creative director Geoff Crookes also reflected on how important community feedback was to development, saying "feedback from the community will always remain our north star".</p>

<p>"Ever since we started letting players get their hands on Soulframe earlier this year in our pre-alpha playtests, things have ramped up in the best way possible," Crookes said. "We've always had a greater vision for what we aspire Soulframe to be, but feedback from the community will always remain our north star.</p><p>"That community feedback paves a tailored roadmap on changes to make and focus on in our current Pre-Alpha around nearly every aspect of the game as we ramp things up for full public access," Crookes added. "We hear the feedback around combat and lack of social features, which is why you've seen those elements become major focuses for us as we add new things like social hubs."</p>
<p>For more, you can check out the teaser above, which shows off the player social hub and some new quests, as well as introduce some new NPCs (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/soulframe-shows-off-a-new-teaser-trailer-and-a-cool-giant-wolf-to-hang-out-with/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>"Even as Ode'n shadow spreads across Alca, the future of Soulframe: Preludes is bright, Envoys! Enjoy a preview of what's to come to Preludes in 2025," DE teases in the description.</p>
<p>Back in July 2022, Digital Extremes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-dev-announces-free-to-play-fantasy-action-mmorpg-soulframe">unveiled its first new property since Warframe's release</a> back in 2013. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-devs-free-to-play-fantasy-mmorpg-soulframe-shows-off-30-minutes-of-gameplay">Besides a 30-minute gameplay teaser this time last year</a>, though, we've seen very little else. Back in July, however, at TennoCon 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-will-open-up-to-a-lot-more-players-this-autumn-says-digital-extremes">we finally got our first extended look at it</a>.</p>
<p>Soulframe will be Digital Extremes' first new game in over five years, following on from 2017's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-dev-hits-pause-on-deck-building-shooter-the-amazing-eternals">short-lived team-based FPS The Amazing Eternals</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
