            <p>
Hell is Us creative director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête called the surprise release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> "a little callous", believing it had an impact on his game's sales.
</p>
<p>
Rogue Factor's adventure game was already locked in for its release ahead of Team Cherry's announcement, but the two games eventually released on the same day.
</p>
<p>
"When you know you're that big, I think a shadow drop is a bit like – wow," said Jacques-Belletête on <a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/hell-is-us-developer-silksong-release-date-surprise-was-a-little-callous/">Skill Up's Friends Per Second podcast</a>. "As the '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> of indie'... to shadow drop something like this is a little callous."

<p>
After Team Cherry's announcement, the Hell is Us development team discussed with publisher Nacon whether to change the date. "It was a real thing," said Jacques-Belletête.
</p>
<p>
However, the "real pain in the ass", Jacques-Belletête explained, is that changing release date means refunding pre-orders. And while that wasn't a deciding factor, the team believed they could weather the storm.
</p>
<p>
Still, Jacques-Belletête admitted Silksong's release did impact the launch of Hell is Us. "I don't have any specific numbers,"he said, "at least not at this time. But for sure it did."
</p>
<p>
Above all, Jacques-Belletête highlighted the difficulties of finding an appropriate release window in the current climate.
</p>
<p>
"That's the thing nowadays, honestly – getting a window where you're pretty much alone is almost impossible," he said. "15 years ago, the mid-end of the summer was always a dead period. But there's no such thing anymore. It's just constant madness."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksongs-release-date-causes-delays-for-more-games-than-you-might-think">Plenty of games did change their release date in the wake of Silksong's launch</a>, including Demonschool and Baby Steps.
</p>
<p>
"Hell is Us is an absorbing, nightmarish meditation on the horror of war, but divisive design choices prove tedious," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hell-is-us-review">Hell is Us review</a>.

            <p>
Stop Destroying Videogames - the European campaign inspired by the Stop Killing Games movement - has shared a progress update as EU countries continue verifying petition signatures, saying it's preparing for the next stage, which will include "countering misinformation and industry lobbying".
</p>
<p>
Stop Destroying Videogames is looking to convince the EU to pass regulations preventing "the remote disabling of video games by the publishers, before providing reasonable means to continue functioning of said video games without the involvement from the side of the publisher." To that end, it turned to the European Citizens' Initiative - an official EU mechanism designed to provide a way for citizens to propose a legal act to the European Commission - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">successfully surpassed 1.4m signatures</a> before the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/eci">petition</a> closed in July.
</p>
<p>
With several months having passed since then, Stop Destroying Videogames organisers have now <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/comments/1nfvxk1/campaign_update/">shared a progress update on the Stop Killing Games subreddit</a>. At present, the post explained, all signatures are being checked by national authorities. As previously noted, if 1m signatures are successfully verified (the post adds "early reports from several countries show around 97 percent of signatures being valid"), the petition can then be presented to the EU for either a public hearing or full debate session at the European Parliament. "That moment will mark the start of the legislative phase," the post continues, "where the Commission and Parliament must decide how to respond."

<p>
While verification continues - a process that should take around three months - Stop Destroy Videogames is preparing for the next stage of its campaign. The goal, organisers explain, is to ensure "our initiative cannot be ignored", and so it's working toward, "Legislative outreach to Members of Parliament and the Commission; countering misinformation and industry lobbying; strengthening our community structures to support this next stage." Some work will, by necessity, remain behind the scenes. "Past attempts to undermine the initiative," organisers write, "have shown us the risks of being too open."
</p><p>
Stop Destroying Videogames also noted some "long-time contributors" - including Ross Scott, the figurehead of the main Stop Killing Games initiative - have "stepped back" after years of effort. In a follow-up comment, Ross clarified, "It's more like I'm 'on call' for anything where me being involved would help a lot. Most of what's happening now is best left to people familiar with EU political processes like Mortiz [Katzner], so I'm leaving most things to people who know what they're doing better than I do to maximise our odds."
</p>
<p>
"This campaign exists only because of you," the post concludes, "and with your continued support we can make sure our voices are heard in Brussels."

            <p>
The physical release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> will be on a game key card and will take up around a third of the console's storage capacity.
</p>
<p>
Some Switch 2 physical games are sold as game key cards, which use the card solely as a key to download the full game. Many third-party publishers are opting for this method of release on Nintendo's new console.
</p>
<p>
Images of the game box on <a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade---switch-2">Square Enix's store</a> prove Final Fantasy 7 Remake will be another game key card release, while its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/limited-early-purchase-editionfinal-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-switch-2/?srsltid=AfmBOooMV8kwa75CskPgxZMlJ4rAwW63sBdWbil-myyKr466ROJJPwwY">eShop listing</a> states it requires a download of up to 90GB. As the Switch 2's storage capacity is 256GB, that means the game will take up approximately 34 percent (though of course you'll need to account for console system files).

<p>
The reported maximum size for a proper game card is 64GB, which is the card size CD Projekt Red opted for with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> release on Switch 2. But at 90GB, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s game wouldn't fit.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, the huge size of games is exactly the reason Nintendo offers game key cards as an option, but this has been heavily criticised by game preservationists. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-dont-like-nintendos-controversial-game-key-cards-you-can-now-let-the-company-know-directly">Nintendo even released a survey</a> to gather reactions.
</p>
<p>
So what's the alternative solution here? Should Square Enix be to blame for its decision and/or inability to reduce the game size? Or is Nintendo to blame for not offering larger game cards?
</p>
<p>
Larger game cards would be more expensive for publishers, while a higher console capacity would be more expensive for Nintendo who seems more than happy to let consumers choose to expand storage space through expensive MicroSD Express cards - this now looking pretty essential if you plan on playing triple-A third-party games on the Switch 2.
</p><p>
One developer at Ubisoft did explain why it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-dev-comes-out-with-first-actually-good-reason-for-using-switch-2s-controversial-game-key-cards">opted for a game key card with Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2</a>, stating traditional cards "simply didn't give the performance we needed at the quality target we were going for". The game was built around the SSDs of release platforms and as such it "relies heavily on disk streaming for its open world environments".
</p>
<p>Perhaps Square Enix has a similar reason.</p>
<p>
Still, Square Enix has confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-gets-switch-2-release-date">entire Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy is headed to Switch 2</a>. And considering second game Rebirth is 145GB on PS5, there's no way you'll be able to play all three games on your Switch 2 in future without opting to expand the memory.
