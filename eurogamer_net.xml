            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/2xko-launches-with-100-arcane-bundle-shocking-early-access-players-but-is-it-worth-it.1319494/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>2XKO is out in early access, bringing with it seasonal content, two new characters in Teemo and Warwick, and a suite of cosmetics for players to unlock and buy. As a free-to-play game this isn't unusual, however the game's most expensive bundle has some players wincing.</p>
<p>The reason why comes down to the cost. 2XKO's Arcane-themed Ultra Starter Edition is available to buy for $99.99 / €99.99 / £84.99 / CA $139.99. Now, that's a lot of money, but for that amount you get three "Mythic" tier skins with a bunch of alternate colours, an exclusive finisher, eight champion unlock tokens, a player card, avatar cosmetic bundles, and 5,000 KO points (in-game currency). </p>
<p>It's worth noting that this is the price of the most expensive version of the bundle. The standard version of the starter bundle costs $29.99 and comes with four champion unlock tokens, a player card, and enough in-game currency to buy one legendary skin from the shop. However, if you want those Arcane skins, you'll have to fork out the full price. There is no other way to get them, you'll have to pay for the Ultra version.</p>

<p>The reaction online from fighting game players seeing this has been passionate to say the least. <a href="https://x.com/vicwingly/status/1975626557306835417">Some have expressed shock at the bundle's price</a>, others <a href="https://x.com/Spideraxe30/status/1975660887055683867">are expressing disappointment that they aren't able to buy the Arcane skins separately from the bundle itself</a>, <a href="https://x.com/TimeBombFanatic/status/1975780591242219776">while some are totally fine with spending that much money on these fancy cosmetics</a>.</p><p>It's an interesting twist on an ongoing point of discussion within the fighting game genre. Dedicated players for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> <a href="https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2025/jan/06/sf6-costumes-silence-displeasure/">have been begging for more consistent character skin releases to support the game</a>, rather than the onslaught of Battle Hub cosmetics that game has received since launch.</p>
<p>For many fighting game players 2XKO is their introduction to modern free-to-play microtransaction models, and as eye-watering as $99.99 is to see pop up on your screen, it's not an alien concept to Riot Games. The company has been supporting Valorant with expensive gun skins ever since that shooter's launch, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> has been experimenting with gacha and super-expensive Ahri and Jhin skins.</p>
<p>The question is, is this bundle worth it? Well, an obvious point to make first is that some people will simply not be able to afford $100 for an in-game bundle regardless of its value proposition. For those who can, a lot of the value comes down to how much you like the exclusive Arcane skins. I, for example, don't care for Vi, Jinx, or Ekko, so it's not much of a prize.</p>
<p>The in-game currency you get as part of the Ultra version of the bundle comes to about 2.5 legendary skins in the shop, or you can grab the Ultra version of the current battle pass and be left with 1,500 KO points left. These skins <em>are</em> cool, and the battle pass is full of all manner of quirky customisation options, but again you're contesting with the $100 shock factor here. Also, funnily enough, your remainging 1,500 points if you choose to buy the battle pass isn't quite enough for a legendary skin, so you'll have to buy more premium currency to use up what you've got left in your 2XKO wallet, at the expense of your real-world wallet.</p><p>Ultimately there's not too much you can do to tear away the shock of a $100 price point on any in-game bundle, but those in favour of this price point will of course argue it's not meant to be bought by everyone. It's meant to be an illustrious expense for super fans (or whales). This is true of course, but with three more bundles set to release before 2026, one has to wonder how much money people will have to spend to get everything Riot is selling here.</p>

            <p>If you're reading this, then you're probably one of the "hyper enthusiast, price-insensitive players" keeping the games industry going.</p>
<p>That's because, according to research by analyst firm Circana, around a third of video game players in the US buy a new game less than once a year.</p>
<p>While this research is specific to the US, it's certainly eye-opening for the state of the industry across the globe. And with 12 percent purchasing once a year and 18 percent purchasing once every six months, it means a combined 63 percent of players buy just two games or fewer each year.</p>
<p>The research is part of Circana's Q3 2025 Future of Games survey, as shared on social media by analyst Mat Piscatella.</p>
<p>"Hyper enthusiast, price-insensitive players are really keeping things going, especially in the non f2p gaming space," he said.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigtnlcxloqjvmbylrdg2jzzq4x6qlon6az44xwjvfajx6viqo7h3m" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system" data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/app.bsky.feed.post/3m27zezw2ek2v"><div lang="en"><p>Hyper enthusiast, price-insensitive players are really keeping things going, especially in the non f2p gaming space.

According to Circana's Q3 2025 Future of Games, only 4% of US video game players buy a new game more often than once per month, with a third of players not buying any games at all.</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3m27zezw2ek2v?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p></div>— Mat Piscatella (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x?ref_src=embed">@matpiscatella.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3m27zezw2ek2v?ref_src=embed">2 October 2025 at 17:54</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>It's interesting timing for the data following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year">recent price hike of Xbox Game Pass</a>. If, on average, players are spending, say, £140 on two full price games (or less) each year, is spending around £275 a year (£22.99 for 12 months) on Game Pass Ultimate for access to day one games really a good deal?</p><p>Nowadays there are more games than ever being released, but if players are only buying a couple - and let's face it, it'll be the likes of EA FC, Call of Duty, and inevitably <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> - how can smaller studios expect to survive?</p>
<p>And that's outside of free-to-play live-service games, where just a handful of games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/live-service-games-continue-to-dominate-accounting-for-40-of-time-spent-on-ps5-and-xbox-in-us-last-month">continue to dominate player time</a>.</p>
<p>It would seem the 14 percent of players purchasing at least one game each month are the ones keeping the industry afloat at present, but this is by no means an infinite pool of money for studios to aim for. It's why growth of the industry has stagnated in recent years - it's those average players who need to be reached.</p>
<p>For the "hyper enthusiast" players, then, subscriptions like Game Pass offer good value - although not ownership. But how can that be made more attractive to the average consumer?</p>
<p>It certainly helps to explain Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/every-screen-is-an-xbox-microsoft-reportedly-tells-staff">"Everything is an Xbox" approach</a>, to lower the barrier of entry for the average consumer. It's also why <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-launching-completely-redesigned-luna-streaming-service-later-this-year-with-emphasis-on-social-gaming">Amazon is now looking to boost its Luna cloud gaming service</a>.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-role-of-the-console-is-shifting-are-rising-prices-the-end-for-games-consoles-as-we-know-them">what does this mean for the future of console gaming</a>? Eurogamer asked the experts, and it's not all doom and gloom.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> is getting a free trial for an entire week, starting 9th October. This free trial for last year's Call of Duty will provide access to the campaign, multiplayer, and zombies game modes - so interested players can play everything Blops currently has to offer.</p>
<p>This on its own would be some nice news for those looking for something to do during this month but with little money in their pocket right now, but an extra interesting layer to this free trial is that it's taking place during the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> release.</p>
<p>If this timing is intentional, it would mark the first case of marketing retaliation from Activision in the ongoing public scuffle between the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> and Battlefield 6. This scuffle started during the Battlefield 6 Multiplayer reveal, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield">where the developers at Battlefield Studios weren't shy about their intentions to stick to sensible military cosmetics, rather than the gaudy out-of-universe skins available in CoD</a>.</p>

<p>Following this discussion about wacky cosmetics' prevalence in Call of Duty entering the zeitgeist, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-dutys-u-turn-on-absurd-cosmetics-is-proof-that-battlefield-6-competition-is-a-really-good-thing">Activision soon announced its intention to pull back a bit from its cosmetic approach in Black Ops 7</a>.</p>
<p>Even so, EA continued to push this messaging in advertisements, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-live-action-trailer-is-its-biggest-jab-at-call-of-duty-yet-makes-a-point-out-of-blowing-up-zac-efron">bringing in celebrities to star in a recent Battlefield 6 live-action trailer in reference to Call of Duty's history of selling real-world figures as in-game skins</a>. The trailer soon blows these celebrities up, with a squad of typical looking soldiers taking their place.</p><p>So the clash over public opinion has been rather one-sided so far, but dropping Black Ops 6 for free during the Battlefield 6 release date is a pretty solid way to strike back, especially given the fact that Black Ops 6 is at the tail end of its lifespan with Black Ops 7 set to launch next month.</p>
<p>For those who do decide to hop into Black Ops 6 during this free week, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blog/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-zombies-season-06#Events">they'll be met with a collection of Halloween-themed events and cosmetics</a> to get them into the festive mood. These will transfer over to Warzone but not to Black Ops 7 as part of that aforementioned decision to keep things visually coherent in the new game, so keep that in mind.</p>
