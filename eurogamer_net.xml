<p>Many of us here at Eurogamer were rather taken with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a> on its release last year, so this is one I would suggest snapping up while you have the chance. We described the pixel-art combat-free Metroidvania as "astonishingly rich" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animal-well-review">Eurogamer's five star Animal well review</a>.</p>
<p>Another highlight leaving PlayStation's subscription service is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tales-of-kenzera-zau">Tales of Kenzera</a>: Zau. "What Tales of Kenzera lacks in creative game design it makes up for in vital, passionate storytelling," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-review">Eurogamer's four star Tales of Kenzera: Zau review</a>.</p><p>

As for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/slay-the-spire">Slay the Spire</a>, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-the-year-2019-slay-the-spire-and-the-joy-of-spontaneity">one of Eurogamer's Games of the Year 2019</a>. Our review, meanwhile, called it "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slay-the-spire-review-a-gorgeous-blend-of-dungeon-crawler-and-card-battler">a gorgeous blend of dungeon-crawler and card-battler</a>".

<p>But, while some games are leaving, some new games have arrived on PlayStation Plus this month. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-in-playstation-plus-next-month">PlayStation Plus Essential games for March</a> - and which are available now - include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dragon Age: The Veilguard (PS5)</li>
<li>Sonic Colors: Ultimate (PS4)</li>
<li>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection (PS4/PS5)</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll find more details on what else is on offer in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">full PlayStation Plus guide</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It has been six years and a bit since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> was first announced, and ever since then we have been seeking out any crumb of information about the upcoming game.</p>
<p>And yet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-gets-surprise-sequel-for-switch-and-pc">since that now slightly hazy day of February 2019</a>, developer Team Cherry has kept release details under relative wraps (although in January, the team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-progressing-and-will-release-says-team-cherry">did try and assure us that Silksong is "real, progressing and will release"</a>).</p>
<p>But, when will it be released, Team Cherry? When? You tell me it is real, but where is the proof? I need hard evidence, Cherry! (Ok, I am jesting slightly here.) But, while I may need further reassurance, Microsoft is clearly still confident the game will eventually show up, namechecking it as part of a new <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/18/idxbox-developers-finding-success-with-xbox/">post</a> about its ID@Xbox program.</p>

<p>"Looking ahead, our lineup is incredible with upcoming games," Xbox writes, before highlighting titles such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/belle-epoque-rpg-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gets-april-release-date">which is slated for an April release</a>) and Control multiplayer spin-off FBC: Firebreak from Remedy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-control-developer-remedy-reveals-first-ever-multiplayer-game">FBC: Firebreak was announced in October last year</a>, and has a release window of 2025.</p>
<p>And as well as those? "Of course Hollow Knight: Silksong too!" Microsoft states.</p>
<p>Does this mean Hollow Knight: Silksong may be releasing soon? Ahh, alas, I doubt its inclusion in Xbox's post really means anything more than Microsoft is having a playful joke with those of us who are wanting to hear more. But then again, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-moments-set-to-shape-video-games-in-2025"><em>maybe </em>2025 will finally be the year Silksong flies onto platforms</a>.
