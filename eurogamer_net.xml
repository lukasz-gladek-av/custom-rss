            <p>
Developer Shift Up has quietly announced its acclaimed sci-fi hack-and-slash adventure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> is getting a sequel - and it looks like it's due to arrive before the end of next year.
</p>
<p>
Shift Up shared the news as part of its <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/irdata.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=254&amp;page=1&amp;code=irdata_eng">recent investor presentation</a>, tucking mention of a Stellar Blade sequel away on a slide highlighting its "IP expansion" plans for 2025 and 2026. The studio's free-to-play sci-fi shooter Goddess of Victory: Nikke got a mention, as did the mysterious "Project Witches", but it's Stellar Blade we're interested in here.
</p>
<p>Two key developments were listed under the Stellar Blade header: firstly, a "platform expansion", which seems likely to be a reference to the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-out-on-pc-next-month-according-to-leaked-trailer">imminent arrival on PC</a> - a release Shift Up has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-pc-sales-expected-to-exceed-console-says-shift-up">extremely high hopes for</a>. And then next to that, an unassuming second blue box tagged with the all-important word "sequel".

<p>
Shift Up's sequel announcement didn't come with any specific details, but one interesting takeaway is the timeline the studio looks to be working on. According to Shift Up's slide, Stellar Blade 2 is due to launch before 2027, strongly suggesting the developer is targeting a 2026 release - less than two years after the launch of the first game. That feels like a remarkably swift turnaround time for a fully fledged AAA sequel.

<p>
Hopefully, though, Stellar Blade 2 can live up to the standard set by its acclaimed predecessor, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">awarded four stars in Eurogamer's review</a>. "Stellar Blade has a fair bit of weirdness," Jessica Orr wrote, "but its killer tunes and vibey, flow-state combat - plus a transformative hard mode - are enough to leave you entranced."
</p>
<p>
PC players can pick up Stellar Blade via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3489700/Stellar_Blade/">Steam</a> or <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/stellar-blade-fa21c3">Epic</a> when it launches on 11th June. Additionally, a Complete Edition arrives for PC and PlayStation 5 on the same day, bundling together the base game, various cosmetics for protagonist EVE, and more. PC players should note, however, Stellar Blade is currently blocked in over 120 countries, which seems to have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-pc-release-blocked-on-steam-in-over-120-countries-surprising-even-its-developer">surprised Shift Up as much as everyone else</a>. Over the weekend, the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-studio-says-it-is-closely-discussing-the-region-lock-issue-with-playstation">said it was "closely discussing the region lock issue" with Sony</a> in the hope of finding a solution before 11th June.

            <p>
Mike Pondsmith, the creator of the Cyberpunk tabletop RPG that formed the basis of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, has been discussing CD Projekt's in-development sequel, saying it'll feature second city that feels like "Chicago gone wrong".
</p>
<p>
CD Projekt <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-red-announces-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-future-witcher-projects-outlined">confirmed a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel was in the works</a> back in 2022, and only a scant few details have been shared since then. We know it's currently being referred to by the codename Project Orion, for instance, that it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-team-relocating-to-boston-for-sequel">being developed by CD Projekt's Boston and Vancouver studios</a>, and... well, that's about it.
</p>
<p>
Pondsmith, though, has now provided what might just be the first tangible details of CD Projekt's Cyberpunk 2077 sequel. Speaking to TVGRY during this year's Digital Dragons Conference in Krakow, he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cthec500Ofo">explained</a> that while he's "not as involved directly" with Project Orion as he was its predecessor, he still sees the scripts and has been visiting its development studio.

<p>
"Last week," he revealed, "I was wandering around talking to different departments and seeing what they had... I spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place in Orion... because there's another city we visit, and I'm not telling you anymore than that."
</p>
<p>
Luckily for everyone (except, perhaps, CD Projekt, which seems unlikely to have sanctioned any of these reveals), Pondsmith <em>did</em> share a little more. First, he confirmed "Night City is still there" alongside this second location, before teasing how Project Orion's two cities will differentiate themselves. "I remember looking at [the new location] and going, 'Yeah, I understand the feel that you're going for, and this really does work. It doesn't feel like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a>, it feels more like Chicago gone wrong'. And I said, 'Yeah, I can see this working.'"
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, while Pondsmith only suggested Project Orion's second location was <em>like</em> Chicago, fans have long speculated the actual city of Chicago will play a key role in CD Projekt's sequel. As explained in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/17jz77f/chicago_might_be_one_of_the_new_locations_in_the/">fairly comprehensive post on the Cyberpunk subreddit</a>, the in-universe version of Chicago has struggled through both an economic collapse, a corporate war, and a bio-plague - so "gone wrong" would very much apply here. Additionally, Cyberpunk 2077's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> expansion features a possible ending that can nudge players several years forward in the timeline, after which the Transcontinental Maglev Network project referenced in the base game - one linking Night City with Chicago - is revealed to be complete.
</p>
<p>
It's certainly a compelling theory, especially given Pondsmith's latest chatter, but there's obviously no guarantee any of this will make it through the years of development required to turn Project Orion - which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-shares-witcher-and-cyberpunk-project-updates-announces-partnership-with-mobile-developer-scopely">currently in the pre-production phase</a> - into a complete and released game. That won't happen until sometime after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>'s still-nebulous launch window - but at least that leaves plenty of time to wrap up the original Cyberpunk 2077, which will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-is-a-switch-2-launch-title">soon be making its Nintendo debut on Switch 2</a>.
