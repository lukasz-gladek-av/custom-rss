            <p>
Bethesda veteran Julian LeFay, sometimes referred to as the 'father of Elder Scrolls' thanks to his pioneering work on the legendary fantasy RPG series, has died aged 59.
</p>
<p>
The news follows developer OnceLost Games' announcement last week that LeFay, who had previously been diagnosed with cancer, would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-veteran-julian-lefay-father-of-the-elder-scrolls-departs-game-development-due-to-cancer">stepping back from game development</a> to spend his "remaining time with his family and loved ones".
</p>
<p>
LeFay joined Bethesda shortly after its founding in 1987, and oversaw the likes of The Elder Scrolls: Arena and its 1996 sequel Daggerfall in his role as chief engineer. He departed the company in 1998, briefly returning for The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind, then pursued various other ventures before setting up OnceLost Games with fellow Elder Scrolls veterans Ted Peterson and Vijay Lakshman in 2019. Since then, the studio has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-wayward-realms-is-a-grand-rpg-by-former-elder-scrolls-devs">working on The Wayward Realms</a>, an open-world RPG announced in 2021.
</p>
<p>
LeFay's departure from The Wayward Realms project was announced last week in a video addressed to fans, where it was revealed he'd been "fighting a battle with cancer for the last several years" and didn't "have very much time left". Now, OnceLost has confirmed LeFay's death in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oncelostgames.bsky.social/post/3lum4pyp3cs2e">message shared on social media</a>.
</p>
<p>
"It is with profound sadness and heavy hearts that we inform our community of the passing of Julian LeFay, our beloved technical director and co-founder of OnceLost Games," the studio wrote. "Julian LeFay was not just a colleague, he was a visionary who fundamentally shaped the gaming industry as we know it today," it continued, highlighting his work on numerous classic games. "His pioneering work established the foundation for open-world RPGs and influenced countless developers and games that followed."
</p>
<p>
"At OnceLost Games, Julian was one of the masterminds behind The Wayward Realms, bringing decades of expertise and an unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of what RPGs could achieve. His technical brilliance, creative vision, and dedication to player agency have been the driving forces behind our ambitious project.
</p>
<p>
"Throughout his courageous battle with cancer, Julian never wavered in his passion for The Wayward Realms. Even during his illness, he continued to share his vision with our team, mentor our developers, and ensure that every aspect of the game reflected his commitment to creating something truly extraordinary. His strength, determination, and unwavering focus inspires us all."
</p>
<p>
Acknowledging the questions fans and Kickstarter backers might now have regarding the future of The Wayward Realms, OnceLost wrote that despite the "immeasurable loss for our team, our community, and our industry", LeFay's "technical frameworks, design philosophises, and direction have all been carefully documented and shared with our team", and that it was "more committed than ever to bringing The Wayward Realms to life exactly as Julian intended it".
</p>
<p>
"Julian's influence extends far beyond our studio," OnceLost concluded. "He touched the lives of millions of players worldwide and inspired countless developers to push creative boundaries. Julian's legacy will live on in every realm, every quest, and every moment of wonder that players will experience in The Wayward Realms."
