            <p>People are getting ready for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> in the very best way possible – by replaying the original, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>, in record numbers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date">Ever since Silksong's 4th September release date was confirmed at Gamescom last week</a>, more and more people have been heading back into Dirtmouth, so much so that Team Cherry's critically-acclaimed game has repeatedly broken its own concurrent peak player count on Steam over the weekend.</p>

<p>Right now (and "right now" is subject to change with alarming speed), Hollow Knight's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/#max">all-time concurrent peak of 39,356 players</a> was set less than an hour ago. And while there are plenty of games that have eclipsed that over the last few weeks, don't forget that Hollow Knight is an indie single-player game that's eight years old now.</p><p>Of course, concurrent Steam peaks are precisely that – an indication of popularity on Steam – but it's usually indicative of player counts on other platforms, too. But before the Silksong announcement, Hollow Knight's concurrent Steam peak, set back in 2022, stood at a much more modest 20K.</p>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong will release on Thursday, 4th September 2025 for PC, Switch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. Yet contrary to what you may believe, Silksong hasn't been in development hell for that time, however – in fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-silksong-hasnt-been-in-development-hell-hype-skyrocketed-sales-of-the-original-game-to-give-team-cherry-financial-freedom">Team Cherry's developers say they were just having too much fun making it</a>.</p>
