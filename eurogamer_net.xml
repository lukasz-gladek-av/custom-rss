            <p>The top five games played on the PlayStation in 2025 by US players were exactly the same as in 2024, according to Circana's Player Engagement Tracker.</p>
<p>This information, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mbraw2dcfc2s">published on social media by senior director at Circana Mat Piscatella</a>, states that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> took the top spot in 2025, followed by Call of Duty, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto V</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a>, then Minecraft. This is interesting as this list is an exact replication of the top five games played on US PlayStations in 2024.</p>
<p>Looking at the top five games played on US Xbox's in 2025, there's a slight different in the order of the games which take the top five spots, but the games themselves remain the same. In 2025, Fortnite took the number one spot, followed by Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto V, Minecraft, and Roblox. Whereas in 2024, Call of Duty was number one, followed by Fortnite, Minecraft, Grand Theft Auto V, then Roblox at number five.</p>

<p>It's safe to say that, judging by these stats, the upper echelon of popular games right now are somewhat cemented in place right now. With the biggest live service games bringing in absurd profit and player engagement metrics, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-on-earth-do-you-find-lasting-meaningful-success-with-a-live-service-game-developers-answer-the-billion-dollar-question">it's a tricky task to break into the space and survive</a> let alone thrive. A year after its launch, <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/20696836/epic-apple-trial-epic-games-exhibit.pdf">Fortnite made over $5bn,</a> and has shown little sign of slowing down ever since.</p><p>That should provide some context as to why developers keep attempting to make big live service hits, as if they can catch on the potential profits are staggering. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-12-million-sales">Arc Raiders would be an example of this going well</a>, while examples of these sorts of games not catching on are far more numerous. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/free-to-play-big-team-pvp-warhaven-announces-closure-just-4-months-after-its-early-access-launch">Just look at Warhaven</a>, which shut down only four months after its early access release.</p><p>

Will 2026's top five list be different? Even with Call of Duty <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">having hit a bit of a roadbump with Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> performing exceptionally well, it's likely the top five list itself will stay very similar. If <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">Grand Theft Auto VI wasn't delayed to November</a> perhaps we'd have seen a passing of the torch to the sequel, but oh well.

            <p>Amazon has announced more cast members joining its live-action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a>.</p>
<p>Renowned actress, beloved Faithful and nervous farter from last year's Celebrity Traitors Celia Imrie has joined already announced Tomb Raider cast members Sophie Turner, Jason Isaacs, Sigourney Weaver and Martin Bobb-Semple.</p>
<p>Other newly announced cast members include Jack Bannon, John Heffernan, Bill Paterson and August Wittgenstein, to name just four.</p>
<!-- code from Primis - Eurogamer.net - eurogamer.net -->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span> </p>
</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>So, who is playing who? Well, along with Turner as Lara Croft, the following cast are confirmed in canon roles from the Tomb Raider video games:</p>
<ul>
<li>Martin Bobb-Semple is <strong>Zip</strong>, Lara Croft's long-standing tech support and friend (many suspected this is who Bobb-Semple would be playing) </li>
<li>Jason Isaacs is <strong>Atlas DeMornay</strong>, Lara's uncle</li>
<li>Bill Paterson is <strong>Winston</strong>, the long-standing Croft family butler</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, the following roles are new to the Tomb Raider universe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jack Bannon is <strong>Gerry</strong>, Lara's personal pilot and snack collector</li>
<li>John Heffernan is <strong>David</strong>, an exhausted government official who finds himself tangled up in Lara's unusual world</li>
<li>Celia Imrie is <strong>Francine</strong>, the Head of Advancement at the British Museum, focused solely on raising funds and glasses of champagne</li>
<li>Paterson Joseph is <strong>Thomas Warner</strong>, a senior government official brought in to clean up an almighty mess</li>
<li>Sasha Luss is <strong>Sasha</strong>, a fierce, deeply competitive new adversary of Lara's</li>
<li>Juliette Motamed is <strong>Georgia</strong>, a devoted, by-the-books curator at the British Museum, dedicated to the "proper" preservation of history</li>
<li>Sigourney Weaver is <strong>Evelyn Wallis</strong>, a mysterious, high-flying woman who is keen to exploit Lara's talents</li>
<li>August Wittgenstein is <strong>Lukas</strong>, an illegal raider who shares history with Lara in more ways than one</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these descriptions, I am going to say Lukas is a love interest in a similar vein to Daniel Craig's Alex West from the first Angelina Jolie-fronted Tomb Raider film.</p>
<p>I am curious to see what Isaacs' Uncle Atlus will be like. The last time I remember hearing his name pop up was in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a>: Blood Ties DLC, when he was trying to get Croft Manor from Lara. It didn't sound like he and Lara exactly saw eye to eye. Also, I hope we don't get too bogged down in any Daddy issues, as I am going to assume Lara is once again an orphan in the upcoming series.</p>

<p>"Tomb Raider has always been defined by bold storytelling and unforgettable characters, and these new cast members bring incredible depth and gravitas to the series,"  <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/tomb-raider-prime-video-phoebe-waller-bridge-sophie-turner">said Peter Friedlander</a>, head of Amazon MGM Studios. "With talents like Sigourney Weaver and Jason Isaacs joining the ensemble, we're elevating this world in exciting new ways, and can't wait for our global Prime Video audience to experience this next chapter of Tomb Raider."</p><p>Weaver previously stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-scripts-are-incredible-and-very-funny-sigourney-weaver-confirms-she-will-play-wallace-in-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Tomb Raider scripts are "incredible, and very funny, very charming, very witty"</a>. Meanwhile, Phoebe Waller-Bridge - who along with Fleabag is also known for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Killing Eve and Crashing - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">will serve as the Tomb Raider series' creator</a>, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner. Jonathan Van Tulleken will be director and executive producer, along with Chad Hodge as co-showrunner and executive producer.</p>
<p>Filming for Tomb Raider is expected to kick off later this month, on 19th January.</p>

<p>As well as Amazon's show, the game side of the business is currently collaborating with Crystal Dynamics on an all-new Tomb Raider known as Catalyst. Revealed last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards">Tomb Raider: Catalyst sends Lara to Northern India</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-where-tomb-raider-catalyst-sits-on-the-series-timeline">takes place some time after series entry Underworld</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raiders-newest-lara-croft-is-frightened-about-losing-the-role-after-being-absolutely-blindsided-by-perfect-dark-cancellation">Alix Wilton Regan will portray Lara in both Catalyst and next year's Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a>, which is a remake of the first game.</p>
