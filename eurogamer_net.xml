            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has had a rough time of it since launch. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-performance-related-pc-improvements-coming-this-week-says-capcom">From day one</a>, players on PC in particular have been criticising the game's performance (though that was recently addressed, to some degree, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-patch-finally-fixes-the-games-inexcusable-performance-woes-on-pc">with a much-needed patch</a> that took aim at stuttering and shaders). But aside from the complaints about performance, faithful hunters have also been knocking the game's approach to difficulty and content variation, bemoaning the easy hunts and comparative lack of end-game content.</p>
<p>Today, in a post over on X (formerly Twitter), Capcom has released a surprising statement that notes the developer will actually move various items <em>up</em> the roadmap to better placate players that have issues with the game.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1950139099160949156">In a post</a> that addressed the release date and content of update Ver.1.021, Capcom notes:</p>
<p>"The expansion of endgame content which was originally planned as part of Title Update 3 in late September will now be released ahead of schedule as part of the Ver.1.021 update."</p>
<p>As such, the update (which was initially planned to launch 'early August') will now drop closer to mid-August, and is currently being readied for deployment on 13th August.</p>
<p>The main content added to the game in this update will include: a sew level of quest difficulty (hopefully making things just that little bit tougher for series veterans), a new rewards system for these end-game quests (this will be realised in the form of Talismans that players can equip, which will carry random skill combinations - ideal for depth and variety in build-crafting), weapon balance adjustments (that will cover more weapons than originally planned for this update), and other improvements and adjustments (dare we say: better performance?)</p>

<p>It's nice to see the developer responding to the criticism about the game in this manner. I spoke recently about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">the impact the game's negative reviews have been having</a> on the title, and it seems Capcom is keen to demonstrate that it's listening to fans by being fluid with its development pipeline in this way. As for what this increased difficulty is, though, we've no idea at the time of writing. Will it just be harder versions of the Apex monsters, the Gore Magalas, and boss-monster Arkveld, with higher damage output and more tanky HP? Or will it be something a little more meaningful?</p>
<p>I, personally, am hoping for more stagger resistance for lower-tier monsters, since the weaker monsters seem to be incapable of getting out of stunlock if seasoned players pepper them with the right attacks in the right places. A smart move would be to provide 8* versions of the overall monster roster, bringing the 'chaff' monsters up to par with some of the super-powered end-game beasts that have been added to the title post-launch. I think this would efficiently nail both content variation and difficulty concerns in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>As the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-series-helps-capcom-achieve-12th-consecutive-year-of-increased-profit">continues to help Capcom meet various sales targets</a> (and<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-rises-beyond-another-impressive-milestone-in-first-month"> perform incredibly well</a> in its own right), the optics of the developer listening to fan feedback and attempt to rectify launch window wobbles is certainly welcomed. The rest of the roadmap - which, currently, runs until 'this winter' - promises more monsters and even more 'challenging hunts', something that the community has been gnashing for since it put <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-details-next-monster-hunter-wilds-update-as-steam-reviews-continue-overwhelmingly-negative-plunge">Seregios and Lagiacrus</a> to bed at the beginning of July.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-revised-roadmap]]></content:encoded>

            <p>PlayStation and Guerrilla's Horizon franchise, which kicked off in 2017 with the debut of Zero Dawn, and plunged us all into a world that was both primal and futuristic at the same time, has now surpassed 38m copies sold.</p>
<p>The news comes as part of Sony's recently filed legal complaint against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>, where the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">company accused the Chinese technology conglomerate of ripping off its Horizon video game franchise with its upcoming release Light of Motiram</a>.</p>

<p>Tucked away within the filing is text which reads: </p>
<p>"The Horizon franchise is immensely successful and widely distributed. The Horizon franchise has sold over 38m copies globally. There would be no question that Tencent had access to the Horizon franchise when it created Light of Motiram, even if it had not expressly approached [Sony Interactive Entertainment] with a request to license [Sony Interactive Entertainment's] intellectual property rights in the franchise."</p>
<p>While Zero Dawn and its sequel were originally PlayStation exclusives, they both subsequently released on PC. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Remastered, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawns-remaster-arrives-in-october-and-itll-cost-10-to-upgrade">which offered a souped up version of the original release</a>, was also launched last year.</p>
<p>As well as the two mainline games, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-horizon-forbidden-west-burning-shores-is-a-visual-masterclass">Horizon series also has DLC</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-call-of-the-mountain-review-a-visually-spectacular-introduction-to-the-psvr2">VR release Call of the Mountain</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-review">brickified Lego Horizon Adventures</a>.</p>
<p>To compare Horizon's latest sales number with another of Sony's properties, in 2022 PlayStation announced that <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/22q2_sonyspeech.pdf">Santa Monica's God of War reboot had surpassed 23m units sold</a>. That same year, the company announced that its sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-sells-51m-copies-in-first-week">God of War Ragnarök had sold 5.1m copies in its first week</a>, making it officially the fastest-selling first-party PlayStation title to date.</p>
<p>By November 2023, PlayStation revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> had sold through more than 15m units worldwide across both PlayStation 4 and PS5. This would by now bring the God of War games to a sales total of in excess of 38m units.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a> is working on a new live-service game, despite the high profile flop of Suicide Squad last year.</p>
<p>A new job for an executive producer at WB Games Montréal has been <a href="https://wbgamesmontreal.com/en/jobs/r000096070/">listed</a>, which includes mention of development "from concept to post-launch live operations", and the experience required includes "deep understanding of the full game development lifecycle, including live services".</p>
<p>While the game itself isn't specified, it will be a "high-quality AAA game based on one of the iconic IPs from the vast Warner Bros. and DC Comics catalogue".</p>

<p>WB Games Montréal previously developed DC game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gotham-knights">Gotham Knights</a>, which - while not live-service - was another flop for the company. In December last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gotham-knights-developer-warner-bros-games-montreal-slashes-99-jobs">99 developers from the studio were laid off</a>.</p>
<p>Now it seems it's beginning to ramp up development on its next project.</p>
<p>Back in February, DC boss James Gunn confirmed he'd been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dc-boss-in-talks-with-rocksteady-and-netherrealm-to-develop-dc-universe-games">in talks with both Rocksteady and NetherRealm to develop new games in the DC Universe</a>.</p>
<p>It's unknown if WB Games Montréal is also working on a DC game. In June, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-restructures-leadership-team-following-new-focus-on-game-of-thrones-dc-harry-potter-and-mortal-kombat">Warner Bros. Games announced a shift in leadership</a> as it refocuses its efforts on its biggest franchises: DC, Mortal Kombat, Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>The DC Universe is perhaps the most likely candidate for another live-service game. However, this would follow the failures of Rocksteady's Suicide Squad, which struggled to find an audience. That resulted in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flop-leads-to-41-drop-in-warner-bros-gaming-revenue">41 percent drop in Warner Bros. gaming revenue</a> last year, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms">layoffs at the studio later in the year due to it underperforming</a>.</p>
<p>While Suicide Squad remains online, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-final-chapter-brings-game-to-a-cheap-end">received its final piece of content at the start of the year</a>.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">cancelled its Wonder Woman game from Monolith earlier this year</a> due to a "strategic change in direction", with Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and Warner Bros. Games San Diego all closing.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-is-working-on-another-live-service-game-despite-suicide-squad-flop]]></content:encoded>
