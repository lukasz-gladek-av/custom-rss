            <p>Amazon's live action God of War series has found its Kratos, and it's a name you may already recognise from the franchise.</p>
<p>Ryan Hurst has been cast as Kratos in the upcoming show from Sony Pictures Television and Amazon MGM Studios. Along with his live action credits, which include as Gerry Bertier in Remember the Titans and Opie Winston in Sons of Anarchy, Hurst also portrayed Thor in 2022's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>, for which he scored himself a BAFTA nomination.</p>

<p>Sharing the news of Hurst's casting, game developer <a href="https://x.com/SonySantaMonica/status/2011529734682010108">Sony Santa Monica said</a>: "We're excited to see his take on Kratos as he joins the legendary ranks of T.C. Carson and Christopher Judge who have each shaped this character in unforgettable ways."</p>
<p>Speaking of Judge - who played Kratos in God of War 2018 and its sequel - the actor also sent his congratulations to Hurst. "You’re gonna be great… BOI !!!" he <a href="https://x.com/iamchrisjudge/status/2011575459436454176">wrote on social media</a>, with an accompanying heart emoji. Of course, Judge's booming call to Kratos' son Atreus with a simple "Boy!" is one of God of War's most memorable lines.</p><p>As for the series, it will follow the path of Santa Monica's most recent Norse-based God of War games. "God of War follows father and son Kratos and Atreus as they embark on a journey to spread the ashes of their wife and mother, Faye. Through their adventures, Kratos tries to teach his son to be a better god, while Atreus tries to teach his father how to be a better human," <a href="https://press.amazonmgmstudios.com/us/en/press-release/ryan-hurst-tapped-to-play-kratos-in-prime-videos-i">reads the show's official logline</a>.</p>

<p>Last month, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/emmy-winning-shogun-director-joins-amazons-live-action-god-of-war-series">Frederick E.O. Toye will direct the first two episodes of the upcoming God of War series</a>. Toye's works include Amazon's acclaimed Fallout series, and The Walking Dead. Meanwhile, in 2023, Toye won the Emmy for outstanding directing for a drama series for his work on Shōgun's ninth episode, Crimson Sky.</p>
<p>The director joined showrunner and former Battlestar Galactica executive producer Ronald D. Moore on the upcoming series. Moore hasn't always been involved with the God of War TV show, only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer">joining the project towards the end of last year</a> following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-reportedly-starting-from-scratch-as-showrunner-departs">departure of the original team</a>.</p>
<p>We still don't have a release window for the first season, however a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written">second season of God of War has already been greenlit at Amazon</a>. Now I just wonder who will play Atreus…</p>
