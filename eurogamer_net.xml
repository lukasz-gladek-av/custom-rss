            <p>Just weeks after release, an unspecified number of Wildlight's Highguard development team has been laid off.</p>
<p>The studio's live-service hero shooter will not be shut down, Wildlight has confirmed to Eurogamer, but instead be given to a "core group of developers" to keep the game going.</p>

<p>In the statement shared with Eurogamer this morning, Wildlight wrote: "Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game."</p>
<p>The Highguard studio added it is "proud of the team, talent, and the product" it had created. "We're also grateful for players who gave the game a shot, and those who continue to be a part of our community," Wildlight concluded.</p><p>While Wildlight did not say how many members were affected by today's layoffs, posts on the likes of LinkedIn suggest it was the majority of the team. "Unfortunately, along with most of the team at Wildlight, I was laid off today," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alex-graner-a37262114_alex-graners-resume-activity-7427480816940892161-hmDh/">level designer Alex Graner wrote</a>. "This one really stings as there was a lot of unreleased content I was really looking forward to that I and others designed for Highguard."</p>
<p>Tech artist Josh Sobel was also impacted by the Wildlight layoffs. "It was the best team I've ever worked with, and I've never put so much of myself into a project before," <a href="https://x.com/Joshiepoo25/status/2021732021127852097">Sobel wrote</a>. "I wouldn't trade the past 2.5+ yrs for anything."</p>
<p>In a follow up post, Sobel said they had "LOVED working at Wildlight", and it is now "hard to envision going up from here", likening today's news to the end of a romantic relationship. "You can't think about dating right after a breakup. It wasn't just a gig to me. 2.5yrs of working towards a promising, rose-tinted future, with the most passionate and efficient devs on the planet. We fucking MADE THAT SHIT! Fast."</p>

<p>"I don't think gamers really understand just how special this group of talented devs was. There were stumbles, as any new team would face, but our ability to execute on goals and pivot at a moment's notice was unmatched. I am devastated that this team as a complete unit can no longer be," Sobel continued.</p><p>"We accomplished a lot, and I couldn't be more proud. But it's hard to believe it's over. Hard to believe that this was the result of all our efforts. I wish the best of luck to everyone who remains at Wildlight.</p>
<p>"If the numbers climb, I'll be the first in line to apply again."</p>
<p>"I join my incredible Wildlight teammates in having been laid off," Highguard's social and community lead <a href="https://x.com/alex_frostwolf/status/2021745874435813748">Alex Frostwolf also shared</a>. "Highguard is the story of us: a group of talented, like-minded folks on an adventure into the unknown. Much like our Wardens who get back up after losing a fight, we too will rise again for our next adventures."</p>

<p>Highguard was announced back in December, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">closing out Geoff Keighley's trailer-filled The Game Awards</a>. Coming from several former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">Highguard quickly had a large influx of players on its release earlier this week</a>, however there were a few complaints as well, with many disappointed with areas such as map size and the 3v3 game format. The studio sought to address these issues with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguards-latest-update-includes-new-warden-ekon-who-can-ride-himself-yes-really">a number of content updates and patches</a>, while also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-gets-permanent-5v5-mode">making its once-limited-time 5v5 mode a permanent feature</a>.</p>
<p>Since its slightly rocky debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developers-defend-as-complaints-pile-up">other developers across the industry voiced their support for Highguard</a>, with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded studio 1047 Games stating: "No game is perfect on day one."</p>
