<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> features a rejig of the series' usual controls due to the addition of being able to go prone.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4TA6gKaTvtOC1mOjZIxCZd">blog</a> published today that goes into detail on Shadows' parkour system, developer Ubisoft noted that the Assassin's Creed franchise's typical crouch and dodge buttons have been swapped. 
</p>
<p>
This change is due to the mapping of the prone ability to the same button as crouch, which now sits on the X button on a standard Xbox controller. Tapping X now makes your character crouch, while holding X will make you go prone. 
</p>
<p>
The ability to dodge, roll, and drop down while parkouring is now mapped to the B button instead.
</p>
<p>
"In Shadows, dodge has been merged with parkour down mechanics, which unlocks a whole bunch of new parkour moves," Shadows' associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois said. 
</p>
<p>
"This new mapping also disconnects stance-switch (eg. standing, crouching, prone) from parkour, ensuring you can use any stances without accidentally going down a rooftop when you don't want to."
</p>
<p>
Many traditional Assassin's Creed parkour moves return as expected, including the ability to perform a recovery roll to reduce impact and noise when landing from height. 
</p>
<p>
The ability to climb down has been augmented by another, flashier, option to perform a directional dodge over a ledge, meanwhile:

<p>
If you're high enough to take fall damage, an additional prompt when parkouring downwards will be required. Of course, the franchise's handy hay bales are still present to cushion your fall in certain spots.

Finally, here's a look at Shadows protagonist Naoe demonstrating the new prone position. You can, of course, assassinate enemies while prone. Thus:

<p>
One other big change within Shadows is that only some surfaces will be climbable. This is a change to how various recent Assassin's Creed entries have let you scamper all over cliffs and up sheer rock faces, influenced in part by the Shadows' addition of a grappling hook. In short, it means you'll need to look more carefully for surfaces that have physical handholds.
</p><p>
"This is a pretty big deal for us," Lemay-Comtois says. "This means we had to be more thoughtful about creating interesting parkour highways and afforded us more control about where Naoe can go, and where Yasuke can't, making our two playstyles even more contrasted."
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows will finally arrive on 14th February after last year's high-profile delay. We recently learnt that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-naoe-has-her-own-speedy-naruto-run">Naoe has a "Naruto run"</a> and that the game will have a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-has-a-canon-mode-story-option-without-narrative-choices">"canon" story option for players who don't like making narrative choices</a>.

            <p>
Former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> staff - who departed the acclaimed video game publisher last September as part of a "mass exodus" - have reportedly established a new company and will be taking over indie label Private Division's portfolio, which was sold by Take-Two last year.
</p>
<p>
Annapurna's entire video game division - responsible for publishing the celebrated likes of Cocoon, Outer Wilds, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sayonara-wild-hearts">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">departed the company late last year</a>, reportedly following a dispute with owner Megan Ellison. At the time, there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurnas-mass-exodus-of-staff-a-baffler-says-company-spokesperson">suggestion</a> all 25 former employees might reunite under a new name, Verset, which was originally intended to be an Annapurna Interactive spin-off before negotiations broke down.
</p>
<p>
And now, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/ex-annapurna-video-game-staff-to-absorb-former-take-two-label-private-division">reports</a> former Annapurna Interactive staff are indeed working together again, as part of a still-unnamed new company, which is said to have inherited the games and franchises of Private Division - the indie-focused label behind the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a> that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-sells-private-division-label-confirms-closure-of-olliolli-world-and-kerbal-space-program-2-studios">sold by Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two Interactive</a> in November.
</p>
<p>
At the time, Take-Two said it had made the decision to sell the label so it could focus its resources on "growing our core and mobile businesses for the long-term", and that the unnamed buyer had purchased the rights to "substantially all" of Private Division's live and unreleased titles - with the exception of Moon Studios' No Rest for the Wicked.
</p><p>
According to Bloomberg's latest report - which cites "people familiar" with the matter - Private Division's buyer was Texas-based private equity firm Haveli Investments. Haveli reportedly then struck a deal with ex-Annapurna employees to fund their new company and place them in charge of distributing the former Private Division titles. These are include the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kerbal-space-program">Kerbal Space Program</a> series, upcoming Lord of the Rings farming game Tales of the Shire, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-studio-game-freak-creating-new-action-adventure-ip-with-private-division">Pokémon developer Game Freak's new action-adventure IP</a>.
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg adds the new arrangement will likely result in a number of layoffs among the approximately 20 Private Division employees Haveli inherited as part of its purchase,  although specifics are reportedly still to be finalised.
</p>
<p>
As for what remains of Annapurna Interactive, the publisher previously said it was hiring to fill vacancies left following last year's mass exodus, and that it was "focused on moving forward". Annapurna's future projects - which all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/developers-rush-to-reassure-players-of-forthcoming-releases-following-annapurna-interactive-mass-exodus">appear to be unaffected</a> despite last September's events - include the likes of Mixtape from Beethoven and Dinosaur, Wanderstop from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a> creator Davey Wreden, and No Code's Silent Hill: Townfall.
</p>
<p>
Annapurna Interactive's first in-house title, Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth, seemingly faces more significant challenges, however. Game director Chelsea Hash and all other full-time members of the development team reportedly left amid last year's departures, but the company said work would continue despite these setbacks.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A new report from People Make Games has detailed disturbing allegations of abuse towards employees at Indonesian studio Brandoville, a company used for art and animation support in games such as Age of Empires 4 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.</p>
<p>In 2021, People Make Games <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm7KUE1Kwts">reported on crunch culture and the industry's reliance on outsourcing</a> to external developers in order to meet deadlines. Brandoville Studios was one such developer. Little has changed in the industry since that report, but Brandoville's closure a few months ago has lead its employees to now share further stories of their experiences at the studio.</p>
<p>At the centre of this report is Christa Sydney, who worked at the company from 2019 until 2024 and says she was subjected to mental and physical abuse by commissioner Kwan Cherry Lai, wife of Brandoville CEO Ken Lai, who ran day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>The full report can be watched in the below video, though please note it contains some incredibly harrowing content and footage.</p>

<p>Sydney describes how Cherry Lai took her under her wing following a dispute early in her career, but how this led to toxic abuse. Initially, Lai imposed a strict working schedule on employees and would purposefully divide employees through gossip and demeaning words, Sydney said.</p>
<p>Sydney was actually part of People Make Games' previous report, but says she was later forced by Lai to film a statement in support of Brandoville against her will. Other employees felt she was being brainwashed, it's reported.</p>
<p>Sydney now says she was then continuously abused by Lai, including during a work trip to the XDS '22 conference where Lai micromanaged her time and only allowed her to sleep for a few minutes over the course of four days leading up to the event. Further abuse included imposing daily Christian worship, forcing Sydney to write lines like a schoolchild, daily check-ins over WhatsApp of her outfits as part of "quality control", and humiliating her in front of colleagues.</p>
<p>Eventually Lai's abuse became physical, forcing Sydney to film herself slapping her face 100 times as punishment, or hitting her head against a door frame until she was concussed before forcing an apology.</p>
<p>Another employee, Caesarion Balthazar, had an arrangement with Lai where she would take part of his salary to assist with his spending habits. This led to her, in Balthazar's words, stealing an amount of money equivalent to a month's salary. Additionally, Balthazar says he was told he owed money for expensive training programmes he hadn't yet taken when he tried to leave the company.</p><p>A third employee, Syifana Afiati, also says she was abused by Lai during her time at Brandoville from 2019 to 2024. Afiati fell pregnant, but was repeatedly overworked by Lai. At one point during the pregnancy Afiati says she was taken to hospital due to an issue, but was still asked to come into the office and work - to which she declined. Afiati's son was born two months prematurely and sadly died four months later in intensive care, however Lai still expected her to work and provided no sympathy or support from the company.</p>
<p>In August 2024, Brandoville Studios went into liquidation, though Cherry and Ken Lai convinced a handful of employees to stay and begin a new company: LaiLai Studios. Sydney was one such employee, but says she was subsequently subjected to direct physical violence from Cherry Lai on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>Sydney eventually escaped and compiled evidence against Lai. Media reports in Indonesia went viral, which finally lead to police investigations. This was required due to the local phrase "no viral, no justice", stemming from mistrust in the police and justice system.</p>
<p>In response to the allegations, Cherry Lai issued a statement to People Make Games, bizarrely stating: "To me my part of the story is not important, as long as my team are good and safe now." However, further discussion was declined.</p><p>Other employees claimed Ken Lai was Cherry's "biggest enabler" and should've done more to stop this abuse. Sydney and others however say they believe Ken is yet another victim of Cherry's abuse and his silence comes from a place of fear.</p>
<p>The report concludes by noting how the treatment of outsourced workers goes largely unnoticed and unremarked upon by the video games industry due to its discomfort discussing outsourced work, despite it being a crucial part of game development. Eurogamer has contacted Microsoft and Ubisoft for comment on their connections to Brandoville.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> developer Rocksteady has quietly suffered another round of layoffs, this time just before the end of 2024.
</p>
<p>
Half a dozen staff impacted by the redundancies have spoken to Eurogamer to confirm the job losses, under condition of anonymity to protect their careers. 
</p>
<p>
Roles impacted include members of Rocksteady's programming and artist teams, as well as more QA staff. 
</p>
<p>
The job losses follow an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms">earlier round of redundancies at Rocksteady that Eurogamer first reported back in September</a>, when the company's QA team was nearly halved in size from 33 to 15 people. One staff member made redundant at the time said they had discovered they'd lost their job in the middle of their paternity leave.

<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Warner Bros. for comment on this latest round of layoffs, but has so far not received a response. The publisher previously did not publicly acknowledge September's layoffs, either.
</p>
<p>
2024 was a difficult year for Rocksteady, as the company continued to support Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League with the remainder of its post-launch content schedule despite low player numbers.
</p>
<p>
Warner Bros. previously said it had lost around $200m (£160m) on the game. Currently, it's unclear what Rocksteady will work on next.
</p>
<p>
In early December, the developer acknowledged <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deathstroke-kicks-off-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-final-announced-season">it would not continue updating Suicide Squad with any new content in 2025</a>, though servers will remain online for the forseeable future.
</p>
<p>
The commercial failure of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has seen staff lose jobs on the other side of the pond, also. December also saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gotham-knights-developer-warner-bros-games-montreal-slashes-99-jobs">job losses at Batman: Arkham Origins and Gotham Knights studio Warner Bros. Games Montreal,</a> where 99 jobs were reportedly eliminated. The majority of these positions are believed to have been supporting Rocksteady with additional content for Suicide Squad.

            <p>Horses - the cursed horror game from Saturnalia developer Santa Ragione and directed by Andrea Lucco Borlera - is still coming, it is just taking a little longer to get out of the gates than first anticipated.</p>
<p>Horses sees players take on the role of a summer worker at a farm. This sounds safe enough, and after all, it's only for two weeks - but there is something much darker and downright unsettling lying beneath the surface.</p>
<p>"Will you survive the summer, or will the farm claim yet another victim? In any case, we're sure your summer working experience will be truly unforgettable..." reads the official blurb.</p>

<p>Horses was initially announced back in 2023, with a suitably unsettling trailer which showed off the game's silent movie-like style and a host of naked humans with horse masks on their heads. At this time, it was slated for a release in 2024 which, obviously, has been missed.</p>
<p>Thankfully though, Horses has not been silently cancelled. Santa Ragione has confirmed to Eurogamer the upcoming game will now be released this year, and a demo is also on the cards.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately we had to delay the game to 2025," studio director Pietro Righi Riva told me. "[We're] not ready to talk about the reasons for the delay yet, but will absolutely keep you posted. By end of Q2 2025 we'll have a date for both the demo and the full release of the game."</p>
<p>So, stay tuned for more information on Horses soon.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-indie-preview-special-edition">Chris had a go with Horses last year</a>, calling it "magnetically sinister" following time with the game.</p>
<p>"It's a simpler thing in practise than some of Santa Ragione's previous games - effectively you are waking up and slowly carrying out simple, if escalating strange tasks each day, like watering plants, feeding the dog, or, erm, burying bodies, as a story takes shape around you - but the magic here is in the atmosphere and tone," he wrote.</p>
<p>"It's also a rare attempt at using actual, suspended meaning in a game. You'll need to bring something of your own to the farmhouse table here, and meet this thing halfway."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
