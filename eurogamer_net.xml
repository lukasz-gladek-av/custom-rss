            <p>Nintendo has added another title to its Switch Online catalogue of games.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fire-emblem-sacred-stones">Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</a> has been added for those of us with the Expansion Pack. It is available via the Game Boy Advance section.</p>
<p>"Guide Eirika and Ephraim on their twin quest to rebuild Renais," Nintendo wrote on social media. You can check out a trailer for Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones on Switch Online below.</p>

<p>"In a world of dragons and magic, you must always be ready for battle. Take advantage of the terrain and the weapon in your hand, and attack enemies either from afar using magic or up close with your sword. Each weapon has its own strength and weakness, so choose wisely when attacking your opponent, because you don't want to be caught off guard," reads the trailer's official blurb.</p>
<p>"Build the perfect army. Do you want a pegasus rider or a wyvern rider? An assassin or a rogue? Upgrade your troops to different classes, each with their own skills and weapons, and save the land from the forces of darkness!"</p>

<p>In addition, over the weekend Nintendo asked us all to accept a quest, by highlighting that both The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages are available to play via Switch Online. These <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-classic-game-boy-color-zelda-titles-arrive-on-nintendo-switch-online">games arrived on the service back in 2023</a>, but I am a fan so I am echoing Nintendo and suggesting you give these a go.</p>

            <p>Pedro Pascal, who plays Joel in HBO's The Last of Us adaptation, has shared his thoughts on the shocking events from this week's episode.</p>
<p><strong>Please note, there will be major spoilers for The Last of Us below. </strong></p>

<p>During the early hours of Monday morning for those of us here in the UK, the second episode of The Last of Us season two aired. It was a packed showing, with more infected than you can shake a stick at. But, even though the siege of Jackson was surely an suspenseful and emotionally impactful story beat, there is one moment in particular that has grabbed the hearts of viewers and torn them  into a million pieces - Joel's death.</p>
<p>As in The Last of Us Part 2, in the show Joel is killed with a golf club by Abby, a former Firefly seeking revenge for the death of her father.</p>
<p>In the season one finale,  Joel massacred the Fireflies in Salt Lake City in a bid to save Ellie, his surrogate daughter. And now, the time has come for him to face the consequences of those actions. Abby - played in the show by Kaitlyn Dever - arrives in Jackson with a group of fellow former Fireflies to even the score. And she does, beating Joel until finally dealing a killing strike to the neck with a golf club. It's a hard watch.</p>
<p>But, what is it like for Pascal and the rest of The Last of Us' cast and crew? "I'm in active denial," <a href="https://ew.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-pedro-pascal-shocker-kaitlyn-dever-bella-ramsey-on-set-exclusive-11717893">Pascal told EW</a>, following the episode's debut.</p>
<p>"I realise this more and more as I get older, I find myself slipping into denial that anything is over. I know that I'm forever bonded to so many members of the experience and just have to see them under different circumstances, but never will under the circumstances of playing Joel on The Last of Us.</p>
<p>"And, no, I don't spend a lot of time thinking about it because it makes me sad."</p>
<p>But while it may make the actor sad, Pascal believes the fact that this narrative has affected and pained so many people is a "brilliant achievement of the storytelling".</p>
<p>"I have nothing but respect for the level of investment that people have in a video game or a TV show or movie or book. I experience that myself. I've flung books across the room because its impact is so profound on me and experiencing the story," <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/pedro-pascal-bella-ramsey-joel-death-last-of-us-1236373640/">Pascal said</a>.</p>

<p>The show has made a few tweaks to The Last of Us Part 2's narrative - for example having Dina on patrol with Joel that day, rather than his brother Tommy. Another change made by the showrunners was to have Bella Ramsey's Ellie drag herself over to Joel's dead body, an image that will stay with me for a long time to come. According to showrunner Craig Mazin, this moment was "in there from the very beginning, draft one". This is because Ellie at this moment also believes she is going to die.</p>
<p>"Ellie's been kicked in the ribs. She's clearly very injured. She has no reason to think she's going to survive," <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-joel-dies-pedro-pascal-1236372785/">Mazin told Variety</a>.</p>
<p>"She's not crawling over there just to say goodbye. She's crawling over there so she could be with him in death. That's where she wants to be, and it's when she takes his hand. We've seen her do it before. Bella Ramsey, geez."</p>

            <p>
Bethesda will finally show off its long-awaited The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake today.
</p>
<p>
Teaser imagery can now be seen on Bethesda's social media channels pointing to today's date, 22nd April, and a time: 4pm UK. (That's 11am Eastern or 8am Pacific if you live across the pond.)
</p>
<p>
Bethesda then links to its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> and YouTube pages, directing you to watch the game's announcement trailer when it drops. But when will the game itself be available?
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">Eurogamer previously reported</a>, amidst a sea of leaks, Bethesda has been planning to announce and shadow drop the game this week on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including via Game Pass.

<p>
Bethesda's Oblivion Remaster has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-reportedly-set-for-imminent-reveal">one of gaming's worst kept secrets over recent months</a>, with screenshots popping up in the files of developer Virtuos' website this month, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-references-now-found-on-bethesdas-website">references to the game on Bethesda's own site</a> just days ago.

<p>
That's not to mention the years of references to the project <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-bethesda-roadmap-reveals-unannounced-releases-including-dishonored-3">spotted in Microsoft documents</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-details-surface-as-leaker-suggests-its-coming-in-june">whispered by a former developer</a>.
</p>
<p>
Over the long weekend, the leaks continued. Fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1k3tvxy/oblivion_remake_steamdb_listing_leaked/">spotted a SteamDB listing</a> for the game, while others claimed it had suddenly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1k3sclu/oblivion_remastered_appearing_on_steam_accounts/">turned up in their Steam accounts</a>. Others noticed that the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k4b068/esrb_oblivion_entry_last_updated_50_minutes_ago/">US ratings board listing had suddenly been updated</a> too.
</p>
<p>
The Oblivion Remake is expected to be a new version of Bethesda's classic Elder Scrolls game built from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5 by port studio Virtuos.
</p>
<p>
According to an earlier leak by a ex-Virtuos developer, the game will feature newly reworked stamina, sneaking, blocking, archery and hit reaction systems, as well as a fresh HUD.
</p>
<p>
How will it feel to play? Well, here's <a href="https://80.lv/articles/virtuos-the-code-behind-remakes-remasters-adaptations/">Virtuos design director Nicolas Roginski speaking in March 2024 to 80.lv</a> seemingly about the project, without actually naming what it is.
</p>
<p>
"We are working on a very big, unannounced project," Roginski said. "Our approach for the design work of this remake is simple but challenging. It's challenging, mainly because of players' perception of their old memories. We tend to recollect things much better than they really were. 
</p>
<p>
"Hence, if we deliver the reality of what gaming was like in the earlier days, there is a good chance that players will be disappointed because it won't match the 'feeling' of their memories.
</p>
<p>
"To produce a quality remake, we aim at recreating the 'feeling of the memory', not the actual memory. Our design approach at Virtuos is 'Keep, Improve, Create'."
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">Eurogamer's Jim Trinca called on Bethesda to "remake Morrowind, not Oblivion, you cowards"</a>. I fear that ship has now sailed. Tune in at 4pm today to see Jim be disappointed, I guess.
