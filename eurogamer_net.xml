FragPunk - the chaotic, neon-splurged hero shooter from NetEease - has sorted out the "unexpected technical challenges" it ran into earlier this year while trying to get the console version out the door. As such, it's finally coming to Xbox Series X/S and PS5 on 29th April.
</p>
<p>
FragPunk's 5v5 (and free-to-play) shooting action ticks plenty of familiar genre boxes as its 12 distinct Lancer "heroes" hit the battlefield, but it's all made spicier thanks to its card-based modifier system - which sees teams pooling their earned chips at the start of a match to decide which of three possible options they want to inflict on everyone this turn.
</p>
<p>
Choices are pulled form a pool of over 150 Shard Cards, meaning rules can be twisted in sometimes dramatic ways. You might decide to give everyone massive heads, for instance, or remove all guns from play. Or you might choose a card that lets allies lay eggs to restore health or that teleports enemies back to their spawn point after taking damage.

It's got its fair share of issues, as<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fragpunk-could-be-brilliant-if-it-wasnt-so-obsessed-with-being-a-hyper-rewarding-slot-machine"> Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell recently opined</a> after playing FragPunk for a while, but its match-weirdening gimmick is a good one. "For someone who's always found this genre just a little too self-serious," Chris wrote, "this stuff is perfection... all the less desirable stuff from this genre, the toxicity and the almost excessive levels of tension, are quite easily defused when the thing people are shrieking about is called 'Mass Crab Walk'. In playing a highly moreish few hours of it this week, I've had a blast."
</p>
<p>
FragPunk was originally supposed to launch for Xbox and PlayStation early last month, at the same time as PC version. However, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fragpunk-console-launch-delayed-as-neteases-shooter-hits-pc-this-week">opted for a last-minute console delay</a>, blaming "unexpected technical challenges". Now, though, in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/netease-games_we-appreciate-your-patience-lancers-were-ugcPost-7316113990856695808-FrBu">short message shared on social media</a>, the company has confirmed a 29th April release for FragPunk on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, thanking players for their "continuing patience and unwavering support."
</p>
<p>
It's also promising non-specific "gifts" to console players "as a token of our gratitude and to make up for the delay". These will be sent to all newly registered console game accounts and include time-limited event rewards from the start of Season 1 up to 29th April. "A detailed list of all above mentioned rewards and their distribution methods," it adds, "will be shared in a separate announcement before launch."

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s enormous final content update - which has been undergoing public stress testing for a good few months now on PC - finally has a release date, and is launching for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC next Tuesday, 15th April.
</p>
<p>
Patch 8 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-is-getting-new-subclasses-cross-play-and-more-next-year">unveiled last November</a>, with developer Larian Studios promising some major final additions before it waved goodbye to Baldur's Gate 3 and moved onto pastures new. These included cross-play, a photo mode, the l<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-patch-8-adds-long-awaited-split-screen-co-op-for-xbox-series-s">ong-awaited addition of split-screen co-op on Xbox Series S</a>, and most significant of all, new subclasses for each of the game's 12 existing classes.
</p>
<p>
It seemed like quite the parting gift, then, but rather than slinging it at fans and calling it a day, Larian announced Patch 8 would initially undergo public testing ahead of a full release so it could  "catch things before they [could] become an issue once a patch has been released."

<p>
Testing eventually got underway at the end of January <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-eagerly-awaited-patch-8-out-now-on-ps5-but-larian-says-it-shouldnt-be">after a bit of a premature start</a> and, following a steady period of finessing, the end is now firmly in sight. Larian <a href="https://x.com/baldursgate3/status/1910709438018998733">confirmed Patch 8's 15th April arrival in post on social media</a>, noting it'll be marking the occasion with a special <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> stream a day later, taking an especially close look at its new subclasses.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/">discounting the acclaimed RPG by 20 percent on Steam</a> ahead of Patch 8's full release, meaning anyone yet to leap onboard the Baldur's Gate 3 appreciation train can pick it up for £39.99 until 21st April. Which is a bargain route to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-gives-baldurs-gate-3s-withers-a-pair-of-big-naturals-to-celebrate-100m-mod-downloads">Withers' "big naturals"</a>, if you ask me.
</p>
<p>
As to what Larian's doing next, that's still something of a mystery. Last year, the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">confirmed it would moving away from Baldur's Gate and Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> entirely, teasing its new project would be "big and ambitious", and "new in the sense that it is different from the things that we've done before."
</p>
<p>
But while Larian is moving onto new things, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-mammoth-success-drives-larian-to-bumper-207m-pre-tax-profit-for-2023">Baldur's Gate 3's remarkable success</a> inevitably has Dungeons and Dragons owner Wizard of the Coast already dreaming of a sequel. Last April, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wizards-of-the-coast-now-talking-to-lots-of-partners-about-next-baldurs-gate">confirmed it was "now talking to lots of partners"</a> about the next <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> game, but later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-wants-baldurs-gate-4-but-isnt-in-a-hurry">insisted it wasn't "in a hurry" to get a fourth instalment made</a>.
