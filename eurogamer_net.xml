            <p>Happy Bloodborne remake day! Wait let's not get ahead of ourselves. Sony's delivering a State of Play broadcast this evening from 10pm UK time and we'll be covering all of the announcements, as they happen, right here in this article. It's like magic and it's very handy for if you're out but don't want to miss out.</p>
<p>What's more - and as if you needed any encouragement - you can chat along with us. Tell us what you think and how you think the show is going. Give it a rating out of 10 if you like. You don't even have to use a star system.</p>
<p>So what's Sony's plan for the evening? The show will be 40 minutes long and focus on PS5 games made in Japan and Asia, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-announced-for-tomorrow">Sony said yesterday</a>, "alongside a few other exciting updates". The PS5 is just turning five years old, incidentally, which could provide Sony with a moment for a meaningful announcement.</p>
<p>And what more meaningful announcement is there to make, you say, than a Bloodborne remake? What indeed, fair reader, what indeed! After all, wasn't Bloodborne made in Japan? The stars are aligning. The stage is set. Do it, Sony, you cowards - do it!</p>
<p><em>Ahem.</em></p>
<p>PlayStation at 10pm, then. Join us (or risk missing a piece of history!).</p>
