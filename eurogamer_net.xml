Desperate Silksong fans believe a new ARG hinting at the long-awaited game's release date has begun, involving the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and a slice of cake.
</p>
<p>
Let's break it down. Two days ago, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> and Silksong co-creator William Pellen updated his social media handle, profile name and picture on X. 
</p>
<p>
His handle is now @everydruidwaswr, his name is now "little bomey" and his profile picture is a slice of cake. It's this slice of cake which fans have now linked to Switch 2.
</p>
<p>
Why? Well, Pellen went on to tweet: "something big is coming. keep your eyes closed tomorrow". Tomorrow meaning the 16th January - which was of course when Switch 2 was announced. 
</p>
<p>
So maybe Pellen was just in the know, as a lot of people were, about the Switch 2 reveal? Or, Silksong fans say, maybe there's more! 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">something big is coming. keep your eyes closed tomorrow</p>— little bomey (@everydruidwaswr) <a href="https://twitter.com/everydruidwaswr/status/1879751713621725206?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
A Google reverse image search on the slice of cake image does throw up something odd: that it comes from a recipe page posted on 2nd April 2024. That's exactly a year ahead of 2nd April 2025, when Nintendo will hold a huge Switch 2 Nintendo Direct and unveil the console's game line-up properly.
</p><p>
Could it be deliberate? Over on the Silksong <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1i31gas/what_we_know_so_far_about_the_william_pellen/">reddit</a>, fans say developer Team Cherry has dropped similarly labyrinthine hints previously. Fans also reason that an appearance in the Switch 2 Direct would be a reasonable place for the game to finally materialise. 
</p>
<p>
Silksong's launch made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-moments-set-to-shape-video-games-in-2025">Eurogamer's list of our most anticipated moments of 2025</a> - if it actually launches this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-will-no-longer-launch-in-first-half-of-2023">following years of delays</a>.
</p>
<p>"Silksong is the fast-paced and fluid sequel Hollow Knight deserves," we said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-the-fast-paced-and-fluid-sequel-hollow-knight-deserves">after playing a demo of the game</a> - all the way back in 2019.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Mario Kart fans are pouring over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">yesterday's reveal of a new entry in Nintendo's racing series for Switch 2</a> - and have come up with a few more clues on how the game might play. 
</p>
<p>
Our first look at Mario Kart 9 - or whatever it ends up being called - was, on the surface, a pretty straightforward affair. We saw one racetrack, 12 returning characters and not a lot else.
</p>
<p>
Except for the fact, as we noted yesterday, there are now 24 spaces on the track's starting grid. Huh! Let's hope Nintendo has improved its online servers to allow for 24 players.
</p>
<p>
Overnight, fans have analysed the trailer in more detail - with an eye to working on what Mario Kart 9's main 'gimmick' might be. We've had underwater racing and gliders, anti-gravity tracks, and now... could Mario Kart 9's big change revolve around conserving fuel?
</p><p>
One fan spotted a rather conspicuous fuel tank added to the side of Mario's otherwise familiar kart, labelled "1-UP Fuel". The same fan also pointed to the mysterious glowing power-up seemingly placed outside a pit-stop burger joint - perhaps a fuel-replenishing power-up.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">haven't seen anyone else talk about this but the gimmick of mario kart 9 is definitely a fuel tank<br>karts have conspicuous fuel tanks now and there's something on this track that doesnt look like an item box <br>it'll be a resource you can use freely to boost <a href="https://t.co/bhGnEOe8Xo">pic.twitter.com/bhGnEOe8Xo</a></p>— chloe (@payapaberii) <a href="https://twitter.com/payapaberii/status/1879956048762794250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

<p>
Another fan pointed to the presence of a large gas station by the track itself, with a large sign that reads: "Fire Flower Gas Station". 
</p> <div>

<p>
Other changes  noted yesterday include slight tweaks to Mario and Donkey Kong's character designs. (We think they now deliberately look more similar to those seen in the Super Mario Bros. Movie!)
</p>
<p>
For lots more chat about Mario Kart 9 - including our theories on whether the game might be open-world, or feature user-made courses, be sure to watch the latest episode of the Eurogamer Newscast, below.

            <p>Nintendo said it believes "in giving proper credit" to those who work on its games, after recently omitting the original development team at Retro Studios from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>'s credits.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is a remaster of 2010's Wii release, which was originally developed by Retro and published by Nintendo. This year's remaster, however, has been helmed by Forever Entertainment, which is front and centre of the new release's credits. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-removes-retro-studios-staff-from-credits">Nintendo has omitted the original developers from the ending</a>,  simply stating the HD remaster was "based on the work" of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country-returns">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a> team.</p>
<p>Now, in a statement to Eurogamer regarding its crediting policy, Nintendo said: "We believe in giving proper credit for anyone involved in making or contributing to a game's creation, and value the contributions that all staff make during the development process."</p>

<p>Nintendo did not state why then it had still omitted the original Donkey Kong Country Returns team from the HD remaster's credits. We have asked for further clarification on this, and will update if we hear more.</p>
<p>Nintendo has previously been called out for missing those who worked on a game from its credits. </p>
<p>In 2023, former Retro Studios engineer Zoid Kirsch said he was "let down" by the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-retro-studios-engineer-let-down-by-metroid-prime-remasters-lack-of-credit-for-original-team">lack of individual credits in Metroid Prime Remastered</a>. Meanwhile, last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/external-translators-hired-for-nintendo-projects-bemoan-lack-of-credit-in-almost-every-big-title">translators contracted from firms outside of Nintendo voiced their disappointment at not being credited for work on high-profile games</a>.</p>

<p>We recently awarded Donkey Kong Country Returns HD three out of five stars.</p>
<p>"A straightforward remaster that struggles to outshine the Switch port of Tropical Freeze, but Returns HD is still a challenging and satisfying platformer that stands the test of time," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review-a-formidable-platformer-that-still-holds-up-today">Eurogamer's Donkey Kong Country Returns HD review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
