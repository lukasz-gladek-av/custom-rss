            <p>Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast-owned studio Atomic Arcade has reportedly been shut down.</p>
<p>Word of the studio's fate comes from numerous LinkedIn posts citing the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brandon-miller-3734ba77_hi-everyone-im-currently-exploring-new-ugcPost-7429285429494984704-qbn8/">"recent closure" of Atomic Arcade</a>.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately Hasbro has made the call to close Atomic Arcade," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/justinkimball_opentowork-activity-7429273899965636608-4DCD/">one such post reads</a>. "I was only with the studio for about a year, but from the start I felt the studio had tons of talent and potential. I'll miss working with the team we had, and wish everyone the best."</p>
<p>Atomic Arcade was working on a game based around GI Joe character Snake Eyes, which for now remains in development despite changes at the studio.</p>
<p>"The Snake Eyes game is not cancelled. The team is currently taking time to evaluate the path forward for the game," a Hasbro representative said in a statement shared with <a href="https://wccftech.com/hasbro-wizards-of-the-coast-reportedly-shut-down-g-i-joe-snake-eyes-game-makers-atomic-arcade/amp/">Wccftech</a>. "While decisions haven't been finalised, we're committed to providing updates as soon as we're able."</p>
<p>Hasbro first announced plans to make a GI Joe game based on Snake Eyes all the way back in 2022, and Atomic Arcade was established. At this time, Atomic Arcade's Ames Kirshen told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/snake-eyes-and-the-evolution-of-adaptation">Eurogamer's sister-site GamesIndustrybiz</a>:</p>
<p>"I always had this great desire to tackle G.I. Joe and take a crack at making an amazing game with the IP because I think there's a lot of potential there... So long story short, we decided to build a studio to support that franchise, to support that game."</p>
<p>Atomic Arcade is not the only studio to be the subject of layoffs this year. Just this weekend, GTFO and Den of Wolves developer 10 Chambers confirmed a "large number" of layoffs, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gtfo-and-den-of-wolves-developer-10-chambers-confirms-large-number-of-layoffs-including-several-of-the-studios-co-founders">which included "several of the studio's co-founders"</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Highlight developer Wildlight was also impacted by layoffs earlier this month, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-not-shutting-down-following-wildlight-layoffs-with-a-core-group-of-members-left-to-support-game">only a "core" group left to work on the free-to-play shooter</a>.</p>

            <p>
As the tech giants' escalating AI arms race continues to impact RAM supplies, Valve has confirmed Steam Deck is the latest machine to face availability issues as a result of memory and storage shortages.
</p>
<p>
Memory shortages and soaring prices are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">direct results of the tech industry's continuing push into AI</a>. Substantial quantities of RAM are required to power AI platforms, so as tech giant including Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta continue to invest in new AI data centres to remain competitive, the demand for RAM has increased dramatically.
</p>
<p>
It's an issue that's already threatening to have a significant impact on consumer electronics. Earlier this year, for instance, Valve <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-admits-its-steam-machine-and-steam-frame-will-be-delayed-due-to-ram-and-storage-price-surges">announced a delay for its new Steam Machines</a>, specifically blaming memory and storage shortages - but it's not just the company's future hardware that's impacted. Valve has also now confirmed its current Steam Deck line-up is similarly affected.
</p>
<p>
As per a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">message on its Steam Deck store page</a>, Steam Deck OLED "may be out-of-stock intermittently in some regions due to memory and storage shortages". At the time of writing, all three Steam Deck models - the 256GB LCD model, as well as the 512GB and 1TB OLED - are unavailable in the US, but supplies in other countries, including the UK, remain available for now. Notably, Valve confirmed it was discontinuing the Steam Deck LCD 256GB back in December, meaning no more stock is being produced.
</p><p>
Valve's dwindling Steam Deck supplies come amid reports that other gaming companies are considering dramatic responses to AI-driven memory shortages. This week, Bloomberg claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-mulling-ps6-delay-while-nintendo-eyes-switch-2-price-hike">Sony is looking to delay the launch of its PS6</a> into 2028 or 2029, while Nintendo is said to be mulling over a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> price increase later this year.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Robert Purchese recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">took a closer look at the issues surrounding RAM</a> and what they might mean for gaming.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hyper-scape">Hyper Scape</a> feels like something that happened ages ago, but Ubisoft's failed battle royale game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-beleaguered-battle-royale-game-hyper-scape-is-shutting-down-in-april">was shut down in April 2022</a> after halting its content updates a year before that. The game itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyper-scape-review-a-battle-royale-as-smart-as-it-is-generic">wasn't anything special</a>, yet no small amount of FPS veterans praised its core traversal and movement mechanics. This is why a passionate fan is attempting to bring it back from the live-service graveyard.</p>
<p>On 16th February, <a href="https://x.com/fiirce">Fiirce</a> on X/Twitter revealed Hyper Scape working offline (with bots that serve as target practice) perfectly fine. That alone is an achievement, as the game's core functionality was tied to Ubisoft's server infrastructure, which was shut down back in 2022. The user underlines this is a very early effort running on a private server, with largely limited alpha access that must be requested and primarily targets players with "reverse engineering experience" that want to help out with the project. You can see the game running below:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hyperscape Revival.<br>Game feels exactly as I left it (perfect).<br>Singleplayer works for now, will be awhile before anything multiplayer works (could be months or even years). Early alpha/private for now.<br>Reach out to me if you have reverse engineering experience and want to help. <a href="https://t.co/EnzhADUTfW">pic.twitter.com/EnzhADUTfW</a></p>— Fiirce (@fiirce) <a href="https://twitter.com/fiirce/status/2023452799439434111?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>Fiirce isn't promising a working release of Hyper Scape anytime soon, as figuring out how to make <em>at least </em>the basic online features work could take "months or even years." That said, it has been getting a lot of traction over at X/Twitter since the gameplay clip was posted, which could summon the required expertise quickly and get a proper reverse-engineering effort going soon.</p>
<p>In any case, there's also the question of whether Ubisoft will step in and shut down the project as many publishers do when fans take over dead IPs to work on non-profit new games or revivals. Nobody's expecting the powers that be to ever revisit Hyper Scape, so this shouldn't bother them, but you never know if another publisher could swoop in and pick up the rights to do <em>something</em>. Remember <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/paragon-the-overprime">Paragon: The Overprime</a>?</p><p>This fan-led revival project joins the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-can-run-on-private-servers-youtube-video-reveals">the experiments some people are doing on Anthem</a> shortly after its death. Live-service games are hard to maintain and make really sustainable, but when these endeavours become so common, you have to wonder if the failed IPs that litter the games industry should be made public instead of thrown into vaults.</p>

            <p>Mewgenics, the cat breeding indie hit from the creators of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a> and The End is Nigh, has broken a rather impressive Steam record.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Mewgenics - which sees players using "tactical" breeding to raise a cat army before sending their feline Frankenstein-like creations into the fray - welcomed 115,428 concurrent players on Steam.</p>
<p>This number probably doesn't mean that much to you on its own, though it is of course an impressive figure. However, Mewgenics' latest concurrent player peak actually means it now has the highest concurrent player count of any roguelike on Steam <em>of all time</em>.</p>
<p>The Steam game with the highest concurrent player count before Mewgenics took the crown was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, Supergiant's sequel to the incredibly successful Hades and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">2025 Game of the Year nominee</a>.</p>
<p>As you can see via the image below, Hades 2 has a concurrent player peak of 112,947, which was reached five months ago. This means Mewgenics has welcomed 2,481 more concurrent players than Steam's previous roguelike record holder (look at me doing maths early in the morning).</p><p>So, yes, Mewgenics is really rather popular, something that has taken co-creators Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel by surprise. On its release, it sold 150k copies in six hours, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-is-a-breakout-hit-on-steam-it-sold-150000-copies-in-six-hours-and-its-already-made-its-development-costs">swiftly making back its development costs</a>. That figure has since increased, and developer Glaiel later revealed Mewgenics had sold half a million units in 36 hours (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tylerglaiel.com/post/3men362utkk2f">in the words of Glaiel</a>, "wtf").</p>

<p>The team has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-dlc-is-coming-but-dont-expect-it-any-time-soon">already confirmed that Mewgenics DLC is planned</a>, though for when we don't yet know. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-console-release-for-steams-cat-breeding-roguelike-hit-mewgenics-is-currently-in-the-works">console version is also on the cards</a>, but again, we don't know when exactly it may materialise.</p>
<p>If you are one of the many already playing Mewgenics on Steam, be sure to check out our guides. Here is one on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/best-mewgenics-classes-tier-list-how-to-unlock">best Mewgenics classes tier list and how to unlock every class</a> to get you started.</p>
