            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> developer Build a Rocket Boy has reportedly started the layoff process at the studio, after an underperforming launch.</p>
<p>The report, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say">written by IGN</a>, states the developer has informed staff the redundancy process has begun, with sources claiming over 100 employees could be impacted.</p>
<p>A source who wished to remain anonymous told IGN the 45-day consultation process had begun, which according to UK law kicks into effect when over 100 layoffs are planned within a 90-day window.</p>

<p>This news comes after a launch which disappointed many eager fans waiting to play the game that had, originally, been touted as a rival to Grand Theft Auto. The game, since its release, has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">plagued with bugs, performance issues</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-crashes-caused-by-a-memory-leak-developer-says-as-it-remains-committed-to-ensuring-all-players-have-a-great-experience">crashes</a>, and what many have called 'dated design'. Right now MindsEye is rated Mostly Negative on Steam, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-hotfix-planned-for-pc-this-week-but-console-players-may-have-to-wait">though a hotfix has been released</a> to improve the game for those still eager to give it a try. However, even after the patch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-mindseye-has-abject-technical-performance-even-after-its-latest-patch">things are still far from perfect</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to its release, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">CEO of Build a Rocket Boy suggested negative reviews had been paid for</a>, though the publisher of MindsEye <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-publisher-doesnt-believe-negative-comments-were-paid-for-despite-developer-suggesting-otherwise">did not share this belief when asked by IGN</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-review">Eurogamer's review of MindsEye</a>, writer Rick Lane wrote: "although it shows some early promise, MindsEye is sunk by a ridiculous story, inconsistent writing, poorly designed mission scenarios, and utterly atrocious combat."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-developer-reportedly-prepping-for-layoffs-after-botched-launch]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> team has delayed its upcoming 2.3 update.</p>
<p>This update was casually announced earlier this month, when CD Projekt revealed  "we are planning another part for the game". At this time, the update was slated for a 26th June release, with more details to come closer to that date.</p>

<p>However, with three days to go before that aforementioned release, CD Projekt has said it needs "more time" to make sure it is totally happy with it.</p>
<p>"We're aiming for a scope similar to Update 2.2," the Cyberpunk 2077 team <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1937135894978253112">wrote on social media</a>. Thanking the community for its patience, the developer said it will "update [us] further as soon as we can", so stay tuned.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-22-adds-new-secrets-expanded-customisation-options-and-more">Cyberpunk 2077's 2.2 update was released towards the end of last year</a>, and included various new features and quality of life improvements, as well as what the developer teased as "secrets". These, it turns out, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-night-city-infiltrated-by-balatros-giggling-joker-in-22-update-secret">included a little nod to Balatro</a>. I wonder what the team's next update will includeâ€¦</p>
<p>Rumours that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-cdpr-isnt-actually-finished-with-cyberpunk-2077-announces-another-update">Cyberpunk 2077 would be getting more content started making the rounds earlier this month</a>, when a LinkedIn post from a developer at Virtuous was circulated online. This post said the developer was working on Cyberpunk 2077 DLC, something that hadn't been announced yet.</p>

            <p>Ashly Burch has played numerous video game characters, one of her most famous being Aloy in Guerrilla's Horizon series. Earlier this year, footage leaked showing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-is-experimenting-with-ai-powered-playstation-characters-ironically-chooses-horizons-aloy-to-demonstrate">Sony employee engaging with an on-screen AI version of the Horizon lead</a>. The employee asked the AI Aloy a number of questions, such as "how are you", to which the character replied she was ok, before she shared some Horizon lore. </p>
<p>The whole thing raised a few eyebrows, especially considering Aloy is a character growing up in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by rogue AI-controlled machines.</p>
<p>Burch herself released a video following this leak, stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-forbidden-west-actress-ashly-burch-responds-to-sonys-controversial-ai-aloy">developer Guerrilla had been in contact with her to say the "demo didn't reflect anything that was actively in development"</a>. She additionally added Sony "didn't use any of [Burch's] performance" for the demo. But, how would she feel if AI <em>was </em>used in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrilla-casually-confirms-horizon-forbidden-west-sequel">the next Horizon game</a>?</p>

<p>"For me, I think that AI as a tool to make things easier on devs would be a great thing. Like, I think I've heard someone say before something like, 'oh, if we used artificial intelligence to help with clean up between the mo-cap stage and importing it into the actual game engine, that could be amazing'. So, things that help streamline the development process [and] help make people's jobs easier, I think is great," Burch told Eurogamer.</p>
<p>That being said, for Burch, "in terms of if someone asked me 'can we make a replica of you that players could interact with ad nausium'," she would "<em>really</em> have to know how [the developer] was going to protect against me saying something awful". This is, of course, something Epic got into hot water with earlier this year, when its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-now-lets-you-chat-with-darth-vader-using-generative-ai-speech">use of AI to recreate James Earl Jones' voice for Fortnite's Darth Vader saw many using the technology to get the Sith lord to cuss</a>.</p>
<p>Burch believes the use of AI "would have to be a conversation" with those involved. "It's such a new technology, so it's difficult to know what applications developers would want to use it for," she said, before adding: "Guerrilla really cares about performance in its games, and I think a universe where Guerrilla just replaces every single actor they have with a robot is not going to happen."</p>
<p>However, Burch says there are some studios who do want to use AI to "generate what they want when they want".</p>
<p>"So, it becomes a conversation of 'what do you want to use this for, what are you trying to get out of this technology. Are you trying to <em>replace </em>my performance? Or are you trying to streamline your process or trying to find out in the pre-production phase how things would sound in my voice?' I think it becomes a 'use case' thing for me."</p>
<p>Burch additionally wants others to get the chances she did when she was starting out as a video games actor. She says she wants others to be able to have this same experience as she has, to say "I want to be a games actor" and to then be able to develop their skills and do just that.</p>
<p>"A lot of those characters that I cut my teeth on, like doing callouts in a MOBA, those things are at risk of being replaced," Burch said.</p>
<p>"I think that kind of work is essential for people to be A) able to make rent, and then B) be able to hone their craft and get better. It's important to me that actors continue to have the opportunity to act," Burch closed, although she appreciates that as a "tool devs can use", AI could have its place.</p>
