            <p>Footage of the next Battlefield game is once again popping up online, this time of its single-player campaign.</p>
<p>Despite requiring participants to sign an NDA before they can get involved, playtest players continue to find a way to share all manner of things, from clips of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhifj5/bf6_campaign/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">gameplay</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhnpdm/all_of_the_bf_labs_subfactions/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">factions</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhny43/gear_customization_heading_in_the_right_direction/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">gear customisation options</a>, and details of its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lh7bzp/how_do_you_feel_about_battle_royale/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">battle royale</a>.</p>
<p>This leak of the single-player campaign seems to be one of the biggest yet, including locations of where players can expect to travel in the solo campaign, and the environments you can explore when you get there.</p>

<p>Some of this information appears to have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhm017/the_entire_menu_of_the_cracked_bf_labs_build/">datamined from the latest Battlefield Lab build</a>. There's plenty of unfinished images and assets, leading some fans to assert the game "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhnpdm/comment/mz5eb63/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">looks like AI slop</a>" or "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhnpdm/comment/mz5djnh/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">fugly</a>" despite numerous statements from EA and the development teams that this is a work-in-progress with placeholder details that will be replaced when the game releases in full.</p> <div>

<p>The same thing happened with the first phase of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">its Battlefield Labs initiative</a>. Despite branding the playtest as the "most ambitious community testing program in franchise history" and requiring participants to sign an NDA, plenty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefields-invite-only-playtest-has-just-begun-and-gameplay-is-already-leaking-online">gameplay footage popped up in various corners of the internet</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reminds-battlefield-players-things-taking-place-in-labs-may-or-may-not-make-their-way-to-the-final-game">EA was not happy</a>, eventually hitting back at a grumpy reddit thread about an unsupported claim about skill-based matchmaking with "Okay, enough".</p>
<p>Pretty much all we officially know about the next Battlefield so far is that it's set in the modern day, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">bring back traditional classes and more focused maps</a> after the unpopular changes made in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>. Beyond that, it's all speculation - although one sleuth scoured the new game's concept art and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-sleuth-seemingly-identifies-location-teased-in-next-games-first-bit-of-concept-art">identified landmarks suggesting it could be set in Gibraltar</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst we don't yet have a release name or date, EA confirmed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-expected-to-release-before-april-2026">expects the series' latest instalment to arrive before April next year</a>. We also recently learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-major-battlefield-reveal-still-set-for-summer-as-mass-effect-bundle-takes-fans-by-surprise">Battlefield 2042 is getting a Mass Effect bundle</a>, as a series exec confirmed there's still a big Battlefield (2025) reveal set to come this summer.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-single-player-campaign-details-leak-online]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Remedy says it's hearing your feedback on FBC: Firebreak "loudly and clearly" and is committed to improving things, particularly the shooter's opening hour, "starting now".</p>
<p>Collating feedback from across social media, Discord, and Steam, the developer - for which Firebreak is its first self-published title - said that while "several things have gone well", "clearly, not everything has". Consequently, its first priority is to improve the game's "first hour experience", making progression faster and more rewarding.</p>

<p>"The game's first hours do not provide a great experience due to a combination of things. Some of this is down to a lack of onboarding (more about that in a bit), explaining the game’s systems, how to take advantage of the tools at your disposal, and a lack of clarity as to what to do in the Jobs and how to do the work effectively," the team <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2272540/announcements/detail/536605349656920275">said</a> in its first patch notes.</p>
<p>"In addition, the power fantasy isn’t great in the first hours of the game as starting (tier 1) weapons feel weak, and unlocking higher-tier weapons requires a bit too much grinding," the studio added. "We can see from the data and are seeing feedback that players who stick around and unlock more powerful tier 3 weapons and Perks, playing on higher Threat levels and Full three zone Job runs, are having a better time."</p>
<p>Because of this, Remedy says it wants to get you "to the fun faster", which also means getting us to the better tools and weapons. With better onboarding, user-interface clarity, and making Jobs easier to access, the studio thinks we'll get a more rewarding start.</p>
<p>That's not all, though.</p>
<p>"We hear you: the grind is too slow," the team added. "You want to try different builds, equip stronger weapons, use Altered Augments and experiment with Perks. Right now, getting to that takes too long.</p>
<p>"The upgrade economy was balanced with players finding a good amount of Lost Assets currency during Jobs, but as the currency (the folders on the ground) does not particularly stand out from the environments, players completely ignore them and are thus earning Lost Assets roughly 3x slower than hoped," the notes admitted. "Then, players do not earn Lost Assets unless they finish a job. If you exit a job midway or disconnect, you'll get nothing. That’s frustrating. We are looking into what we could do about this, but there are no changes to announce yet."</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreak-review">Eurogamer's FBC Firebreak review</a>, we awarded it 3 out of 5 stars, writing: "A bold approach to the concept of work marks this game out as a singular enterprise".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreak-hears-your-criticism-loudly-and-clearly-and-is-fixing-things-starting-now]]></content:encoded>

        <p>But "not the gaming rights".</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Hollywood producer, director, and screenwriter Adi Shankar has acquired the rights to Duke Nukem.</p>
<p>Shankar - who developed both the Castlevania and Devil May Cry animated shows for Netflix - told <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a64929637/adi-shankar-castlevania-devil-may-cry-interview/">Esquire</a> he has "video games in production", and has been approached with "different IPs and companies that want to work with [him]", as well as "obviously more" Devil May Cry. In amongst that is Duke Nukem, albeit "not the gaming rights".</p>

<p>"I got video games in production. Obviously more Devil May Cry," he said. "I'm being approached with different IPs and companies that want to work with me. I bought the rights to Duke Nukem. Not the gaming rights, but I bought it from Gearbox.</p>
<p>"It's a middle finger to everybody. When Duke Nukem blew up, a bunch of people sat around trying to turn it into a brand, when it's just a middle finger. Duke Nukem can't be made by a corporation, because the moment a corporation makes Duke Nukem, it's no longer Duke Nukem. I don't intend on having anyone tell me what to do on this one."</p>
<p>As for his Devil May Cry show? Shankar said Season 1 "had to be the gateway drug", but in Season 2, "the storytelling is going to pivot".</p>
<p>"Season 2 is going to be different, stylistically and tonally, from season 1. Virgil is a big, very important character. It's essentially a new show," Shankar added.</p>
<p>"I have goals. I want to body Arcane, surpass it in viewership... Arcane is the Joker lighting cash on fire, and it's great. With season 2 of Devil May Cry, I want to beat that. Show up to a tank fight with a water balloon and destroy the tank. Because that's cool."</p>
<p>Celebrating Devil May Cry's latest sales milestone, Capcom said the anime had been met with critical acclaim and boasts more than 5.3m views, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-devil-may-cry-animated-series-gets-positive-update-one-week-after-debut">has now been renewed for a second season</a>. Along with Johnny Yong Bosch as Dante, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-voice-actor-kevin-conroy-posthumously-stars-in-netflixs-devil-may-cry-anime">first series of Devil May Cry included legendary Batman voice actor Kevin Conroy as VP Baines</a>.</p>

            <p>Rebel Wolves, the studio from former CD Projekt director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, has dropped a new trailer giving us our first meaningful look at The Blood of the Dawnwalker's gameplay.</p>
<p>Recorded on PC - and clearly labelled as a pre-beta "work-in-progress" - the trailer presents a bumper-length introduction to some of the game's features and gameplay mechanics. You can check it out below:</p>

<p>As well as watching protagonist Coen in action, and some of the gorgeous environments he'll visit, we also get a good long look at his perks menu, too, and learn a little more about how to balance his human qualities with his superhuman ones.
</p>
<p>"Using hexes consumes his health," explains design director, Daniel Sadowski. "The way our magic system works, there's always a price to pay for manipulating reality."
</p>
<p>Rebel Wolves confirmed its first project would be dark fantasy RPG Dawnwalker <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-game-directors-new-studio-confirms-first-project-as-fantasy-rpg-dawnwalker">at the beginning of last year</a>. Described as a "brand-new role-playing saga", it's single-player and open-world, with a "strong focus on story and narrative", casting players as Coen - a "young man turned into a Dawnwalker, forever treading the line between the world of day and the realm of night". You must "fight for your humanity or embrace the cursed powers to save your family".</p>
<p>Alongside Tomaszkiewicz, Rebel Wolves counts former CD Projekt scribe Jakub Szamałek as its narrative director and main writer, with other team members including design director Daniel Sadowski, animation director Tamara Zawada, art director Bartłomiej Gaweł, CFO Michał Boryka, and studio head Robert Murzynowski - who have collectively worked on games such as Cyberpunk, Thronebreaker, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-warrior-2">Shadow Warrior 2</a>, and The Witcher series.</p>
<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series in 2026.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-gameplay-from-former-the-witcher-developers-fantasy-rpg-the-blood-of-the-dawnwalker]]></content:encoded>
