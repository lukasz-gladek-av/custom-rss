            <p>
Three-person Danish developer The Outer Zone and publishing partner <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/11-bit-studios">11 Bit Studios</a> (of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> fame) have unveiled Death Howl, a gorgeously moody melding of turn-based tactical action, deck-building, and "Soulslike" exploration that's coming to PC later this year. 
</p>
<p>
Death Howl is described as a "poignant tale of grief, healing, and resilience", and follows the journey of hunter Ro as she departs her tribe and ventures into a disturbingly realised realm of the spirits in the hope of reuniting with her deceased son.
</p>
<p>It's journey through a land of horrors - of fearsome creatures and grotesque bosses - that combines grid-based, turn-based battles with a deck-building focus, plus open-world exploration across a series of strikingly atmospheric biomes.

<p>As players venture deeper, they'll uncover fragments of Ro's story, steeped in love and loss, alongside forgotten lore. Additionally, each discoverable realm promises unique cards and deck mechanics that'll gradually deepen Death Howl's strategy layer, as well as the likes of shamanic totems that can further enhance a deck.
</p><p>
"The loss of a loved one is universal - an inevitable part of the human experience," The Outer Zone explains. "We believe our narrative approach will resonate with players of all kinds. We've introduced a fresh take on the deck-builder genre, combining it with soulslike exploration and adding compelling lore to leave a lasting impact on anyone who joins Ro on her journey".
</p>
<p>
Death Howl is scheduled to release for Steam later this year, but players can familiarise themselves with its deck-building action and forlorn ambience - amply evident in its announcement trailer - when its demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2825880/Death_Howl/">launches on Steam</a> next Monday, 20th January.

Following yesterday's long-awaited Switch 2 reveal, Nintendo has started opening up registrations for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-switch-2-public-hands-on-tour">previously announced public hands-on play sessions</a>, confirming that attendees will have up to four hours play tie with the new console.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's Switch 2 World Tour, as the company's calling the months-long event, runs from 4th April until sometime in June. It's set to visit 15 cities spanning four continents - Europe, North America, Oceania, and Asia - in that time, starting with Paris and New York.
</p>
<p>
And for those eager to attend and check out Nintendo's new console, <a href="https://experience.nintendo.com/#/events">registrations are starting to go live</a>. Currently, registration is open for most European venues - Paris, London, Milan, Berlin - with other Madrid, Amsterdam, and venues in other territories to follow.

<p>
What's perhaps most notable is the length of time attendees can spend with Switch 2. Anyone looking to go hands-on must select a 60-minute arrival window when they register, but actual play sessions officially last four hours. In Europe, at least - details currently available for North American venues point to significantly shorter play sessions, lasting two and a half hours.
</p><p>
It's worth reiterating registration doesn't guarantee entry to Nintendo's hands-on events, as tickets will be assigned based on a randomly selected draw. You can, however, register as a group - provided everyone attending has a Nintendo Account linked to the same family group.
</p>
<p>
As to what'll be available to play during each session, Nintendo hasn't yet said - but it seems likely a new Mario Kart will be there given its prominence in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">this week's Switch 2 reveal</a>. We can expect more details on the console's launch line-up during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct on 2nd April</a>, but in the meantime, here's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">everything we know so far</a>.
