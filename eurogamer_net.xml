            <p>Tonight, as part of the Kojima Productions 10th Anniversary livestream, called Beyond the Strand, we got a new update on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> franchise. The stream promised to be "a celebratory event" that will include "special guest appearances as well as offer a glimpse into future projects," and it certainly lived up to that promise.</p>
<p>The stream began with a quick recap of Kojima Industries' history so far, from inception through to the announcement and launch of Death Stranding, Death Stranding 2, and the reveals of both OD (2023) and Physint (2024). Towards the end of the project, Guillermo del Toro, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>, George Miller and Mamoru Oshii took to the stage to talk about the future of entertainment, gaming, and art. Notably, all of the speakers talk about going 'off-screen' with storytelling.</p>
<p>Then John Hanke, founder of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokemon Go</a> developer Niantic and now boss of Niantic Spatial (an 'AI-led geospatial business platform'), joined Kojima on-stage to present a section devoted to how Kojima plans to 'move beyond the screen,' where the Japanese developer envisions "going to the top of a mountain, and even finding entertainment there".</p>
<p>There's no real hint as to what this project will be beyond a fluffy teaser trailer that seems to be Pokemon Go-meets-Death Stranding. "Kojima Productions and Niantic Spatial Team Up to Redefine Immersive Entertainment" reads a blurb on the trailer, as people wonder around interacting with virtual bonsai trees, golden aura, and other weird environmental aspects. It all looks like stuff from the chiral network in the Death Stranding games, so I imagine our job - as porters via our phones or smart glasses, per the trailer - will be to connect things up.</p>
<p>You can see the latest trailer for Death Stranding x Niantic as part of the livestream below.</p>

<p>This seems like very early concept-level blue sky thinking. It's worth noting that Niantic Spatial isn't quite Pokemon Go developer Niantic: the company was split into a games and geospatial division earlier this year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-will-be-sold-to-monopoly-go-maker-scopely-niantic-confirms">the gaming development arm going over to Monopoly Go maker Scopely in a deal worth $3.5bn.</a>
</p><p>Niantic Spatial focuses on a refreshed version of Niantic's original core interest - creating a digital map of the planet, now using geospatial AI. The newly-rebranded company has secured $250m of capital investment ($50m from Scopely and $200m from Niantic's own balance sheet), and this is the first game-related project we've seen from the company.</p>
<p>"We're in the midst of seismic changes in technology, with AI evolving rapidly," Niantic founder John Hanke wrote when talking about the goal of the Spatial platform. "Existing maps were built for people to read and navigate but now there is a need for a new kind of map that makes the world intelligible for machines, for everything from smart glasses to humanoid robots, so they can understand and navigate the physical world.
</p>
<p>It seems Kojima wants to leverage this tech, and paste a Death Stranding experience on the top of this evolving tech that is as-yet-untested in a gaming environment.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> received a warm reception when it launched earlier this year, with Eurogamer calling it a "busier, louder, and more emotionally resplendent take on this singular hiking sim" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">our four star review</a>.
</p>
<p>We're also expecting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-animated-movie-with-original-story-on-the-way-with-raised-by-wolves-writer-attached">a Death Stranding animated movie</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-casually-reveals-a-death-stranding-anime-is-in-the-works">an entirely different Death Stranding anime</a> with an original story, too.
</p>
<p>"I love the world of Death Stranding, it's so creatively freeing, so beautifully dark and yet hopeful; I'm so excited and honoured that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>, whose work I've long admired, has invited me to dwell within his creation, to birth new stories into this fertile, mind-bending universe," says Raised by Wolves creator Aaron Guzikowski, who is penning the script for the animated feature.</p><p>It's clear the series has some life in it yet, and even with games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/od">OD</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/physint">Physint</a> on the way from Kojima Studios, the storied developer is a long way from giving up on this particular baby, just yet.

            <p>Tonight, as part of the Kojima Productions 10th Anniversary livestream, called Beyond the Strand, we got a new update on the studio's Metal Gear-style project, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/physint">Physint</a>.
</p>
<p>The title, which to date has been shrouded in secrecy, is still in the early stages of development, but we did get some confirmations this evening: actors Don Lee, Charlee Fraser, and Minami Hamabe are involved, and Hamabe also featured in an in-engine demonstration in which Kojima specifically noted how pleased he was with the rendering of her skin.</p>
<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment Studio head Herman Hulst appeared briefly before the segment on Physint, doubling down on the statements about Sony working closely with Kojima Productions on the title.
</p>
<p>The game, as previously teased, is a "stealth action title" a la Metal Gear Solid, and we finally got a little look at the key art for the game - you can see it in the header of this article.</p>
<p>You can see the latest Physint information dump here as part of the livestream below.</p>

<p>All that we knew about Physint before this, really, was that the title was 'some way off'. The last update we had on the game came from Kojima in Auguast 2025, as the influential developer noted he was still working on the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-metal-gear-like-physint-is-still-so-early-in-development-hes-currently-working-on-it-all-by-myself">"all by [him]self"</a>.
</p><p>Physint was announced to be in the works <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-making-new-metal-gear-solid-style-game-and-movie-for-playstation">for PlayStation</a> in January 2024, with Kojima Productions describing it as a "next-generation action espionage game" at the time. Apparently, the game would enter full production after the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> - and here we are.
</p>
<p>Back in May, Kojima revealed Physint was now "in development", noting it would likely take him<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-next-espionage-game-physint-wont-be-out-for-a-few-years-yet"> "another five or six years"</a> to complete. It's also a personal project for the storied developer, who has described the game as a "culmination of [his] work", that he wants to "transcend the barriers between film and video games". The title was born<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-says-he-decided-to-make-physint-for-fans-after-sickness-made-him-reconsider-his-priorities"> during a period of sickness and surgery</a>, when thoughts of his own mortality convinced him to 'change his priorities' and do something fans had been asking him to do for years. Cheery, then.</p>

            <p>Tonight, as part of the Kojima Productions 10th Anniversary livestream, called Beyond the Strand, we got a new update on the Death Stranding movie. Notably, the project is not going to be a direct adaptation, but an original story set in the world of Sam Porter Bridges, Fragile, and the other characters we recognise from the games.</p><p>

Michael Sarnoski took to the stage to join Kojima to talk about the project (now that he's wrapped work on A Quiet Place: Day One). Sarnoski noted that the movie will include new characters and focus on a new plot, though beyond that, details are fairly sparse.

</p><p>"I think, with this project, we really want to capture the soul of the game, capture the themes of the game, but tell a story you haven’t seen in that world and explore characters you haven’t seen before, and find all of that scope and all of those incredible real locations, but also find all of those nuanced characters and just do justice to this on a macro and micro scale," Sarnoski noted on-stage.
</p>
<p>Kojima is too busy to direct the film himself - unsurprisingly - but the storied developer added that he is, at least, "deeply involved" in the production of the title.</p>
<p>We're also getting an animated movie, alongside A24's live-action effort. The animation, named Mosquito, which will also tell an original story. The name relates to one of the main characters who has the ability to 'take something from you', like a mosquito takes blood.

            <p>Tonight, as part of the Kojima Productions 10th Anniversary livestream, called Beyond the Strand, we got a new update on the studio's peculiar work-in-progress, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/od">OD</a>.
</p>
<p>The title, which Kojima has previously referred to as "a game and at the same time a movie and at the same time a new form of media", got a new trailer during the livestream, as the developer was joined by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a>.</p>
<p>"At Xbox, we empower creators to push boundaries, and that's exactly the game that OD is," said Xbox CEO Phil Spencer when he turned up on stage. Kojima added that he wanted to 'go over the system' of films and games, before showing some footage of OD running on the Unreal Engine (assumedly Unreal Engine 5). This is most likely because the Xbox-backed title isn't allowed to use Guerilla's Decima engine, which is owned by Sony.</p>
<p>You can see the latest trailer here as part of the livestream below. "It's very scary," warns Kojima. I do have to say, the motion capture is astounding, if nothing else. The game gets a new tagline: 'For all players and screamers'.</p>

<p>"We have one goal in mind: to bring Kojima's vision to life for all players everywhere," wraps up Phil Spencer.</p>
<p>The game has a new subtitle: Knock, because Kojima wants to create the fear of the 'knock' - "I am afraid of the 'knock' sound, so I wanted to make that very frightening," says Kojima. Kojima cryptically notes that Jordan Peele is working on another part of the OD experience, so that subtitle, Knock, may refer to a specific episode Kojima is working on himself - it's currently unclear.</p>
<p>Kojima also joked that he 'wants to win an award' for being the first person to motion-capture a ghost, and that the scariest experience of all was standing on-stage next to Phil Spencer. Relatable.</p>
<p>So, what else do we know about OD? </p>
<p>The game first surfaced via rumours in 2022, when word online suggested Kojima was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-latest-project-is-reportedly-a-horror-game-called-overdose">working on a horror title called Overdose</a>. This turned out to be true, and in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">we got a 10-minute blowout on the game</a> that didn't, really, reveal anything at all. 
</p><p>At least <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoUJh7W2xsY">we got a trailer</a> featuring Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier - all reciting the same eerie rhyme, and each with a different emotional emphasis, as the camera held steady on their faces. It ended with a door slowly creaking open, as seen reflected in Lillis' eyes, and a terrified scream. Intriguing.
