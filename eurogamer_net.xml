            <p>
Pok√©mon TCG Pocket, the new smartphone version of the classic Pok√©mon trading card game, looks to be off to a strong and lucrative start. 
</p>
<p>
A report into its launch by app store analytics firm AppMagic suggests the game has reached 12m downloads worldwide and earned $12.1m across its first four days, for an average of $3m every 24 hours (thanks, <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-earning-over-3m-per-day-with-over-12m-banked-to-date/">MobileGamer.biz</a>).
</p>
<p>
45 percent of earnings so far come from Pok√©mon's home turf of Japan, with US the second-largest market, providing 25 percent of the game's app store revenue.

<p>
Using the same metrics, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pok√©mon Go</a> is reported to net around $1m per 24 hours - though the game also generates revenue outside of its app via various means, most notably its increasingly-prominent web-based storefront.
</p>
<p>
Pok√©mon TCG Pocket is heavily engineered around the opening of card packs, though you can also unlock the ability to play a faster-paced version of the traditional Pok√©mon card game too. 
</p>
<p>
Players get to open up to two card packs per day for free, if you build up enough "Pack Stamina", and can purchase further packs for real-world money. 
</p>
<p>
Further microtransactions exist to reduce the wait for new packs and cards, plus cosmetic options where you can customise your digital card folders, playmats and coins. 
</p>
<p>
"There's one inescapable truth about TCG Pocket though - it is free-to-play, and it wants your money," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-focus-is-on-pack-opening-but-theres-a-promising-version-of-the-card-game-underneath">Eurogamer's Lottie Lynn wrote after playtesting Pok√©mon TCG Pocket</a>. "It wants your money so badly in fact, you'd think it's been possessed by a Gimmighoul."

            <p>One clever reddit user has figured out a hidden message tucked within <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, by using the mysterious photos found in the game.</p>
<p>The photos in question are collectibles, and each has a little phrase attached to it, such as: "So many people here."</p>
<p>But, what do they mean? Well, one Silent Hill 2 Remake player has worked it out, and found a secret message which had been placed by developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>. Please note, <strong>there will be Silent Hill 2 Remake spoilers below</strong>.</p>

<p>OK, to the matter in hand. Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DaleRobinson/">DaleRobinson</a> shared a post on the Silent Hill feed over the weekend, proclaiming he had solved the puzzle of those mysterious photos. He realised that if players count certain things within each photo, and then count along the phrase on the relevant photo up to the same number, they will land on a letter.</p>
<p>There are 26 photos to find, so 26 letters in total. And, if you collect all the photos and count the right object, you will ultimately spell out this phrase:</p>
<p>"You've been here for two decades."</p>
<p>Posting about his find on social media platform X, Robinson joked: "I thought I was gonna get something cool, but instead the game reminded me that I am an old man now."</p>

<p>Robinson's feat, which is by no means small, was subsequently spotted by Bloober Team's own creative director and lead designer, <a href="https://x.com/Mateusz_Lenart_/status/1853189523745730675">Mateusz Lenart</a>. Resharing the reddit post, the developer wrote:</p>
<p>"I knew it wouldn‚Äôt stay hidden for long! (There was a theory in our company that the puzzle might be too hard). I really wanted to make it subtle when I was painting those photos... I think the timing couldn‚Äôt be better for you to solve it.</p>
<p>"Congratulations!"</p>
