            <p>Sega has announced its forthcoming Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds release will have the full game on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> card, unlike many other third-party titles on Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is set for release across other consoles and PC in September, including the original Switch. The Switch 2 version will arrive digitally during this year's holiday season, with the physical version launching "early 2026".</p>
<p>Many third-party publishers have drawn ire from players for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-most-switch-2-third-party-physical-releases-dont-have-the-game-on-the-card">using Nintendo's game-key cards for Switch 2 games</a> - essentially containing a download key instead of the full game. That includes Sega's already-released Sonic x Shadow Generations.</p>

<p>With Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, though, the company has u-turned. "The physical version will feature the full base game on the cartridge," it said in a press release.</p>
<p>The game will cost £64.99 on Switch 2 for the standard edition, and £79.99 for the digital deluxe edition. That compares to £54.99 on the original Switch.</p>
<p>There will also be an upgrade pack for original Switch users, which will carry over progression to the Switch 2 version. An <a href="https://www.sega.com/news/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-faq">FAQ</a> on the game's website states this will be $10 (Eurogamer has asked for clarification on UK pricing), matching the difference between the consoles.</p>
<p>The news was shared along with a new trailer for the game, showing off its customisation options. Players will be able to tweak their vehicles to amend stats and weapon combos (known as gadgets), with Sega boasting over 70,000 unique combinations will be possible.</p>
<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will release across PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC and original Switch on 25th September. The game's unique gimmick allows players to choose how tracks morph into others across each lap, hence its title. That extends to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hatsune-miku-personas-joker-and-minecrafts-steve-join-the-roster-for-sonic-crossworlds">crossovers with other characters</a>, including Joker from Persona 5 and Ichiban from the Like A Dragon games, as well as vocaloid artist Hatsune Miku and Steve from Minecraft.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson stated the game "might be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-might-be-the-most-mechanically-rich-kart-racer-ever-made-hands-on">most mechanically rich kart racer ever made</a>" after going hands-on.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-will-buck-third-party-switch-2-trend-with-full-game-on-card]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Charlie Guillemot has addressed concerns of nepotism after being named co-CEO of Ubisoft's new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>-funded subsidiary, following in the footsteps of his father Yves Guillemot.</p>
<p>Ubisoft announced in March it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-new-business-for-assassins-creed-and-other-big-ips-with-116bn-tencent-investment">launching a new subsidiary with €1.16bn of investment from Chinese conglomerate Tencent</a>. This subsidiary will be the home of the company's biggest franchises: Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry.</p>
<p>Now the company has named Christophe Derennes and Charlie Guillemot as co-CEOs. Derennes has spent over 35 years at Ubisoft, co-founded Ubisoft's Montreal studio in 1997, and most recently served as managing director for the company's North American output.</p>

<p>Charlie Guillemot, meanwhile, began his career in 2014 at Owlient, a studio acquired by Ubisoft. The studio's biggest release, mobile game Tom Clancy's Elite Squad, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tom-clancys-elite-squad-shuts-down-a-year-after-launch">shut down a year after launch</a> having failed to find an audience. Before that, the game was embroiled in controversy following accusations of including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-pulls-black-lives-matter-raised-fist-from-new-tom-clancy-game-following-backlash">imagery promoting alt-right Black Lives Matter conspiracy theories</a>.</p>
<p>After this, Guillemot left Ubisoft to co-found <a href="https://www.unagi.games/">Unagi</a>, a company known for Web3 gaming, AI, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a>.</p>
<p>In a press release announcing its new subsidiary co-CEOs, Ubisoft stated: "Charlie Guillemot has built a hybrid career at the intersection of management and innovation. He brings an entrepreneurial perspective and a sharp understanding of evolving industry dynamics and players' expectations, shaped by his experience in game development. With a strong product mindset, deep tech culture, and a passion for games, he represents a new generation of leadership focused on innovation, quality, and putting players at the centre of decision-making."</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/ubisoft-spinoff-ceos-christophe-derennes-charlie-guillemot-1236453661/">Variety</a>, Guillemot then directly addressed any concerns of nepotism, following in the footsteps of his father.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm Yves' son," he said. "That's not something I hide from. But my appointment isn't only about family ties; it's about what Ubisoft needs at this moment."</p>
<p>He continued: "I've spent the last decade building experience both inside and outside Ubisoft, leading teams, managing brands, and navigating change in a fast-moving industry. I also made the conscious choice to step away when it made sense, to learn and grow elsewhere.</p>
<p>"What matters now isn't my name, it's the work ahead. Ubisoft is at a pivotal moment. What's expected of me is to help push the company forward by bringing energy, focus, and by relying on the incredible expertise that already exists across the teams. I see myself as someone here to contribute, support, and help create the right conditions are in place for everyone to do their best work."</p>
<p>In the same interview, the co-CEOs detailed how their roles will complement each other. Guillemot will be "in charge of the 'what'", focusing on creative direction and marketing of the company's brands. Derennes will be focused on production and technology - the "how".</p>
<p>In a separate <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/60h1Sq3PKN8WlNdlic2KLN/ubisoft-announces-christophe-derennes-and-charlie-guillemot-as-coceos-of-new-subsidiary">interview published by Ubisoft</a>, the pair also spoke of opportunities for growth in the games industry today.</p>
<p>"The biggest difference today is that the market is stable, compared to the previous decades in which there were massive disruptions one after the other which brought big changes - I'm thinking of the new console releases and the arrival of online gaming, to name a few," said Guillemot. "Of course, generative AI and cloud are likely to revolutionise game creation and the player experience in the long term, but what really matters today is standing out. That means being able to offer high-quality content, and sometimes that means shorter content, speaking to new generations that consume content in a different way. I'm convinced the industry will face new tech disruptions we can't fully predict yet. And Ubisoft intends to play an active role in shaping that future."</p>
<p>Derennes, meanwhile, spoke of expanding franchises beyond games. "Whether as references, as new ways of telling a story or as ever-expanding transmedia universes, video games' cultural impact as the tenth art is a reality. And this reality is exactly what we aim to capture with this new organisation," he said.</p>
<p>Back in May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-moving-some-of-our-biggest-productions-into-2026-and-2027-after-positive-impact-of-assassins-creed-shadows-delay">Ubisoft stated it had postponed several of its "biggest productions"</a> to allow for more development time, following in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/charlie-guillemot-follows-father-as-co-ceo-of-ubisofts-new-tencent-funded-subsidiary-nepotism-claims-addressed]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Virtuos - the studio behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-has-clocked-up-over-4-million-players-in-less-than-5-days">this year's successful The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> and whose staff have also worked on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-23-update-wants-you-to-relax-and-take-in-the-night-city-sights-with-new-self-driving-cars">recently announced Cyberpunk 2077 update</a> as well as serving as a support studio for the anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> - has reportedly been impacted by layoffs.</p>
<p>According to a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gautoz.cool/post/3lu3ntewdrk2t">BlueSky by Gauthier Andres</a>, a reporter for the French-language publication Origami, seven percent of the company's workforce will be subject to layoffs. That's 300 people.</p>
<p>These layoffs will allegedly be across the United States, Asia, Europe, and three branches in France. Andres' sources said the initial layoffs will affect those in China.</p>

<p>"Virtuos is said to have made significant efforts on Oblivion, with a policy of over-spending on quality and a royalty-free contract (without bonuses tied to the game's success)," Andres wrote (via machine translation). "The result: teams put under severe strain for a purely showcase game, whose profitability is doomed to be questioned."</p>
<p>The company reportedly put a freeze on raises and reduction on bonuses back in February of this year. This move led to questions regarding layoffs from staff to Virtuos' management. As a result, Andres said a strike is taking place at Virtuos Lyon, which will protest the layoffs and aim to "protect the future capacity of the branch".</p>
<p>According to sources, Virtuos is also making a move towards the use of generative AI. "In one year, we've gone from a few group-level presentations to basic but mandatory training for employees," Andres was told.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Virtuos for comment on the report.</p>
<p>Layoffs have been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">a depressingly regular</a> story in the video games industry over the past few years. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">Microsoft began another round of layoffs at the company impacting in excess of 9000 people</a>. This saw games cancelled and studios closed.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/studio-behind-oblivion-remastered-one-of-2025s-biggest-hits-subject-to-mass-layoffs-report]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The team behind the upcoming Mortal Kombat movie sequel - aptly known as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-2">Mortal Kombat 2</a> - has released a new teaser for the film, with a certain Mr Johnny Cage taking centre stage (poetry!).</p>
<p>The teaser itself is called Uncaged Fury, and sees Karl Urban's Johnny Cage taking on a load of would-be assailants by whacking them all with pipes and leaping around in a rather athletic way. This leaping includes him jumping over a recently launched Bazooka missile, which despite being aimed at the ground manages to miss Johnny and hit… actually, I won't say, because you really do have to see it to believe it.</p>
<p>You can check out the new teaser trailer for Mortal Kombat 2 below.</p>

<p>In addition to Urban, Adeline Rudolph - who previously starred in Netflix's The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-adds-another-sabrina-star-this-time-as-kitana">will play Princess Kitana</a>. Meanwhile, fellow Sabrina alum Tati Gabrielle is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharteds-tati-gabrielle-set-to-play-jade-in-mortal-kombat-2-film">Kitana's bodyguard, Jade</a>.</p>
<p>This is not Gabrielle's first foray into the video game adaptation scene. She also starred as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-the-uncharted-film-is-the-treasure-ive-been-looking-for">Jo Braddock in 2022's Uncharted film adaptation</a>, and recently starred in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-adds-danny-ramirez-tati-gabrielle">The Last of Us' second season as Nora</a>, "a military medic struggling to come to terms with the sins of her past".</p>
<p>Eurogamer's former editor Wesley Yin-Poole wasn't overly keen on the first Mortal Kombat film when it came out a few years ago, calling it boring.</p>
<p>"There's just enough low-rent entertainment to prevent the Mortal Kombat movie from being a complete disaster, but it's tough to recommend when it costs £16 to rent online. A tenner straight to Blu-ray feels like a better fit," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/save-your-gbp16-the-mortal-kombat-movie-is-boring">Eurogamer's Mortal Kombat movie review</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-film-trailer-sees-johnny-cage-jumping-over-a-bazooka-missile-with-some-very-wide-legs]]></content:encoded>
