As part of its latest <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/presentations/?presentationtype=webcasts">financial earnings report</a>, developer CD Projekt has shared progress updates on its numerous Witcher and Cyberpunk projects, as well as confirmed a partnership with Saudi-back mobile developer (and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-will-be-sold-to-monopoly-go-maker-scopely-niantic-confirms">new Pok√©mon Go owner</a>) Scopely to create a game.
</p>
<p>
As far as the Scopely project goes, there's not much to report at present. CD Projekt merely confirmed it had "entered into a strategic partnership with Scopely to develop a game set within one of CD Projekt's IPs." And while it seems reasonable to assume that's pointing toward some sort of mobile game set in either The Witcher or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> universes, we won't know for sure until more is revealed.
</p>
<p>
Away from Scopely, CD Projekt also spent some time offering progress updates on the various titles it's previously confirmed to be in development. Work on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> continues apace, for instance, but CD Projekt's other Witcher games have seen some adjustments. Witcher spin-off Project Sirius - which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-spin-off-project-sirius-sounds-like-its-being-rebooted-from-scratch">rebooted several years back</a> - remains in pre-production, and CD Projekt says it's now merged developer The Molasses Flood with the CD Projekt Red team to "ensure even better alignment in the scope and direction of the project".

<p>
Additionally, CD Projekt's Witcher 1 remake, which was announced back in October 2022 as part of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-red-announces-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-future-witcher-projects-outlined">studio's ambitious development roadmap</a>, is still in the concept phase. Furthermore, the studio says that due to "production process dependencies" related to assets and technology, it has decided to "temporarily integrate its development with ongoing work on The Witcher 4". As a result, a "small portion" of developer Fool's Theory is currently supporting the Witcher 4 team, with the aim being to "have the necessary assets, tools, and pipelines ready for more efficient development of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-remake">The Witcher Remake</a>."
</p>
<p>
Moving on from The Witcher, CD Projekt's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiplayer-being-considered-for-cyperpunk-2077-sequel-says-cd-projekt">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a> - currently known as Project Orion - is said to be nearing the end of its concept phase and will be entering pre-production "in the coming weeks". Additionally, development of the studio's new IP, known only as Project Hadar at present, continues. "The vision of Hadar has progressed over the last year, becoming more detailed," CD Projekt explained. "Internal assumptions and ideas have been forged into main pillars that guide us forward [and] the team's focus is on further developing the IP and the game's story, while prototyping some gameplay solutions specific to Hadar."
</p>
<p>
CD Projekt also reiterated it has a number of other undisclosed projects in the works, including another from Fool's Theory, and once again drew attention to its still-mysterious new Netflix Cyberpunk 2077 animation, which is currently "under development".
</p>
<p>
The Witcher 4 did, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">see its long-awaited reveal at the end of last year</a>, with CD Projekt finally confirming Ciri would be the focus this time around - although Geralt of Rivia (once again voiced by Doug Cockle) will also return in some capacity.

            <p>
A new report has highlighted the "havoc" <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>'s lack of a release date is causing among game publishers, as they attempt to draw up launch plans for their titles that won't put them on a collision course with Rockstar's all-consuming sequel - with one executive reportedly saying, "We don't want to be anywhere near that."
</p>
<p>
Following comments made by EA's Andrew Wilson earlier this year suggesting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be">the publisher would be willing to shift the new Battlefield's release in order to avoid GTA 6</a>, journalist Christopher Dring spoke to a number of industry executives to understand how Rockstar's game was impacting their own decision-making behind the scenes - with the responses he received reflecting those previously expressed by Wilson.
</p>
<p>
Speaking on the <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-publishers-plan-to-delay-games">newly launched The Game Business podcast</a>, Dring shared a quote from the boss of "one of the biggest games publishers in the world", who didn't want to go on record. "Rockstar games always suck a lot of money and, more importantly, time out of the market," the executive told Dring. "We don't want to be anywhere near that. We're working up multiple different plans for our title."

<p>
Another senior executive from a different publisher shared similar sentiments, telling Dring, "Even without GTA, it's immensely difficult to find free time for new games to shine. Time is the real scarcity for us, not money. It's tough out there."
</p>
<p>
A third senior executive - the European boss of an unnamed triple-A publisher - highlighted additional concerns, specifically around the "fall" launch window previously touted for GTA 6's launch by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>. "We don't want to launch just before or just after the game," the executive explained. "If it arrives in late October, that means you either have to launch early - which a lot of people seem to be doing with the recent glut of summer release dates. Or go later, putting you up against the Black Friday sales."
</p>
<p>
"If we move out of 2025," the executive continued. "what if Rockstar do too? Will we have to push our game up or will we have to delay further? It's proven to be very stressful."
</p>
<p>
Dring said these kind of considerations are currently "causing a bit of havoc" across the games industry, and it's not just a problem for publishers looking to launch new releases; GTA 6's arrival is likely to impact the fortunes of live service games too. One "top 10 live service games" developer told Dring, "GTA 6 is basically a huge meteor and we will stay clear of the blast zone. We will nudge our updates back or forward three weeks to avoid it. Of course, the problem is everyone is going to do the same. So three to four weeks before or after GTA 6, you're going to get a load of live service games dropping content in what they believe will be the safe zone."
</p>
<p>
"It's obviously going to get a little bit messy," Dring observed. But as he also highlighted, history suggests publisher have good reason to be concerned. Looking back to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>'s launch in September 2013, Dring explained, 50 percent of the month's game revenue was for Rockstar's title - despite it only releasing half-way through September. As for GTA 5's launch week in the UK, Rockstar's game reportedly accounted for 89 percent of all games sold and 94 percent of all video game revenue - and the the title is also said to have accounted for two thirds of all games sold in the UK during the three-week "blast zone" following its release.
</p>
<p>
Take-Two has been doggedly sticking to the same non-specific <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">"fall" launch window for Grand Theft Auto 6</a> since announcing it last May - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">despite persistent reports of a potential delay</a>. But as noted by Game File's Stephen Totilo during The Game Business podcast, there seems to be one relatively safe spot on the 2025 calendar right now: it's unlikely GTA 6 will release on or during the weeks surrounding 23rd September - given that's the launch date <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-gets-new-trailer-and-a-release-date">Take-Two reserved for Borderlands 4</a> earlier this year.
