            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> will follow up its hugely successful <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake with a new joint project with Konami.</p>
<p>The project will be a "new game based on Konami's IP" - the specifics are unknown, but considering Bloober's horror pedigree and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-tops-one-million-copies-sold-in-less-than-a-week">Silent Hill 2 success</a>, a new game in that franchise seems like a safe bet.</p>
<p>"Our collaboration with Konami has been incredibly fruitful, and the success of Silent Hill 2 speaks for itself," said Piotr Babieno, CEO of Bloober Team. "By sharing knowledge and experience, we have been able to create high-quality production together. Of course, we can't reveal too many details at this time, but we are confident that fans will be just as excited about our collaboration as we are. We can't wait to share something truly special with players when the time is right."</p>

<p>Reads a press release on the news: "The trust built upon the success of Silent Hill 2 laid the foundation for signing another agreement for a new project. The deal aligns with Bloober Team's strategic plan to expand its internal development division within a first-party framework."</p>
<p>Konami's IP includes the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>, Castlevania, eFootball, Bomberman, and Suikoden, though Silent Hill does seem the most likely candidate for Bloober.</p>
<p>The Polish studio's next game has already been announced, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-bloober-is-following-silent-hill-2-with-its-first-original-survival-horror-cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn being the company's first original survival horror game</a>.</p>
<p>"We are super happy for the [Silent Hill] team, for the accomplishments, and I do believe that they paved the path for us," Cronos co-director Wojciech Piejko told Eurogamer. "They dramatically changed the reception of our company on the internet from 'Bloober should not touch Silent Hill' to 'new great game from Bloober!'</p>
<p>"I'm super thankful for them and I know it wasn't easy to survive all these critics on the internet. You always have to remember there are people behind every game. It doesn't make your work easier. So kudos for [the team], because they made the impossible possible with making Silent Hill."</p>
<p>Konami announced a number of Silent Hill games back in 2022, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-announced-from-resident-evil-reverse-developer">Silent Hill f</a> perhaps the most anticipated.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> publisher Ubisoft has responded to the leak of story details and gameplay footage from its upcoming samurai stabathon, a month ahead of the game's release date.
</p>
<p>
This past weekend, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/careful-of-spoilers-assassins-some-fans-are-playing-assassins-creed-shadows-early">photos posted online showed several fans now had access to early physical copies of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, while others claimed to have briefly been able to download a digital version of the game from the PlayStation Store.
</p>
<p>
Chunks of gameplay footage are now easily findable online, even as Ubisoft battles to remove the videos. Other fans have posted summaries of their time with the game so far, including story spoilers. And there's still weeks to go until Assassin's Creed Shadows' 20th March launch date.

</figure>
<p>
"We are aware players have accessed Assassin's Creed Shadows ahead of its official release," Ubisoft said in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1ixdc8d/a_message_from_the_assassins_creed_community_team/">message from the Assassin's Creed community team, posted to reddit</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"The development team is still working on patches to prepare the experience for launch and any footage shared online does not represent the final quality of the game."
</p>
<p>
Physical copies of the game were likely manufactured weeks if not months ago, while Ubisoft will continue to issue patches up to and beyond the game's street date in March. That said, fans report not seeing too many issues with the game so far.
</p>
<p>
"Leaks are unfortunate and can diminish the excitement for players," Ubisoft's statement continues. "We kindly ask you not to spoil the experience for others. Thank you to our community for already taking steps to protect everyone from spoilers.
</p>
<p>
"Stay in the shadows, avoid the spoilers, and keep an eye on our channel for more official surprises in the coming weeks!  20th March will be here soon!"
</p>
<p>
It's been a long wait for Assassin's Creed fans, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">repeated delays from the game's original launch date</a> late last year. Shadows is the first new Assassin's Creed game since 2023's Mirage, which was originally planned as an expansion for 2020's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>.
</p>
<p>
The game's launch comes amidst a pivotal few months for Ubisoft, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-acknowledges-buyout-reports-stating-it-regularly-reviews-options">the company looks poised to be sold or taken private</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-pre-orders-solid-in-line-with-series-second-biggest-launch">the threat of further layoffs loom</a>.
</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Katharine Castle recently reported back after playing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">six hours of Assassin's Creed Shadows, calling it the biggest shake-up of the series in years</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>DC boss James Gunn has confirmed he's in talks with both Rocksteady and NetherRealm to develop new games in the DC Universe.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/james-gunns-new-plan-to-unify-dc-universe-includes-labelling-non-canon-games-as-dc-elseworlds">Gunn laid out his plans for the DC Universe back in 2023</a>, which would combine films, TV series and video games into a singular canon universe - much like Marvel has done.</p>
<p>Now, in a recent DC Studios event attended by <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/new-dc-games-netherrealm-rocksteady-batman-arkham-injustice-3/">ComicBook</a>, Gunn and his co-CEO Peter Safran confirmed they're in close talks with the two Warner Bros game studios.</p>

<p>"We work incredibly closely with JB Perrette who runs that division," said Safran. "It's really the first time it's ever been this way at Warner Bros. James and I sit with the guys that run the studios under JB whether it's NetherRealm or Rocksteady. We sit with them and we talk about characters and stories that we're interested in and that they're interested in."</p>
<p>Added Gunn: "We see designs for the projects in their very earliest stages. We talk about those, we talk about what the story might be and we'll say 'Well, maybe you want to go this way because we're planning on maybe doing something with <em>this </em>character'."</p>
<p>There are no details yet on what these games will be, or which characters they'll focus on, with Gunn stating it will be a "couple years" from now when we finally see for ourselves.</p>
<p>Later this year DC will release its new film incarnation of Superman, so could we finally see a decent game adaptation in the future to follow up? There will also be The Batman Part 2 in 2027, while in 2026 there are film plans for Supergirl and Clayface. Could these hint towards game plans?</p>
<p>NetherRealm most recently released <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a>, with the last in its DC fighting series <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/injustice-2">Injustice 2</a> released back in 2017. Rocksteady, meanwhile, released the ill-fated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> last year.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-has-a-new-single-player-batman-game-in-development-teases-new-report">Rocksteady is "looking to return to Batman for a single-player game"</a>, though it's "years away" from release.</p>
<p>Of course, there's also the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wonder-woman-games-reportedly-still-years-away-from-release-if-it-ever-launches-at-all">Wonder Woman game already in development from Monolith</a>, though it remains years away from release.</p>
<p>In further DC news, further crossovers with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is planned, as the company is discussing with Epic which characters to focus on. Again, the likes of Superman and Supergirl would make sense with the forthcoming films.</p>
<p>This wouldn't be the first time DC characters have appeared in Fortnite, as various heroes and villains have been available as skins in the past. However, this stopped once Warner Bros' crossover fighting game Multiversus launched.</p>
<p>It appears Warner Bros has U-turned on this decision following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-director-in-deep-mourning-following-last-weeks-shutdown-news">shutdown of Multiversus</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Plug being pulled in May.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Just weeks after laying off the "majority" of its staff, developer Phoenix Labs has announced it's shutting down its free-to-play Monster Hunter-style action game, Dauntless.
</p>
<p>
Dauntless' fast-paced take on the Monster Hunter formula received a warm reception when it launched into PC early access in May 2018, but it struggled to maintain that early momentum following a wider launch a year on. And its journey is now officially near its end.
</p>
<p>
Announcing Dauntless' closure in a <a href="https://x.com/PlayDauntless/status/1894090939267702888">terse message on social media</a>, Phoenix Labs wrote, "Dauntless is shutting down on May 29, 2025. Dauntless will receive no additional content or updates. Dauntless will no longer be available to play on and after May 29th, 2025 at 11.45pm PST. Thanks to all for being a part of the Dauntless journey."

<p>
Confirmation of Dauntless' demise follows several rounds of layoffs at Phoenix Labs, which was acquired by crypto company Forte in 2023. Last May, the studio announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fae-farm-developer-phoenix-labs-lays-off-staff-and-cancels-projects-in-significant-restructure">cancelling all projects other than Dauntless and Fae Farm</a> and laying off staff - a move believed to have impacted 140 employees - in order to "pave a path for a strong future". Then came the news last month that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dauntless-and-fae-farm-studio-phoenix-labs-lays-off-majority-of-employees">a "majority" of employees would lose their jobs</a> in another round of cuts - which the studio blamed on "unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations".
</p>
<p>
At the time, it said it would discuss the future of Dauntless and Fae Farm "in the coming weeks". And while Dauntless' fate is now sealed, Phoenix Labs hasn't yet shared its plans for Fae Farm.

Keepsake Games' Jump Ship is a co-op FPS where up to four players attempt to leap across the universe by selecting from a variety of hand-crafted missions. As the action plays out, they can seamlessly transition from operating their ship to on-foot planetary exploration, even space walks if need be. There's also talk of scavenging to make upgrades and repairs, as well as random elements to keep things fresh. Jump Ship comes to early access this summer.

<p>
Echo Weaver is a "time loop metroidBRAINia where time is [the] best resource and secrets are [the] only upgrades." It sees players navigating the remnants of a ruined society - a task made more challenging by the fact they're stuck in a glitching time loop. To escape, they'll need to rely on the energy of the loop itself, using it to heal, trade, and more. Developer Moonlight Kids also proudly proclaims, "No upgrades, no unlocks, just secrets... you can already do everything, you just don't know how yet." Echo Weaver doesn't have a release date, but it's coming to Xbox and PC with a day one release on Game Pass.

Fans of rogue-lite dungeon-crawling and shop management can witness their loves smash together again later this year when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a> 2: The Endless Vault launches for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and Game Pass. On a basic level, developer Digital Sun's sequel promises more of the same, but it does have a few new tricks - including a new setting and a leap from the original's charming pixel art to striking 3D.

<p>
There's a lot of buzz already for developer Dogubomb's "atmospheric architectural adventure", Blue Prince - a deeply intriguing puzzler set in an ever-changing house. The ultimate goal is to find the elusive Room 46 by unravelling the secrets on its 9x5 grid of chambers, but players can only venture so many steps before it reconfigures itself again. Blue Prince looks like fiendishly clever stuff and it now has a release date, coming to PlayStation, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass on 10th April.

<p>
If, like me, you've been itching to get back into an orange camper van ever since your family's beloved Volkswagen dramatically burst into flames in the middle of the road somewhere in the 90s, developer Square Glade Games' Outbound should be pure bliss. It's a game of open-world wilderness roving and survival, where you'll need to grow your own crops, harness natural resources for energy, customise your vehicle, and build a comically impractical house on your roof. Sadly, it's not out until next year, but I'm ready and eager.

<p>
Herdlings, the latest from Far: Lone Sails developer Okomotive, is a "stirring and beautiful journey into the mountains... and beyond" that sees players shepherding (or herding, I guess) mysterious creatures across a strikingly picturesque landscape of sweeping peaks, fog-shrouded forests, and more. You'll need to hone your skills to overcome its challenges, threats, and a smattering of light puzzles - and you'll probably need a few tissues too given it's promising an "emotional, wordless tale of trust, survival, and companionship during a great crossing through a fallen world". Herdlings is out this summer on PC and consoles.

<p>
Wax Heads, from developer Patattie Games, continues to look a treat. It's a "cosy-punk" narrative game about running a struggling record store, where players are tasked with satisfying eccentric customers by rooting out the perfect musical purchase. It's got puzzles, arcade cabinets, stickers, and "punchy, humorous" dialogue - and it's coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC in "summer" next year.

<p>
The Lonesome Guild is a single-player action-RPG "full of heart, battles, and bonds that change everything". It's the work of developer Tiny Bull Studios and follows protagonist Ghost (a ghost) and their ragtag team of friends as they try to save the world. It promises puzzles, intense battles, and a land full of mystery and treasure that players can explore by seamlessly switching between party members - with new side quests and abilities unlocking as bonds are strengthened among the team. It's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC this autumn.

<p>
Pretty much everything you need to know about Buckshot Roulette is right there in the title. Developer Mike Klubnika's grimly comedic twist on Russian Roulette - the twist being that it involves a shotgun - is a game of bargaining, begging, and betrayal, as players battle to walk away rich over the course of a 15-minute match. It was a bit of a viral sensation when it launches in 2023, and it's coming to Xbox and Game Pass "soon".

Suda51 and Swery's 2.5D slasher parody Hotel Barcelona <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suda51-and-swerys-25d-slasher-parody-hotel-barcelona-delayed-into-next-year">didn't quite make its originally planned 2024 release date</a>, but today's ID@Xbox showing indicates it's still on track to launch this year. Its weird, wild premise sees novice federal marshal protagonist Justine - who's got an insane serial killer named Dr. Carnival living inside her - breaking up a serial killer shindig in the titular Pittsburgh hotel. That involves rampaging across seven levels, each inspired by a different horror movie and featuring a distinct boss. She's also got a bit of extra help from the ghosts of her previous attempts, which manifest to fight alongside her.

Developer LocalThunk's poker-inspired roguelite Balatro has been a smashing success since releasing last year. But if you haven't had chance to play it yet, you've <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-balatro-has-shadow-dropped-on-game-pass">now got the option to do so via Game Pass</a>. And to accompany its arrival on Microsoft's subscription service, a free new DLC - adding cosmetic card backs inspired by the likes of Assassin's Creed, Fallout, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> - launches today on all platforms.

The last band management game I can remember playing was Rockstar Ate My Hamster, and that came out over 35 years ago. Yet Rockbeasts from developer Lichthund somehow reminded me of that game's anarchic spirit, even if you're playing grumpy, grungy animals instead of parodies of real-life musos here. "Lead a band of misfits on a roller-coaster ride to stardom in the age of MTV, rock anthems, and bad haircuts," explains its official blurb, before dropping the bombshell that it also stars Iggy Pop. Rockbeasts, officially a "story-driven, role-playing management game" is coming to Steam and consoles later this year.

<p>
Ratatan, if you're unfamiliar, is the spiritual successor to Sony Japan Studio's beloved PlayStation Portable rhythm adventure Patapon. It managed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/patapon-creators-ratatan-kickstarter-funded-within-an-hour">smash its crowdfunding goal within an hour of launch</a> back in 2023 and development's been quietly ticking along since then. Helmed by Patapon creator Hiroyuki Kotani, with original Patapon musician Kemmei Adach also onboard, it promises a roguelike blend of rhythm and side-scroller action in which players build an army of 100 Cobun to take on foes. Ratatan was originally targeting an Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC release this April, but its latest trailer - shared during ID@Xbox - now only says "2025".

When last we heard from developer Witch Beam, it was gracing us with Unpacking - a lovely little thing that would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamers-game-of-the-year-is">go on to be crowned Eurogamer's game of 2021</a>. Four years later and it's poised to release <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tempopo">Tempopo</a>, a vibrant musical puzzler set across a world of floating islands. Each island is a puzzle and finding the solution enables protagonist Hana to reclaim a lost musical bloom and replant it in her garden. Finding the solution, however, involves using Hana's conducting skills to guide the titular Tempopo onward, encouraging them to smash, block, lift, and push their way to victory. It's coming to PC, consoles, and Game Pass on 17th April.

<p>
Tiny Monks Tales' Woodo is absolutely adorable, and I'm already sold based on that fact alone. But more specifically, it's a "cosy 3D puzzle matching game" in which players work through a series of dioramas charting a new episode in the life of Foxy and Ben the frog. Each new stage brings a new selection of items - lovely, chunky wood-carved things - and players have to figure out where they belong, dropping them into a scene with a satisfying plop. There's no release date for Woodo yet, but it's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation, and PC.

<p>
In Denkiworks' Tanuki: Pon's Summer, the Tanuki Festival is just a month away. Unfortunately, the shrine is also in need of repair - and so enters Pon, a well meaning Tanuki who gets himself a part-time job delivering packages, all in the name of raising some coin. There's a colourful cast of characters to befriend, a whole bunch of side activities and sports to pursue - from baseball and sushi-making to enthusiastic drumming - and best of all, you get a BMX you'll be using to hurtle around the game's four towns, inspired by Kyoto, Aomori, Sapporo, and Beppu. It's a delightful looking thing and it's out on PC, Switch, Xbox, and Game Pass later this year.

Descenders Next, an extreme-sports-focused sort-of-sequel to developer RageSquid's acclaimed downhill biking hit Descenders, has a release date and is coming to Xbox, PC, and Game Pass on 9th April. It's an intriguing one too, ditching the exhilarating mountain biking of its predecessor in favour of basically as many extreme sports as possible. That's obviously a pretty ambitious goal, so Descenders Next is starting smaller and focusing on boarding sports - the snow kind and otherwise - across "multiple huge biomes". It's got extensive customisation, a Monstercat soundtrack, and support for up to 12 players.

After getting its neon on in 2023's Tron: Idenity, Bithell Games is back with more future action in Tron: Catalyst. It's an "all-new story-driven, isometric action adventure game" in which players ride Light Cycles and engage in Identity Disc combat as they traverse the crumbling Arq Grid. There's talk of "intriguing stories within a budding revolution", as well as secret areas and shortcuts to find - all of which players will be able to experience when Tron: Catalyst comes to  PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on 17th June.

It's an intriguing thing too, serving up a striking action roguelike in which players, in the role of damned souls, must co-operative to defeat hordes of monsters and massive bosses in order to rebel against God's final judgment and fight for their eternal lives. There's a twist, however; as its name implies, this is a chaotic quest designed to be tackled by 33 players.

And finally, a bit of a treat for twinky puppet fans. Lies of P: Overture, the eagerly awaited expansion for 2023's well-received Souls-like adventure, just got an atmospheric new story trailer. Overture, a "dramatic prequel" to the base game, transports players to the city of Krat to witness its final days before the Puppet Frenzy massacre. They'll meet a legendary Stalker and journey through Krat together, uncovering untold stories and hidden secrets. And probably a bunch of extremely tough battles too. There's still no release date for Lies of P: Overture, however, so you'll just have to make do with its latest trailer for now.
