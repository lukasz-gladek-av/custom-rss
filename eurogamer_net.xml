            <p>"Major job cuts" are set for Xbox as part of a company-wide reorganisation.</p>
<p>That's according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/microsoft-plans-major-job-cuts-at-xbox-gaming-division">Bloomberg report</a>, which states these cuts will begin next week. While Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier said it is currently unclear how many people will be affected by the alleged job cuts, "it's expected to be big".</p>
<p>According to the report, sources famaliar with the company's plans said managers within Xbox are expecting "substantial cuts across the entire group".  </p>
<p>This would not be the first time Microsoft and Xbox have made headlines for layoffs in the last 18 months. Back in January 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">1900 people from across Microsoft's video game teams were laid off</a>. A further <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">650 staff were then let go that September</a>.</p>

            <p>Drag x Drive - the 3 v 3 wheelchair basketball game coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> - just landed itself a release date.</p>
<p>As shared via Nintendo's Today app, Drag x Drive will make its debut on 14th August. Previously, we just knew the game was coming at some point this summer.</p>
<p>Drag x Drive will be an eShop exclusive, with no physical release currently on the cards (quite literally).</p>

<p>On its release this August, Drag x Drive players will use both Joy-Con 2 controllers as mice to compete in games of wheelchair basketball. The controllers will both need to be used at the same time in order for players to "intuitively steer, speed up, perform tricks and make plays such as dunks," Nintendo says.</p>
<p>As the release date was announced over on the Today app, I don't currently have a new trailer I can embed into this article. When it is made live across YouTube, though, I will add one in.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Xbox has collaborated with Meta to launch the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition, a limited edition VR headset.</p>
<p>The device continues an ongoing partnership between the two companies, following the addition of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-cloud-gaming-is-heading-to-meta-quest-vr-headsets">Xbox cloud gaming to Meta headsets in 2022</a>. This was followed by the release of Xbox Game Pass to Meta Quest 3 back in 2023, as Xbox expanded its cloud gaming offering.</p>
<p>The headset features an Xbox design of black and green, along with matching Touch Plus controllers and a limited-edition Xbox Wireless Controller. The package also includes three months of Meta Horizon+ and three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. It's out now, and costs £379.99. It is available directly from Meta or exclusively at Argos and EE in the UK.</p>

<p>US purchasers will find the headset at Best Buy for $399.99. Further details can be found on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/24/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition/">Xbox Wire</a>.</p>
<p>Through the cloud, users will have access to Xbox Game Pass through the headset - though this won't be fully VR versions of games. Instead, there are four display options, including one cinema-sized screen. Cross-play and cross-progression mean players can continue playing across the VR headset or their Xbox console or PC.</p>
<p>Back in 2019, CEO of Microsoft Gaming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-vr-not-a-focus-for-project-scarlett-because-xbox-fans-arent-asking-for-it">Phil Spencer stated VR wasn't a focus</a> for the company's then forthcoming Xbox Series X/S consoles.</p>
<p>"I have some issues with VR," he said. "It's isolating and I think of games as a communal, kind of together experience. We're responding to what our customers are asking for and... nobody's asking for VR."</p>
<p>He added "nobody's selling millions and millions" of VR units, before stating: "I think we might get there [eventually]. But yeah, that's not where our focus is."</p>
<p>Now, Microsoft is dipping its toes into VR with this collaboration, without developing its own VR system.</p>
<p>It mirrors the company's recently announced handheld console, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-xbox-branded-asus-handheld-finally-gets-an-official-reveal">Xbox branded ROG Ally from ASUS</a>. As announced at the recent Xbox Games Showcase, the handheld will be released later this year.</p>
<p>It's also in contrast to Sony's PSVR2, which has not been well-supported since its release in 2023. Recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/support-for-beat-saber-on-ps4-and-ps4-ends-shining-a-light-on-psvr2s-lack-of-success">Beat Studios ended support for Beat Saber on both PS4 and PS5</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-dips-its-toes-into-vr-with-limited-edition-xbox-themed-meta-quest-headset]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Remember last week when an advert for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> popped up on the London Underground, stating the game is "out now"? This was, alas, a mistake, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-advert-reportedly-spotted-in-london-sparking-hopes-of-imminent-release">Nintendo confirming to Eurogamer the advert was incorrect</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the error has been remedied, and a fresh look Metroid Prime 4: Beyond poster now sits in place, with a 2025 release window plopped next to the image of Samus. This was likely hidden underneath the original 'Out Now' proclamation.</p>

<p>The advert itself is for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> Edition of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, so touts features such as support for mouse controls, up to 4K resolution in docked TV mode, frame rates up to 120fps, and HDR support. On its release - whenever that may indeed be - Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is also set for Nintendo's original Switch console.</p>
<p>We got our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-gets-gorgeous-first-gameplay-trailer-and-its-out-next-year">first gameplay trailer for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond back in June last year</a>. A deeper look at the game was shown during the March Nintendo Direct, where <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-will-give-samus-psychic-powers">Samus' psychic powers were revealed</a>.</p>
<p>Our Ed called Metroid Prime 4 "the best example of Switch 2's varied control capabilities" when he took the upcoming release for a spin earlier this year, though for now he isn't totally convinced by the mouse (as a reminder, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-good-are-switch-2s-mouse-controls-eurogamers-verdict-from-the-big-reveal-event">Switch 2 Joy-Con will boast mouse functionality on the console's release</a>).</p>
