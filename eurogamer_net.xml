            <p>The Division 2: Survivors is "an updated take on the survival extraction experience" coming to The Division 2.</p>
<p>At a panel at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>, the company confirmed that though development is currently "in the early stages" under the watchful eye of creative director and "veteran of the Division from the early days of the original game", Magnus Jansén, the team is keen to involve the community from the off.</p>

<p>"The Division 2: Survivors is as much your baby as it is ours, and we strive for transparency during its development. Clear communication and community involvement are a focus as we build the new experience, and we will be closely involving you as we move forward on the development journey," said executive producer, Julian Gerighty.</p>
<p>There was no in-game artwork or screenshots to share, but Ubisoft did reveal a handful of concept art pieces, which you can see below.</p>

<p>We don't quite know when to expect it – it's still labelled as TBA for now – but we did get a little update on what else players can expect over the course of this year and next:</p>

<p>Interested in trying before you buy and maybe giving a little feedback as you go? Ubisoft is looking to refresh its <a href="http://ubi.li/etf-registration">Elite Task Program, so sign up now</a> if you're a "committed player [looking] to engage directly with the development team and assist in guiding the future of the Division".</p><p>The Division Resurgence – the free-to-play mobile RPG shooter that picks up a few months after the events of the original game – <a href="http://thedivisionresurgence.com/">is also looking for participants for closed tests</a> on both iOS and Android. Ubisoft says it offers "the same gameplay experience as the Division games adapted to mobile gaming", and "with a familiar map updated to reflect the passage of time, the Division Resurgence will bridge the narrative gap between the Division 1 and 2, adding to the existing lore with additional story beats over time."</p>
