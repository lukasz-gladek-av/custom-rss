            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>'s full original soundtrack is now available to stream.</p>
<p>Featuring original works by Swedish musicians Gustaf Grefberg and Jonatan Järpehag, the soundtrack - which Grefberg called "as fun as it gets" - is available on all the usual platforms, including Spotify, YouTube, Apple, and Amazon.</p>

<p>The playlist features 45 tracks, the synth score "providing the perfect backdrop to Mio and Zoe’s sci-fi and fantasy adventures with unique tracks ranging from atmospheric to high tension".</p>
<p>"Since every chapter in Split Fiction is so different, we wanted to do things similarly to the visuals and the gameplay and throw the player into a new world of music," Grefberg explained in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/news/spilt-fiction-official-soundtrack-out-now">Q&amp;A</a> about the game's music.</p>
<p>"Sometimes the inspiration comes from common genres like trance or drum and bass or cinematic new age music. Other times the inspiration originated from a single instrument. For example, the traversal music throughout most of Summit is based on our own live recordings of hangdrums. There are a few subtle references in there, but most inspiration is based on the foundations of genres or instruments taken in our own unique direction."</p>
<p>Grefberg explained that to create the dynamic score that jumps between different genres, the composers "sat down and played through with what we had, which often meant something very much work-in-progress".</p>
<p>"We discussed the overall feeling before we spent some time (usually one to two weeks, depending on available time) to just try out ideas and moods. We then sat down with Josef and listened together and came to a final direction. Sometimes we got them down right away, other times we went through a few iterations to get the feeling and mood that we all aligned with and Josef enjoyed."</p>
<p>Split Fiction shifted 1m units in 48 hours, and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">another million copies in its first week</a> - and now it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-has-broken-not-one-not-two-but-three-world-records">officially record-breaking, too</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, Guinness World Records revealed Hazelight's part-fantasy, part-sci-fi adventure "broke an impressive three world records within days of its release", becoming the most played local co-op video game on Steam, the most sold local co-op video game within 48 hours of release, and most sold local co-op video game within one week of release.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> developer Kinetic Games has outlined what's coming up in the first event of 2025, Cursed Hollow, when it launches on 17th April.</p>
<p>Fans can expect "new bone-chilling challenges and secrets to uncover", as well as a number of "exciting changes from previous events" including new reward categories, daily map rotation - nine of which have been seasonally decorated - and gameplay modifiers as you unearth mysterious Jackalope totems.</p>

<p>Players can also expect "additional reworks" recommended by the Phasmo community itself, including two different types of rewards: Community and Personal. Completing the former will grant points that go towards the wider community pool, whilst personal rewards are precisely that. However, to unlock personal objectives, players have to work together to reach the Community goal first.</p>
<p>"During Cursed Hollow, Ghost Hunters will need to work together to identify ghosts, complete objectives, and search for Jackalope totems hidden across the game’s maps," the developer teased. "But beware: interacting with the totems will have eerie effects, some helpful, and some that may hinder even the most experienced of teams."</p>
<p>"We're really excited for Cursed Hollow to launch next week, and once again have our players join together to tackle this season's Community goals," said lead developer and director of Kinetic Games, Daniel "Dknighter" Knight.</p>
<p>"We've made some changes this year following direct feedback from our previous events; from the new reward split, to some interesting new gameplay modifiers. Our community is everything, and we're always looking for ways to improve - we hope everyone enjoys what 'Cursed Hollow' has in store for them this Easter, and keeps the feedback coming on what they want to see in the future."</p>
<p>Cursed Hollow will kick off on 17th April and run for three weeks. Phasmophobia is available on PC via Steam, PS5, PS VR2, and Xbox Series X/S</p>

            <p>
FragPunk - the chaotic, neon-splurged hero shooter from NetEease - has sorted out the "unexpected technical challenges" it ran into earlier this year while trying to get the console version out the door. As such, it's finally coming to Xbox Series X/S and PS5 on 29th April.
</p>
<p>
FragPunk's 5v5 (and free-to-play) shooting action ticks plenty of familiar genre boxes as its 12 distinct Lancer "heroes" hit the battlefield, but it's all made spicier thanks to its card-based modifier system - which sees teams pooling their earned chips at the start of a match to decide which of three possible options they want to inflict on everyone this turn.
</p>
<p>
Choices are pulled form a pool of over 150 Shard Cards, meaning rules can be twisted in sometimes dramatic ways. You might decide to give everyone massive heads, for instance, or remove all guns from play. Or you might choose a card that lets allies lay eggs to restore health or that teleports enemies back to their spawn point after taking damage.

It's got its fair share of issues, as<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fragpunk-could-be-brilliant-if-it-wasnt-so-obsessed-with-being-a-hyper-rewarding-slot-machine"> Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell recently opined</a> after playing FragPunk for a while, but its match-weirdening gimmick is a good one. "For someone who's always found this genre just a little too self-serious," Chris wrote, "this stuff is perfection... all the less desirable stuff from this genre, the toxicity and the almost excessive levels of tension, are quite easily defused when the thing people are shrieking about is called 'Mass Crab Walk'. In playing a highly moreish few hours of it this week, I've had a blast."
</p>
<p>
FragPunk was originally supposed to launch for Xbox and PlayStation early last month, at the same time as PC version. However, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fragpunk-console-launch-delayed-as-neteases-shooter-hits-pc-this-week">opted for a last-minute console delay</a>, blaming "unexpected technical challenges". Now, though, in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/netease-games_we-appreciate-your-patience-lancers-were-ugcPost-7316113990856695808-FrBu">short message shared on social media</a>, the company has confirmed a 29th April release for FragPunk on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, thanking players for their "continuing patience and unwavering support."
</p>
<p>
It's also promising non-specific "gifts" to console players "as a token of our gratitude and to make up for the delay". These will be sent to all newly registered console game accounts and include time-limited event rewards from the start of Season 1 up to 29th April. "A detailed list of all above mentioned rewards and their distribution methods," it adds, "will be shared in a separate announcement before launch."
