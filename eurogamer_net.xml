            <p>Developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> has deployed another rather chunky patch for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>.</p>
<p>On the game's initial launch last year, Stalker 2 was criticised for its performance issues. However, in an interview with Eurogamer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delaying-stalker-2-again-not-an-option-studio-says-team-worked-until-it-was-broken-by-marathon-development">GSC Game World's CEO Ievgen Grygorovych said delaying the game was not an option</a>. "You're so tired that you would just die if you say let's run an additional marathon," Grygorovych said at the time. </p>

</figure>
<p>The team has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyls-second-major-patch-adds-1700-improvements-and-fixes">remained committed to sorting the game's various niggles</a> and what not since then, with two already sizeable patches already out there, and this most recent update is a continuation of that. </p>
<p>Patch 1.3, as it is known, comes with "over 1200 changes and improvements" to all aspects of the game, including performance, combat and more.</p>
<p>With this patch in play, Stalker 2 players will notice multiple new death screens which "vary based on the cause of the death", as well as improved facial animations, a new night music theme for Slag Heap and a new type of a visual anomaly.</p>
<p>On the combat side of things, GSC has made mutant movements during combat smoother and improved the reaction of NPCs to the sound of footsteps.</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/en/news/patch-1-3">full patch notes via the Stalker 2 website here</a>.</p>

            <p>Shipments for Analogue's upcoming console - known as the Analogue 3D - have been delayed.</p>
<p>The Analogue 3D looks like a pretty smart piece of kit, and one which allows users to play original N64 cartridges in 4K. Oh, hello nostalgia, my old friend!</p>
<p>Anyway, this console was originally available for interested patrons to preorder at the end of 2024, with a scheduled shipment window of Q1 2025. However, shipping has now been delayed, and moved to the balmy summer month of July. So, if analaysts are right, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-analysts-predict-400-price-and-biggest-console-launch-ever-in-june">month after the Nintendo Switch 2 may grace our shelves</a>.  </p>

<p>But, I digress. Back to the Analogue 3D. </p>
<p>"We are working hard to get your 3D order in hands asap and appreciate your patience," a <a href="https://www.analogue.co/support/resource/3d-preorder-faq">notice on Analogue's website reads</a>. The console's maker said if you currently have an open preorder, then no action is required.</p>
<p>"As always, if you’d like to cancel your pre-order at any time, Analogue has always had a no questions asked, 100 percent refund policy for pre-orders," the website continues.</p>

<p>"Analogue 3D represents a milestone in video game preservation: it's not only the world's first reimagining of an N64 - but the world's first 100 percent-compatible recreation of an N64," the company shared on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/analogues-new-console-is-a-4k-n64-machine-that-uses-original-cartridges">the Analogue 3D's initial reveal last year</a>.</p>
<p>"No more incompatibilities found in software emulation like input lag, graphic/audio inaccuracies, timing/frame rate issues and more. For the first time, you can re-experience the N64 exactly as it was meant to be, without compromise."</p>
<p>I wonder if my <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask">Majora's Mask</a> cartridge still works...</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Let's be honest, when it comes to The Sims, sometimes it is quite a lot of fun to kill off various members of your community, be it by letting them get devoured by a cowplant or the always classic pool ladder removal technique (although, you now also need walls to box those Sims in).</p>
<p>So, if you are like me - and don't pretend that you aren't - you will probably be wondering what methods there will be to kill off your characters in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">Inzoi</a>, the upcoming Sim-like from Krafton. And, the good news for us players who like to flex those Godly muscles, Inzoi has "16 different types of deaths" for players to discover.</p>

<p>"One of the biggest features of this game is death," game director Hyungjun 'Kjun' Kim said during an Inzoi livestream (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/in-good-news-for-sim-murdering-sickos-inzoi-has-16-different-types-of-deaths/">PC Gamer</a>), acknowledging that "life comes with death".</p>
<p>So, what of those deaths? "In Inzoi you could go to the bathroom and if you slip you might die. Or if you eat some old food you might have to go to the bathroom and, again, die," the director shared.</p>
<p>"And when you fix broken-down electronics you might get electrocuted, so you need to be careful. I made the chance really low, but actually electronics can very often break down. We have 16 different types of deaths."</p>
<p>Now, some of those deaths sound very similar to deaths in EA's The Sims series, but Inzoi will have one rather unique death -  "dying from the need for recognition".</p>
<p>Said Kjun: "In the modern world you find a lot of people feel fulfilled from being recognised by others and this death reflects that. For example, in Inzoi let's say I fought with someone and that rumor spread and came back to me. I could get a text message about it, or a friend of mine could tell me about the rumor and if the rumor is negative then my need for acknowledgement can go down.</p>
<p>"And if that drops too drastically then you might die from that."</p>
<p>Inzoi's characters can also get hit by cars, so be sure to practice some road safety when out and about. "I reiterate, we have a simulation and death and this type of thing is a part of the game," Kjun concluded.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft has launched the Xbox Adaptive Joystick, a companion controller that looks very similar to the Wii's Nunchuk accessory. 
</p>
<p>
Fans of Nintendo's retro console will spot the same shape as the Wii Nunchuk, with two trigger buttons on the back of the device and an analogue stick on top. Four face buttons are also included.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-expands-accessibility-range-with-new-xbox-adaptive-joystick">Xbox Adaptive Joystick was announced last year</a> as a further aid to accessibility, and plugs directly into any Xbox One or Xbox Series X/S console, Windows 11 PC, or the Xbox Adaptive Controller device.

<p>
For now, the controller is being <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/accessories/controllers/xbox-adaptive-joystick">sold via the Microsoft Store</a> for £25, or $30. 
</p>
<p>
"With more than 429 million players with disabilities worldwide, we know each player has unique needs and preferences for how they choose to play," Microsoft's chief accessibility officer Jenny Lay-Flurrie <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/03/18/microsoft-ability-summit-2025-accessibility-in-the-ai-era/">said in a Microsoft blog post</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"The Xbox Adaptive Joystick is a singular, wired controller primarily designed to meet the needs of players with limited mobility. Its versatility helps players seamlessly incorporate it into their existing gaming setups. Built with the Gaming and Disability community who inform the development of Xbox products from the beginning. The joystick joins our family of adaptive accessories including the mouse, pen, adaptive kit and Xbox Adaptive Controller."
</p>
<p>
Buttons can be remapped via the standard Xbox Accessories app. A range of 3D-printable thumbstick topper designs are also available via the Xbox Design lab, to allow users to customise their controller further to their needs.
