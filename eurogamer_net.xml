Drag x Drive, the Nintendo-developed wheelchair basketball game unveiled alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> back in April, is getting a limited-time demo.
</p>
<p>
Drag x Drive was one of the more unusual additions to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">April's big Switch 2 news blow-out</a>, taking advantage of the console's new mouse controls in a distinctive dual Joy-Con configuration as two teams of three players propel themselves around the court in an effort to score the most points before a match ends.
</p>
<p>
If that sounds intriguing, there'll be an opportunity for Switch Online subscribers to take Drag x Drive for a spin ahead of its full release on 14th August this year. Nintendo's calling the event the Drag x Drive: Global Jam, and it'll run across three four hours slots starting 9th August in the UK.

<p>
Slot one runs from 11am-3pm UK time on Saturday, 9th August, while two additional slots - running 1am-5am and 5pm-9pm - take place on Sunday, 10th August. If you happen to live in the US, the Saturday slot runs from 3am to 7am PT, and the Sunday slots are scheduled for 9am-1pm and 5pm-9pm PT.
</p>
<p>
Drag x Drive will cost £16.99 when it arrives on 14th August as a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Drag-x-Drive-2785803.html">Switch 2 eShop exclusive</a>. Former Eurogamer editor-in-chief Tom Phillips described the fast-paced experience as "exhausting" after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-good-are-switch-2s-mouse-controls-eurogamers-verdict-from-the-big-reveal-event">brief hands on with Drag x Drive earlier this year</a>, but hopefully the full experience will be entertaining enough to balance out that arm-based exertion.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, Atlus' critically acclaimed RPG, has now sold 2m units worldwide.</p>
<p>It became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-surpasses-1m-sales-on-launch-day-to-become-fastest-selling-atlus-game">the developer's fastest-selling game ever</a> upon its release last October, selling over a million units on its first day on sale.</p>
<p>It means the game has taken a further nine months to double its sales, suggesting its initial sales were from Atlus fans eager to play a new game from the developer outside of its famed Persona series, but longterm it perhaps hasn't resonated with a wider audience.</p>

<p>News of this sales milestone isn't entirely new, however, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-leaked-sales-figures-show-sonics-new-frontier-is-heading-in-the-right-direction">Sega accidentally leaked sales figures</a> for a number of its key franchises last month.</p>
<p>While Metaphor has sold 2m units, last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> sold 2.07m units, both of which pale in comparison to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-royal">Persona 5 Royal</a>'s 7.25m units.</p>
<p>The game received rave reviews on its release. "Persona veteran Atlus flexes its expertise with a fresh take on high fantasy," I wrote in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-review">Metaphor: ReFantazio review</a>. "What it lacks in subtlety, it makes up for in grandeur and heart."</p>
<p>More recently, I spoke with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-metaphor-refantazios-ui-escaped-the-shadow-of-persona">game's UI designer Koji Ise about escaping the shadow of Persona</a> and conveying a sense of "cool".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-has-sold-2m-units-worldwide-atlus-officially-reveals]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has announced who will play Link and Zelda in its forthcoming live-action The Legend of Zelda film, with two relatively unknown actors taking the lead roles.</p>
<p>Zelda will be played by Bo Bragason, while Link will be played by Benjamin Evan Ainsworth. The news was shared in a social media post from series creator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, adding: "I am very much looking forward to seeing both of them on the big screen."</p>
<p>Bragason is a young English actress with a very slight filmography, having most recently been in the Disney+ series Renegade Nell and the 2024 film The Radleys. As for games, she played Young Luna in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xv">Final Fantasy 15</a> animated film Kingsglaive.</p>
<p>Ainsworth, meanwhile, is a 16-year-old English actor with roles in Netflix series The Haunting of Bly Manor and comic book adaptation The Sandman.</p>
<p>The film is due for release on 7th May 2027, having been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-has-delayed-its-legend-of-zelda-film">recently delayed from a March 2027 release</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> will amend the way trading works at the end of this month, following previous criticism of the feature.</p>
<p>Trading was added to the digital card game back in January, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-brand-trading-system-a-joke-and-downright-greedy">players quickly criticised the need for an extra currency</a>, calling the system "a joke". Then, back in March, The Pokémon Company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-overhauls-trading-following-player-backlash">acknowledged the backlash and announced an overhaul</a>.</p>
<p>Today, an in-game notification states an update will take place on 29th July. This will discontinue trade tokens and instead the existing shinedust will be used for trading. In addition, players will no longer need to consume cards in order to trade.</p>

<p>To compensate, the amount of shinedust acquired for duplicate cards will be doubled. Trade tokens will also be exchangeable in the shop for pack hourglasses and shinedust.</p>
<p>The exchange rate will be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 x pack hourglass = 1 x trade token (maximum 60 exchanges)</li>
<li>10 x shinedust = 1 x trade token (unlimited exchanges)</li>
<li>100 x shinedust = 10 x trade tokens (unlimited exchanges)</li>
<li>1000 x shinedust = 100 x trade tokens (unlimited exchanges)</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to this update, the trading function will be unavailable from 25th July 7am until 30th July 06:59 am.</p>
<p>Another addition will be a Wishlist feature, where players can indicate to others which cards they'd like to trade for. This will make trading for the right cards considerably easier.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>The Pokémon Company / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Pokémon Company previously stated these changes would arrive by the end of autumn 2025, so this update is arriving a lot sooner than expected.</p>
<p>The annual <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-presents-livestream-date-reveal-points-to-something-musical-rather-than-simply-an-update-on-pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Presents livestream will take place on 22nd July</a>, which was teased yesterday with a Pikachu at a set of DJ decks. Perhaps we'll receive an update to Pokémon TCG Pocket too.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-finally-receives-much-needed-trading-overhaul]]></content:encoded>
