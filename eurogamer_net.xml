            <p>Following the passing of Sylens' original actor Lance Reddick last year, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> has recast the role.</p>
<p>In the latest Horizon outing, the character is voiced by Tim Russ, Eurogamer can confirm.</p>
<p>Russ has been in the industry for many years, and is known for his roles in the likes of Star Trek: Voyager where he portrayed Vulcan Lieutenant Commander Tuvok, and as doorman Frank in Samantha Who?</p>

<p>Sylens features in both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>, which Lego Horizon Adventures is based on, and its sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a>. Series developer Guerrilla is yet to comment on who will replace Reddick, who portrayed Sylens in both mainline games and their respective DLC, longer term.</p>
<p>Reddick <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/actor-lance-reddick-star-of-destiny-and-the-wire-has-died">passed away in March last year</a>, aged 60. Following his passing, players discovered a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lance-reddick-memorial-added-to-horizon-forbidden-west-dlc">memorial situated on an island visited in Horizon Forbidden West's DLC Burning Shores</a>, which served as an homage to the late actor.</p>
<p>"In honour of Lance Reddick, we created a memorial to commemorate the profound impact he had on us all," Guerrilla wrote at the time.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Lance, for everything you brought to the role of Sylens: your gravitas, energy, wisdom and more. An incomparable talent and friend. We miss you terribly."</p>

<p>As for Lego Horizon Adventures, we just awarded the game two out of five stars.</p>

"I still don't know why it exists or who it's for, and there's little evidence to suggest that Guerrilla or Gobo know the answer either."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>GOG has announced a new Preservation Program.</p>
<p>This initiative from the PC platform aims to maintain games' compatibility with modern and future systems.</p>
<p>"Time is erasing the games that shaped you. Forgotten, incompatible, unplayable," the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program">GOG Preservation Program</a> page reads. "We can fight back."</p>

<p>At the time of writing, GOG has confirmed 100 games are currently part of the program. "By maintaining these iconic titles, GOG helps you protect and relive the memories that shaped you, DRM-free and with dedicated tech support," the team wrote.</p>
<p>In addition, GOG shared a number of preservation stories, including <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition">Heroes of Might and Magic 3</a>, which first released over two decades ago.</p>
<p>GOG "revived" it 10 years ago, and an update today fixed non-playing intros in Russian and French versions of the game, validated stability and "verified compatibility" with Windows 10 and 11.</p>
<p>Other titles include the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-resident-evil-available-now-on-gog-2-and-3-on-their-way">recent Resident Evil Bundle</a>, which comprises the original game in the series as well as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> and Resident Evil 3.</p>

            <p>The PlayStation-published <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> doesn't include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> support at launch.</p>
<p>If you pop over to the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-PPSA14632_00-LEGOHZNADVENTURE">PlayStation store</a>, the game doesn't have the PS5 Pro Enhanced label attached to it, which other games do. Rather, the soon-to-be-released brick-based romp will instead offer players two different graphics modes on its debut: Performance and Fidelity.</p>
<p>Performance mode will provide a higher frame rate. Fidelity, meanwhile, gives a lower frame rate but - as the name suggests - higher fidelity. These modes are used in countless other games, as well.</p>

<p>It may well be that developers Guerrilla and Studio Gobo release a patch for Lego Horizon Adventures that adds that shiny, PS5 Pro 'Enhanced' label at a later date.</p>
<p>For now, however, Eurogamer has verified that the game's Perofrmance and Fidelity modes are the only ones offered on both the base PS5 as well as the PS5 Pro.</p>

<p>On the PlayStation 5 Pro's announcement, it was revealed several titles would be patched up to that PS5 Pro Enhanced level, which will ensure these games take full advantage of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">PlayStation 5 Pro's improved features</a>, such as advanced ray tracing and a GPU that enables up to 45 percent faster rendering.</p><p>Many of the games listed at this time were from Sony's own first-party studios, such as Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/insomniac-games">Insomniac Games</a>, The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> and Bluepoint's Demon's Souls. You can check out the full list of PS5 Pro Enhanced games (so far, at least) in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-games-listed">our handy guide here</a>.</p>
