<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> - the Schrödinger's cat of video games in as much as its development appears to be simultaneously alive and dead - is set to reveal its delayed 2.3 update tomorrow, 16th July, with CD Projekt seemingly hinting at a vehicular focus.
</p>
<p>
Cyberpunk 2077's 2.3 update was originally announced in June, despite development on the game having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-development-has-finally-wound-down-after-three-and-a-half-years">technically wrapped up last year</a>, with a planned release toward the end of the month. However, its launch was ultimately pushed back to an undisclosed later point after CD Projekt decided it needed "more time".
</p>
<p>
As for what 2.3 will include, all the studio would say previously is that it was "aiming for a scope similar to" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-22-adds-new-secrets-expanded-customisation-options-and-more">last year's 2.2 release</a>. That, by way of comparison, introduced a variety of fixes and quality of life improvements, alongside an improved photo mode, new car and player customisations, plus a new selection of "most requested" vehicles for purchase via Autofixer. Oh, and there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-night-city-infiltrated-by-balatros-giggling-joker-in-22-update-secret">that Balatro collaboration</a> too.
</p>
<p>
All of which brings us to tomorrow's <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1945136315705467297">newly announced livestream</a>. It's airing at 5pm, 16th July, on <a href="https://t.co/crpXzrC6VR">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://t.co/6RhhKsU0xa">YouTube</a>, with appearances from Cyberpunk 2 associate game director Paweł Sasko and Adrien Jouannet, lead Designer at Virtuos. Rumours <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-cdpr-isnt-actually-finished-with-cyberpunk-2077-announces-another-update">Virtuous had been drafted in to work on some sort of Cyberpunk 2077 DLC</a> first surfaced back in June.
</p>
<p>
CD Projekt's livestream announcement also features some very particular phrasing, strongly hinting this latest release will likely focus on vehicles. "We're driving into Patch 2.3 of Cyberpunk 2077 to check what's under the hood of the newest update," the studio wrote, before referring to the shows guests as "passengers" then wrapping up with a wheel emoji.
</p>
<p>
Cyberpunk 2077 has, of course, recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-a-cutting-edge-game-translates-well-to-nintendos-console-hybrid">made an impressive debut on Switch 2</a>, and a sadder, bloodier, and darker <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/when-people-are-sad-im-a-bit-happy-cyberpunk-edgerunners-season-two-is-going-to-be-sadder-bloodier-and-darker">second season of Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</a> is also on the way. That's alongside Cyberpunk 2077's eagerly anticipated - albeit distant - sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-feature-second-city-thats-like-chicago-gone-wrong-says-series-creator">Cyberpunk 2</a>.

            <p>The Pokémon Company has announced that <a href="https://x.com/pokemon_cojp/status/1945045929620349069?s=46">a Pokémon Presents livestream</a> will take place on 22nd July. This comes alongside a tease of Pikachu standing in front of what appears to be a DJ deck.</p>
<p>The stream will take place at 9pm JST, which is 5am PDT / 8am EDT / 1pm GMT / 2pm CEST. There's no word on what exactly will be shown, but given the teaser image one can assume it'll be some form of music-related game or service.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, Pikachu has tried his hand at DJing in the past. He and Gengar have donned DJ attire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/m8X3DBT_pio">at Universal Studios Japan as part of the Pokémon Halloween event</a>. Aside from that, there have been no music-focused Pokémon games, and neither Pikachu nor Gengar have shown up as DJs in card form.</p>

<p>So what's the deal here? Well, this is speculation, but one of two reveals seems likely. The longshot is a new music-focused Pokémon game that'll get revealed during the Pokémon Presents livestream. The other, a Pokémon music service. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-music-app-sees-mario-maker-take-on-spotify-and-youtube-playlists">Nintendo launched its own music app in October 2024</a>, and Pokémon is no stranger to banger tracks and catchy tunes.</p>
<p>That or it could be something totally different, and this teaser image has nothing to do with music whatsoever. With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> the next big release in the series, one wouldn't be surprised to see an update for that game featured as part of this livestreamed event. Either way, we'll have to check it out live to know for sure!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-presents-livestream-date-reveal-points-to-something-musical-rather-than-simply-an-update-on-pokemon-legends-z-a]]></content:encoded>
