            <p>
Activision has delayed the rollout of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone Season 3, including the anticipated return of the latter's classic Verdansk map. 
</p>
<p>
Season 3 was previously due to arrive around 20th March. Now, it'll hit two weeks later on 3rd April.
</p>
<p>
"Season 3 is a big moment for Call of Duty: Warzone and Black Ops 6, and we're taking the time to deliver a great experience starting on 3rd April," Activision wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1896636715143704641">post on social media</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"More to come following Call of Duty: Warzone's fifth anniversary next week..."
</p>
<p>
Verdansk was Call of Duty: Warzone's original map, available when the battle royale's first iteration arrived back in 2020. Now, it's widely-expected to return in time for the game's fifth anniversary.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty is the latest battle royale to lean on nostalgia and bring back a classic map in the hopes of boosting player numbers, following the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>.
</p>
<p>
The move to return to a fan-favourite map follows a patchy start to this year's Call of Duty content, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-bans-another-136000-cheaters">Activision having to focus time to address player concerns over rampant in-game cheating</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-block-ops-6-players-accuse-activision-of-using-ai-slop">admitting to the use of in-game AI imagery</a>, and selling a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-players-lament-battle-passes-in-between-battle-passes-with-squid-game-event">separate expensive Squid Game battle pass</a>
</p><p><span data-fixed="false" data-hashid="" data-init="false" data-poll-position="1"></span>

"For a series built on high-octane thrills and explosive gratification, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's withdrawal to the well-trodden formula echoes the wider industry's continued allergy to risk," our Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">Eurogamer's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/new-game-in-classic-jrpg-series-suikoden-announced-by-konami<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A new role-playing adventure set in the world of Suikoden is on the way, but there is a catch.</p>
<p>It has been many years since we last got a Suikoden. In fact, the last mainline entry was released in February, 2006. So, nearly 20 years ago (seriously, where is time going?!). This makes last night's announcement from Konami rather exciting - a new title in the Suikoden series is on the way, and it looks lovely, with pixel art reminiscent of the original games.</p>
<p>It's known as Suikoden Star Leap, and will take place "a few years before the events of Suikoden 1, but a couple years after Suikoden 5". The upcoming game promises "vibrant" locales to explore and new characters along with familiar faces. But, like I said, there is a catch. You see, this is the "first title to be tailored for mobile", and the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3ljj4ymsvzs2m">developer has confirmed it will have gacha elements</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out a trailer for Suikoden Star Leap below (Japanese audio).</p>

<p>We don't have a release date yet for Suikoden Star Leap, with Konami simply stating it will be coming "soon". The team will share more details as part of a future announcement, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>While for now the game is only slated for release on iOS and Android, we know that other gacha games have done well on the likes of PlayStation (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/honkai-star-rail-review-more-than-genshin-impact-in-space">hello there Honkai Star Rail</a>), so perhaps Suikoden Star Leap will one day make its way to consoles.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on Suikoden Star Leap?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has sold over 8m units in just three days, setting a new record for Capcom as its fastest selling game.</p>
<p>The game was released last Friday, 28th February, and on its first day reached a concurrent player count on Steam of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">over a million within its first day</a>.

<p>These 8m sales are across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

<p>Capcom has put the high sales down to the game's broad global appeal, its inclusion in global events (like PlayStation's State of Play and The Game Awards), and holding multiple online beta tests.</p>
<p>"Capcom remains firmly committed to satisfying the expectations of all users by leveraging its industry leading game development capabilities in order to create highly entertaining gameplay experiences," the company said, perhaps alluding to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">poor technical performance of the game</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-warns-incoming-monster-hunter-wilds-update-will-discontinue-your-online-session">patch for the game was released earlier this morning</a>, designed to fix a progress-blocking bug and more.</p>
<p>Capcom lists its top-selling games, what it calls <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html">Platinum Titles</a>, with Monster Hunter Worlds at the top with 21.3m units sold (as of December last year). It's followed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> with 16.7m and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> remake with 15m.</p>
<p>Could Monster Hunter Wilds overthrow its predecessor? At the very least, it's cemented once again that Monster Hunter is Capcom's most lucrative series.</p>

            <p>
If you've spent anytime at all plopping stuff down in 2019's wonderfully soothing minimalist city builder Islanders, there's a fair chance you've been won over enough that a sequel is potentially quite exciting indeed. So brace yourself: publisher Coatsink has announced Islanders: New Shores, and it's coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC this "summer".
</p>
<p>
The original Islanders, to recap, was a game about strategically cramming as many amenities as possible onto a tiny (but visually pleasing) randomly generated island - all while attempting to maximise your score by making the most of each amenity's adjacency multipliers. That probably doesn't sound hugely exciting, but its chill vibes and relaxed action made for an unexpectedly hypnotic experience - a space management game as compelling as it was soothing.
</p>
<p>
Which brings us to Islanders: New Shores, a gently expanded follow-up promising the chance to "explore, build, and strategise like never before". This time around, Coatsink - which acquired the franchise from original developer Grizzly Games in 2022 - has teamed up with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/steamworld-build">SteamWorld Build</a> studio The Station, and it's touting a variety of new features for its sequel.

<p>
For starters, New Shores introduces "boons" - one-time power-ups unlocked as players amass points, used to gain an advantage on tougher stages - plus two distinct modes of play in the form of High Score and Sandbox, each with their own saves. Elsewhere, there's talk of 44 unique building types and seven island properties, as well as a photo mode with its own filters and a turntable camera. You can get a taste of New Shores' action in the trailer above.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date for Islanders: New Shores just yet, but it's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2368930/ISLANDERS_New_Shores/">Steam</a>, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch this "summer". And if it's anywhere near as good as its predecessor, it should be well worth keeping an eye on. Christian Donlan called the original Islanders a "thoughtful spin on strategy" and a "classic" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/islanders-console-edition-review-a-gloriously-dreamy-approach-to-city-building">his Recommended review</a> back in 2021.
