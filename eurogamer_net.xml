            <p>
The heroes in a half shell are back, and this time they're pressing right up against your eyeballs. That's thanks to their debut VR outing, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>: Empire City, which is coming to Meta Quest 3 and SteamVR sometime next year.
</p>
<p>
Empire City is the work of Cortopia Studios - which co-developed last year's well-received gladiatorial bludgeon-'em-up Gorn 2 - and follows Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, and Michelangelo in an action-adventure set on (and presumably under) the Foot Clan-infested streets of New York City following Shredder's demise.
</p>
<p>
It's an adventure described as "equal parts hard-hitting combat and an exploration of the bonds of brotherhood", and there's talk of "fluid parkour" as players - and up to three friends - scale the urban landscape. Fan-favourite villains are also promised, all readying for a walloping - in battles built around strikes and blocks - with each turtle's signature weapon.

<p>
And that, apart from confirmation The Last Ronin author Tom Waltz is saving as narrative consultant, is about all we know. The teaser trailer above isn't much more informative, but you'll find a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3713650/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Empire_City/">handful of screenshots over on Steam</a>. Expect more details in the run up to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Empire City's Steam VR and Meta Quest release in 2026.
</p>
<p>
It's been busy few years for the Turtles, of course; following 2022's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shredders-revenge-is-a-reminder-of-the-richness-and-joy-of-16-bit-animations">brilliant beat-'em-up Shredder's Revenge</a> and acclaimed 2023 movie outing Mutant Mayhem, last year brought the fairly middling Mutants Unleashed and rogue-like Splintered Fate. Strange Scaffold took on the series earlier this month, nudging it into turn-based strategy territory with Tactical Takedown, and it's already been confirmed more games - including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tmnt-graphic-novel-the-last-ronin-will-become-a-dark-god-of-war-style-video-game">God of War-inspired The Last Ronin</a> - are on the way. As a scaly green youth once put it, "Totally tubular, dude!"

CD Projekt's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> sequel has officially shed its Project Orion codename and will henceforth be known as Cyberpunk 2. That's as the studio provides its latest development update, confirming it's now entered the pre-production phase.
</p>
<p>
A Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, codenamed Project Orion, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-red-announces-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-future-witcher-projects-outlined">formally announced back in 2022</a>, and CD Projekt has been providing investors with progress updates on its development since then. Most recently, back in March, it revealed Project Orion was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-shares-witcher-and-cyberpunk-project-updates-announces-partnership-with-mobile-developer-scopely">nearing the end of its concept phase</a> and would be entering pre-production "in the coming weeks". And now, as per the <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cd-projekt-wraps-up-the-beginning-of-2025/">studio's Q1 2025 earnings results</a>, pre-production is officially underway.
</p>
<p>
Announcing its latest development milestone, CD Projekt also took the opportunity to jettison the Project Orion codename and instead begin referring to the sequel simply as Cyberpunk 2. This doesn't, however, mean the name will permanently stick; CD Projekt <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675651/cd-projekt-red-cyberpunk-2-project-orion">told The Verge</a> Cyberpunk 2 "just means it's another game in the Cyberpunk universe."

<p>
Despite these notable developments, Cyberpunk 2's team size has only seen a modest increase since the beginning of the year, with 96 developer now confirmed to be working on the project versus 84 in February. The bulk of the studio, as expected, is currently focused on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>, with 422 employees assigned to the project. That's compared to the modest 49 developers working on multiplayer The Witcher spin-off Project Sirius, and the 19 on Project Hadar - which is planned to be the studio's first-ever original game.
</p>
<p>
All these production updates were accompanied by a number of sales milestones. Cyberpunk 2077 expansion Project Liberty has, for instance, now sold over 10m copies, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> - which this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-cd-projekt-red-when-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-launched">celebrates its tenth anniversary</a> - has seen over 60m sales. 
</p>
<p>
As for what's next, CD Projekt has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-can-the-new-nintendo-console-handle-it">priming a Switch 2 version of Cyberpunk 2077</a> to release alongside the console next week, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-is-bringing-cyberpunk-2077-to-macs-early-next-year">Mac port is also on the way</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-actor-celebrates-witcher-4-protagonist-ciri-following-woke-criticism">Ciri-starring Witcher 4</a> is likely still some considerable way off, with the newly monikered Cyberpunk 2 - which will reportedly <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Eurogamer/posts/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-features-second-city-thats-like-chicago-gone-wrong-says-se/">take players to second city like "Chicago gone wrong"</a> - to follow.

        <p>Move will "sharpen our focus", says EA.</p>

            <p>
EA has reportedly cancelled its single-player Black Panther game and closed the studio behind it, resulting in an unspecified number of layoffs.
</p>
<p>
EA Entertainment president Laura Miele shared the news in an email to staff <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-games">seen by IGN</a>, insisting today's Black Panther cancellation, the closure of Cliffhanger Games, and the resulting job losses - as well the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reportedly-lays-off-over-300-employees-cancels-new-titanfall-game">recent cancellation of other projects</a>, including an unannounced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> game at Respawn - would help the publisher "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities."
</p>
<p>
EA declined to comment on the number of employees impacted by its latest round of layoffs when approached by IGN (these will reportedly also affect members of the publisher's mobile and central divisions), but the website says it understands fewer individuals will be affected compared to the 300 job cuts recently made across Respawn and several other teams.
</p>
<p>
"These decisions are hard," Miele wrote. "They affect people we've worked with, learned from, and shared real moments with. We're doing everything we can to support them - including finding opportunities within EA, where we've had success helping people land in new roles."
</p>
<p>
EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-single-player-black-panther-game-from-new-studio">announced its Black Panther title</a> back in 2023, confirming it would be handled by its then-new Cliffhanger Games studio in collaboration with Marvel Games. Although few details were shared at the time, it was described as a third-person title set in an "expansive and reactive" version of Wakanda, and still "early in development". Nothing has been seen of the project since then, but a job listing in 2024 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-black-panther-game-will-be-open-world-recruitment-ad-suggests">indicated it would be an open-world game</a>.
</p>
<p>
Black Panther's cancellation follows EA CEO Andrew Wilson's comments last year that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-further-lay-offs-this-time-likely-to-affect-around-670-employees">publisher would be moving away from "future licensed IP"</a>. And while Miele insisted EA will continue to invest in developer Motive's Iron Man project and Respawn's third Star Wars: Jedi game, she suggested the focus will now be on a small number of its own franchises, specifically Battlefield, The Sims, Skate, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>. That's in addition to Bioware's next <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>.
</p>
<p>
Notably, EA also recently announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-its-pausing-development-on-future-rally-games-as-wrc-partnership-ends">ending its licensing partnership with the World Rally Championship</a> and "pausing development" on all future rally games - a move which resulted in an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-it-is-reducing-roles-at-codemasters-and-redeploying-as-many-as-possible">undisclosed number of additional layoffs</a> at Codemasters.
</p>
<p>
A second Black Panther project - publisher Skydance Games' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, which is being penned by Uncharted writer Amy Hennig - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amy-hennigs-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-into-next-year">recently delayed into next year</a>.
