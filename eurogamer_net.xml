            <p>
Last night, Microsoft trumpeted the announcement of Muse, a new "generative AI breakthrough" designed to aid "gameplay ideation".
</p>
<p>
The company also <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/02/19/muse-ai-xbox-empowering-creators-and-players/">published some grainy-looking gifs</a> of AI-generated gameplay footage, based on Xbox studio Ninja Theory's multiplayer game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bleeding-edge">Bleeding Edge</a>. (The images were miniature in size, presumably to avoid highlighting some of the wonkiness AI is known for.)
</p>
<p>
Finally, Microsoft made the claim that Muse would "radically change how we preserve and experience classic games in the future", and that the algorithm could be used to make older games compatible with "any device".

<p>
Reaction to Microsoft's announcement was swift, with social media awash with posts pointing out that, yes, Microsoft was absolutely jumping on the tech industry's AI buzzword bandwagon - but also the suggesting that Xbox was about to start using Muse to pump out AI slop. 
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, someone has done a better job than Microsoft itself of explaining what Muse is actually doing - and that person is AI researcher and game designer Dr Michael Cook.
</p>
<p>
For background, Cook is an expert on the subject of AI in games - he's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/can-an-ai-win-a-game-jam">the guy who built an artificial intelligence to see if it could win a game jam</a> a full decade ago, whose work <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/plastic-soul-one-mans-quest-to-build-an-ai-that-can-create-games">Eurogamer has covered on several occasions</a>. He's also a senior lecturer at King's College London, and has published and spoken extensively on the subject of AI.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.possibilityspace.org/blog-before-you-post/index.html">Cook lays out in an extended blog post on Muse</a>, the AI model is not generating gameplay or creating its own original ideas. 
</p>
<p>
In short, Muse was fed seven years of video footage of people playing a singular game - in this case, Bleeding Edge - to see if it could then generate further gameplay footage of it.
</p>
<p>
(If this all sounds familiar, it's similar to the process <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/google-reaches-grim-ai-milestone-replicates-playable-version-of-doom-entirely-by-algorithm">Google used to generate footage of classic first-person shooter Doom</a> last year.)
</p>
<p>
So, what's the point of all this? Well, as Cook writes, it's so Microsoft researcher could ask Muse to predict what might come next if changes to a game were made.
</p>
<p>
"They made a tool that let game developers edit a game level using existing game concepts like adding in a jump pad to a place where there wasn't one before," Cook explains. 
</p>
<p>
"They then gave this new level to their model, and asked it to show what it thought the footage of a player playing from this new position would look like."
</p>
<p>
In other words, the idea is Muse could be used as a shortcut tool for predicting and visualising how gameplay might adapt to a particular input by a developer. And, crucially, that developer is still a human.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Screenshot-2025-02-20-123122.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Muse's AI-generated gameplay footage of Ninja Theory multiplayer game Bleeding Edge. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Microsoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Microsoft's research paper on Muse says the AI model is required to understand persistency, consistency, and diversity in order to succeed. In other words, if a human input is provided, the AI needs to ensure the effects of that input remain, whatever else is going on, and that the effects remain similar while adapting to a range of player behaviours.
</p>
<p>
For example, say a human adds a jump pad to a game's level. The paper says Muse must predict gameplay footage to reflect this which also ensures the jump pad persists (no deleting it!), that it reacts the same each time (it should always make players jump), regardless of what else is happening (this should apply even if a different player activates it).
</p>
<p>
"The paper is not really about 'generating gameplay' or 'ideas'," Cook continued. "It's about these researchers thinking about the implications of how people will work with these tools."
</p>
<p>
Notably, there's nothing in the paper that discusses the implications of Muse being added to the development processes of teams with a strong aversion to using AI, Cook notes. 
</p>
<p>
That said, in Xbox's blog post on Muse yesterday, Microsoft gaming AI exec Fatima Kardar stated that the company had simply "empowered creative leaders here at Xbox to decide on the use of generative AI" - suggesting there was no specific mandate from Microsoft to use AI, for now.
</p>
<p>
But even with Muse being just used for a limited purpose, Cook has further questions around whether it will ever be fully viable.
</p>
<p>
"This is not a practical process," Cook writes. "It's impressive that it can do this using visual information because things like lighting, camera angles, user interface and so on are a lot for an AI model to handle. 
</p>
<p>
"But ultimately, even with all of this data, all the time spent annotating datasets, and so on, it was still only just about able to generate footage predicting player behaviour."
</p>
<p>
Such a system currently lacks any practical use, is enormously expensive, and requires any developer already have a vast vault of gameplay footage lying around for Muse to ingest in the first place.
</p>
<p>
"The research team behind this probably believe it will get more efficient over time, which might make it more affordable or tractable for small developers," Cook continues. "However, it still raises the question of how we get video footage of people playing our game in the first place. 
</p>
<p>
"If you've been in development for a couple of months then you won't have enough footage, and even if we make the systems able to run on less input data there must be a minimum level required to understand the full game logic. So I think there is a question here not just of whether it makes sense as a tool now, but whether it can ever make sense."
</p>
<p>
Lastly, on game preservation.
</p>
<p>
"You could imagine a world where, from gameplay data and video, a model could learn old games and really make them portable to any platform where these models could run," Xbox chief <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c15vxDHJ2lU&amp;t=225s&amp;ab_channel=Xbox">Phil Spencer said yesterday in a video on Muse</a>. "I feel that's really exciting."
</p>
<p>
Bluntly, Cook calls Spencer's comments "idiotic".
</p>
<p>
"I mean, in a sense anything is a preservation tool," Cook writes. "I could ask my friend's five-year-old son to draw a crayon picture of what he thinks the ending cutscene of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-viii">Final Fantasy 8</a> looks like and that would still count as game preservation of a certain sort."
</p>
<p>
Despite a decade of AI growth, Cook says, there's no method yet to measure what exactly an AI model has captured and what it has not. Muse is able to provide grainy gifs of one fairly simple video game based on seven years of footage, but it is not a solution for holding everything about a game or every possible outcome of what players could do.
</p>
<p>
"This is absolutely not a solution for game preservation," Cook concludes, citing a <a href="https://bl.iro.bl.uk/concern/reports/37f6e434-73cf-43f5-8d7e-7ab37a6de832">report by gaming archeologist Florence Smith Nicholls about the archiving of digital games</a>. "What does it mean to preserve a gameplay experience? Even if this model was a perfect replication of the original executable software, this is not the be-all and end-all of game preservation. A generative model of what game footage maybe looked like once might be a nice curio on the side of a real preservation process, but it is always going to be inferior to other ways we approach the problem."
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/artificial-intelligence-is-an-oxymoron-theres-no-such-thing-says-take-two-boss">Strauss Zelnick weighed in with his opinion of AI</a>, saying that "artificial intelligence is an oxymoron, there's no such thing".

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> has now surpassed 32 million players a year after release, though lawsuits filed by Nintendo remain unresolved.</p>
<p>Developer Pocketpair shared the news on social media, with those player numbers across Steam, Xbox and PS5.</p>
<p>The news arrives as the game receives its <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1892412892508770560">latest update</a>, fixing crashes on Xbox and Steam Deck, reworking the Random Pal mode, and making various balance adjustments and bug fixes.</p>

<p>It's been a rocky year Pocketpair and its monster-catching game, which first caught the attention of players for its Pokémon-with-guns aesthetic.</p>
<p>Upon release, the game hit <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-has-clocked-up-2m-players-in-just-24-hours">two million players in just 24 hours</a> and its all-time concurrent player peak on Steam remains just over two million players. Two weeks later, the game had surpassed 19 million players across PC and Xbox Series X/S, with Microsoft touting it as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-surpasses-19m-players-sees-biggest-third-party-game-pass-launch-ever">biggest third-party launch in Game Pass history</a>.</p>
<p>The launch was soured, though, by comparisons with the Pokémon series, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-fans-hit-back-at-palworlds-lazy-pal-designs">fans calling the Pal designs "lazy"</a> due to their similarities.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-is-officially-out-today-on-playstation">game eventually arrived on Sony's PS5 in September</a>, to further expand the playerbase. And that will increase further once a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-headed-to-mobile-courtesy-of-kraftons-pubg-studios">mobile release arrives, developed by Krafton's PUBG Studios</a>.</p>
<p>However, Nintendo dropped a major bombshell in September when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Pocketpair</a>, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-says-it-will-investigate-and-take-appropriate-measures-following-claims-palworld-copied-designs">statement back in January</a> it would "investigate and take appropriate measures".</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-vows-to-fight-nintendo-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-fans-and-indie-developers">Pocketpair vowed to fight the lawsuit</a> on behalf of fans and indie developers. "Pocketpair is a small indie game company based in Tokyo," it said. "Our goal as a company has always been to create fun games. We will continue to pursue this goal because we know that our games bring joy to millions of gamers around the world."</p>
<p>It added: "It is truly unfortunate that we will be forced to allocate significant time to matters unrelated to game development due to this lawsuit. However, we will do our utmost for our fans, and to ensure that indie game developers are not hindered or discouraged from pursuing their creative ideas."</p>
<p>In November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says">Pocketpair provided further details on the lawsuit</a>, revealing it related to three patents filed by Nintendo between February and July of 2024, which relate back to a pre-existing parent patent from December 2021. These patents cover gameplay mechanics like capturing digital creatures and riding them.</p>
<p>A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">Pocketpair ditched its Pokéball-style summoning mechanic</a>.</p>
<p>Most recently, Nintendo has filed a number of patent applications in the US, as reported by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/yesterday-nintendo-received-a-u-s-version-of-another-anti-palworld-patent-and-asked-the-u-s-patent-office-for-an-interview-to-get-a-third-patent/">GamesFray</a>. These appear to relate to similar patents filed in Japan. However, at present there is no suggestion Nintendo is bringing US litigation against Pocketpair - for now, the lawsuit remains in Japan.</p>
<p>Still, development on Palworld is ongoing, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-adding-ending-scenario-this-year-as-game-celebrates-first-anniversary-while-under-legal-threat-from-nintendo">Pocketpair is adding an "ending scenario"</a> as part of its second year roadmap, as well as co-op crossplay. It won't be the end of Palworld, though, as community manager John "Bucky" Buckley confirmed to Eurogamer this <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-discusses-games-ending-says-its-been-mapped-out-for-quite-some-time">ending has been "mapped out for quite some time"</a>.</p>
<p>"As a company, we've learned how to structure our processes better," Bucky told Eurogamer, discussing the past year. "People often forget that Pocketpair is quite a small team. The methods we've used for our previous games worked well, but Palworld put a spotlight on both our weaknesses and strengths. This year really brought the team together and made us more effective in our workflows."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Marvel Rivals has amassed over 40 million players since its launch, but Chinese publisher NetEase has denied abandoning western studios after it laid off a number of developers from the game's US development team.</p>
<p>In its latest financial report, the company also boasted the free-to-play hero shooter topped Steam's global sellers chart after launch and had over 10 million registered users within 72 hours.</p>
<p>However, earlier this week NetEase laid off an unspecified number of employees from Marvel Rivals' US development team, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">game director Thaddeus Sasser breaking the news first</a>.

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-publisher-netease-responds-to-shocking-layoffs-claims-they-were-to-optimise-development-efficiency">Netease stated afterwards</a> the layoffs were a "difficult decision" made to "optimise development efficiency". However, a new report from <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/netease-is-unloading-its-overseas-game-properties-hurting-u-s-gaming/">VentureBeat</a> suggests there's more to come.</p>
<p>Sources interviewed by VentureBeat said the company is losing its will to make games outside of China, in part due to the high cost of US developers. The success of games like Game Science's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> also prove the AAA capabilities of China's own development studios.</p>
<p>The report also highlights that recent layoffs have coincidentally occurred alongside the trade war between the US and China, which could have further repercussions in the global games industry.</p>
<p>NetEase has denied such allegations.</p>
<p>"As far as overseas business efforts are concerned, NetEase has not wavered in its global expansion plans," reads a statement from the company to VentureBeat.</p>
<p>"Our 'two-pronged' approach, proposed in 2022 (combining self-research and investments to explore overseas markets), is still actively progressing and yielding positive results. For titles developed by the self-owned studios, we successfully launched games like Once Human and Marvel Rivals in 2024. These projects demonstrate NetEase's ability, along with our talented development teams, to produce high-quality games loved by players worldwide. For 2025, we have an extensive pipeline of titles in development, featuring a variety of genres, including FragPunk, Ananta and more."</p>
<p>NetEase did, however, acknowledge a "scaling down" of studios - something that has led to shutdowns and layoffs at an array of studios including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-will-pause-operations-at-fresh-aaa-game-studio-while-seeking-new-partner">Mass Effect veteran Mac Walters' Worlds Untold</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">Halo Infinite head of design Jerry Hook's Jar of Sparks</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">Just Cause creator Christofer Sundberg's Liquid Swords</a>.</p>
<p>"As part of our investment strategy, we started scaling down two of our studios at the end of 2024," it said. "This decision was based purely on business evaluations and was not influenced by other factors. And this represents only a small portion of our overseas studio portfolio. Our studios in North America, UK, Spain, and Japan all continue to refine and develop their ongoing game projects."</p>
<p>It continued: "We are very open and aim to leverage our company's strengths and accumulated expertise to support all developers. In order to achieve this vision, we have implemented an evaluation process, which applies equally to all NetEase studios globally – both domestic and overseas."</p>
<p>As far as the trade war is concerned, NetEase responded: "Regarding the tariff trade war, yes of course we are mindful of any developments in international trade. However, our decisions have been based solely on business evaluations and not influenced by other factors. We highly respect our gaming community in the US and their love and enthusiasm for our games is valued and appreciated."</p>
<p>Could other Chinese games companies pull out of the US? All eyes are on Chinese conglomerate <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>, the biggest games company in the world, which the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-labels-tencent-as-a-chinese-military-company">US labelled as a military company</a> last month. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-threatens-legal-proceedings-if-us-doesnt-overturn-decision-to-label-it-as-a-chinese-military-company">Tencent threatened "legal proceedings"</a> in retaliation.</p>
<p>"While geopolitical concerns and cost pressures after two challenging years for the global video game industry are driving Chinese game companies to re-evaluate their US operations, this does not signal a withdrawal from operating and investing in studios overseas," gaming analyst firm <a href="https://nikopartners.com/chinese-video-game-companies-are-adapting-their-us-strategies/">Niko Partners wrote</a> yesterday. "It instead reflects a more selective and strategic approach to overseas investments, prioritizing projects with clear market potential - a business and fiscally driven strategy."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in its financial report, NetEase stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/where-winds-meet-brings-wuxia-to-the-west">wuxia action game Where Winds Meet</a> surpassed 3m downloads within four days of its PC launch in China - combined with the later mobile release, the game had 15 million players within two weeks. A release outside of China is expected this year.</p>
<p>"We boldly pushed the boundaries of innovation once again in 2024, delivering groundbreaking gaming experiences that captivated players worldwide," said CEO William Ding. "Our new hit titles not only redefined gameplay but also set new industry benchmarks, while our legacy franchises gained fresh momentum through striking enhancements in design, storytelling and immersive content. As our diverse game portfolio expands across more genres and engages an ever-growing global audience, we remain dedicated to fostering creativity and collaborating with top talent and strategic partners to shape the next wave of gaming trends."</p>

            <p>The live-action Street Fighter film now has a new director: Kitao Sakurai.</p>
<p>Capcom is "deeply involved with the adaptation" reports <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-finds-its-director-1236140934/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, and it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/live-action-street-fighter-movie-gets-2026-release-date">still set to release on 20th March 2026</a>.</p>
<p>The Japanese-American filmmaker most recently directed Netflix film Bad Trip starring comedian Eric André. Sakurai also wrote, directed and exec produced The Eric André Show.</p>

<p>Sakurai also isn't a stranger to video game adaptations, having directed several episodes of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/twisted-metal">Twisted Metal</a> TV show. He was also exec producer on the second season of Netflix show Beef, and directed several episodes of forthcoming Amazon series Butterfly.</p>
<p>Legendary will co-develop and co-produce the film alongside Capcom.</p>
<p>A previous incarnation of the film was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-new-street-fighter-movie-gets-the-directors-behind-horror-film-talk-to-me">set to be helmed by Australian twin filmmakers and YouTubers Danny and Michael Philippou</a>, known for the horror film Talk to Me. Last June the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-movie-loses-talk-to-me-filmmakers-1235924842/">pair left the project</a> with scheduling partly to blame.</p>
<p>Little else is known about the film, though Capcom's involvement will hopefully ensure its authenticity. I'm sure we can expect the likes of Ryu, Ken, and Chun-Li to feature.</p>
<p>Of course, it's by no means the first Street Fighter film adaptation, following the infamous 1994 film starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue.</p>
<p>The Street Fighter film will be up against its traditional rival, Mortal Kombat.</p>

            <p>
The Pokémon Company's annual Pokémon Presents broadcast has now been confirmed to air next week, on Thursday 27th February at 2pm UK time. That's 6am Pacific Time, or 9am Eastern.
</p>
<p>
Every year, Pokémon holds a presentation on this date to mark the anniversary of the original Pokémon Red and Green titles launching in Japan for Game Boy. This year is no different. 
</p>
<p>
So, what do we expect to see?

<p>
This year's biggest Pokémon launch will undoubtedly be Pokémon Legends Z-A, which was announced last year in a brief teaser that curiously did not show any gameplay. The title is a Switch 1 game, but will we see a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> version confirmed - or the game running on Nintendo's newly-announced hardware?
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Legends Z-A is set to take players back to the Kalos region</a>, the setting of Pokémon X and Y, and looks like it will once again feature the popular Mega Evolution mechanic.
</p>
<p>
As another Legends game, it will likely have more of an action-RPG focus, similar to the previous Pokémon Legends Arceus. But where that game was set in the distant past, Z-A appears to be set in the modern day or near future.
</p>
<p>
Alongside a big focus on Z-A, Presents will likely feature a look at the franchise's other various ongoing games - such as Pokémon Unite, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>.
</p>
<p>
This week, it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-developer-close-to-selling-games-for-35bn-to-saudi-owned-monopoly-go-maker-report">Pokémon Go is in talks to be sold to the Saudi-backed Savvy Games Group</a>, in a deal worth  $3.5bn. But don't expect to hear an update on that next week.
</p>
<p>
As ever, Eurogamer will be covering all the announcements from Pokémon Presents - join us then for more.

            <p>The second major update for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> is now available, adding a new Olympian: the god of war.</p>
<p>Appropriately named the Warsong Update, Ares has now been added (but redesigned) along with all of his boons, which look to be similar to those in the first game.</p>
<p>Also added is The Final Confrontation, with a new discovery to make atop Mount Olympus. Say no more.</p>

<figcaption>Hades II - The Warsong Update Trailer<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrpGYTlCjNQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The update also includes a new animal familiar to aid in battle, new arcana arts, new enemies, new music, and new ways to relax in the Crossroads, all as per the trailer above.</p>
<p>And of course, the story expands with new events too.</p>
<p>Over on Steam, developer Supergiant Games has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/503942841152569404">detailed all the additions</a> - along with quality of life tweaks and bug fixes, there are reworked boons and blessings, new upgrades and keepsakes, changes to level designs and more.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-gets-new-region-weapon-familiars-and-more-in-first-major-early-access-update">first major update for Hades 2</a> (the Olympic Update) was back in October last year, which the Warsong Update follows along with other smaller patches.</p>
<p>The game remains in early access for now and, as noted in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350?emclan=103582791472836561&amp;emgid=503942841152569349">separate Steam blog</a>, a third major update is planned. There's still no release date for version 1.0.</p>
<p>"We're excited to have launched this Major Update, since it includes numerous ideas we've been eager to implement since we started working on Hades 2 years ago!" the post reads.</p>
<p>"But we're not finished yet, and have already made plans for our third Major Update, which we intend to deliver some months from now. Note it's still too early to share our plans beyond that, including when our v1.0 launch will be."</p>
<p>Last year creative director Greg Kasavin said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-in-early-access-at-least-through-the-end-of-this-year-says-creative-director">game would be in early access "at least through the end of this year"</a>. It seems that's set to extend for a while yet.</p>
<p>"Supergiant's first ever sequel may feel very comfortable and familiar, but Hades' best weapon remains the power of surprise," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades 2 early access review</a>. Clearly there are still plenty more surprises to come.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
