            <p>Last year, The Pokémon Company announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-pokemon-project-in-the-works-with-wallace-and-gromit-maker-aardman">teaming up with Wallace and Gromit maker Aardman for a "special project"</a> and now, thanks to this afternoon's Pokémon Presents broadcast, we have our first peek at the adorably British looking stop-motion animation series.</p>
<p>"We'll be putting some very special Pokémon front and centre, as the heroes of our show," Aardman's creative director Peter Lord said today, "and it will be set in a region that is very close to our hearts. It will give a unique look at the Pokémon world, told from the perspective of Pokémon with the signature sense of Aardman character and comedy and craft."</p>
<p>Lord's words certainly seem to ring true when you watch the first teaser for what is now officially known as Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch'd and Pichu, which along with those two cheeky blighters causing all sorts of chaos in the background also stars a very unphased Wooloo nonchalantly munching on grass and - eventually - a baked apple. You can check out the first teaser for Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch'd and Pichu below.</p>

<p>Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch'd and Pichu is scheduled for release in 2027. Will you be tuning in? I think it looks rather adorable (plus, I am a fan of Wallace and Gromit). </p>

            <p>Pokémon Friends has just been announced at today's Pokémon Presents event. It's a game focused on puzzle solving and plushie collecting, and it's out right now <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000102053">on the Nintendo e-shop</a>.
</p>
<p>The gameplay centres around you solving three randomly generated puzzles in order to collect some special yarn. This yarn can then be taken to the Plush-O-Matic machine. This will then create a cute Pokémon plush, which you can display in an in-game plush room.
</p>
<p>The game also allows you to track all the plushes you collect, and mark each day you log in! All in all, it appears to be a cute little daily puzzle game, aimed to giving you a short burst of brain activity every day.

            <p>Moon Studios, the developer behind the Ori games, will focus on PS5 over Xbox for its forthcoming game No Rest for the Wicked due to "current market conditions".</p>
<p>No Rest for the Wicked is currently in early access on PC, with a console release due in future. But on the <a href="https://x.com/delmontyb/status/1947313884584398874">game's Discord</a>, studio CEO Thomas Mahler stated: "given current market conditions, we might only release on PS5 and potentially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> for the time being - we'll have to discuss things with MS to see what makes sense for Xbox."</p>
<p>It's quite the turnaround, considering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ori-and-the-blind-forest">Ori and the Blind Forest</a> (and its sequel) was first released on Xbox with Microsoft as publisher.</p>

<p>Responding to a further comment on social media, Mahler walked back his statement slightly.</p>
<p>"There's nothing to officially confirm yet," he said. "We want to support consoles and just looking at the numbers, PS5 makes the most sense at the moment. Ultimately we'll ship on all platforms, but likely not at the same time!"</p> <div>

<p>Over on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/no-rest-for-the-wicked-may-be-skipping-xbox-due-to-market-conditions-update-dev-reply-added-to-op.1686511/">NeoGAF forum</a>, Mahler provided a further response that this wasn't a "shakedown" of Microsoft but "common f*cking sense".</p>
<p>"Folks, can we drop the conspiracy theory insanity?" he began, adding that co-op and console support are what the community want the most.</p>
<p>"And in order to get there fast, we'll first support the platform that has the most users purely out of resource reasons," he continued. "We're a comparatively small indie studio, so doing a console port at the quality level we want is not a small task. Porting to Xbox means porting to Xbox Series X and Series S and that'll take more time to optimise compared to porting to PS5 and PS5Pro. So we're most likely going to do PS5/PS5Pro first and launch there in order to make fans happy and supply other ports later.</p>
<p>"That's literally all there is to it. And yes, we'll need to discuss with Xbox and Nintendo what the best strategies are to support their platforms and their features in the best way possible and that'll be an ongoing discussion."</p>
<p>No Rest for the Wicked gets off to a "shaky start", according to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-review-a-shaky-start-but-theres-potential">our review of the early access release</a> in April 2024. However the game has received multiple updates since then and sits with a Mostly Positive rating on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1371980/No_Rest_for_the_Wicked/">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Back in March, Moon Studios secured the publishing rights to the game from Take-Two and announced it was a fully independent studio.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ori-studios-focus-on-ps5-over-xbox-for-next-game-isnt-a-shakedown-but-common-fcking-sense-says-ceo]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new development in the troubled history of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/duke-nukem-forever">Duke Nukem Forever</a> has revealed itself. COO of Digital Extremes Sheldon Carter revealed to Eurogamer that while there was an "alternate history" where the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a>-creator took the game under its wing, the studio had its hands full at the time with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">Bioshock</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-darkness-ii">The Darkness 2</a>.
</p>
<p>This conflicts with a May 2022 post by Apogee and 3D Realms co-founder Scott Miller, <a href="https://www.apogeeent.com/devblog/dnf-truth">who wrote a short history of the game</a> after a 2001 build was leaked online. In it, Miller claimed he tried to pass the game onto Digital Extremes.
</p>
<p>Miller stated: "I recognised that DNF was in deep trouble back in 2004 and tried to get the entire game developed by a more experienced studio, Digital Extremes (now famous for Warframe). The owner there was eager to take over DNF from us, and we even had the blessing of our publisher at the time (Take-Two), but this idea was shot down internally. It turned out to be a fatal suicide shot."

<p>But according to Sheldon, Digital Extremes was too busy to take up development of a third game: </p>
<p>"What can I say about this... I mean these are still those stories that are tough, tough to tell. I would say the things that were neat were that we definately got to see it all, and we got to have meetings with George [Broussard, co-founder Apogee and 3D Realms] who was amazing and has always been a cool guy. It was an exciting time for us. I think in the end they ended up being published by 2K right? We were working on The Darkness 2 and Bioshock, both were kind of cranking at that point. So, there's an alternate history [laughs] on how that all worked out. </p>
<p>"But I can't imagine it could have been anything but George's baby to be honest."</p>
<p>When asked if this was the main reason Digital Extremes didn't take on Duke Nukem Forever, Carter emphasised it was moreso the work on The Darkness 2 and Bioshock was taking priority. Carter explained: "I think mainly we were pretty commited with the stuff that we had. <em>My baby</em> at the time was The Darkness 2, that was my obsession.
</p>
<p>"The way our company was structured, we had two games which was really cool, and they were both going at that time with 2K. So it was natural for [3D Realms] to approach, as we were executing two first-person-shooters, but I don't think it ever went to the level that might have been implied. We weren't in a position to aquire it or take it on, it never got to that stage. It was definately cool though!</p>
<p>It turns out this week is a special one for the infamous Duke Nukem Forever. The game took 5,158 days to release since its announcement on the 27th April, 1997. Eventually coming out on 10th June, 2011, 5,158 days later, you've got the 24th July, 2025. How about that! On Thursday, we'll be one Duke Nukem Forever away fron Duke Nukem Forever.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/digital-extremes-coo-claims-digital-extremes-was-too-busy-with-bioshock-and-the-darkness-2-to-take-on-the-troubled-duke-nukem-forever]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Today's the day! The Pokémon Company's next Pokémon Presents broadcast goes live in just under an hour, at 2pm UK time - and you can watch it right here on Eurogamer.
</p>
<p>For anyone watching across in the States, you'll want to tune in at 5am Pacific and 8am Eastern. For Japan, it's a bit later on, taking place at 9pm JST. </p>
<p>Per metadata from the Pokémon YouTube channel, the stream will run for just over 24 minutes (making it one of the longer presentations in recent years).</p>
<p>The livestream was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-presents-livestream-date-reveal-points-to-something-musical-rather-than-simply-an-update-on-pokemon-legends-z-a">teased last week</a> with an image of Pikachu standing in front of a set of speakers and a DJ deck, leading many to think the presentation would announce something music-related.</p>
<p> In actuality, The Pokemon Company <a href="https://twitter.com/Pokemon_cojp/status/1946525436080480353">revealed</a> that the tease was pointing towards a pre-show music stream. At 1pm, an hour before Pokémon Presents, a pre-event show called "Everyone Gather! DJ Pikachu Live" will show the little yellow mouse channeling his inner-Avicii. Fair enough!</p>
<p>Check out the pre-show concert below.</p>

<p>Other than this peculiar and charming development, we can expect updates on a few key Pokémon titles coming over the next few months; I anticipate updates on the next mainline game (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>), some updates on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon Go</a>, new content for Pokémon Pocket TCG, and I'm also hoping for more information on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-shown-at-this-years-pokemon-presents">Pokémon Champions</a> - the upcoming strategy video game developed by The Pokémon Works and published by Nintendo.
</p>
<p>So far, we know the game is coming to the Nintendo Switch, Android and iOS. It has no release date at the time of writing, and basically continues the ideas set out in Pokémon Stadium, way back in 1999. The game will connect with Pokémon Home, so you can use your caught Pokémon from the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>, or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-scarlet-violet-walkthrough-tips-9015">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a>. It seems like a tentpole project for TPC, and I'm curious to see what more we learn about the game today.</p>

<p>In a previous Pokémon Presents, we also got confirmation that Pokémon Concierge will return for a second season - I'm hoping we'll get a release date for the beautiful, stop-motion Netflix series beyond the vague 'September 2025' window we currently have. For me, it represents a very deep understanding of the Pokémon brand: welcoming, warm, and with a focus on the creatures themselves. I look forward to learning more about it soon.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-pokemon-presents-here]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The first-ever Hellraiser game is in development as a single-player, survival horror action release, with the team behind it all promising the chance to experience the infamous series "like never before".</p>
<p>It's coming from Saber Interactive and Boss Team Games, and will of course pit players against Pinhead. For fans of the series, the upcoming game - known as Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival - will also see actor Doug Bradley returning to the role for the first time in nearly two decades.</p>
<p>"Discover the tale of Aidan, who must unlock the dark powers of the Genesis Configuration, a mysterious puzzle box, to help his girlfriend from a hellish abyss," reads the official blurb. "As Aidan, you'll harness the box's infernal abilities to survive your pact with the sinister Pinhead and battle against the twisted cult that worships him and the Cenobites. Fail, and your suffering will be legendary, even in Hell. We have such sights to show you..."</p>

<p>"Working on the first true Hellraiser game has been a venture deep into the recesses of my darkest imaginings," said Hellraiser creator Clive Barker. "The dedication that Saber and Boss Team Games have shown is nothing short of remarkable. They've immersed themselves in the Hellraiser universe, capturing its essence - the seductive pull of suffering, the beauty within the grotesque - and forged a narrative that invites players to step beyond the threshold.</p>
<p>"I'm eager for both the curious and the damned to experience this new chapter in the Hellraiser mythos, where every moment balances on the brink of nightmare and revelation."</p>
<p>Saber head Matthew Karch, meanwhile, called Hellraiser "the quintessential horror franchise", and one which "lends itself perfectly" to a video game.</p>
<p>"Saber has had success with horror IPs in the past, and working alongside Clive to create tense gameplay and a new story that delves into the twisted depths of pain and pleasure has been a real treat," Karch said. "We look forward to opening up the gates of hell."</p>
<p>Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival is available to wishlist now via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>While this will be, in Barker's words, the first true Hellraiser game, it won't be Pinhead's first foray into the world of video game horror. He has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylights-hellraiser-dlc-is-getting-yanked-from-sale-soon">popped up in Dead by Daylight</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/first-ever-hellraiser-game-announced-with-doug-bradley-returning-as-pinhead]]></content:encoded>
