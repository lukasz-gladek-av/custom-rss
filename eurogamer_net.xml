            <p>
Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza has found its sea legs on Steam, where it launched to the series' second-biggest concurrent player haul to date.
</p>
<p>
A peak of 22,327 PC players played Pirate Yakuza over the weekend, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3061810/charts/#1w">Steam's own stats</a> - avast total higher than every other game in the franchise to date, save Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth. 
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Steam itself broke its all-time concurrent user record once more - this time to hit 39.92 million online users. Prior to this, the record stood at 39.3 million, from back in December 2024.

</figure>
<p>
While a better start than most of the (many) other Yakuza/Like A Dragon games, including 2023's Like A Dragon: Ishin! and The Man Who Erased His Name, RGG Studio's nautical spin-off still saw around half of the players at launch as last year's Infinite Wealth, which peaked at 46,161 concurrent players total.
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, Pirate Yakuza is most definitely a spin-off from the main series. On the other - pirates!
</p>
<p>
"A raucous, absurd spin-off that manages to still feel like a first-rate Yakuza game despite the leftfield setting and delightfully unhinged plot," Matt Elliot wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-review">Eurogamer's Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza review</a>. "All of this somehow coalesces into something that works in defiance of itself."

            <p>Actor Yuri Lowenthal, the voice behind Peter Parker in Insomanic's games, has confirmed the original Spider-Man won't be sidelined in the series' third chapter.</p>
<p>In conversation with <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/spider-man-3-ps5-game-story-exclusive">The Direct</a>, Lowenthal stated there were "very few things" he could say about Insomniac's yet to actually be announced next Spider-Man game right now, but assured fans that "Peter is not gone" by any means.</p>
<p>"He will be a part of the next game and he won't be relegated to the couch, I promise," Lowenthal said. <strong>Beware some Marvel's Spider-Man 2 spoilers below.</strong></p>

<p>Those who have completed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> will know that the game ends with Peter Parker essentially handing the webby torch over to Miles Morales. While Miles as Spider-Man will take care of New York, Peter was going to focus more on his personal life with Mary Jane, and also build the Emily-May Foundation after it got fairly ripped to shreds during the fight with Venom.</p>
<p>The game then rounds out with two mid-credits scenes, clearly pathing the way for that third entry. The first of these scenes sees Norman Osborn - devastated by his son Harry's comatose state, and who blames the Spider-Men for ruining Harry's recovery - popping over to The Raft to visit Dr Octavius. He seems on course to become the Green Goblin, one of the Spider-Man series' main antagonists.</p>
<p>A second scene focusing on Miles' family introduces us very briefly to his mother's new boyfriend Albert Moon, and Albert's daughter, Cindy. Cindy Moon, for those unaware, is another person in the Marvel universe who gets bitten and given powers by a radioactive spider. She becomes the superhero Silk.</p>
<p>Guides writer Marie and I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lets-discuss-marvels-spider-man-2">chatted at length about where the next game could go following Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>, and we theorised Miles may take Cindy under his wing and show her the Spidey ropes much like Peter did with him. At first we assumed this would mean Peter would have more of a 'cameo-like' role in the next game, but given what Lowenthal has said, it seems he may have a bigger role than first thought.</p>
<p>What are your hopes for Peter and co in the next Marvel's Spider-Man game?</p>

<p>While Lowenthal's comments have sparked plenty of chatter, Marvel's Spider-Man 3 is perhaps still a way off. After all, the studio still has its Wolverine release in the works.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-studio-insomniac-developing-wolverine-game">Wolverine was first teased back in 2021</a>, during a PlayStation Showcase. At this time, the studio stated the game was still "very early in development". Last month, Insomniac's newly appointed studio head Chad Dezern acknowledged the "pent up excitement" around the game, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-developer-wont-say-if-wolverine-launches-in-2025-but-acknowledges-pent-up-excitement-for-release-date">refrained from confirming or denying a 2025 release window for Wolverine</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm has hit out at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, saying he "should've never been banned in the first place" despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">admitting to conduct</a> that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate" with a minor back in June 2024.</p>
<p>Responding to news Twitch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-reckons-cheating-while-livestreaming-is-a-low-severity-violation">has updated its enforcement rules so that streamers caught violating guidelines will now be subjected to varying limited-time bans</a>, Beahm issued a comment from his personal account X/Twitter, saying Twitch "should've never allowed a low-level employee to override the entire ban system".</p>

<p>"Although things have been 'settled', Twitch should do the right thing and correct their mistake of permanently banning the Doc by reinstating the channel," he wrote. "We should've never been banned in the first place.</p>
<p>"Twitch should've never allowed a low level employee to override the entire ban system, which had already determined we didn't do anything wrong, because of biased opinions of the Doc character.</p>
<p>"They could've reached out and had a quick five-minute call and realise these mutual jokes and bantering never had serious intentions. Pathetic."</p>
<p>Beahm <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">admitted to conduct</a> that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate" with a minor back in June, after Twitch's former account director of strategic partnerships, Cody Conners, claimed an unnamed person had been banned from the streaming platform "because [he] got caught sexting a minor". Those allegations were later directly linked to Beahm.</p>
<p>After a period away from the spotlight, an agitated Beahm returned in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkaSTVagsgo">combative YouTube stream</a> in September in which he repeatedly accused Conners and "so-called journalists" of a "planned and coordinated attack". All this, Beahm admitted, came ahead of a 25th September "opportunity" to reapply for partnership on YouTube and re-monetise his channel, which was eventually approved.</p>
<p>Since that admission, Robert Bowling - who co-founded developer Midnight Society with Beahm - <a href="https://x.com/fourzerotwo/status/1805671144412049732">distanced himself</a> from the streamer, and many long-running partners <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dr-disrespects-sponsors-and-partners-are-responding-to-twitch-ban-allegations-updated">terminated their agreements</a>. By the end of January, four months after making "significant" layoffs, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/drdisrespect-studio-midnight-society-announces-closure-four-months-after-significant-layoffs">Midnight Society announced it was permanently shutting its doors</a>.</p>
<p>Beahm has yet to publicly share the "mutual jokes and bantering" messages he sent to the minor.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Brace yourself, Assassin's Creed fans - it looks like early copies of the upcoming instalment, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, have broken the street date.</p>
<p>Unsubstantiated reports are beginning to circulate that not only have some fans been able to download the full game early from the PlayStation Store, physical copies have been prematurely sold, too.</p>
<p><strong>There may be light spoilers after this point</strong>, so only proceed if you're happy to be spoiled!</p>

<p>Perhaps most notably, Assassin's Creed YouTuber The Hidden One <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Cm-56xcxUo">recently revealed</a> that he knows someone playing the full game on PS5 "because the PlayStation Store made a mistake".</p>
<p>Admitting that he could neither prove it or compel anyone to believe him, The Hidden One then revealed that in the leaked footage, he saw that Animus anomalies are back - something not previously confirmed for Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>
<p>"In the video [the friend with early access] showed me, the player encounters something Animus in the world," he said.</p>
<p>"A pop up appeared that read: 'Animus systems breached. Stabilise anomalies and gain data fragments to advance your active strand'."</p>
<p>The player was then prompted to "press touchpad to open the Animus menu".</p>

</span></p><p>Over on the Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit it goes even further, with reports that <a href="https://ibb.co/PvQX2f2g">physical copies have similarly been sold early</a>.</p>
<p>While, as yet, there doesn't seem to be early footage popping up on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> or YouTube, now may be a good time to mute key words on your favourite social media apps, just in case...</p>
<p>Last week, Ubisoft signalled its expectations for Assassin's Creed Shadows in its latest quarterly financial results, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-pre-orders-solid-in-line-with-series-second-biggest-launch">in which it describes pre-orders for the game as "solid"</a>.</p>
<p>While the company did not divulge exact pre-order numbers, it said they were "in line with those of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a>, the second most succesful entry of the franchise".</p>
<p>Our Katharine said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">Assassin's Creed Shadows was "the biggest shake-up of the series in years"</a> during our recent hands-on time with the game, and praised its dual protagonist gameplay. "If Ubisoft can stick the landing on this one, it will be worth the extended wait," she wrote.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Beyond games, Jason is perhaps best-known for his roles in Deadwood, 48 Hrs, and Prince of Darkness, although you'll also spot him in movies like Rio Lobo, Impulse, Brewster's Millions, They Live, and Alien Nation. He also guest starred on Murder, She Wrote, The Golden Girls, Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories, and Mad Men.</p>

<p>Higher-severity violations - such as ones for hateful conduct - could remain on an account longer, such as a couple of years. But players caught cheating in games whilst streaming via Twitch are now deem "low severity" will only face a 24-hour suspension from the service.</p>
<p>"Starting today, most violations will expire and drop off of your account after a set amount of time," Twitch <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/An-Update-to-our-Enforcement-System?language=en_US">explained</a>. "You will be able to track when they expire in the Appeals Portal, and this information will also be in the enforcement emails that you receive.</p>
<p>"Most violations committed tend to be low severity (such as cheating in online games) and will expire in 90 days. However, higher-severity violations (such as hateful conduct) will remain on an account longer, and will expire in 1 or 2 years.</p>
<p>"The most severe harms will still result in immediate indefinite suspensions. If you are indefinitely suspended due to accumulating multiple violations within a short time period, you are able to apply for reinstatement after 6 months."</p>
<p>Twitch believes "escalating consequences" will "hold users accountable for repeated harmful behaviour", defining harm as "including actions that lead to physical, emotional, social, or financial damage to a community member, to Twitch, or to society".</p>
<p>If your account was previously indefinitely suspended it will remain so despite these changes, Twitch stressed, although in those instances, users can apply for reinstatement (thanks, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-cheating-low-severity-violation/">Insider Gaming</a>).</p>
<p>In November, just ahead of the US elections, Twitch tightened its rules around broadcasts that include debates about "political" and "sensitive social issues". However, after a vocal backlash, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-streams-about-political-and-sensitive-issues-including-reproductive-and-lgbtq-rights-now-require-a-label">Twitch clarified that labels would not apply if a streamer is discussing their "lived experience"</a>, or if discussion of these topics isn't the "focus" of the stream.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The pace of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> US sales has "fallen behind" that of the PS4 Pro.</p>
<p>That's according to games industry analyst Mat Piscatella, who used Circana data to conclude that whilst the PS5 Pro enjoyed a solid start, January 2025's hardware spend in the US was 45 percent lower when compared to the same period a year ago.</p>

<p>In fact, Piscatella posits that there was "double-digit percentage declines" across all major console platforms compared to a year ago, with PS5 hardware spend dipping by 38 percent year-on-year, Xbox Series declining by 50 percent, and Switch 53 percent.</p>
<p>The latter, however, may be as a result of players holding off for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, as part of its financial report to investors, Sony confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-has-now-sold-75m-ps5-consoles-and-has-record-monthly-users">sales of its PS5 console have reached 75m units</a>, which is just shy of PS4 sales after an equivalent period.</p>

<p>However, Sony deviated from the norm and chose not to separate console sales in this report, so we're no longer able to disaggregate PS5 Pro sales from the base console. This makes it difficult to ascertain if the PS5 Pro's eye-watering cost of admission has put off players who would typically update their hardware mid-generation.</p>
<p>That said, PlayStation 5 was once again the best-selling hardware platform of the month in terms of both units sold and dollars generated. Xbox Series was second in hardware spending, although the Nintendo Switch edged out Xbox Series in terms of units sold.</p>
<p>As yet, there's no comparative sales data for PS5 in the UK or Europe.</p>
<p>Back in November, Sony said that despite the "different comments" on the PS5 Pro's chunky price point, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-pro-price-has-not-had-a-negative-impact-on-sales-says-sony-boss">the "pricing [...] has not had a negative impact" on PS5 Pro sales</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
