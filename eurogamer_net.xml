            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>'s eighth season will release a "couple of weeks" later than scheduled after Blizzard decided to serve "the game, not the plan".</p>
<p>Writing on social media, general manager of Diablo Rod Fergusson revealed development was taking a little longer than originally anticipated, but did soften the news by teasing "an old 'friend'" was making a return.</p>

<p>"In the spirit of serving the game, not the plan, Season 8 will take a couple of weeks longer to bake than we initially anticipated," Fergusson wrote.</p>
<p>"The team is hard at work on some great updates coming in the next season, so stay tuned. Looking forward to seeing an old 'friend'."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hey everyone - In the spirit of serving the game, not the plan, Season 8 will take a couple of weeks longer to bake than we initially anticipated. The team is hard at work on some great updates coming in the next season, so stay tuned. Looking forward to seeing an old "friend".</p>â€” Rod Fergusson (@RodFergusson) <a href="https://twitter.com/RodFergusson/status/1895218822615048571?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>That "old 'friend'" has got players excited - and speculating. Whilst Fergusson couldn't be drawn on who that friend - or foe, as the case may be - is, fans have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1izvosa/an_update_on_season_8_from_rod/">suggesting</a> all kinds of characters, from to Cain to Covetous Shen to Lyndon. Others posit it could be the return of Lorath, Tyrael, Zoltun Kulle, Eirena, or Kormac.</p>
<p>Right now, it's unclear exactly how long the season will be delayed for, but we'll keep you posted.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Ed reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-backtracks-on-diablo-4-annual-expansions-next-due-in-2026">Diablo 4's next expansion won't arrive until 2026</a>, marking a change in its annual plans.</p>
<p>Fergusson made the announcement at a DICE panel event, saying: "In 2025, or just before Season 8, we will have a 2025 roadmap for Diablo 4.</p>
<p>"Now, our second expansion won't be on that roadmap, because our second expansion is coming in 2026, but at least players will have the road ahead."</p>
<p>"A polished, bewitching upgrade that sinks its claws into you - featuring perhaps the best character class in Diablo's history," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review">Vessel of Hatred review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
