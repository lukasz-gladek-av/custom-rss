It's not magic brain science to suggest <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> is going to be big, but one investment firm has suggested it's going to be big to the tune of $7.6bn in just two months, while also securing the accolade of "largest gaming release of all time." 
</p>
<p>
That's according to Josh Chapman, managing partner at "thesis driven investment firm" Konvoy Ventures (thanks <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-will-clear-7-6-billion-in-first-60-days-investment-firm-predicts/1100-6533204/">GameSpot</a>). Chapman shared his predictions <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joshchapmanb_gta-vi-we-predict-that-gta-vi-will-generate-activity-7350762544032010240-p4Eo/">over on LinkedIn</a>, suggesting GTA 6 will be the "largest gaming release of all time, shattering records of copies sold and revenue generated within almost every period of time".
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Chapman believes Grand Theft Auto 6 will generate $7.6bn USD in revenue in the first 60 days of its launch, and that it'll recoup its development costs in under a month. It's worth noting, however, all this is based on certain unconfirmed assumptions. Chapman's maths assumes the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">base version of GTA 6 will cost $80</a> (neither Rockstar nor publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> have announced a price yet, but there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">certainly</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">precedent</a>), and his predictions are also based on a speculative development budget of $2bn - a figure that's long been rumoured, but never actually confirmed.

<p>
Things then veer away from the financial to the perhaps a little fanciful, with Chapman calling GTA 6 the 'next user-generated platform'. More specifically, he predicts it'll "have a UGC component that includes creator payouts for server hosts, mod creators, and more (mimicking the creator economics of [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>] and Roblox)", alongside "200-person lobbies [with] higher risk/reward dynamics where you can raid and steal items from players more easily."
</p>
<p>
None of that's particularly far-fetched, of course, but neither is it supported by any real evidence, but given Chapman notes, "In the end, we're just gamers who can't wait to see this title released", there's maybe a bit of room for some enthusiastic wishful thinking.
</p>
<p>
GTA 6 is currently expected to launch for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th May next year, following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">not exactly unexpected delay in May</a>. And there's little doubt it's going to be big; as Take-Two confirmed earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-has-now-sold-a-staggering-210m-copies">GTA 5 has now sold an astonishing 210m copies</a> since its release 12 years ago, so it's probably not unreasonable to assume its massively anticipated sequel will manage to do that and then some.

            <p>Netflix's Assassin's Creed adaptation - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-announces-assassins-creed-live-action-series">which was first announced in 2020</a> - is finally moving forward.</p>
<p>The long-in-the-works adaptation based on Ubisoft's games is being helmed by Roberto Patino (DMZ, Westworld, Sons of Anarchy) and David Wiener (Halo, Homecoming, The Killing), who will serve as creators, showrunners, and executive producers on the show.</p>

<p>"We've been fans of Assassin's Creed since its release in 2007," Wiener and Patino told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-1236463572/">Variety</a>. "Every day we work on this show, we come away excited and humbled by the possibilities that Assassin's Creed opens to us. Beneath the scope, the spectacle, the parkour and the thrills is a baseline for the most essential kind of human story - about people searching for purpose, struggling with questions of identity and destiny and faith."</p>
<p>Continuing, the duo said Assassin's Creed is "about power and violence and sex and greed and vengeance", but above all that "this is a show about the value of human connection, across cultures, across time" and "what we stand to lose as a species, when those connections break".</p>
<p>Said Wiener and Patino: "We've got an amazing team behind us with the folks at Ubisoft and our champions at Netflix, and we're committed to creating something undeniable for fans all over the planet."</p>
<p>According to the official blurb for Netflix's take on Assassin's Creed, the series will be "centered on the secret war between two shadowy factions - one set on determining mankind's future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will. The series follows its characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny". That all sounds suitably Assassin's Creed-y.</p>
<p>In addition to Wiener and Patino, Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin and Austin Dill of Ubisoft Film and Television will serve as executive producers for the Assassin's Creed series along with Matt O'Toole.</p>
<p>"We are so excited to work alongside Roberto, David, and our Netflix partners to bring this beloved franchise to series," said Boykin. "We look forward to delivering an experience that speaks to the heart of what fans love about Assassin's Creed, while introducing its unforgettable worlds and timeless themes to new audiences worldwide."</p>

<p>Once upon a time, Die Hard writer Jeb Stuart was attached to Netflix's Assassin's Creed project. However, in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-assassins-creed-adaptation-loses-die-hard-writer-jeb-stuart">Stuart stepped away from the series due to differing visions between himself and the show's executives</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-anime-announced-by-netflix-castlevania-creator">Assassin's Creed anime was announced by Netflix in 2017</a> from Adi Shankar, creator of the popular Castlevania animated series. However, the project ultimately failed to materialise.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-its-finally-go-time-for-netflixs-live-action-assassins-creed-series]]></content:encoded>
