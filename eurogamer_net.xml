            <p>
BioWare appears to have bid farewell to any further updates for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, following the launch this week of the game's Patch 5.
</p>
<p>
Patch <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-5-release-notes">notes</a> for the update thank fans for playing Dragon Age: The Veilguard over the past few months while some small additional quality of life features have been implemented. 
</p>
<p>
BioWare goes on to state that it is now happy the game is in a "stable place" and will move to monitoring for any reports of game-breaking bugs, should these occur.
</p>
<p>
The patch notes finish with "Dareth shiral!" - meaning '<em>farewell</em>', or '<em>safe journey</em>' in the game's Elvish language. It really sounds like this is it.

<p>
Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-ea-sports-fc-25-and-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-as-it-lowers-financial-forecast">EA said Dragon Age: The Veilguard had missed the publisher's own internal targets</a>, after it "engaged" 1.5 million players between October 2024 and the end of the year, "down nearly 50 percent from the company's expectations".
</p>
<p>Last week, Eurogamer published the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-game-director-leaving-bioware">first statement from Dragon Age: The Veilguard game director Corinne Busche</a>, discussing her exit from the studio.</p>
<p>
While large updates to Dragon Age: The Veilguard were not expected and BioWare had already ruled out the prospect of DLC, fans have still reacted in surprise at the sudden end to any further small additions.
</p>
<p>
There had been some hope of a New Game Plus mode being added, for example, as well as further cosmetic options for character clothing designs.
</p>
<p>
Instead, Patch 5 contains a number of small bug fixes, and one final quality of life change: "Recommended levels have been added to side quests that players may receive at significantly lower levels."
</p>
<p>
Dareth shiral, Dragon Age: The Veilguard. On the upside, here's hoping this helps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-isnt-ready-to-suddenly-have-a-team-of-250-300-people-working-on-it-now-dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-done">BioWare get work spun up more quickly on Mass Effect 5</a>.

            <p>Back in 2023, the Video Game History Foundation announced it was curating a digital library, which would allow users to access its vast collection of magazines, art books and more from the comfort of their homes. And while it didn't pop a date on when it would be available to the public at that time, it now has.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gamehistoryorg.bsky.social/post/3lggnduk3p227">Writing on social media</a>, the Video Game History Foundation revealed its digital library will be launching next week, on 30th January.</p>
<p>"Good things come to those who wait," the team wrote, promising it would share further details on what to expect closer to the time.</p>

<p>When the digital library was first announced a year and a bit ago, library director Phil Salvador said one of the questions the team at the Video Game History Foundation was asked was how people "can access our collections of rare video game history research materials", but without having to make a trip in person.</p>
<p>This digital library - which in 2023 had already been in the works for two years - was the solution. You can check out a little video about the library above.</p>
<p>The Video Game History Foundation was initially set up back in 2017, by game preservationist and historian Frank Cifaldi. Writing on BlueSky, Cifaldi shared a more recent teaser for the team's "work-in-progress" digital library, adding it will be "such a great resource" for users.</p>
<p>"I just asked it to show me every video game magazine in our collection in chronological order that says Metroidvania," Cifaldi posted.</p>

<p>"From the humble beginnings of Insomniac Games as an independent studio to its rise as a powerhouse PlayStation studio, Ted has left an indelible mark on our industry," AIAS president Meggan Scavio said.</p>
<p>"His legacy encompasses a portfolio of beloved and critically acclaimed games, a studio that holds him in the highest regard, and a profound impact on the Academy itself."</p>
