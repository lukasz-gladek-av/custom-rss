            <p>SAG-AFTRA - the union that represents 160,000 American media professionals, including voiceover artists - has launched two new agreements: the Student Interactive Waiver Agreement and the Game Jam Waiver Agreement.</p>
<p>The union said the new agreements "provide video game developers at every stage of their careers the opportunity to work with union performers, even as the video game strike continues".</p>

<p>The Student Interactive Waiver Agreement has been designed for students currently taking video game courses at accredited educational institutions and "provides an opportunity for students to work with SAG-AFTRA performers to satisfy course requirements during game development" providing the project is recorded entirely in the US and is owned by the student.</p>
<p>The Game Jam Waiver Agreement, on the other hand, is designed for developers contributing to game jams. Under this agreement, participants can work with SAG-AFTRA performers and session fees and secondary payments are deferred "provided that the project does not generate revenue" and material is not recorded prior to the commencement of the event.</p>
<p>In the event that a project does generate revenue, SAG-AFTRA will work with participants to "sign the project to the appropriate agreement".</p>
<p>"With these new agreements, SAG-AFTRA can help support game developers at all levels who want to work with union talent and who want to learn more about producing video games under a union contract. Plus, our members are passionate about this industry and they want to be able to participate in these types of projects where the future of video games is being shaped," said SAG-AFTRA national executive director and chief negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal">actors' union stated the strike would continue due to "alarming loopholes" allowing for "AI abuse"</a>. Negotiators on behalf of the bargaining video game companies, meanwhile, stated "meaningful progress" had been made, but voice actors on games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/genshin-impact-actor-recast-due-to-ongoing-sag-aftra-strike-over-ai-others-come-out-in-support">Genshin Impact</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-zenless-zone-zero-actors-lose-jobs-over-ai-dispute-without-notice-finding-out-alongside-players">Zenless Zone Zero</a> have been replaced due to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA actors' union strike.</p>

            <p>Blizzard is reportedly considering dropping the "2" from its squad-based first-person shooter sequel, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>.</p>
<p>A leak purporting to share details of the shooter's 16th season not only gives us an early peek at what's coming in the new season - as well as a Gundam collaboration - but also claims Overwatch 2 skins will be renamed "Valorous", and Overwatch 1 skins as "Classic", leading some players to believe Blizzard may be about to retire the sequel's name.</p>

<p>Twitter user SkaVorah, who shared the leaked images, said: "Skin names changed. Overwatch 1 -&gt; Classic. Overwatch 2 -&gt; Valorous.</p>
<p>"Say goodbye to 'Overwatch 2', I guess. Looks like they are dropping the '2'. This suggests that the overwatch 2 name may be retired."</p>
<p>The leak is accompanied by a handful of images that purportedly depict Overwatch 2's S16 main screen, Juno Mythic, new Mythic aspects, and reveal an upcoming collab with Gundam.</p>
<p>As with most leaks, for now, all we can do is chalk this up to a rumour until Activision Blizzard confirms one way or the other. Either way, though, it's once again got players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jmbcuq/comment/mkc5qpl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">talking</a> about whether or not live-service games like Overwatch or Destiny should simply keep evolving rather than develop stand-alone "sequels".</p>
<p>We've reached out to Activision for comment and will update as/when we hear back.</p>
<p>Last month we learned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2-is-bringing-loot-boxes-back-two-years-after-they-were-removed-from-the-series">Blizzard is reimplementing loot boxes into Overwatch 2</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-loot-boxes-will-be-withdrawn-from-sale-at-the-end-of-the-month">a little over two years after the team removed them from Overwatch</a>.</p>
<p>Blizzard detailed its plans for what the studio calls "one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>'s most significant years so far", including a brief look at Overwatch 2 season 15, which is set to debut later this month, on 18th February. It is this season that will see those aforementioned loot boxes make their return to the hero shooter.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
