            <p>The head of Riot Games' anti-cheat team Phillip Koskinas has confirmed why you can't have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/valorant">Valorant</a> running at the same time. Yes, it involves a clash between EA's Javalin anti-cheat and Riot's Vanguard anti-cheat.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/deteccphilippe/status/1954976139530866904">Posting on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Koskinas wrote: "Vanguard is compatible with Javelin, and you don't need to uninstall one anti-cheat to use the other. However, BF6 does not currently allow the Valorant client to be running simultaneously, because both drivers race to protect regions of game memory with the same technique."</p> <div>

<p>In layman's terms, both Valorant and Battlefield 6 need to run in a particular way while they are running on your computer. When it comes to interacting with game memory, they do the same thing. Detecting another program is messing around at the kernel level and touching things they are monitoring, the anti-cheats identify each other as potential problems and thus issues arise.</p>

<p>The conversation around Javalin and Vanguard causing problems together stems from several posts during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-almost-250000-people-waiting-in-an-open-beta-queue">last weekend's Battlefield 6 open beta</a>, in which some users were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mlwcbl/battlefield_6_just_told_me_to_uninstall_valorant/">reporting error messages</a> stopping them from playing the absurdly popular shooter while Valorant was running. So while you don't need to uninstall Valorant to play Battlefield 6 this weekend for its second open beta, you should probably make sure the game is totally closed before you do so.</p>
<p>Still it's easy to see why deep-access kernel level anti-cheats are used in games like Battlefield 6. According to EA, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-anti-cheat-system-has-already-prevented-330000-attempts-to-cheat-or-tamper-with-anti-cheat-controls">Javelin caught over 330,000 attempted cheaters over its first weekend</a>. All this during what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-battlefields-biggest-open-beta-ever-says-ea">EA has dubbed Battlefield's biggest open beta ever</a>.</p>
<p>So for now it seems like an easy fix for those looking to get some Battlefield 6 games in. It does seem unlikely the way either Javelin or Vanguard work will be changing, due to the low number of players looking to run two shooters simultaneously. Still, as kernel-level anti-cheats become the norm these conflicts between opposing systems is something to keep an eye on.</p></div>

            <p>Remedy is "unsatisfied" with the sales of its live-service shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>, as the game underperformed on Steam.</p>
<p>As part of the company's half year financial <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5">report</a>, CEO Tero Virtala stated Remedy's revenue increased by 63.5 percent, with game sales increasing due to the release of FBC: Firebreak.</p>
<p>The launch succeeded technically and had over a million players in its first 10 days. However, the majority of players were on Xbox Series X/S and PS5, where the game was available day one on subscription services. On Steam - intended as the primary sales channel on PC - the launch "underperformed".</p>

<p>"The game's initial onboarding experience and mission structure resulted in high early player drop-offs and an influx of negative reviews," admitted Virtala. "As players spent more time in the game and we released updates improving the game, sentiment in reviews turned more positive."</p>
<p>Virtala continued: "Commercially, we were unsatisfied with the launch-phase consumer sales of FBC: Firebreak. Thus far, FBC: Firebreak's commercial performance has largely been driven by the Xbox and PlayStation subscription service agreements. A considerable portion of the revenues from these agreements will still be recognised throughout the contract period."</p>
<p>The performance of FBC: Firebreak is important to Remedy as its first self-published game, a spin-off of its popular single-player game Control.</p>
<p>Shortly after the game's release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreak-hears-your-criticism-loudly-and-clearly-and-is-fixing-things-starting-now">Remedy stated it heard fan feedback "loud and clearly"</a> and was committed to improving the game. A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreak-team-acknowledges-onboarding-frustrations-assuring-things-will-change">Remedy acknowledged onboarding frustrations </a>and noted patches released for a better experience.</p>
<p>"FBC: Firebreak was designed as a game that evolves over time," said Virtala in the report. "Despite the rocky launch, we believe we have a solid game to build on. Players who spent over an hour with the game reviewed the game mostly positive - showing us that the core experience of the game is entertaining."</p>
<p>A major update is planned for September, which Remedy expects will drive further interest in the game. "We are committed to continuing to work on FBC: Firebreak, engaging with the community, and expanding the game," said Virtala.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the report, Remedy confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/control-2">Control 2</a> development is "on track towards meeting its next milestones", focusing now on gameplay, environments, and missions.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> 1 &amp; 2 remake project is also in full production.</p>
<p>Lifetime sales of Control have now surpassed 5m copies. Earlier this year, the publishing, distribution and marketing rights for the game transferred to Remedy, resulting in positive sales.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>, meanwhile, has "continued to sell steadily and accrue royalties", though no sales figure has been provided. The horror game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-fastest-selling-remedy-game-but-yet-to-turn-a-profit">Remedy's fastest-selling game</a>, but only became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-is-finally-profitable-over-a-year-after-release-says-remedy">profitable a year after release once sales passed 2m</a>.</p>
<p>"A bold approach to the concept of work marks this game out as a singular enterprise," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreak-review">FBC: Firebreak review</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/remedy-unsatisfied-with-fbc-firebreak-sales-as-subscription-console-players-exceed-those-on-pc]]></content:encoded>
