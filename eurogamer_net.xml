<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' first "special collaboration" will be a crossover with survival horror game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a>, set to arrive on 27th May. 
</p>
<p>
"Step into The Fog," reads a post on social media by the Assassin's Creed account this afternoon. "A new Dead by Daylight quest begins. Slip through the shadows. Survive the ordeal."
</p>
<p>
An accompanying teaser video shows Naoe and Yasuke resting by a campfire, while a figure with glowing red flames around their arms and feet faces them. Exact details on what the crossover will contain are presumably set to arrive at a later date.
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-post-launch-roadmap-features-regular-new-story-missions-parkour-updates-new-game-plus">Assassin's Creed publisher Ubisoft revealed that Shadows would get multiple "special collaboration" updates as part of its free post-launch content roadmap</a>. 
</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>
Today's announcement appears to put a date on Shadows' next big update, in which this first collaboration is included. Other additions expected on 27th May include improvements to the game's photo mode and additional flashy parkour moves.
</p>
<p>
This update will then be followed by at least one further update in June, where a second free story mission will be added. This will feature a new ally that can come hang out at your homebase. June's update is also set to feature new difficulty options, and the ability to wear headgear in cutscenes (a highly requested feature by fans).
</p>
<p>
Beyond June, Ubisoft has said it has plans to add a New Game Plus Mode, additional story missions, and more "special collaborations". 
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time Assassin's Creed has provided optional post-launch content crossing over with other games, of course. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-assassins-creed-origins-will-get-a-chocobo-horse">Final Fantasy's Chocobo turned up in Assassin's Creed Origins</a>, while multiple Assassin's Creed heroes have themselves crossed over into the world of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"Majestic in scope, impressive in detail, Assassin's Creed Shadows honours the beauty of feudal Japan," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Eurogamer's Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>, "even if its strongest moments are saved for the personal stories of its two protagonists."

            <p>
A little over a year after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-stalker-trilogy-makes-its-way-to-xbox">its arrival on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S</a>, the original Stalker trilogy is getting an Enhanced Edition, bringing upgraded visuals and more to the post-apocalyptic shooter series on current-gen consoles and PC.
</p>
<p>
Officially titled Stalker: Legends of the Zone Trilogy Enhanced Edition, developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a>'s newly announced current-gen update promises a range of additions and optimisations to all three bundled titles - 2007's Shadow of Chornobyl, 2008's Clear Sky, and 2009's Call of Prypiat - alongside a number of platform-specific features.
</p>
<p>
All platforms get visual upgrades, for instance, including enhanced lighting (GSC specifically mentions godrays, screen space reflections, and global illumination), advanced shaders for water and wetness effects, upgraded skyboxes, upscaled textures, and improved 3D models for NPCs, weapons, and environments. That's in addition to improved weapon field-of-vision, and 4K pre-rendered cinematics for a bit of extra storytelling pizzazz.

Consoles also get keyboard and mouse support, Mod.io integration, and a variety of graphics modes, with Xbox Series X, PS5, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> all offering Quality, Balanced, Performance, and Ultra Performance options. Quality mode renders at a native 4K/30fps, Balanced at an upscaled 4K/40fps, Performance at an upscaled 4K/60fps, and Ultra Performance at an upscaled 2K/120fps. As for Xbox Series S, graphics modes are listed as Quality (native 2K/30fps), Balanced (upscaled 2K/40fps), and Performance (1080p/60fps).
</p>
<p>
Over on PC, GSC Game World is introducing cloud saves, full controller compatibility support, Steam Workshop integration, and Steam Deck optimisation. Full system requirements are <a href="https://www.stalker-game.com/en/faq">detailed over on the Enhanced Edition FAQ</a>.
</p>
<p>
And here comes the best news; owners of Stalker: Legends of the Zone Trilogy or any of the individual current-gen releases of Shadow of Chornobyl, Clear Sky, and Call of Prypiat on Xbox Series X/S or PS5 will receive the Enhanced Edition versions for free starting 20th May. Similarly, anyone who's purchased the original games on PC will get free Enhanced Editions upgrades, and will continue to have access to the originals too.
</p>
<p>
As for series newcomers, Stalker: Legends of the Zone Trilogy Enhanced Edition will cost $39.99 USD (or your local equivalent) when comes to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC on 20th May, with individual titles priced at $19.99 each.
