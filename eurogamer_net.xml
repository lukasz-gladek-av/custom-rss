Nintendo does not have the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> stock to meet customer demand in Japan, it has admitted, in a stark warning from the company's president.
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media this morning, <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1914982671522083155">Nintendo boss Shuntaro Furukawa revealed</a> an astonishing 2.2 million people had applied to buy a Switch via the My Nintendo Store as part of a lottery process.
</p>
<p>
Furukawa admitted this was a number that "far exceeds expectations" and "far exceeds the number of Nintendo Switch 2 consoles that can be delivered" at launch.

</figure>
<p>In Japan, Nintendo has offered a cheaper, region-locked version of Switch 2 that will only play Japanese games and only be compatible with Japanese Nintendo accounts. The thinking here is that this version can be offered to Nintendo's key home market, which is currently impacted by a weak Yen, while also ensuring it cannot be bought up and resold online to those elsewhere. 
</p>
<p>But creating a Japan-only version of Switch 2 may also present its own problems - such as creating an additional line of stock that has to be manufactured separately, and cannot be topped up by additional units made for elsewhere.</p>
<p>
Nintendo is now telling its Japanese fans that "a significant number of customers" will be unable to get Switch 2 at launch. Anyone who has applied to buy the console so far will be automatically entered into a second lottery - but this too will result in an undisclosed number of applications being unsuccessful.
</p>
<p>
"We deeply apologise for not being able to meet your expectations despite our prior preparations," Furukawa wrote.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo says it is "further strengthening" its Switch 2 production as a result, and that pre-orders via other Japanese retailers will open tomorrow, should fans want to try their luck there.
</p>
<p>
"With the cooperation of retailers, we will continue to ship the console and make efforts to get as many Nintendo Switch 2 consoles as possible into your hands," Furukawa added.
</p>
<p>
"We plan to continue producing and shipping a considerable number of Nintendo Switch 2 units in the future. We apologise for the delay in our ability to meet your expectations, and we appreciate your understanding."
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media, <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1914985844189933700">Dr Serkan Toto</a>, CEO of Japanese game industry consultancy firm Kantan Games, described the amount of interest in Switch 2 as "ridiculous", but also noted Nintendo had "originally promised enough supply for launch - which of course immediately sounded like a fairy tale for anybody with a basic understanding of the game market".
</p>
<p>
Overseas, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">Switch 2's launch has already proven bumpy in North America</a> - where Nintendo has had to factor in the current US trade war with China into its launch pricing. In the US, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-raising-cost-of-switch-2-accessories-in-us-due-to-tariffs-but-console-price-to-remain-same-1">Switch 2 will still arrive on 5th June alongside the rest of the world, though prices for its accessories have now been raised</a>.

            <p>It may have now released its own remaster of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, but that doesn't mean Bethesda is planning on shutting down work on the fan-made Skyblivion mod.</p>
<p>Let's be honest, we all knew a spruced up version of Oblivion was on the cards. Along with those <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">screenshots on developer Virtuos' website</a>, references to the project were also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-references-now-found-on-bethesdas-website">spotted on Bethesda's own website</a> before Bethesda had made any official announcement. Then last night, it finally got around to telling us what we all knew already: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered is real</a>, and available to play now.</p>

<p>However, while this was an exciting bit of news for many, there is one particular group this announcement was perhaps less than welcome for, at least in terms of timing. That would be TESRenewal, the team working Skyblivion, a volunteer-based project seeking to remake Oblivion in the Skyrim engine.</p>
<p>When word of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remaster started gaining more traction last week, project lead Rebelzize said Bethesda's then-impending announcement "changes nothing" as far as the Skyblivion team were concerned. Rebelzize, on the outside at least, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skyblivion-fan-project-lead-reacts-to-oblivion-remake-news-with-all-love-and-no-hate">remained positive about the project and the upcoming remaster being able to both thrive</a>, stating it was a "win-win" for fans of Oblivion.</p>
<p>Now, the TESRenewal team has gone one step further and assured its Skyblivion community Bethesda has "no intention of shutting down our project". It additionally thanked the studio for the Oblivion Remastered game keys Bethesda gifted the entire modding team.</p>
<p>"This means so much to us. Thank you for everything," the <a href="https://x.com/TESRSkyblivion/status/1914754195674333459">TESRenewal team shared on social media</a>.</p>

<p>While this is good news for the Skyblivion team and all those looking forward to the project's release (which is slated for some time this year), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-say-no-official-mod-support-for-its-oblivion-remaster">Bethesda itself has said it has no plans for Oblivion Remastered official mod support</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile since its release last night, The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered has pulled in some impressive player numbers for Bethesda and co-developer Virtuos. Over on Steam, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-off-to-a-good-start-on-steam">Oblivion Remastered has an 182,298 concurrent player peak so far</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Who would have suspected Bethesda to shadow drop Oblivion yesterday! Well, quite a lot of us, in fact. 
</p>
<p>
But regardless of whether fans had already prepped themselves for The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered or not, they turned up in huge numbers.
</p>
<p>
Over on Steam, which <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2623190/charts/">publicly reveals its player data</a>, Oblivion Remastered has an 182,298 concurrent player peak so far - placing it ahead of anything else on Steam except stalwarts <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, PUBG and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>.

<p>
Oblivion Remastered is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the best-selling game on Steam right now, and has launched with a Very Positive user review rating from those who have played.
</p>
<p>
Of course, Steam's numbers only count for a fraction of those who have jumped in so far. Oblivion Remastered is also available via the Microsoft Store on PC, and via the PC Game Pass subscription, as well as on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including via Game Pass Ultimate.
</p>
<p>
We'll be keeping an eye out for combined player numbers from Bethesda when they're available.
</p>
<p>
As announced - and launched - yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">the Oblivion Remaster is really more of a ground-up remake</a> using Unreal Engine 5 from talented co-developer Virtuos. 
</p>
<p>
The new version of Bethesda's classic role-player includes the game's previous expansion content and boasts various gameplay tweaks such as a refreshed levelling system inspired by Skyrim, additional dialogue, modern controls including sprinting. It now also runs at 4K 60fps.
</p>
<p>
Last night, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-say-no-official-mod-support-for-its-oblivion-remaster">Bethesda said it had no plans for Oblivion Remastered official mod support</a>, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-already-almost-100-mods-for-oblivion-remake-even-without-official-support-from-bethesda">plenty of unofficial mods have popped up now anyway</a>. Bethesda also made the welcome gesture of gifting access to the Oblivion Remaster to the team of fans currently remaking Oblivion in the Skyrim engine, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-has-no-intention-to-shut-down-fan-made-skyblivion-mod">which it has indicated it approves of</a>.

<p>Earlier this week, the second episode of The Last of Us' second season aired. While much of the episode's run time was made up of the infected's attack on Jackson, there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-internet-reacts-to-the-last-of-us-season-twos-latest-episode">one particular moment that left fans of the series in shock</a>: Joel's death.</p>
<p>As in the video game it is based on, in HBO's adaptation Joel - played by Pedro Pascal - is killed by new character Abby with a golf club, following a harrowing and bloody beating. While Abby's reasons for killing Joel are not explained until much later in the game's narrative, resulting in a surprising twist for players, HBO's showrunners decided to change this, laying out Abby's intentions from the beginning.</p>
<p>The second series begins with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-one-makes-a-big-change-to-the-chronology-of-abbys-revelation-and-im-not-sure-about-it">Kaitlyn Dever's Abby mourning the loss of her fellow Fireflies following Joel's rampage at the end of season one</a>, vowing to kill him for what he has done. Now, Bailey has spoken about the changes in the script, stating she believes them to be a wise choice by the showrunners.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Screenshot-2025-02-14-at-12.41.40.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When it first leaked that Abby kills Joel in The Last of Us Part 2, Bailey received online abuse and death threats aimed at herself and her son. "Every time I went online, that's all I saw. Death threats and threats of violence," she said in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2s-abby-actor-reveals-online-abuse-didnt-just-threaten-her-life-but-her-baby-son-too">behind-the-scenes documentary, Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2</a>, which was released in February last year.</p>
<p>Now speaking with <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/the-last-of-us-abby-voice-actress-interview-backlash.html">Vulture</a>, Bailey says she feels it was a good decision by the showrunners to brace viewers for Joel's fate ahead of the event itself. "I think that's why HBO is doing what they're doing," she said. "You're prepared for it."</p>
<p>Bailey called her own experiences with the online abuse "a very rough period of time" for her. "I knew it was going to be intense. I knew it was going to be controversial," the Abby actress said.</p>
<p>"But I was still so excited to share it with the world, because I poured so much into that performance, and I was really proud of it. So to get <em>that </em>reaction right away was really tough. I don't think anybody predicted what the fallout would be from it. I was not prepared. But I don't think anybody on the team was."</p>
<p>Bailey admitted there is still a part of her that is anxious Joel's TV death will stir things up again, and while things have "definitely calmed down" in the five years since The Last of Us Part 2's first release, "there's definitely still a contingent of people that have not calmed down" from the events of the game.</p>
<p>"You know, anytime anything gets posted about [The Last of Us Part 2], or anytime I post anything random, there's going to be at least one comment from somebody," Bailey revealed.</p>
<p>"And I honestly don't know: Is it just the same hundred people that keep commenting? And they just won't let go? It's one of the reasons I don't really post on social media anymore. I don't want to say I was scared away from it, because I don't think that's what it was. It just kind of made me more guarded, you know?"</p>
