<p>I am personally quite curious about The Exit 8, and given my new year's resolution (at least in terms of video games) is to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/our-new-year-2026-gaming-resolutions-i-want-to-see-how-close-i-can-get-to-100-percenting-the-game-in-24-hours">make sure I get my money's worth from my various subscriptions</a>, I am going to give this one a bash. If you haven't heard of it before, it's a walking simulator inspired by Japanese underground passageways. Now, I admit that doesn't sound great at first, but here's the thing: you are trapped in this seemingly endless passageway, and have to pay careful attention to your surroundings in order to find your way out.</p><p>Another one I am tempted to try is A Little to the Left, which I missed when it originally released back in 2022. It's a cosy puzzle game which sees you organise household items. While I gather it doesn't leave quite the same impression as Unpacking, I am more than happy to play something cosy while it is still ruddy freezing outside.</p>
