With a positive critical response to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> now safely tucked under its belt, BioWare's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a> project director Michael Gamble has reflected on some of the differences between the studio's two upcoming projects.
</p>
<p>
Unlike Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which hits shops later this week, Mass Effect 5 will not seek to tweak the sci-fi franchise's established visual style, he said.
</p>
<p>
"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> is photorealistic and will be as long as I'm running it," Gamble wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1850999886763983193">post</a> on X. 
</p>
<p>
"Both are from the studio, but Mass Effect is Mass Effect. How you bring a sci-fi RPG to life is different than other genres or IPs," he continued, "and has to have different kinds of love."

<p>
Eurogamer's Bertie Purchese praised The Veilguard's divisive new graphical style in our review of the game, noting how BioWare seemed to be "aiming for something closer to an animated film in appearance". 
</p>
<p>
"It really works," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>, noting how in particular it enhances facial gestures and helps draw out "the inherent fantasy and emotion in scenes and environments".
</p>
<p>
As for Mass Effect 5's tone, Gamble wrote it would "maintain the mature tone of the original Trilogy. This is all I'm going to say for now."
</p>
<p>
The obvious point of comparison here is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-andromeda">Mass Effect Andromeda</a>, the franchise's fourth main entry that was primarily developed by BioWare's now-shuttered Montreal team. This entry took a chattier, more youthful and adventurous tone than the sci-fi series' first three games - perhaps to be expected, considering the increasingly dire stakes and wartorn backdrop there. Still, the change was not well received.
</p><p>
But word that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-teases-mass-effect-5-title-plus-answers-to-trilogy-ending-questions">Mass Effect 5, or whatever it ends up being called</a>, will feel closer to the original trilogy of games is not a surprise. We know from years of teases that BioWare's return to the franchise will pick up the story of the original trilogy's Milky Way galaxy many centuries later, and see <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-development-proceeding-very-well-as-bioware-issues-fresh-tease">the return of at least one familiar face</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for when Mass Effect 5 might arrive, BioWare has not yet said. Perhaps we might hear more on 7th November, the series' annual N7 Day fan celebration, when BioWare typically drops new information.

            <p>Two N64  games have now been added to the Mature app of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/turok-2-seeds-of-evil">Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</a> and Shadow Man are both available right now for subscribers with the Expansion Pack.</p>
<p>Both games were known for their blood and gore - unusual on Nintendo's system - hence their inclusion in the Mature app, alongside shooters Perfect Dark and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/turok-dinosaur-hunter">Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</a>.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the Mature app is a separate download away from the main N64 app.</p>
<p>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil was, of course, the follow-up to the first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/turok">Turok</a> game, in which players shoot dinosaurs with a variety of outlandishly gruesome weapons.</p>
<p>Shadow Man, meanwhile, was based on the comic book series of the same name, following a voodoo warrior with the ability to visit the land of the dead.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> has had its early access release date pushed back until December.</p>
<p>Grinding Gear Games' take on Diablo was expected to release this November. However, due to some "server-side infrastructure work" that still needs sorting out, Path of Exile 2 will now be released in December.</p>
<p>"I'm really sorry about this one. People plan time off and things like that around our launches, but we just have to do it," Path of Exile 2 game director Jonathan Rogers said in a video announcing the delay.</p>

<p>Path of Exile 2 itself is in good shape, the director stated, though to ensure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mercenary-class-unveiled-for-path-of-exile-2-and-it-plays-like-shooter">microtransactions work seamlessly across both Path of Exile and the sequel</a>, a little more time is needed.</p>
<p>"We have to integrate the account systems for not only <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile">Path of Exile</a> 1 and 2, but also for the console realms as well," Rogers explained. "This meant changing a lot of things. Not only do we have to create a bunch of new systems, we have to make sure that all the old data is backwards compatible with them as well."</p><p>The Path of Exile 2 team wants to ensure everything is "perfect" on the game's early access launch, Rogers continued, so "nobody loses anything they paid for and nobody has their account broken". This means "a lot of load testing to make sure the whole thing doesn't fall over" on Path of Exile 2's debut, he added, as Grinding Gear is expecting a "huge number" of players.</p>
<p>Rogers admitted things had been left too late to get everything up to snuff for Path of Exile 2's November release date. "I'm really sorry," he apologised again, "this one really hurts".</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 will now be released in early access on 6th December. Ahead of this, the developer plans to host a live stream in roughly four weeks time, with an exact date still to be confirmed. Rogers promised the team will share more on what kind of content players can expect on Path of Exile 2's launch during this stream.</p>
<p>"Until then, thank you very much for your support," Rogers concluded.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/niantic">Niantic</a> has announced changes to its big new Gigantamax battles feature, in response to this weekend's initial launch.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-launches-gigantamax-raids-to-mixed-response-as-developer-bans-countless-players-by-accident">Fan feedback to Gigantamax has been decidedly mixed</a>, as Eurogamer reported yesterday, with concerns over the difficulty level of being able to beat the skyscraper-high monsters, and the ease of then actually catching one afterwards.
</p>
<p>
Niantic has responded swiftly, and in a statement to Eurogamer last night a company spokesperson detailed a number of changes for the game's next set of Gigantamax raids this weekend, against Gigantamax Gengar. 
</p>
<p>
Most notably, the difficulty of Gigantamax Gengar will be lowered "slightly", to make the battle easier when compared to other Gigantamax battles. 
</p>
<p>
"While we want Gigantamax to be the new high bar for a meaningful challenge in Pokémon Go, we want to make sure that players have a reasonable chance to defeat Gengar," a Niantic spokesperson told Eurogamer. "You'll still need to strategise and coordinate with your group and go in powered up to a degree, but we think this tuning will make things slightly easier to help a range of Trainers jump into Gigantamax."
</p><p>
Here, Niantic seems to agree with a common complaint I heard this past weekend - that the feature could have benefited from giving players more of a leg-up to get started. Once you have your first Gigantamax Pokémon (and after a battle or two to learn the ropes), the whole thing becomes easier. 
</p>
<p>
Other changes to Gigantamax Gengar include a bonus 25k Stardust reward for beating the boss, and an improved capture rate for snagging it afterwards.
</p>
<p>
"We want players to feel rewarded for accomplishing such a huge feat, and right now the catch rate didn't match the experience we wanted," a Niantic spokesperson said. "We'll be increasing this for Gengar and will continue to monitor other Gigantamax encounters."
</p>
<p>
There's no changes to the game's Max Particle limit, which effectively caps the amount of Gigantamax raids you can complete at two without purchasing more of the currency from Pokémon Go's shop. And there's certainly no suggestion you will be able to complete Gigantamax Gengar battles without still forming a large group of players.
</p><p>
Also, it's worth highlighting that these changes are specifically for Gigantamax Gengar this weekend, in a manner that suggests Niantic realises it needs to throw the game's community something of a bone to encourage participation in the feature once again. 
</p>
<p>
Could these changes stick? "Other Gmax encounters are unaffected for now," a Niantic spokesperson said, "but we MAY make changes to them in the future."
