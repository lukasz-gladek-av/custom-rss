            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> has surpassed 40,000 concurrent players on Steam, setting the series' highest peak on the platform for a single-player game.</p>
<p>The second part of the remake trilogy was released last week, 23rd January, and over the weekend it set a peak concurrent player count of 40,564 (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2909400/charts/">SteamDB</a>).</p>
<p>For comparison, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> (the first part) set a concurrent peak of 13,803, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> (released last year) reached 27,508.</p>

<p>The series' highest peak overall remains <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>, which boasted 95,150 concurrent players after its popular Endwalker expansion was released.</p>
<p>This peak for Rebirth is positive news, considering <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> previously admitted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">sales of the PS5 version "did not meet expectations"</a>, leading to the company's multiplatform strategy.</p>
<p>Previously, PC versions of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-pc-barebones-port">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-final-fantasy-16-is-highly-demanding-on-pc-and-these-are-the-best-settings">Final Fantasy 16</a> were somewhat criticised for their performance, though Rebirth has been praised by comparison. It's also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-verified-for-steam-deck-handheld">Steam Deck verified</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, a PC release allows for fan-made mods. Director Naoki Hamaguchi asked players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-asks-pc-players-to-avoid-offensive-or-inappropriate-mods">not to install "offensive or inappropriate" mods</a> in a previous interview.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/i-respect-mods-they-breathe-life-into-the-pc-market-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-director-naoki-hamaguchi-reveals-a-more-personal-perspective-on-mods/">Automaton</a>, he admitted to using mods himself as a PC player and acknowledged how they can "breathe life" into games.</p>
<p>Referring to the previous interview, he said: "I wasn't trying to tell people not to use mods. It was more about being mindful. Both creators and users alike should ensure mods don’t detract from the intended game experience."</p>
<p>"I respect the modding community," he continued. "Mods have played a significant role in the rise of the PC market. Look at series like Fallout or The Elder Scrolls – even years after release, new mods breathe life into these games, making players want to come back to them."</p>
<p>As for the final game in the trilogy, series producer Yoshinori Kitase confirmed the story - written by creative director Tetsuya Nomura - has been completed and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-story-completed-producer-very-satisfied-as-development-continues-without-delay">he's "very satisfied with it"</a>.</p>
<p>The PC version of Rebirth includes an option to speed up cutscenes, which the developers would like to add back to the PS5 version, within the limits of the console's capabilities.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Coca-Cola has partnered with Xbox to give away a selection of super bright controllers "representing the most popular flavours in the brand's portfolio", such as orange, lemon, exotic, fruit twist, grape, and lemon-elderflower.</p>
<p>As well as Fanta-inspired Xbox Series X console bundles and wireless controllers, there's also hundreds of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscriptions up for grabs, too, although you should probably note that they can only be redeemed by new members and not existing ones, I'm afraid.</p>

<p>Delving into the <a href="https://www.cocacolaep.com/news-and-stories/fanta-xbox-favourite-flavour/">small print</a>, it looks like there'll be 1600 Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subs available, 15 Xbox wireless controllers - two each week for the first six weeks, and one per week in the remaining three - and two Xbox Series X console bundles.</p><p>Players need to be 18 or over, able to scan the QR code, and willing to download the Coke App to see if they're a winner. You're welcome to try your luck up to 100 times between now and when the competition ends on 25th March, 2025 providing you live in one of the qualifying regions: Spain, Portugal, Great Britain, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, and Norway.

            <p>The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep - the Witcher anime heading to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> next month - will take place in the middle of the live-action show, specifically between episodes 5 and 6, and it includes a scene that was cut from Henry Cavill's first season.</p>
<p>As detailed in this month's <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/sfx/">SFX magazine</a> and shared by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/fantasy-shows/the-upcoming-the-witcher-anime-movie-features-a-new-version-of-a-scene-cut-from-the-henry-cavills-first-season/">GamesRadar+</a>, writer Mike Ostrowski and co-writer Rae Benjamin call it "a period of not being together [with Yennefer], or a period of trouble, but still on each other's minds".</p>

<p>The writers say they do not interfere with the live-action show's chronology or timeline, but the anime does include a "fun little scene" that was reportedly cut from the main Netflix series.</p>
<p>What, exactly, that scene entails? We're going to have to wait until the show debuts on 11th February, unfortunately - the writers wouldn't say more. But as we know Anya Chalotra reprises her role as Yennefer in the anime, the writers tease that we'll see more of Geralt and Yennefer's relationship in Sirens of the Deep.</p>
<p>"Geralt cannot let Yennefer go, even though he's trying his best," Ostrowski added. "She haunts him. Even if he wanted to be rid of her, he can't."</p>
<p>As Matt summarised for us recently, two and a half years after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-confirms-new-the-witcher-game-in-development">announcement</a>, CD Projekt finally gave it the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">big reveal treatment</a> late in 2024, confirming Ciri to be the focus this time around. And now Doug Cockle - voice of former series protagonist Geralt of Rivia both in the games and the anime - has had his say, calling the switch to a new main character, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ciri-as-witcher-4-protagonist-really-really-interesting-for-all-kinds-of-reasons-says-geralt-voice-actor">"really, really interesting move for all kinds of reasons"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>35 years after point and click horror game Last Half of Darkness first released it's coming back, remade from the ground up by the same solo dev who created it.</p>
<p>In honour of the 35th anniversary (well, technically 36th now) of the 1989 original, Bill Fisher has gone back to the start by remaking the first Last Half of Darkness with all-new graphics, a new soundtrack, "enhanced" story, and "even more" puzzles. You can check out the announcement teaser below:</p>

<p>"Your aunt sure was a strange one," the blurb teases. "She was some sort of witch or something. A good witch though, practicing only good spells and magic. In fact, she was working on a potion just before she was killed.</p>
<p>"Now the secret will go to the grave with her... unless you can find the missing ingredients."</p>
<p>"I made it on an XT PC 64k RAM system with a 10mb hard drive over a 9 month period, just working part-time on it," Fisher explained. "Was goofing around with some paint programs seeing if I could make some cool looking rooms and locations. It ended up turning out relatively good so I decided to actually package it. Hired an artist to do the package design and found a box manufacturer, etc. Got it in a couple retail stores locally, and sold a few at some conventions but wasn't really familiar or had the right contacts with the distribution side of things so it never was officially released commercially.</p>
<p>"However, right around that time, shareware was starting to really take off... and turned out to be very successful."</p>
<p>Last Half of Darkness is set to release on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3096000/Last_Half_of_Darkness/">Steam</a> on 7th February 2025, although if you missed the original first time around, worry not - <a href="http://lasthalfofdarkness.com/">that's still available</a>, too.</p>
