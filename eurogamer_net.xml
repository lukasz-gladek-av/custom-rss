            <p>
Eternal Strands, the fantasy action-RPG from former Dragon Age creative director Mike Laidlaw's Yellow Brick Games studio, has a release date - it's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, PC, and Game Pass on 28th January next year.
</p>
<p>
Eternal Strands follows the adventures of Brynn - a member of a dwindling group of magic users known as the Weavers - who sets out across a fantasy kingdom ravaged by a cataclysmic magical event to uncover its mysteries and recover her people's cultural home.
</p>
<p>
In gameplay terms, all this takes the form of an action-RPG inspired by the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, with a bit of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> thrown in. The latter two games can be seen in the bosses roaming Eternal Strands' "open zone" world - 25-meter-high climbable creatures known as the Arks - and the way defeating them provides resources used to create new weapons and armour back at a base camp.

<p>
As for the Zelda influences, they come in the interplay between Brynn's magical abilities and the environment. Powers are built around flame, ice, and telekinetic force, all of which can be further enhanced in conjunction with the shifting temperatures caused by the world's unstable climate. "Heat spreads, cold chills, and real-time destruction allows for unprecedented reactivity in combat," explains the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491410/Eternal_Strands/">blurb over on Steam</a>. "Create [ice] bridges, burn barriers, or launch Brynn across the world. The next-generation physics system encourages and rewards player creativity in exploration as much as combat." Oh, and every surface is climbable too.
</p><p>
When Eternal Strands arrives on 28th January next year, it'll be available for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. It's also confirmed to be a day one Game Pass release for Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers. Additionally, as per an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1491410/view/4467103536898901921?l=english">FAQ on Steam</a>, free post-launch content is planned, and a demo's also on the way. Yellow Brick Games says more details on the latter will be shared at a "later date".

            <p>
Descenders Next, the extreme-sports-focused sort-of-sequel to 2018's acclaimed downhill biking hit Descenders, has kicked off its online Test Sessions via Steam, giving players the chance to check out a "huge" build ahead of its eventual release.
</p>
<p>
Developer RageSquid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/acclaimed-biking-game-descenders-is-getting-an-extreme-sports-sort-of-sequel">unveiled Descenders Next back in August</a>, explaining its goal was to introduce the "same feel, the same sense speed" as its predecessor, but across as many extreme sports as possible over the coming years.
</p>
<p>
To begin with, though, Descenders Next is focusing on two distinct boarding sports: snowboarding and mountainboarding. There's talk of speed challenges, trick-focused challenges, scavenger hunts, kit upgrades, and more as players careen down procedural off-piste mountains and through "multiple huge biomes".

<p>
Descenders Next is due to release some time in 2025, but players can get stuck in right now courtesy of its previously teased Test Sessions. Details remain pretty vague - there's no word on how Test Sessions will be structured or how long they'll last - but a press release accompanying their launch does note players will have access to a "huge build with many hours of play, showcasing both the snowboarding and the mountainboarding, with full online multiplayer".
</p><p>
Test Sessions (a controller is recommended) are limited to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2375530/Descenders_Next/">Steam</a> at present, and players will first need to <a href="http://descendersnext.com/">follow the instructions over on RageSquid's website</a> to receive then activate their key. The studio says it'll "monitoring the Test Sessions very closely" and wants players to share their thoughts, feedback, and bug reports as they go.
