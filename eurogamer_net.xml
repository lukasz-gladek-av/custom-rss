            <p>The developer of Wuchang: Fallen Feathers has acknowledged issues with the game's performance and promised a patch is on the way.</p>
<p>The soulslike, from Chinese studio Leenzee and publisher 505 Games, released yesterday and has already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuchang-fallen-feathers-follows-in-black-myth-wukongs-footsteps-with-strong-steam-launch">racked up a significant concurrent player count on Steam</a> that exceeds other games in the genre. However, player reviews are Mostly Negative, citing issues with the game's performance owing to its use of Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>"We have received reports regarding issues such as the game's optimisation not meeting expectations, errors in distributing pre-order rewards, and some abnormal pricing," said the team in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/498327923676151994">statement on Steam</a>. "These problems should never have occurred, and we deeply regret the inconvenience and negative experience some players are currently facing."</p>

<p>It continued: "We are confident in the game's performance within our recommended spec but we're working on optimisation. We are looking to issue a patch as soon as we can."</p>
<p>The team has linked to an <a href="https://support.505games.com/support/solutions/150000215541">FAQ</a> to assist with any issues.

<p>Leenzee is also aware of pricing anomalies in some regions and is working with Steam to restore the correct pricing.</p>
<p>Lastly, the studio found a bug in the reward distribution preventing players from receiving the correct items after pre-ordering the standard and deluxe editions. This will also be fixed in the future patch. Those impacted will receive a free digital soundtrack as a token of goodwill, while deluxe edition purchasers will receive an additional exclusive bonus costume.</p>
<p>"We are fully committed to investigating and resolving these issues as quickly as possible," said the studio. "Our team is prioritising these problems at the highest level, striving to fix and handle everything promptly to ensure you have the best possible gaming experience.</p>

            <p>
Itch.io, the digital distribution platform known for its focus on independent game developers and other artists, has "deindexed" all NSFW content following discussions with payment processors contacted by the same Australian pressure group that recently targeted Steam.
</p>
<p>
Hints that something was afoot on the platform first surfaced on social media earlier today, as itch.io creators began reporting their NSFW games were no longer being displayed in search results. Alarm bells immediately began ringing given <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-introduces-vague-new-rules-banning-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-to-appease-credit-card-companies">recent similar events on Steam</a>, which saw Valve "retiring" unspecified NSFW titles and introducing vague new rules banning "certain kinds of adult content" from its store.
</p>
<p>
Itch.io's response, meanwhile, has been even more drastic. It's confirmed the deindexing, albeit temporarily, of "all" adult NSFW content from its browse and search pages. "We are truly sorry for the frustration and confusion caused by this change," platform founder Leaf Corcoran wrote in a <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content">statement shared on the website</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Recently, we came under scrutiny from our payment processors regarding the nature of some content hosted on itch.io," it continued. "Due to a game titled No Mercy, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-quietly-removes-explicit-game-featuring-extreme-sexual-violence-from-steam-in-uk">temporarily available on itch.io before being banned back in April</a>, the organisation Collective Shout launched a campaign against Steam and itch.io, directing concerns to our payment processors about the nature of certain content found on both platforms."
</p>
<p>
Collective Shout is an Australian pressure group claiming to be "against the objectification of women and the sexualisation of girls" and "for anyone against the pornification of culture". Its previous video game activities have included calling for a ban on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> and <a href="https://x.com/CollectiveShout/status/964663931439480834">promoting a 2018 petition</a> to pull Quantic Dream's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a>, arguing it depicted "child abuse and violence against women". More successful were its efforts to ban Tyler the Creator from touring the country in 2015.
</p>
<p>
In July, Collective Shout mounted a campaign against Steam and itch.io - presented as an "open letter to payment processors profiting from rape, incest, and child abuse games" - and later took credit for Steam's decision to pull certain adult games, calling it a "win". And its decision to pressure the likes of MasterCard, Visa, and PayPal has now had a similar impact on itch.io.
</p>
<p>
"Our ability to process payments is critical for every creator on our platform," itch.io continued. "To ensure that we can continue to operate and provide a marketplace for all developers, we must prioritise our relationship with our payment partners and take immediate steps towards compliance. This is a time critical moment for itch.io. The situation developed rapidly, and we had to act urgently to protect the platform's core payment infrastructure. Unfortunately, this meant it was not realistic to provide creators with advance notice before making this change. We know this is not ideal, and we apologise for the abruptness of this change."
</p>
<p>
Itch.io says all NSFW pages on the platform will remain deindexed while it conducts a "comprehensive audit of content to ensure we can meet the requirements of our payment processors", confirming the process will result in "some pages being permanently removed". After that, "new compliance measures" will be introduced, including mandating that all creators "confirm that their content is allowable under the policies of the respective payment processors linked to their account."
</p>
<p>
"We ask for your patience and understanding as we navigate this challenging period. I'm sorry we can not share more at this time as we are still getting a full understanding of the situation ourselves. We will post a follow up on our blog if the situation changes."
