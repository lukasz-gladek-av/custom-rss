            <p>EA's executive leadership has reportedly set a goal of 100 million players for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">the upcoming Battlefield game</a>, which "very few" developers believe is achievable.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/behind-the-next-battlefield-game-culture-clash-crunch-and-colossal-stakes/">This comes from a tell-all report from Ars Technica</a>, which explores the game's many ambitions and problems through information gathered from anonymous sources. In this article, battle royale modes in competitor titles like Call of Duty inspired this <em>optimistic </em>figure.</p>
<p>"Obviously, Battlefield has never achieved those numbers before," stated one source, while another said: "It's important to understand that over about that same period, 2042 has only gotten 22 million."</p>

<p>For reference, Call of Duty Warzone reached 100 million players back in April 2021 <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2021/04/Incredible-Warzone-and-Game-Sales-Milestones">per an official blog post</a>. Warzone originally came out in March 2020, so it took roughly a year for the biggest FPS IP out there to hit that figure. In 2018, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-fortnite-triggered-an-unwinnable-war-between-parents-and-their-boys-11545397200?mod=e2tw">a Fortnite interview in the Wall Street Journal</a> revealed the game had over 200 million people download and play the industry defining battle royale.</p>
<p>According to the report, those who had worked at DICE for a while were "particularly sceptical", with one source saying: "nothing in the market research or our quality deliverables indicates that we would be anywhere near that."</p>
<p>The article also states Battlefield 5's battle royale mode Firestorm failed to meet expectations, while the aforementioned competitors continued to retain vast playerbases. Nonetheless, it seems that a new attempt at this format is what EA leadership expects will attract much of that 100 million figure. </p>
<p>This new Battlefield is currently undergoing a closed alpha test, though that hasn't stopped leaks from getting out. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-leak-confirms-return-of-fan-favourite-mode">Rush mode has been leaked</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-single-player-campaign-details-leak-online">some single player campaign info</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-most-important-leaks-battlefield-6">a deluge of info on weapons and a battle royale mode</a>. If this next Battlefield can hit the targets set out by EA executives, it'll be the most popular Battlefield game ever by a large margin. Whether it actually can, is something else entirely.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reportedly-expects-battlefield-6-to-have-100-million-players-three-times-more-than-the-series-best-seller]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The next shooter project from Romero Games has lost funding following recent layoffs and studio closures at Microsoft.</p>
<p>The Galway-based studio, set up by Doom creator John Romero, released a statement earlier today on social media saying its publisher had cancelled funding for its game along with "other unannounced projects at other studios". Romero Games said this decision was "well above our visibility or control".</p>
<p>As a result, the studio is now evaluating next steps, but the team is "heartbroken" at the decision.</p>
<p>While the statement does not specify Microsoft was the publisher in question, it can easily be inferred following yesterday's news. Moreover, as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/john-romeros-next-fps-has-lost-funding-in-the-wake-of-the-microsoft-cuts/">VGC</a> spotted, artist <a href="https://x.com/christophredl94/status/1940719223472640128">Christoph Redl shared on social media</a>: "Unfortunately, due to the recent Xbox layoffs, I've lost my position at Romero Games." This confirms Microsoft's involvement.</p>
<p>The project was set to be an all-new shooter based on an original IP, created in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>The statement from Romero Games - specifically CEO and co-founder Brenda Romero, wife to John - added: "We deeply wish there had been something, anything, we could have done to prevent this outcome."</p>
<p>It continued: "This absolutely isn't a reflection of our team's work, performance, or the quality of the project itself. We hit every milestone on time, every time, consistently received high praise, and easily passed all our internal gates. We are incredibly proud of the work being done, and of the talented team behind it. The best we've worked with."</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/romero/status/1940718014540009489">Romero himself shared the statement</a>, adding: "These people are the best people I've ever worked with, and I'm sorry to say that our game and our studio were also affected."</p>
<p>The original Doom from Romero was of course developed at id Software, now part of Zenimax Media, which is itself part of Microsoft. The link to publishing the studio's next game is therefore clear.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">Microsoft laid off thousands of staff from across the business</a>, including its gaming division - it's impacted the likes of Zenimax, King, Turn 10, and Raven Software. Additionally, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild has been cancelled</a>, along with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">Perfect Dark reboot at The Initiative, and an unannounced MMORPG at Zenimax</a>.</p>

            <p>Yesterday, as widely expected based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-reportedly-set-for-major-job-cuts-from-next-week">earlier reports</a>, Microsoft began another sweeping round of layoffs - its fourth in just 18 months - this time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">affecting thousands of people across the company</a>. It's believed more than 9,000 employees have lost their jobs as a result of this most recent move, which Microsoft told Eurogamer were "necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace."</p>
<p>Since the announcement, additional reports have surfaced painting a clearer picture of the devastation wrought by Microsoft's latest cost cutting measures, as well as the substantial impact on its Xbox division. Beyond the significant human cost of the move - which Xbox boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> insisted was necessary to ensure the "enduring success" of the company in a message to staff yesterday - further details on the specific studios and projects impacted have now begun to emerge.</p>
<p>Rare's fantasy adventure Everwild, first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rare-announces-everwild-its-next-big-new-ip">announced in 2019</a>, has reportedly been cancelled, for instance, leading to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-and-banjo-kazooie-director-gregg-mayles-reportedly-leaving-rare-after-35-years">departure of studio veteran Gregg Mayles</a> after 35 years. Microsoft's troubled Perfect Dark reboot, unveiled in 2020, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">reportedly also ceased production</a> and its first party developer, The Initiative, closed. Microsoft is also said to have terminated its partnership with Crystal Dynamics, which was called in to help on the beleaguered project back in 2022, raising questions around how that team may also have been impacted by yesterday's news.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, an unannounced ZeniMax MMO has reportedly been cancelled, while 200 people are said to have lost their jobs at the Microsoft-owned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/candy-crush">Candy Crush</a> maker King, and nearly 50 percent of staff at Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10 have reportedly been laid off. The full extent and impact of Microsoft's massive "organisational and workforce changes" are yet to become clear, with Microsoft only providing limited information to press. It has, however, moved swiftly to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-microsoft-gaming-ceo-not-retiring-from-xbox-anytime-soon">deny rumours of Phil Spencer's imminent retirement</a>, insisting the Xbox boss won't be retiring from his position "anytime soon".</p>
<p>With fresh reports continuing to surface around yesterday's bombshell announcement and its impact on Xbox, we've set up this rolling news blog to sift through the confusion, and to collate breaking news and industry reactions as the story continues to evolve.</p><div data-live="true">

As we reported this morning, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-microsoft-gaming-ceo-not-retiring-from-xbox-anytime-soon">Phil Spencer won't be stepping down from his role as Microsoft Gaming CEO "anytime soon"</a>, according to a statement shared with The Verge. That's despite rumours shared on social media, and calls for his departure following these latest layoffs.

      <p>Due to layoffs, Warcraft Rumble won't receive any more content updates</p>
    <p>Blizzard <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24215864/announcing-changes-to-warcraft-rumble-support">has announced</a> that 2023 mobile game Warcraft Rumble will not be receiving any more content. This is because its developers have been laid off.</p>
<p>This news comes less than a year after the mobile game made its debut on PC. The decision to cease development on new content does not mean the game will go offline completely, however: per Blizzard, Warcraft Rumble will continue to operate with in-game events and bug fixes, we just won't be getting any new content.</p>
<p>"Warcraft Rumble began development nine years ago as a love letter to Azeroth and launched back in 2023, reflecting input from enthusiastic players around the globe and the effort of a passionate team—some of whom continue to support Rumble or other Blizzard games, and some we’ve had to sadly part ways with," Blizzard wrote.
</p>
<p>The game hit digital storefronts some 18 months after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-new-warcraft-mobile-game-is-free-to-play-tower-offence-arclight-rumble">its initial unveiling</a>, and was dubbed a 'free-to-play tower offence' title.</p></div>

      <p>Context for Xbox's most recent wave of layoffs</p>
    <p>A brief bit of extra context for yesterday's layoffs: as noted above, these mark the fourth round of job cuts at Microsoft in just 18 months, making for a total of over 11,500 layoffs in that time. And if you go back a further 12 months, you can unfortunately add an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reportedly-set-to-cut-thousands-of-jobs">additional 10,000 job cuts</a> to that tally.</p>
<p>In January 2024 (a little over three months after it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">formally acquired Activision Blizzard for $69bn</a>), Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">confirmed it had laid off approximately 1,900 people</a> from its video game teams - a decision Xbox boss Phil Spencer called "painful" at the time. That was followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">another 650 job cuts in September</a> (which Spencer insisted would "organise our business for long term success"), and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reportedly-makes-small-number-of-layoffs-across-divisions-including-gaming">"small" number of further layoffs</a> were reported earlier this year. These are said to have impacted employees spanning Microsoft's security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming divisions.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of video game workers have <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">sadly now been laid off in recent years</a>, with everyone from small indies to massive companies including Sony, EA, Epic Games, Riot Games, Warner Bros., and Embracer Group having announced job cuts or closed studios. Last year, The Game Business' Chris Dring, writing for Eurogamer, took a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">some of the reasons behind the devastating layoffs affecting the industry</a>.</p></div>

      <p>Romero Games' new shooter cancelled by Xbox</p>
    <p>Romero Games, the small Irish game development studio set up by John Romero and Brenda Romero, has had its funding pulled by Microsoft, effectively <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-next-shooter-project-loses-funding-following-microsoft-cuts">ending development of an all-new shooter IP it was working on</a>.</p>
<p>Brenda Romero announced the development in a statement on social media, saying there was nothing the studio could do to prevent this. All milestones were reached on time and apparently well received.</p>
<p>Jobs have been lost as a result, with some departing staff reporting that the entire development team has been laid off. </p></div>

<p>We have fuller write-ups of these nearly ready to go, incidentally. I was never quite sure about Warcraft Rumble but it's sad to hear about Romero Games. It also sounds like it's put the small Irish studio in a very difficult position too.</p>

I actually had a dream with Phil Spencer in last night, I assume because I went to sleep thinking about this situation, and in the dream I had to interview him. We got as far as the interview starting and then I don't remember any more, so I have no breaking dream-news for you.
</p>
<p>
But I woke up feeling sad about the whole situation. Sad, obviously, for the people losing their jobs. Sad to see decorated developers like Matt Firor, the head of Elder Scrolls Online (and once the co-creator of Dark Age of Camelot, an MMO that means a lot to me) leaving his role after 18 years, after the cancellation of a new MMO he'd been working on. And sad to read about Gregg Mayles reportedly leaving Rare after 35 years there. It's such a shame. I had thought Rare resurgent in recent years, after the success of Sea of Thieves, and I'd greatly looked forward to Everwild, and now I'm left bewildered and wondering what will become of the studio that's there. I only hope the people losing their roles are being offered generous severance packages with it.
</p>
<p>There was also a feeling of losing belief in Microsoft and Xbox. When Microsoft started buying up studios a few years ago, I watched it all enthused. I was really excited at the prospect of studios like Obsidian Entertainment and inXile finally having the backing of a company with deep pockets and resources. I was excited to see Blizzard wrestled away from Kotick, and curious about where Microsoft would take Bethesda. I thought it was a good thing. But of late it's seemed to be more precarious being a part of Xbox than not.</p></div>
