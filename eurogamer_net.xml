            <p>It looks like those on PlayStation Plus' Extra and Premium tiers can expect two more blockbuster games to join the service next week.</p>
<p>According to the ever-reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-on-connait-les-tetes-daffiche-des-ajouts-de-decembre-2025-60803">Dealabs</a>, Ubisoft's more bitesized <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> and the well-received Three Kingdoms-era Soulslike Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty will arrive for members next Tuesday, 16th December. Dealabs also said that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/soulcalibur-3">Soulcalibur 3</a> is "expected" to be included in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PlayStation Plus Premium</a> Classics Catalog.</p>

<p>We were quite taken with Assassin's Creed Mirage on its release in 2023, calling it a "rich and characterful adventure".</p>
<p>"I have frequently looked at Assassin's games as historical adventures with a bit of wonky sci-fi glamour, and Mirage's late-game certainly conforms to the formula in this regard. But what Mirage, and Mirage's Baghdad in particular, have reminded me is that the historical stuff is where the real care is found," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-review">Eurogamer's four star Assassin's Creed Mirage review</a>.</p><p>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty also came out in 2023, and again we quite liked it. "Team Ninja evolves Nioh's formula in a Three Kingdoms-era action RPG where allies, flags, and stealth make its brutal challenges more manageable than ever," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-review-masocore-action-with-an-approachable-twist">Eurogamer's Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty review</a>.</p>
<p>Sony is expected to announce its PS Plus December line up soon, so stay tuned for the official announcement.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Assassin's Creed news, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">PEGI rating for Black Flag Resynced was recently spotted</a>, further cementing that those remake rumours are indeed true. Perhaps we will officially hear more on Black Flag's remake at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">The Game Awards later this week</a>?</p>

            <p>Netflix considers Warner Bros.' game studios to be "relatively minor", as it admits they didn't factor into its $82.7bn acquisition deal.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-acquires-warner-bros-in-827bn-deal-including-studios-behind-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy">Netflix announced its intention to acquire Warner Bros.</a>, which would include its game studios as part of the bid. That said, gaming was not mentioned in the press release for the news, while a webcast for the news only included gaming in passing.</p>
<p>Now, in the company's <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4851311-netflix-inc-nflx-presents-at-ubs-global-media-and-communications-conference-2025-transcript">latest earnings call</a>, Netflix co-CEO Gregory Peters made it clear gaming was not a major consideration as part of its bid. "While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space, we actually didn't attribute any value to that from the get-go because they're relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things," he said.</p>
<p>It's fair to say Warner Bros. has been struggling in the games industry as of late. In its 2025 Q1 earnings report, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-failed-to-launch-a-game-last-quarter-resulting-in-48-drop-in-gaming-revenue">company reported a 48 percent decrease in games revenue due to no new releases</a>. Its most recent earnings report from November reports a 23 percent decrease, again due to no new releases.</p>
<p>This follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-cancels-major-game-expansion-as-financial-woes-continue">cancellation of a planned expansion to Hogwarts Legacy</a>; layoffs at Rocksteady after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flopped-due-to-perfectionism-and-ill-suited-genre-pivot-report">Suicide Squad flopped</a>; the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">cancellation of Monolith Productions' Wonder Woman game</a>; and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-director-in-deep-mourning-following-last-weeks-shutdown-news">shutdown of brawler Multiversus</a>.</p>
<p>Still, it's not as if Warner Bros. isn't capable of success. A report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-27/warner-bros-cancels-planned-hogwarts-legacy-game-expansion?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MzEwMzc5MiwiZXhwIjoxNzQzNzA4NTkyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVFNSRDZUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.dGBdhB7lWw3cxZNYXHsmp5Xz3rOJ-TM3ph6fDrDzGpg&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> earlier this year stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> had sold over 34m copies, making it one of the best-selling games ever. A sequel is reportedly in the works.</p><p>"Now we're super excited because some of those properties that they've built, Hogwarts is a great example of that, have done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we're offering," said Peters in the Netflix earnings call. "Quite well" is a bit of an understatement.</p>
<p>He continued: "They've got great studios and great folks working there. So we think that there's definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven't built that into our deal model."</p>
<p>Though harsh, there's certainly some truth in Peters' comments. Hogwarts Legacy's success alone isn't enough to keep Warner Bros.' gaming studios afloat. And while a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-restructures-leadership-team-following-new-focus-on-game-of-thrones-dc-harry-potter-and-mortal-kombat">change in leadership came in June as the company doubled down on its biggest franchises</a> (Mortal Kombat, Harry Potter, DC, Game of Thrones), nothing has been seen yet.</p>
<p>Still, it appears gaming is not a priority for Netflix, which doesn't bode well for the future of these studios. So while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-has-a-new-single-player-batman-game-in-development-teases-new-report">Rocksteady is reportedly working on a new Batman game</a> to follow its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-games-order">Arkham series</a>, it's unclear how this may be impacted by the acquisition.</p>
<p>And it's not quite over yet - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paramount-to-ruin-the-netflix-party-hollywood-studio-announces-clearly-superior-warner-bros-offer-of-its-own">Paramount has also made a public offer for Warner Bros.</a>, in a bid to outdo Netflix's "inferior" proposal.</p>

            <p>Doom creator John Romero's cancelled game is back, with the developer stating the untitled project has "survived".</p>
<p>Following mass layoffs at Microsoft this summer, Romero Games - the studio set up by the Doom creator and his wife Brenda - announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-next-shooter-project-loses-funding-following-microsoft-cuts">its publisher had pulled funding for its game along with "other unannounced projects at other studios"</a>. While Microsoft was not mentioned as being involved, this much was inferred.</p>
<p>Soon after this, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-studio-not-closed-as-publishers-express-interest-in-saving-cancelled-game">Romero Games assured fans the studio had not been closed</a>, and the team was now on the hunt for a new publisher to handle its cancelled game. And, it seems a new publisher or some kind of deal was indeed found, with Romero recently stating the game had "survived cancellation".</p>

<p>Romero discussed the topic of his studio's cancelled game at Salón del Videojuego de Madrid (see video below). Confirming it had been saved, Romero was met with waves of applause from the audience, before he shared a few more details about what we can all expect on its release.</p>
<p>Romero said the game has "been basically completely redesigned". The studio's upcoming game has "nothing" to do with the previous game, he furthered, but "incorporates a lot of the elements" from it.</p>
<p>"We're not starting at ground zero," the developer said. "We can take pieces out of and put into a brand new indie game. We have a lot of stuff we can put in the game. The design is completely different, but the team is very excited about the new design."</p><p>He added it is now a "much smaller game" than before, but it is "more fun" for the team as "the people working on it are all directors from different departments, and they didn't actually get to the code or design or whatever to do it themselves, but now we get to actually do that". Said Romero: "[We get to] do the thing we are really good at, ourselves. And, that's why small teams are great."</p>
<p>The developer still can't talk about the design specifics just yet, but said he has "never played a game like it" before. We do know that it is a shooter, though. "But, the things that you do in it, will be new to people, the way that going through <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> was a really new experience," he said.</p>
<p>"It was a very crazy place, and a different world, and it was really cool to explore it and be like 'what is that?'," Romero elaborated. "That's the idea behind what we are doing in this game."</p>
