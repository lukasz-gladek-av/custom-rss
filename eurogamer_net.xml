            <p>
Kojima Productions really is determined to make sure we don't forget <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> is almost upon us. Alongside a <a href="https://www.deathstrandingconcert.com/">musical world tour</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/limited-edition-death-stranding-2-ps5-controller-will-launch-alongside-kojimas-sequel">themed PlayStation 5 controller</a>, plus all that chatter about a Death Stranding <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-movie-reportedly-being-helmed-by-a-quiet-place-day-one-director">movie</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-casually-reveals-a-death-stranding-anime-is-in-the-works">anime</a>, the studio has now confirmed it'll be streaming a Death Stranding 2 panel event next month.
</p>
<p>
Officially known as the Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Game Premiere event, it's the first date in Kojima Productions' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-getting-world-tour-to-celebrate-its-release">previously announced months-long "world tour"</a> that careens through the likes of Sydney, Paris, London, and Hong Kong before ending in Lucca this November.
</p>
<p>
Things get underway, however, at 7pm PDT on Sunday, 8th June in Los Angeles, California - and keen-eyed observers will immediately appreciate that ties is neatly with the start of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Game Fest season</a>. And thus enter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>, who'll be hosting the Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Game Premiere event at Los Angeles' Orpheum Theatre, with best pal and Death Standing creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> in attendance too.

<p>
The focus of the event is a panel discussion featuring Kojima and unspecified "special guests", but there's also talk of a live demonstration of Death Stranding 2, should you wish to get another peek ahead of its 26th June release on PlayStation 5. And if you <em>do</em>, you can either show up in person - tickets are <a href="https://web.cvent.com/event/f7243f5b-d8db-4292-9b92-eacc5a299c61/summary">available online</a> - or, probably more conveniently for most, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/gOV2Rx-ncxM">watch the whole thing on YouTube</a>. Just be aware that it doesn't start till 3am on 9th June in the UK, so you might prefer to catch up later once you've had your beauty sleep.
</p>
<p>
So there's a lot happening in the world of Death Stranding, then, but will the wait be worth it? Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale nipped across the ocean to have a look a few months back and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-death-stranding-2-preview-how-a-big-dollop-of-metal-gear-is-expanding-kojimas-bizarre-epic">came away with many thoughts</a>. Perhaps the most telling words, however, are these: "So far, [Death Stranding 2] feels like the most Kojima-game yet".

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will receive another patch next week to make improvements for solo players.</p>
<p>FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-gets-balance-adjustments-in-day-one-patch">already received a day one patch that brought balance adjustments</a>. And there's more to come.</p>
<p>Next week, patch 1.02 will be released, adding an automatic revival effect once per Nightlord battle for solo expeditions. Further, the amount of runes acquired will be increased.</p>

<p>Nightreign released earlier today and has already seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-gets-strong-start-on-steam-reaching-over-300k-concurrent-peak">strong numbers of concurrent players on Steam</a>, although it's received a Mixed reception due to players criticising the lack of duo option and in-game communication features.</p>
<p>Indeed, many players have criticised the studio - known for its single-player games - for creating a multiplayer game, although solo play is an option.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The following improvements for solo expeditions will be added to the game:<br>- The effect "Automatic Revival Upon Defeat", which allows revival once per night boss battle, will be added to solo expeditions.<br>- The amount of runes gained will be increased.<br>Thank you for your support.</p>â€” ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1928436890924884471?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>As I wrote earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/should-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-solo">I would not recommend Nightreign as a solo game</a> at this point as it's clearly not the intended way to play.</p>
<p>However, it seems FromSoftware is aiming to respond to the current backlash to make solo play more feasible.</p>
<p>The studio previously stated it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-could-receive-two-player-mode-post-launch">considering a two-player option post-launch</a>, acknowledging it was "something that was overlooked during development".</p>
<p>"FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off is an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour," I wrote in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
