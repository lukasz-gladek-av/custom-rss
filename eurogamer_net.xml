            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> is almost upon us, and ahead of its 2nd October arrival, developer Insomniac has confirmed its highly anticipated sequel is getting its own co-op-focused Legends mode as free post-launch DLC next year.
</p>
<p>
There's not much to report in the way of specifics just yet - the news was only very briefly shared <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-and-blog">during Gamescom Opening Night Live</a> - but host <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> teased Ghost of Yōtei's take on Legends mode would include a "fantastical supernatural story and survival missions".
</p>
<p>
It seems reasonable to assume, then, that Ghost of Yōtei's Legends mode will be similar to that of its predecessor, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>. Tsushima's Legends mode <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-is-getting-online-co-op-multiplayer">arrived several months after launch,</a> introducing a combat-focused co-op spin on the solo experience that saw 2-4 players - as one of four available classes - completing missions inspired by Japanese folk tales and mythology. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima-legends">Ghost of Tsushima: Legends</a> later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushimas-multiplayer-legends-mode-getting-standalone-launch">released as a standalone game</a>.
</p>
<p>
It might be a little while before we get some solid details about Ghost of Yōtei's Legends mode, but you can see the tiniest glimpse of its action in the new trailer below.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> studio Game Science has revealed it's working on the next game in the series.
</p>
<p>
Black Myth: Zhong Kui will be an all-new follow-up, focused on the titular ghost-catching god who wanders between hell and earth. Like Wukong, it will be another single-player action-RPG rooted in Chinese folklore.
</p>
<p>
A brief teaser trailer was shown at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> Opening Night Live, showing a couple of men hiding from a parade of mythical characters, including Zhong Kui himself riding a giant tiger.

<p>
So why not release a Wukong sequel? Game Science explained over on the <a href="https://www.gamesci.cn/zhongkui">new game's website</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Upon completing the journey with the Destined One, we now aspire to take a tentative first step - to build more distinct game experiences, to challenge ourselves with bolder features, and to bring fresh ideas to our world and narrative design," reads a Q&amp;A. 
</p><p>
"Zhong Kui came as a natural choice born of that aspiration and other contributing factors. We are confident that, in this new project, we can make refreshing changes, create new things, while taking a hard look at our past flaws and regrets. And to all friends who love Black Myth: Wukong: the westward journey won't end here."
</p>
<p>
There's no release date yet, but it's planned for PC and "mainstream console platforms".
</p>
<p>
Wukong was a huge success for Game Science, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-continues-its-dominance-with-new-milestone">selling 10m copies in just three days</a> after its release last year. It's considered China's first AAA release and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-black-myth-wukong-has-changed-the-game-for-chinese-developers">paved the way for a whole string of Chinese-made action-RPGs on the way</a>.
