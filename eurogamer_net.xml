            <p>Meet DMZ: Nuclear Survival, a new PVE and competitive PVP multiplayer open-world survival crafting game set in a post-apocalyptic world after a nuclear war. It's coming "soon" in early access so that the "brand-new, ambitious, and highly flexible" game can grow alongside its community.</p>
<p>It's thought the game - which hasn't indicated a price, but has at least confirmed it won't be free-to-play - will be in early access for the inaugural year, although that "depends upon development progress and player feedback". You can check it out in the teaser below, which debuted at Indie Live Expo 2025 earlier today:</p>

<p>Developed by a two-person team in Saitama, Japan, DMZ is the debut title from newly formed studio Wild Dog. It takes place on the supercontinent "Pangaea, a "vast, procedurally generated" environment featuring a variety of biomes, including forests, wastelands, deserts, and snowfields. The game's lore suggests it was formed by tectonic shifts caused by the war, where "intense battles for survival" unfolded. Players can excavate ancient ruins scattered across the land - such as pyramids, Terracotta warriors, and Roman temples - and research relics, craft items, and "even resurrect powerful soldiers from ancient genes to revive a fallen civilization and fight for survival".</p>
<p>You'll also get to capture NPCs and bring them back to base to become companions, each one with a specialty that may come in handy. Non-human recruits like Bears, wolves, and, er, ostriches are also available. Players can also set up shop on dedicated servers to "play with over 100 players", although offline single-player mode is also available.</p>
<p>The duo hope the final version will introduce new biomes and locations, "enhance soldier and NPC development features, improve PvE and PvP mechanics, add craftable technologies, and implement server updates that allow more players to participate simultaneously".</p>
<p>For more, head on over to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3316500/DMZ_Nuclear_Survival/">Steam page</a>, which informs me there'll be in-app purchases and full controller support.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Pretty much all we officially know about the next Battlefield so far is that it's set in the modern day, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">bring back traditional classes and more focused maps</a> after the unpopular changes made in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>. Beyond that, it's all speculation - although one sleuth scoured the new game's concept art and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-sleuth-seemingly-identifies-location-teased-in-next-games-first-bit-of-concept-art">identified landmarks suggesting it could be set in Gibraltar</a>.</p>
<p>However, with the first phase of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">its Battlefield Labs initiative</a> - described as the "most ambitious community testing program in franchise history" - now live, despite participants needing to sign an NDA before they can get involved, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefields-invite-only-playtest-has-just-begun-and-gameplay-is-already-leaking-online">gameplay is already popping up in various corners of the internet</a>. And EA is not happy.</p>
<p>Whilst at first, with mostly positive news leaking, EA seemed pretty content to let the rumours fly, the team is now cracking down on the leaks, saying that no one wins when "information and content [...] is shared out of context".</p>

<p>Global community manager Totalfps hit back at a grumpy reddit thread about purported skill-based-matchmaking, cutting the commenter off with "Okay, enough".</p>
<p>"Battlefield Labs is about building and collaborating on the future of Battlefield, and we want to do that in the correct way," Totalfps wrote."I want to remind everyone things that are taking place in Battlefield Labs may or may not make their way to the final finish line.</p>
<p>"This is the greatest thing about this program, it allows us the ability to get creative, see what works with those involved, gain educated and informed feedback from those that are participating and potentially spot bugs around the features too. We've long wanted to implement this program, responding to your requests for greater involvement and a return to this type of reactivity around all things Battlefield."</p>
<p>Totalfps added that "there is a specific time and place for the wider community to learn about new features and functionalities", but now "is not it", and "the constant reposting of things is not that time or place" yet, either.</p>
<p>"Individuals are and will continue to be removed if they continue to violate the NDA that they agreed to," they said.</p>

<p>"While the allure of brief internet fame might be tempting, it undermines our efforts to remain open and communicative. And quite honestly, if that is your intention, then I question where this aligns with the interests of our, THIS, community."</p>
<p>Totalfps stressed the Labs program exists because EA "wanted to have an environment that allowed for testing and collaborating once again", but it "cannot do it if the trust continues to be tampered with. We must be allowed the ability to do it right - alongside you all and in the correct way".</p>
<p>"Rules aren't fun, but they exist to make it better for us all. Thank you to those that are abiding by them, but thank you for your trust and time too to make this great for you - our community," they concluded.</p>

            <p>While PCs and smartphones will be exempt from Trump's retaliatory tariffs in the US, consoles will not.</p>
<p>That's according to former GamesIndustry.biz boss Chris Dring, who confirmed in his newsletter, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/pcs-and-smartphones-exempt-from-trump">The Game Business</a>, that not only could Nintendo's upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 console be impacted by the tariffs, but so too will PlayStation and Xbox's hardware.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, it's unclear if the exemptions for other tech components like SSDs and PCs were intentionally not applied to consoles or if it's merely an oversight. On the plus side, it looks as though Nintendo Switch cartridges will be spared the extra 125% levy.</p>
<p>Nintendo had already directed the vast majority of its Switch 2 manufacturing output <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-already-shipped-over-1m-vietnam-made-consoles-to-us-this-year-as-switch-2-launch-threatened-by-tariffs">from Vietnam towards the US over the first two months of this year</a>, as the threat of Trump's now-confirmed tariffs loomed, but the stinging tariffs applied to Vietnam - a key manufacturer for Nintendo - and China continue to cause considerable uncertainty.</p>
<p>This may also have the ripple effect of piting Asian players against US game studios.</p>
<p>"It is not far-fetched to think that even if 'a deal is struck' for tariffs and other issues between the US and China, Chinese consumers would protest the economic uncertainty by avoiding US products and even by avoiding US technology and games," said Lisa Hanson, CEO at <a href="https://nikopartners.com/nikos-opinion-on-tariffs-video-games-and-us-china-trade/">Niko Partners</a>.</p>
<p>"In fact, Chinese social media already has consumer discourse about a consumer-led rebuke against US-products. The same could become true in Vietnam, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and so many other countries. Chinese regulators could very well block US games from ISBNs, and may even take a closer look at blocking Steam International, which is currently a major part of China’s gaming ecosystem despite officially illegally operating."</p>
<p>Earlier this month, US trade group <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-tariffs-will-have-a-real-and-detrimental-impact-on-games-industry-says-us-trade-group">the Entertainment Software Association said the Trump administration's tariffs will "have a real and detrimental impact" on the video games industry</a> as a whole. David Cole - founder of games industry marketing and research firm DFC Intelligence - told Eurogamer his firm <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-likely-to-stick-with-switch-2s-450-launch-price-despite-trump-tariffs-says-analyst">expected Nintendo to stick with its $450 launch pricing for Switch 2</a>, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">temporarily briefly pausing pre-orders in the US and Canada</a>. Pre-order invites for American players are now expected to go out <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/">"starting 8th May"</a>.</p>

<p>"The direction of our game will not undergo any major changes under the influence of Scopely," a Niantic spokesperson told those at the meeting, as reported by <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/mobile/articles/2504/10/news182.html">ITMedia</a> (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-go-will-not-change-due-to-scopelys-influence-niantic-assures-following-acquisition/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>"[Scopely] will just be supporting its further improvement, and we will keep doing what we've been doing since the beginning. To put it more bluntly – please rest assured that we will not be shutting down the game."</p>
<p>The Niantic exec said there was nothing else to announce at this time, but did hint that the company will continue to "evolve" Pokémon Go over time.</p>
<p>As Tom recently summarised for us, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fans-launch-campaign-to-protect-games-future-as-concerns-mount-over-sale">Pokémon Go fans had expressed deep concern over Scopely's acquisition</a> of the game, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-developer-close-to-selling-games-for-35bn-to-saudi-owned-monopoly-go-maker-report">word of the deal leaked online</a>.

<p>"Marathon is a team-based extraction shooter set around the mysterious and cutthroat world of Tau Ceti IV," the voiceover teases. "You are a Runner, a cybernetic mercenary who's given up their human form for a biosynethic shell with unique abilities and stats, capable of both tactical and fast-paced combat.</p>
<p>"Here, you'll fight in a crew of up to three players across a variety of zones and points of interest. You'll face rival Runners in zones of up to 18 players, countless security forces, and otherworldly threats. To scavenge the remains of a lost colony for glory and fortune."</p>
<p>There are six classes, although only four were revealed; stealthy Void, tanky Glitch, as well as Locus and Blackbird. All four will be available in the upcoming alpha test, and there's no need to race to lock in your favourite as you ready up - your team can play as three Voids if you want, as there's no limit.</p>

<p>It goes on to describe the scavengable environments of Tau Ceti IV - they're "filled with weapons, materials, and equipment" - with sponsorship from factions able to help replenish your armoury.</p>
<p>It also stresses that Marathon has been designed to play as fireteams, with contextual pings, shared objectives, and down-but-not-out mechanics, although there is the ability to opt out of crew queues if you're a lone wolf wanting to "take all the glory for yourself as a solo Runner".</p>
<p>"Before deploying, you'll strategically build your loadout and select a Runner to ensure you're equipped for the run ahead. Your objective is simple: get in, gather as much loot as you can, and make it out alive. Die, and all your gear will be up for grabs. Survive, and your loot can be taken into future runs as you grow in power and fill your vault."</p>
<p>That said, death is, apparently, "inevitable, but it's never the end".</p>

<p>"Bungie brings its best in class, first-person person multiplayer action to the forefront. Dynamic and tactile gunplay. Runners with unique playstyles and customisable builds create highly dynamic and strategic team fights."</p>
<p>Because of its timed matches, dynamic events, variable weather, and unpredictable players, Bungie reckons no two matches will be the same. There'll also be endgame challenges, ranked play, secrets, seasonal storytelling, community events, "and more" in season one.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, Bungie also warns that no matter how geared up you are, "players with skill and strategy will always have the edge".</p>
<p>Marathon is coming to PC via Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S with full cross-play and cross-save.</p>
<p>In case you were wondering, no, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-wont-require-a-playstation-network-account-on-pc-and-xbox">you won't need a PlayStation Network account to play Marathon</a> on PC or Xbox.</p>
<p>In response to a comment shared on Marathon's Discord channel in which one user said they were a tad "spooked" by the idea of having to use a PSN login to play, the Marathon team replied with a clear cut and straight to the point message: "Marathon will not require a PlayStation Account for players on PC and Xbox."</p>
