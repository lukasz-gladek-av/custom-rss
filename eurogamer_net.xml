            <p>Embark Studios has confirmed that both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> and the Finals have been hit by DDoS attacks, claiming they were both "extensive" and "co-ordinated".</p>
<p>These problems first started in the early hours of the morning, with reports of mass instability impacting both games. While initially some stability was brought back to the servers, this soon deteriorated again as the DDos attacks continued.</p>
<p>In an update posted on the official Arc Raiders Discord server a few hours ago, community manager Ossen wrote: "Hey Raiders, both ARC Raiders and THE FINALS have been under extensive, co-ordinated DDoS attacks. The strike team has been working hard on mitigations and solutions to fix the problem, and we are making good progress - but at this point in time the attacks are still ongoing."</p>

<p>This effort to resolve the connectivity problems coincided with work on a hotfix targeting unintended changes with the recent major update, which altered the fire rate of some weapons, led to some earned cosmetics going missing, and more.</p>
<p>In the last hour, Ossen updated Arc Raiders players on the DDos issue, stating: "We are noticing that servers are recovering." Whether the DDoS attacks have concluded, or Embark has resolved the issue entirely, remains unclear.</p>
<p>This attack comes only a day following<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/are-you-a-little-too-good-at-arc-raiders-the-new-solo-vs-squad-mode-might-be-for-you"> the release of a new solo vs squad game mode, as well as a Bird City map condition</a>. It's worth noting that even with this ongoing DDoS attack, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">SteamDB still tracks well over 100,000 players still in-game</a>.</p>

            <p>The games industry is in a very weird place right now due to both internal and external factors. Perhaps the most pressing one is the <a href="https://za.ign.com/steam-machine/223581/video/how-ram-shortages-are-making-tech-more-expensive-boring-ces-2026">rising cost of key hardware components</a> due to AI and data centre speculation. Therefore, next-gen hardware delays could be on the table as Sony and Microsoft look to maximize PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, respectively, while waiting markets to settle.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/high-likelihood-ps6-will-launch-after-2028-according-to-new-analyst-forecast-as-sony-focuses-on-extending-ps5-lifecycle">IGN</a>, we're now hearing from David Gibson, senior analyst at MST, who focuses on tech and gaming companies. He published a <a href="https://www.sandstoneinsightsjapan.com/post/sony-group-6758%EF%BC%89%EF%BC%8D%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0%E9%83%A8%E9%96%80%E3%81%AE%E5%A5%BD%E8%AA%BF%E3%81%8C%E7%AC%AC3%E5%9B%9B%E5%8D%8A%E6%9C%9F%E3%82%92%E7%89%BD%E5%BC%95%E3%80%81%E4%BB%8A%E5%BE%8C%E3%81%95%E3%82%89%E3%81%AA%E3%82%8B%E4%B8%8A%E6%98%87%E4%BD%99%E5%9C%B0%E3%81%82%E3%82%8A">report for Sandstone Insights Japan</a> on 16th of this month that commented on Sony's recent financial performance and what might be next for the tech giant.</p>
<p>The good news (for Sony) is that earnings for the third quarter of the fiscal year ending February 2026 are expected to exceed previous forecasts. First- and third-party games continue to drive growth, and it appears PSN subscriptions remain strong, too. Per IGN's report, "Q3 sales are predicted to total around 1.8 trillion yen (approx. $11.6 billion), with operating income at 160 billion yen (approx. $1 billion)."</p>
<p>Good numbers around PS5 hardware and software only makes the case for a delay of PS6 even more convincing. "Sony expects the PS5 lifecycle to be longer than that of previous console generations," Gibson stated, before adding it's likely the PS6's launch won't occur until after 2028. Industry figures <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/gaming-industry/a-ps6-launch-in-2028-feels-right-according-to-former-playstation-boss-citing-increasingly-long-console-generations">had been predicting a 2028 release</a> last year. This would already make the PS5 generation longer than PS4's seven-year exclusive run (though the hardware is still being supported). If a market-induced does occur, PS5 will spend even more time being Sony's top-dog console.</p><p>Recent moves by the company suggest that might indeed be the case, with a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-cheaper-japanese-language-only-ps5-just-for-japan">Japan-only, cheaper PS5 model launching last November</a> and deep discounts happening globally for Black Friday 2025. Via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/sonys-sending-messages-to-ps4-players-encouraging-them-to-upgrade-to-ps5">Push Square</a>, we're also seeing reports of PS4 users being targeted by Sony with aimed messages that encourage making the jump to PS5.</p>
<p>Gibson, however, also thinks Sony is now focusing on retaining existing PS5 users over boosting console sales (even if those <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/466830/ps5-best-seller-as-sales-remain-flat-yoy-europe-hardware-estimates-for-december-2025/">remain strong</a>). At the time of writing, price hikes haven't been announced in answer to memory shortage woes, but the analyst admits "Sony might pass future cost increases onto consumers" even if there's no short-term danger. This would line up with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-the-switch-2-getting-more-expensive-soon-nintendo-says-theres-no-immediate-impact-but-will-keep-an-eye-on-volatile-memory-market">Nintendo's current stance</a> on the matter. Therefore, solid growth well into 2026 is likely for Sony and Nintendo. On the other hand, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/in-not-remotely-shocking-news-xbox-has-reportedly-suffered-its-worst-year-on-record-for-console-sales">Xbox sales in 2025 were lackluster</a>, so there are doubts around Microsoft's consoles' performance moving forward.</p>
