Ubisoft has detailed the exact moment you'll be able to begin pre-loading and then playing the long-awaited <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.
</p>
<p>
The twice-delayed Assassin's Creed Shadows is finally set to arrive on 20th March, in just 15 days. Ahead of then, pre-loading is available right now on Xbox Series X/S - where it weighs in at 107.77GB.
</p>
<p>
If you're playing on PC, pre-loading will begin on 17th March at 4pm UK time worldwide. Lastly, on PlayStation 5, pre-loading will become available on 18th March at midnight local time.

<p>
When the clock strikes midnight on 20th March here in the UK, the console version of the game will become available on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. The PC version unlocks two hours earlier on PC via Ubisoft Connect (that's 10pm on the 19th March) or slightly later at 4am on the 20th if you're on Steam.

<p>
Xbox fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1j43ro9/assassins_creed_shadows_global_release_timings/">discussing the launch timings over on reddit</a> have spotted that the game - as with many - will be available first to those in New Zealand. Do with that information what you will. 
</p>
<p>
And finally today, <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4XbPPtFyQEtIMWrA9xVDmZ/assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa">comments made by Ubisoft</a> surrounding the launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows for Steam Deck have been doing the rounds. The publisher noted last month that the game won't initially be compatible with Valve's handheld due it being below the game's minimum specs - although did not rule out this changing in future.
</p>
<p>
"At launch, the game will not be compatible with Steam Deck," Ubisoft said, "due to the fact it is below our minimum specs for PC."
</p>
<p>Our Katharine recently went hands-on with the game for six hours, and said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">Assassin's Creed Shadows was "the biggest shake-up of the series in years"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As ever, Choice membership fees include a five percent donation to charity. This month, the company's cause of choice is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhXaZ17iXY">Care.org</a>, a leading humanitarian organisation fighting global poverty.</p>
<p>(And a quick note - Eurogamer has covered Humble for years, but the company is now also a part of the same parent company, IGN Entertainment.)</p>
<p>So, what of the games themselves? Well, if you are yet to give Pacific Drive a go, I fully recommend you try out the driving survival game, which invites players to explore the Olympic Exclusion Zone in a station wagon. This wagon is more than just your car, however. It is your companion on a bumpy and rather extraordinary road, complete with strange phenomena and surreal events all thrown into the mix.</p>
<p>Our Chris called the whole experience an "exhausting, oddly lovable nightmare" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pacific-drive-review">Eurogamer's Pacific Drive review</a>, awarding it four out of five stars. "A punishing, exhasperating slog, or an off-beat love story between driver and car, human and the Zone? Pacific Drive is both and then some," he wrote.</p>

<p>Another highlight included in this month's Choice bundle is Tales of Kenzera: Zau, which Eurogamer also awarded four stars. "What Tales of Kenzera lacks in creative game design it makes up for in vital, passionate storytelling," our Ed wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-review">Eurogamer's Tales of Kenzera: Zau review</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you have seen all the chatter about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> recently but aren't ready to purchase it for yourself, Wild Hearts is worth checking out. Our Matt gave the game his recommendation in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wild-hearts-review-monster-hunters-formula-taken-to-fantastic-new-heights">Eurogamer's Wild Hearts review</a>, writing: "Far more than just a Monster Hunter clone, Wild Hearts exceeds expectations and then some, mixing streamlined action with inventive new toys."</p>
