<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> arrives later this week, and with physical editions now out in the wild, fans are expressing dismay amid reports the PS5 release includes just 85MB of data on the disc, with the Xbox Series X/S release seemingly not much bigger.
</p>
<p>
Rumblings of discontent over Doom: The Dark Ages' physical release began <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/some-retailers-have-broken-doom-the-dark-ages-street-date-and-huge-spoilers-are-already-out-there">over the weekend</a>, after one early receiver took to social media to <a href="https://x.com/nilynix/status/1920550232414183648">report the Xbox version contained just 342MB of data on the disc</a>. That was followed by an update on the PS5 version from Does it play?, an account dedicated to "[testing] commercial releases to ensure they work internet free."
</p>
<p>
Does it Play? <a href="https://x.com/DoesItPlay1/status/1920754796463636713">shared screenshots from a supporter</a> purportedly showing Doom: The Dark Ages' PS5 physical release contains just an 85.01MB "stub and a blocker to go online and update" on disc. That means purchasers of either console's physical edition are required to download approximately 85GB of data to play the game.

<p>
Images of Doom: The Dark Ages' physical release <a href="https://x.com/DoesItPlay1/status/1920542970668826913">show an "internet required" badge on the cover</a>, but the extent of the required download size seemingly isn't made immediately clear. Eurogamer has contacted Bethesda for confirmation of the reports, and for clarity on its physical release strategy, but the publisher is yet to respond. We'll update the story if we hear more.
</p>
<p>
The news follows similar criticism by players and preservationists earlier this year after Bethesda released <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> with just 20GB of the game's full 120GB install size on the disc. Nintendo has also seen pushback after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-physical-releases-will-just-have-a-download-key-on-the-card">announcing physical game-key cards for Switch 2</a> that only include a download key. Early signs have suggested a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-physical-releases-will-just-have-a-download-key-on-the-card">significant majority of third-party publishers will release their Switch 2 titles on game-key cards at launch</a>.
</p>
<p>
Away from Doom: The Dark Ages' physical release controversy, Bethesda's latest has received plenty of praise. Eurogamer contributor Christian Donlan called it "brisk and playful" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-review">four star review</a>, while Digital Foundry described it as "phenomenal" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-doom-the-dark-ages-xbox-series-x-delivers-the-smoothest-experience-ps5-pro-the-crispest-image">their tech breakdown</a>.

            <p>Magic: the Gathering has detailed more of its Final Fantasy card collection, and a message from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> character designer Tetsuya Nomura may hint towards the third part of the remake series.</p>
<p>The card collection includes two of Final Fantasy 7 villain Sephiroth - "Fabled SOLDIER" and "One-Winged Angel" - which form a singular piece of art when combined. The first is Sephiroth in human form, the second is his evolved form as the final boss of the game.</p>
<p>"This time around, I drew Sephiroth on both the front and back sides of the card," wrote Nomura in a message on social media. "I actually drew them so that they would join up if placed one on top of the other, so if you manage to get two of the same card and line them up, you'll see how the original illustration looked."</p>

<p>He then added: "There is also a reason that the design for Safer Sephiroth is different from the original game, but I unfortunately can't share more about that."</p>
<p>It's this latter comment that's got fans speculating the new artwork on the card may be taken from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> Part Three.</p>
<div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>

<p>The biggest difference from the original game is that this Safer Sephiroth has both of his arms, where the boss form has one arm and one wing. Still, this is likely our first look at what's to come in the third remake game.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Magic: the Gathering set, each iteration of Cid from across the series will be present.</p>
<p>Cid is a recurring character who debuted in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-ii">Final Fantasy 2</a> and has featured, in some form, in every game since, meaning the set will include 15 Cid, Timeless Artificer cards.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/virtua-fighter-5-revo-confirmed-for-console-and-itll-be-more-than-a-simple-port<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-5">Virtua Fighter 5</a> REVO, the latest edition of Sega's nearly 19-year-old fighting sequel, is heading to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/virtua-fighter-is-making-its-3d-pc-debut-this-winter-including-rollback-netcode">PC debut earlier this year</a>.
</p>
<p>
For those who haven't been following Virtua Fighter 5's convoluted journey over the last two decades, REVO is a remaster of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown">Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown</a>, which initially launched for PS4 in 2021. That, in turn, was a remaster of the game's supposedly final revision, Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown, which arrived on PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2012.
</p>
<p>
As to how Virtua Fighter 5 REVO differentiates itself from the series' most recent revision, the PC version introduced 4K graphics, high-res textures, rollback netcode support to optimise online play, and new online modes enabling competition with up to 16 other players.

<p>
Presumably, Sega's newly announced console editions will be similarly enhanced, but the publisher is yet to provide specific details beyond the fact cross-play will be supported, and there's no word of a release window either. "We're going to include even more content to make this much more than a simple port," it adds, "which we'll tell you about in future updates."
</p>
<p>
News of Virtua Fighter 5 REVO's console release comes after last year's confirmation a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-unveils-new-virtua-fighter-sonic-racing-and-like-a-dragon">brand-new entry in the much-loved fighting series is on the way</a>. That reveal was followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-in-engine-look-at-next-virtua-fighter-game-revealed">first in-engine footage</a> back in January, and Sega has now released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnyE4tsQ3w8">similarly styled teaser</a> showcasing returning character Wolf Hawkfield. Sega's new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter">Virtua Fighter</a> project is part of the initiative announced in 2023, which will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-announces-flurry-of-projects-including-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi">see it revisiting a number of its previously dormant classic properties</a>, including  <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a>, Jet Set Radio, Streets of Rage, and Shinobi.

            <p>The star of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s next game has said she's received preparation for the role - and specifically the online reaction to it - from studio boss Neil Druckmann, following the online abuse previously kicked up around The Last of Us Part 2.</p>
<p>Actress Tati Gabrielle will star as bounty hunter Jordan A Mun in Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, Naughty Dog's upcoming sci-fi project for PlayStation 5. While Gabrielle has worked close to video games before - on PlayStation's Uncharted film adaptation and as Nora in The Last of Us' TV series - this will be her first video game role.</p>
<p>In preparation, Gabrielle said she had been given mental "bootcamp-ing" by Druckmann, as she becomes the face of the game.</p>

<p>"Neil's been bootcamp-ing me. I know Troy [Baker]'s experience, I know Ashley [Johnson]'s experience..." Gabrielle told <a href="https://ew.com/tati-gabrielle-of-the-last-of-us-about-to-go-intergalactic-exclusive-11732492">EW</a>.</p>
<p>"I know Laura Bailey's experience," Gabrielle continued, referring to the backlash Bailey received for her turn as The Last of Us Part 2's Abby.</p>
<p>Prior to The Last of Us Part 2's release, Abby's role as the character that kills Joel was leaked, sparking a wave of online abuse and death threats aimed at Bailey and her son. "Every time I went online, that's all I saw," Bailey revealed previously as part of the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2s-abby-actor-reveals-online-abuse-didnt-just-threaten-her-life-but-her-baby-son-too">behind-the-scenes documentary, Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2</a>, which was released in February last year. "Death threats and threats of violence."</p>
<p>Gabrielle revealed that, like Bailey, she too has been the subject of backlash since it was announced she would star in Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. Already, she has had misogynistic and racist comments sent her way.</p>
<p>"I got a lot of love, but there was a lot of hate over me being a woman, me being a woman of colour, me having my head shaved, all these things that I didn't even actually initially see," Gabrielle said. "I'm out of the social media zeitgeist for that reason - but once I did, Neil [Druckmann] was like, 'Ignore it. No matter what, me and you, we're going to make something beautiful. We're going to make something that we're proud of'."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The actress also spoke more about the upcoming game's theme of faith. Back in March of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-hate-directed-at-the-last-of-us-part-2-naughty-dog-boss-says-next-game-about-the-entirely-uncontroversial-topics-of-faith-and-religion">Druckmann explained how Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet features a fictitious religion</a> which "becomes pretty prominent" in the game's alternate history.</p>
<p>"The question of faith is not black and white," Gabrielle elaborated. "When you initially think of faith, you think of religion, which is a part of it, but there's also faith in oneself. There's faith in your environment or your community. All that faith means is, What are your beliefs?</p>
<p>"What are the things that you hope for? Faith sounds flowery, but we all experience it day in and day out. What is your reason for waking up?"</p>
<p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is in development for PS5. Last year, Druckmann confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-neil-druckmann-says">Naughty Dog had a number of games in the works</a>, including "multiple single-player projects", this being one of them.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in studio news, Naughty Dog and HBO have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-something-in-the-air-as-ellie-sees-red-in-the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-five">just aired the fifth episode of The Last of Us season two</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-underground-remaster-hopes-increase-as-iconic-skater-says-hell-campaign-all-i-can<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a>, the skating icon has said he has "aspirations" for further remakes, including one for the popular <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-underground">Tony Hawk's Underground</a>.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://screenrant.com/tony-hawks-underground-remake-campaign/">Screen Rant</a>, Hawk said the decision to continue remaking older games ultimately rested with the company he worked with - that'd be publisher Activision, and ultimately its owner Microsoft - but that he would "campaign all I can".
</p>
<p>
Still, Hawk's wishes appear to hold at least some sway - such as with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bam-margera-officially-returning-to-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">seemingly last-minute restoration of skater Bam Margera to the roster of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a>.
</p>
<p>
"I always have aspirations," Hawk said on the possibility of Underground being remastered next. "It's not up to me generally. I'll campaign all I can, but I'm working with a much bigger company that's a lot smarter than me."
</p>
<p>
Asked if a decision on Underground was too early, before the launch of Pro Skater 3+4, Hawk added: "Yeah, we haven't even released this game."
</p>
<p>
Activision had looked ready not to continue the Tony Hawk's series at all, despite a positive reception to Pro Skater 1+2 when it arrived back in 2020. Its developer, Vicarious Visions, was later shuffled over to become part of Blizzard, and the future of Hawk's skating series put on ice. 
</p>
<p>
But teases from Hawk himself last year of talks between himself and Activision ultimately resulted in a reversal of fortunes. Earlier this year, Activision began teasing a Pro Skater 3+4 remake within Call of Duty, before making the project official on 4th March.
</p>
<p>
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 will launch on 11th July for Nintendo Switch and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S including through Game Pass Ultimate.
