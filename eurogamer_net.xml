            <p>
Microsoft has announced its Xbox Game Pass line-up for the first half of November, which will be headlined by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-slug-tactics">Metal Slug Tactics</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/goat-simulator">Goat Simulator</a> Remastered and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a>.
</p>
<p>
But you'll only get these new games included in your subscription day one if you're an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass subscriber, or (for now at least) if you're a continuing member of Xbox Game Pass from before Microsoft's recent changes.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, the month's line-up includes a selection of titles already available to members of the above subscription options, that are now available to the new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass titles for November are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Metal Slug Tactics (Cloud, Console, and PC) - 5th November (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</li>
<li>Go Mecha Ball (Console) - 6th November (Now with Game Pass Standard)</li>
<li>Harold Halibut (Xbox Series X S) -  6th November  (Now with Game Pass Standard)</li>
<li>The Rewinder (Console) -  6th November (Now with Game Pass Standard)</li>
<li>Turnip Boy Robs a Bank (Console) -  6th November (Now with Game Pass Standard)</li>
<li>Goat Simulator Remastered (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X S) -  7th November  (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</li>
<li>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X S) -  19th November  (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</li>
</ul>

            <p>Developer Hexworks has shared details on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lords-of-the-fallen">Lords of the Fallen</a>'s PS5 Pro update.</p>
<p>As with games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-ps5-pro-enhanced-label-will-see-30fps-quality-mode-with-added-ray-tracing">Alan Wake 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-ps5-pro-hands-on-preview-is-it-worth-it">Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</a>, Lords of the Fallen will benefit from that 'Enhanced' label on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">PS5 Pro's release this week</a>.</p>
<p>In Lords of the Fallen's case, this will see a 40 percent increase in pixel density. In addition, it will boast an enhanced Performance Mode, which means 1440p at 60fps (Upscaled to 4k). Quality Mode, meanwhile, will offer players 30fps at 4k.</p>

<p>As well as getting its game ready for the PS5 Pro, Hexworks has also released a patch for the base game. Patch 1.6 - as it is known - will include gameplay adjustments, steps to "further enrich the onboarding experience for new players" and a "more immersive" Umbral Realm, to name a few.</p>
<p>Hexworks specifically highlighted the below improvements, which arrive with Patch 1.6:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mob Density: </strong>Based on your feedback, we’ve fine-tuned certain mob encounters to create a  smoother, more immersive combat experience by isolating instances to prevent mobs from  stacking up. Returning players may find it worthwhile to start anew, as we’ve added a few  fresh surprises along the way! (Original enemy distribution and density can still be accessed  via NG+ modifiers.)</li>
<li><strong>Ranged Enemies: </strong>We’ve adjusted the perception of certain ranged units to correct  instances that felt unfair or unrealistic.</li>
<li><strong>Jumping: </strong>Platforming in Pilgrim's Perch has been refined with improved indicators, making  jumps clearer and navigation smoother.</li>
<li><strong>PvP Scaling:</strong> To elevate skill-based play in PvP, we’ve rebalanced scaling mechanics,  particularly where magic-infused weapons and spells are concerned. These tweaks apply  exclusively to PvP, so PvE players can continue with their current builds unaffected.</li>
<li><strong>Attack Displacement: </strong>Some weapon attacks have received slight adjustments to reduce  displacement, providing a greater sense of control while preserving effectiveness and  supporting your playstyle.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the team has said performance will be improved in some of Lords of the Fallen's more graphically challenging areas. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lords-of-the-fallen-2023-review">Eurogamer's Lords of the Fallen review</a> criticised the game for its poor performance, but the developer has been steadily offering improvements on this.</p><p>Today's patch will leave players feeling more "empowered" on their journey, Hexworks said. Full notes can be found via <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1501750/announcements">Steam</a>. Lords of the Fallen is now available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1501750/Lords_of_the_Fallen/?utm_source=press+release&amp;utm_medium=media&amp;utm_campaign=LOTFv1.6&amp;utm_id=Lords+of+the+Fallen+v1.6">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/lords-of-the-fallen">Epic Games Store</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/lords-of-the-fallen/9N3CJZ3HFHTF?utm_source=press+release&amp;utm_medium=media&amp;utm_campaign=LOTF+v1.6&amp;utm_id=LOTF+v1.6">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/lords-of-the-fallen/?utm_source=press+release&amp;utm_medium=media&amp;utm_campaign=LOTF+v1.6&amp;utm_id=LOTF+v1.6">PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 5 Pro</a> from this Thursday.</p>
