            <p>Hideki Kamiya has called out "shitty leakers" in the wake of Nintendo's Switch 2 reveal, stating they "should be cursed".</p>
<p>Earlier today <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo finally revealed its Switch 2 console</a> after months of leaks and speculation.</p>
<p>Following the reveal, Kamiya (game designer of Okami, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>, Devil May Cry and more) took to social media to express his frustration towards those who leaked Switch 2 information ahead of the official reveal.</p>

<p>"I hope that all of the people who leaked Switch 2 information/those who helped leak it will be cursed for the rest of their lives to always have poop on the soles of their shoes when they get home," he began, jokingly enough (via machine translation).</p><p>Kamiya referred back to the surprise reveal of an Okami sequel in development from last year's The Game Awards. "Now that I've enjoyed the surprise announcement of Okami with all the users, I truly believe that... all those damn leakers should be cursed," he said.</p>

<p>He continued, referring to theoretical leakers as "the worst of scum".</p>
<p>"The shitty leaker only acts for his own pleasure and self-satisfaction, not only is he not contributing to anyone's benefit, he is incurring all sorts of opportunity losses, and has done nothing to be proud of in front of others," he said. "He is the worst of scum, so he should be covered in shit from head to toe and thrown out of the atmosphere... and then stop thinking and wander forever."</p>
<p>He concluded the thread with a further vent of frustration.</p>
<p>"These damn leakers are in a position of responsibility where they have access to information that only a very select few know, yet what they do is nothing more than an expression of a filthy desire for approval that lacks a shred of rationality; they are shameful people, so it is not the manufacturers whose secrets have been exposed who should be blamed, but these damn people, and they need to be crushed as soon as possible," he said.</p>
<p>The outspoken Kamiya is known for his hot takes on social media, yet while his thread is lighthearted to begin with, there appears to be an undercurrent of genuine annoyance.</p>
<p>Indeed, leaks have become an issue across the industry. In recent years, many major releases - from Nintendo and other studios - have been leaked ahead of release. This week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-very-very-upset-by-switch-2-leaks-former-staff-suggest">former Nintendo staff said the company had likely been "very, very, upset" by Switch 2 leaks</a>, due to their "disruptive impact".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-in-the-works-with-capcom-and-hideki-kamiyas-new-studio-clovers">Kamiya's Okami sequel</a>, thankfully, didn't leak before its reveal. It's being developed by his new studio Clovers.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 is still without a firm release date, but was finally announced earlier today along with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">tease of a new Mario Kart game</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sony Pictures has released the first full trailer for its Until Dawn horror film.</p>
<p>Earlier this week a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-movie-teaser-reveals-how-its-replaced-the-games-branching-narrative">teaser was released</a> that hinted towards how the game's branching narrative would be replicated in the film.</p>
<p>Now, in this full trailer, we can see how the plot revolves (literally) around an hourglass with the cast repeatedly waking up after gruesome deaths to try their luck at surviving once again.</p>

<p>Though the plot differs from the original game - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-film-wont-feature-the-same-characters-or-even-the-same-story-as-the-game-its-based-on">features a new cast</a> - there are plenty of horror tropes: from the haunted house setting, masked slayers, and chases thwarted by bear traps, to creepy zombie-like monsters and a particularly nasty looking face infection.</p>
<p>"Every night holds a clue," the trailer reads. "Every death brings you closer to the truth."</p>
<p>Then: "If we want to survive, we have to make it until dawn," says one character nodding. He said the name!</p>
<p>The film is set to release exclusively in cinemas on 25th April.</p>
<p>As for the original game, it received a PS5 and PC remake in October last year and<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-remake-leak-points-to-potential-sequel"> includes a new ending</a> that points towards a possible sequel.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has reportedly set itself up with a supply chain network which will ultimately allow the company to sell in excess of 20m Switch 2 units during the console's first year on the market.</p>
<p>This nugget of information comes from a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/nintendo-to-unveil-next-generation-switch-2-in-april?srnd=undefined">Bloomberg</a> report citing Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Robin Zhu. To put that number into more perspective, Nintendo sold "around 15m" Switch units during its own first four quarters after release, so we are looking at (potentially) a 33 percent increase in sales during those first 12 months.</p>
<p>"Given the hardware segment drove 40 percent of fiscal 2024 top line, a successor to the 2017 Switch could go hand-in-hand with its stronger game pipeline in fiscal 2026, reversing what is expected to be the fourth consecutive year of lackluster sales growth in fiscal 2024," added analyst Nathan Naidu.</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">announcement of the Switch 2</a> has been a long time coming. Over the last two or so years, we have been presented with leaks and reports from what felt like every corner of the internet bar Nintendo itself.</p>
<p>Now, however, the day has finally come for Nintendo's Switch successor to take the spotlight. Along with what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-trailer-appears-to-confirm-joy-con-mouse-functionality">appears to be mouse functionality for its Joy-Cons</a>, Nintendo also teased a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">new Mario Kart game coming to Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>We will hear more about Switch 2 in April, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">Nintendo hosts a Direct for the console</a>. As for when we will be able to get our hands on the hardware, it will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-switch-2-public-hands-on-tour">available to play in London on April 11th to 13th</a>.</p>
<p>If it is still more Switch 2 you want, our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-pictures-switch-2-from-every-angle">Tom has broken down today's teaser so you can enjoy the console from every angle</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
