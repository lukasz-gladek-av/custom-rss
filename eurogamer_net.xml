Fans believe that whatever you pick in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>'s pack opening carousel, you'll get the same cards regardless.
</p>
<p>
That's right: carefully choosing the booster pack you want to open from the game's carousel doesn't matter. 
</p>
<p>
Whether you're looking for a bent corner, crossing your fingers or dropping lots of real-world money on the game versus playing for free, the cards are all the same - and actually pre-determined. Choice is an illusion! 
</p>
<p>
Where's the evidence? Well, YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJhGaOrd1qU">Rustywolf</a> has come up with this convincing video where he shows a script he's authored that sniffs data packets sent by Pokémon TCG Pocket to the game's servers. 
</p>
<p>
Behind the scenes, you can see that pack opening data is determined as soon as a pack is purchased, before the user picks the on-screen booster they want to open or sees any of its cards. 
</p>
<p>
The video below shows this all in action, with card IDs received from the game's server and able to be cross-referenced with the game's card database - revealing the cards you'll get whatever pack you pick before you've even picked it.

        <p>Plus Resistance 1 &amp; 2 and more!</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/13/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-november-grand-theft-auto-v-dying-light-2-stay-human-like-a-dragon-ishin-and-more/">revealed</a> the games coming to PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra subscribers this month, with November's offerings including Dying Light 2, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/like-a-dragon-ishin">Like a Dragon: Ishin</a>!, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA5</a> (presumably for the benefit of the two remaining people who haven't yet played it).
</p>
<p>
In total, November brings 12 new PlayStation Plus catalogue additions for Premium and Extra members, alongside five Premium-exclusive titles - including Insomniac's fondly remembered PS3 shooters <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resistance-fall-man">Resistance: Fall of Man</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resistance-2">Resistance 2</a> - which combine to look like this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Grand Theft Auto 5 (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Dying Light 2: Stay Human (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Like a Dragon: Ishin! (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>MotoGP 24 (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>The Sims 4 Island Living - add-on only (PS4)</li>
<li>Digimon Survive (PS4)</li>
<li>Overcooked! All You Can Eat (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Stick Fight: The Game (PS4)</li>
<li>Clash: Artifacts of Chaos (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Killer Frequency (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Hungry Shark World (PS4)</li>
<li>Chivalry 2 (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Synapse (PSVR2)</li>
<li>Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Blood Omen 2 (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Resistance: Fall of Man </li>
<li>Resistance 2</li>
</ul>
<p>
So while November's Premium and Extra catalogue additions aren't, perhaps, quite as strong as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/octobers-playstation-plus-extra-and-premium-games-include-dead-island-2-dino-crisis">last month's stellar line-up</a>, there's still plenty of amusement to be found. GTA5 needs no introduction, of course, but there's also solid parkour-focused zombie slaying in Dying Light 2, enjoyable historical action as Like a Dragon spins off into the Edo period with Ishin!, and even some chaotic multiplayer medieval hack-and-slashery in the acclaimed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chivalry-2">Chivalry 2</a>.
</p><p>
And that's on top of those Premium tier exclusives, pretty much all good stuff this month. Alongside the first two Resistance games, there's Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain and its sequel - which should stand you in good stead if you been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-enhancements-include-map-compass-and-more">eyeing the upcoming Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1&amp;2 remasters</a> - plus some solid sci-fi shooting with Synapse for PSVR2.
</p>
<p>
All the above joins the PlayStation Plus game catalogue next Tuesday, 19th November, and you'll find more details on what else is on offer in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">full PlayStation Plus guide</a>.
