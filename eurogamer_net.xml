            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> 2 is not being considered by FromSoftware, though the franchise will still continue.</p>
<p>Creator Hidetaki Miyazaki spoke to Japanese outlet <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/interview/1644616.html">Game Watch</a> after this year's PlayStation Awards, for which <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree won the grand award.</p>
<p>When asked about the future of Elden Ring, Miyazaki stated the studio is not considering Elden Ring 2, but that doesn't mean the IP won't be developed further.</p>

<p>He added FromSoftware is working on multiple projects, though did not specify if some form of Elden Ring game is one of them.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, shortly after Elden Ring's release, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-described-as-start-of-a-new-franchise-following-enormous-12m-sales-milestone">phenomenal sales</a> were described as "a fantastic start for the new franchise".</p>
<p>However, despite the critical and commercial success of DLC Shadow of the Erdtree, it seems a direct sequel won't be happening.</p>
<p>So what's next for FromSoftware? At present the studio's plans are underwraps, though now-deleted job listings earlier this year included mention of robot characters, leading to speculation of another Armored Core game.</p>
<p>The company's future is uncertain too, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware">reports Sony is looking to acquire FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa</a>. That <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-acknowledges-takeover-interest-from-sony">takeover interest was acknowledged by Kadokawa</a>, lending it credence.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> raked in over $200m during its first month of launch, according to recent estimates by <a href="https://appmagic.rocks/">AppMagic</a>.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-skyrockets-to-200m-in-first-month/">PocketGamer</a>, the mobile card game managed to reach $208m in gross revenue on 29th November. That's roughly £164m for those of us here in the UK, with that figure being across both the App Store and Google Play.</p>
<p>The report added Pokémon TCG Pocket's average daily player spending was $6.5m during its first month.</p>

<p>The game saw a boost on 22nd November, when it recorded $8.4m thanks to the start of the Fire Pokémon Mass Outbreak event. A comparatively reserved $2.7m was spent in the game on its first day, 30th October, which remains its lowest level of player spending as its success has soared.</p>
<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket reached its highest weekly earnings on its third week post launch, with $51.1m. This declined by three percent the following week, to $49.7m.</p>
<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived at the end of October, and within its first four days reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-off-to-strong-start-reportedly-earns-12m-in-four-days">earned $12.1m</a>. That number of course soon swelled even more, and Pokémon TCG Pocket <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-already-surpassed-120m-since-release">surpassed $120m in total earnings</a> in its first three weeks.</p>

<p>"While the invisible hand of compulsion and in-game spending lingers, Pokémon TCG Pocket benefits from smartly interwoven systems and, crucially, just a darn good underlying card game," our Chris wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-review">Eurogamer's Pokémon TCG Pocket review</a>, awarding the game four out of five stars.</p>
