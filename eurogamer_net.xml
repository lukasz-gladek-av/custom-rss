<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocket Pair has released an update for the creature-catching survival game removing the ability to summon creatures by throwing Pokéball-style Pal Spheres - all as its continues to fight Nintendo and The Pokémon Company's patent infringement lawsuit.
</p>
<p>
As detailed in Palworld's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/4477236636060484669?l=english">brisk v0.3.11 patch notes</a>, Pocket Pal's latest upate means it's no longer possible to summon a captured creature to a specific spot by aiming and throwing a Pal Sphere. Instead, Pals are now summoned directly next to players when Pal Spheres are held out. Additionally, the UI reticle is now only displayed while aiming.
</p>
<p>
Although Pocket Pair hasn't yet provided a reason for these changes, it's perhaps notable the update arrives amid the studio's ongoing legal battle with Nintendo and The Pokémon Company. Nintendo announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">suing Pocket Pair for infringement of "multiple" patents</a> back in September, and it was later confirmed the lawsuit was targeting three patents - primarily relating to the ability to either summon a battle character onto the field or capturing a capture by throwing an object in a specific direction.
</p>
<p>
Pocket Pair has repeatedly rebuffed Nintendo's claims, insisting it would "continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings". There's been no official confirmation today's changes are related, but Eurogamer has contacted Pocket Pair for comment.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, Palworld's development continues, and Pocket Pair has teased the game will have a presence during this week's The Game Awards. "You won’t want to miss it!", the studio wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1866170665101152345">message shared on social media</a>.
