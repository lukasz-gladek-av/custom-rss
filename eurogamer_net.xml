            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> fans are starting to suspect that generative AI cosmetics have been added to Battlefield 6, in spite of previous statements by senior EA staff stating that wouldn't happen.</p>
<p>This controversy stems from a player card sticker included in the Battlefield 6 Windchill Bundle, a package of cosmetics offered this festive season to players of the military FPS. One sticker, called Winter Warning, features an assault rifle with a snowflake background. This assault rifle seems to be quite the futuristic weapon indeed, as it has two barrels attached. Double the fire rate, surely?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1prq9x9/remove_this_ai_shit_from_the_store/">This was spotted by user Willcario on Reddit</a>, who titled their post 'Remove this AI s**t from the store', writing: "Two barrels on the M4A1, sure. I would literally prefer to have no sticker than some low quality AI generated garbage. You can look at BO7 and see how many favors AI generated rewards won with them".</p>

</figure>
<p>This led to a bit of holiday investigation from Battlefield 6 players, who went back through the library of similar cosmetics to try and find additional examples of AI use. There's no smoking gun here, but some did point to another sticker <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ps4ze4/there_are_a_lot_of_things_that_dont_really_pass/">featuring a bear with ten claws as a possible naughty bit of technological tomfoolery</a>. On one paw the bear has four claws, whereas the other paw has five. A bit of perspective magic at work, or the shadow of Sam Altman casting an evil spell on EA? Who can say.</p><p>What's interesting though is that previous statements by senior staff at EA have outright crossed out the possibility of generative AI assets showing up in Battlefield 6. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8xrkxdkkrno">In an interview with BBC News Night</a>, VP general manager at EA DICE Rebecka Coutaz stated that while generative AI was "very seducing" to use, it would only be used in the proprietary stages of game development to " allow more time and more space to be creative". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/holy-fck-guys-were-not-pushing-hard-for-or-replacing-concept-artists-with-ai-larian-ceo-responds-to-genai-backlash">A similar sentiment to Larian's CEO earlier this month</a>, who also got hit by plenty of backlash.</p>
<p>So is this a case where temporary AI assets slipped in, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">has there been a change in AI strategy in the months following EA's move to privatisation</a>, or is this a simple case of artist error. Sometimes I still write in Americanised spelling, so maybe an artist could be on autopilot and draw two barrels on a gun? We don't know.</p>
<p>EA nor any of the Battlefield Studios have responded to these accusations as of writing.</p>

            <p>Do you need a new Pokémon T-shirt? Don't answer that. Could you be convinced to buy a new Pokémon T-shirt if a nice one popped up? Well, prepare yourselves, because trendy Japanese high street clothing company Uniqlo has announced a new Pokémon collab for 2026.</p>
<p>The range is scheduled to arrive late March, according to <a href="https://www.uniqlo.com/eu-at/en/spl/ut/pok%C3%A9mon-ss26">the Uniqlo website</a>, and features seven unique designs - some for adults, some for kids (often differentiated by the base colour of the T-shirt). I think the standout adult design is a blue-ish Snorlax T-shirt with a sleepy character design on the left side of the chest, and the words "Snorlax woke up!" underneath it. Though there's a grey Gengar T-shirt with the character smiling wickedly in the middle of the chest that I can imagine going down well.</p>

</figure>
<p>The best kids' T-shirt, and I don't know why they don't do these in adult sizes, is a sunshine yellow (or Easter yellow - is that a real colour?) Pikachu design. Kids and adults both get a watercolour-style white T-shirt with cute little Bulbasaur, Charmeleon and Squirtle character designs across the middle and the words "I have only 3 left, but you can have one! Choose!" underneath. I think this is a quote from one of the games when you get your Pokémon at the beginning? It could even be the original Pokémon game. I am really stretching my Pokémon knowledge here.</p>

<p>Pokémon turns 30 years old next year - I'll look away while you turn to dust at that realisation - and the official celebration date is 27th February, apparently. But Pokémon arrived a few years later in the west, not touching down in the UK until 1999. I know this because I investigated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-pokemons-arrival-in-the-uk-changed-games-workshop-forever">the story of how Pokémon significantly upset Games Workshop's operations</a> when it did arrive. It's unlikely competition, I know, but it transformed the house of Warhammer's operations forever.</p>
<p>The Uniqlo adult T-Shirts are €19.90, and the kids' T-shirts are €12.90. Maybe see if you can squeeze into one of the smaller ones?</p>
<p>Uniqlo is no stranger to Pokémon collabs. Earlier this year it released an eye-catching and very, perhaps, knowing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/did-uniqlo-know-what-it-was-doing-with-this-pokemon-magikarp-t-shirt-slogan">Magikarp design that referenced the creature being an "expert splasher"</a>.</p>
<p>This year saw the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> on Nintendo Switch - another of the in-between and slightly off-at-a-tangent Pokémon Switch instalments. It was a bit uneven but, overall, Chris Tapsell liked it. "Lumiose City could do with work, but Pokémon Legends: Z-A is a much more tightly focused - and delightfully goofy - return to better form. At least by modern Pokémon's standards," he wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">Pokémon Legends: Z-A review</a>.</p>

            <p>Vince Zampella, co-creator of Call of Duty and legendary studio head, has passed away.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/video-game-developer-vince-zampella-crash-call-of-duty/3819576/">According to a report by NBC4</a>, Vince and a passenger died while driving out of a tunnel in Los Angeles' San Gabriel Mountains. The car collided with a concrete barrier, resulting in a fire. The passenger, ejected from the car during the crash, died at the hospital. Zampella died at the scene.</p>
<p>Zampella, known for a trailblazing career in the video game industry, famously co-founded the Call of Duty franchise. He'd later go on to found <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn Entertainment</a>, the studio behind beloved games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>. Recently, Zampella led the charge on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s development, a game that would go on to make waves in the FPS space this year.</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5TCS-pDmqk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>Following news of his death, many industry professionals have come forward to eulogise Zampella. Stig Asmussen, former game director on the Star Wars Jedi series at Respawn, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stasmussen/">wrote their own farewell on LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>Asmussen wrote: "Truly saddened today. Still processing, like a lot of us. Vince was my friend, and he made me a better person. " Daniel Suarez, senior vice president at Respawn Entertainment, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7408986800335065089/">stated</a>: "The industry has lost a Titan and a Legend. Rest in peace, Vince Zampella. I will forever be in awe of the games you helped create, thankful for the opportunity you gave me at Respawn, and for the friendship and laughs we shared over the years. Words cannot express how much you will be missed."</p><p>Respawn Entertainment itself <a href="https://x.com/Respawn/status/2003243956021195138">released a statement</a> on the matter of Zampella's death. Posting on social media, the company noted: "We're heartbroken by the passing of our founder and dear friend Vince Zampella. Vince was a titan and legend of this industry, a visionary leader and a force who shaped teams and games like Call of Duty, Titanfall, Apex Legends, the Star Wars Jedi series and Battlefield for our community in ways that will be felt for generations.</p>
<p>"His impact reached far beyond any one game or studio. We will remember Vince for how he showed up every day, trusting his teams, encouraging bold ideas, and believing in Respawn &amp; Battlefield. Most importantly, he championed what he believed was right for the people behind those studios and our players because it mattered. We will miss him greatly. Our hearts are with his family, friends, and all who love him."</p>
<p>EA too stepped forward and paid homage to Zampella, <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-vince-zampella-battlefield-boss-and-call-of-duty-co-creator-killed-in-car-crash-2000655216">in a statement provided to Kotaku</a>. The company wrote: "This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince's family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work. Vince's influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching. A friend, colleague, leader and visionary creator, his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers around the world. His legacy will continue to shape how games are made and how players connect for generations to come.</p>
