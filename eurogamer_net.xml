            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> players are still struggling to import their world states despite the issue being flagged to BioWare and EA over a week ago.</p>
<p>Regardless of what platform you're playing on, it seems some players can only see default world states.</p>
<p>EA community manager <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/Dragon-Age-Inquisition/Keep-DA-I-World-State-and-Golden-Nug-Not-Syncing-In-Game/m-p/14240306/highlight/true#M86201">EA_Shepard acknowledged the issue</a> on the official forums 10 days ago, saying the team was "aware and investigating". Shepard also validated another issue, this one with the Golden Nug, which goes AWOL mid-playthrough or disappears entirely for some.</p>

</div><figcaption>Dragon Age The Veilguard Review: The BEST Bioware Has EVER Been! (Spoiler-Free).<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f0BX-JXzek" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Revealing that they "reported this [to the studio] at the end of the week last week and checked up on this", EA_Shepard recently confirmed that it was "still an open issue" and the team "is still working on this one".</p>
<p>The issue has apparently been further compounded by some players getting confused "around the world state importing into their game".</p>
<p>"When you import your world state, it will say default world state. The name does not change," Shepard explained.</p>
<p>"When you want to import a world state, rename it in the Keep first, import it in the Keep, and then start a new game," they added, acknowledging that when they tried it themselves on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X, only one was successfully imported.</p><p>Shepard also confirmed that there "are ways to try to get it resolved by manually choosing the options and creating entirely new world states after you sync and replay the keep", but acknowledged this "has not worked for all players".</p>
<p>Towards the end of the week, Shepard shared a <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/Dragon-Age-Inquisition/Keep-DA-I-World-State-and-Golden-Nug-Not-Syncing-In-Game/m-p/14259708/highlight/true#M86454">further</a> update.</p>
<p>"Wanted to let you know I am still looking out for this one," they said. "I know the whole 'we are working on it' message gets old. Believe me, I get it! There is a lot happening and being worked on with Dragon Age so things are a bit slower on other fronts. I am watching it closely though so I have not forgotten about the community!"</p>
<p>"I get that Veilguard support is prioritised at the moment since it's a brand new game, and Keep has always been kinda buggy, but I think I speak for all of us when I ask that this issue be made more of a priority," <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/Dragon-Age-Inquisition/Keep-DA-I-World-State-and-Golden-Nug-Not-Syncing-In-Game/m-p/14262923/highlight/true#M86492">said</a> one player.</p>
<p>As for Dragon Age: The Veilguard? Eurogamer's Robert Purchese had a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">lot of good things to say about BioWare's latest Dragon Age in his five star review</a>.</p>
<p>"From head to toe, wing to wing, The Veilguard is exquisitely realised and full of sophistication across systems and storytelling," he wrote. "It's warm and welcoming, funny and hopeful, gentle when it needs to be, and of course it's epic - epic in a way I think will set a high bar not only for BioWare in years to come but for role-playing games in general."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>By analysing the hacker's digital footprint, the Japanese megacorp was able to hunt them down.</p>

            <p>Nintendo reportedly hunted down an alleged Switch pirate by tracking their reddit posts.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, after putting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gary-bowser-gets-more-than-three-years-in-jail">Switch pirate Gary Bowser behind bars</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">targeting emulator software Yuzu</a>, Nintendo resumed its fight against the modded console business with new lawsuits, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-war-against-switch-piracy-ramps-up-with-two-fresh-cases">including one against James "Archbox" Williams</a>, who was the main moderator behind r/SwitchPirates.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/how-nintendo-found-archbox-switch">Game File</a>, it seems Williams was located after Nintendo commissioned a law firm to investigate "freeshops" or online repositories for pirated Switch games.</p>

<p>By analysing Williams' past posts online - including one from reddit user "archbox" in 2015 that was very complementary about Midwestern University's optometry clinic - the firm helped the Japanese company "succeed in linking Archbox with at least two Nintendo accounts for an individual named James Williams".</p>
<p>And because Williams seemingly used the same email address to get repairs for their Nintendo Switch, staff at Nintendo's Product Lifecycle Management group was able to find his shipping address.</p>
<p>Once it had acquired Williams' address, Nintendo sent a cease and desist, after which Williams initially agreed to "comply and cooperate" with Nintendo's demands. However, Williams then went dark and failed to show up at court, defaulting judgement in favour of Nintendo.</p>
<p>ICYMI, last week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-streamer-who-said-he-could-broadcast-its-pirated-games-all-day">Nintendo filed a new lawsuit against a streamer who broadcast 10 pirated games ahead of their release</a>, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>.</p>
<p>When Nintendo moved to shutdown streamer Jesse Keighin's streams via copyright notices on YouTube, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, and other streaming platforms, he reportedly told them he "could do this all day" and had "a thousand burner accounts".</p>
<p>Nintendo further alleges that as well as broadcasting unreleased games, he also instructed others on how to obtain pirated games via "circumvention devices" Nintendo calls "trafficking".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ubisoft has responded to yesterday's leak that showcased a selection of free battle pass rewards purportedly set to be available via <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' upcoming Animus Hub.</p>
<p>As Eurogamer reported yesterday, these <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-leak-looks-to-show-free-battle-pass-rewards">leaked Assassin's Creed Shadows images</a> showed a similar selection of items to those previously offered through daily and weekly missions via Ubisoft Connect. That said, Assassin's Creed has never offered a battle pass before, and the publisher is still to announce how any new battle pass system for the franchise will work.</p>

<p>In a message posted today on social media that seemed targeted at those taking a less nuanced response to the idea of Assassin's Creed adding a battle pass, Ubisoft said it wanted to "clarify" the matter.</p>
<p>"All the rewards available in the Animus Hub will be entirely free, there are no paid subscriptions or paid battle pass featured in the Animus Hub, and players will have access to regular content [and] missions at no extra cost," Ubisoft confirmed.</p>
<p>Ubisoft said it would unveil more details "closer to the launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows" in February 2025.</p>

</span></p><p>At a BAFTA event attended by Eurogamer in London earlier this month, franchise boss Marc-Alexis Coté went into more detail on how the series will handle its modern day narrative in future, after admitting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-reflects-on-series-struggle-to-tell-consistent-modern-day-story-after-desmond">it had been a "struggle" to remain consistent since the departure of the series' initial protagonist Desmond</a>.</p>
