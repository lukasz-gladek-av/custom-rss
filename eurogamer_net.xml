            <p>
A week after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair removed the ability for players to glide using Pals in response to Nintendo's ongoing lawsuit, a modder has restored the feature on PC. That's as Pocketpair confirms Palworld's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/terraria">Terraria</a> collaboration will launch this "summer".
</p>
<p>
Pocketpair <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-says-pokemon-lawsuit-will-prompt-more-disappointing-changes-as-it-continues-to-dispute-claims">confirmed it had removed Pal-based gliding from Palworld</a> earlier this month, saying it had been forced to make "yet another compromise" due to Nintendo's ongoing patent infringement claim. Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">launched legal action against the studio last September</a>, saying it was seeking "an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages on the grounds that Palworld... infringes multiple patent rights".
</p>
<p>
Several patents - which Nintendo and The Pokémon Company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/exceedingly-plausible-nintendo-crafted-patent-claims-to-specifically-target-palworld-says-ip-expert">seemingly filed onto pre-existing "parent" patents</a> <em>after</em> the release of Palworld - lie at the heart of the case, all relating to specific gameplay mechanics. These include the ability to capture digital creatures by throwing a catching item and the ability to subsequently ride on them.
</p>
<p>
First signs Pocketpair might be forced to capitulate to Nintendo arrived last December, when the developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">axed the ability to catch Pals by throwing Pokéball-style Pal Spheres</a> in a small update. Then, the ability to glide using Pals was removed earlier this month, with the studio saying the changes - which instead added gliders as a useable inventory item - were "necessary in order to prevent further disruptions" to development.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, one modder has moved to reinstate the gliding feature on PC. As spotted by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/palworld/palworld-mod-brings-back-gliding-feature-removed-by-nintendo-lawsuit-3194320/">Dexerto</a>, Primarinabee's Glider Restoration mod is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/palworld/mods/2454?tab=description">now available via Nexus Mods</a> and specifically designed "for those of you who love flying with your pals." Primarinabee says the mod "uses sleight of hand to reverse the sleight-of-hand 'removal' of gliding pals," but notes player will still  need a glider in their inventory to make it work. "It's not <em>quite</em> perfect," they add, "but it basically reverses Patch 0.5.5 without requiring you to forego future game updates".
</p>
<p>
Despite Nintendo's lawsuit, early access development of Palworld continues, and Pocketpair has now revealed its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-announces-major-update-terraria-crossover-despite-ongoing-legal-issues">previously announced Terraria collaboration</a> will launch for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC this "summer". Dubbed Tides of Terraria, it'll enable players to "catch, train, fight, and work" monsters from developer Re-Logic's hugely popular sandbox action-adventure "just like Pals". Pocketpair is also promising non-Terraria-themed additions in the update, including new Pals and new islands, with more to be shared "over the next few weeks".

            <p>Atlus has teased the next game in its Persona series due for global release, ahead of a livestream later this week.</p>
<p>"Think you dropped this," reads an official social post, with an emoji of an owl.</p>
<p>While some have jumped to the conclusion of a Persona 6 announcement, this is actually news of a full release for mobile game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-the-phantom-x">Persona 5: The Phantom X</a>, following its open beta.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-persona-5-spin-off-game-revealed">The Phantom X was revealed back in 2023</a> and comes courtesy of Chinese developer Perfect World.

<p>The game will feature familiar elements from the base game, but with gacha gameplay.</p>
<p>It follows two previous spin-off games from Persona 5 - hack and slash follow-up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-5-strikers-review-an-impressive-sequel-that-inherits-some-of-the-originals-flaws">Persona 5 Strikers</a> and strategy game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-5-tactica-review-a-welcoming-spin-off-aimed-at-strategy-newcomers">Persona 5 Tactica</a>.</p>

            <p>
Fancy testing FBC: Firebreak this weekend? Control developer Remedy has now opened a sign-up process for its upcoming Control multiplayer spin-off to let you do just that.
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak's first closed technical test will run from this Thursday, 15th May at 2pm UK time to next Monday, 19th May at 10pm UK time. 
</p>
<p>
Remedy will be testing a pre-release version of the game across PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S during this period, and you can register your interest now via the <a href="https://firebreak.firstlook.gg/signup/tech-test-may-2025">developer's website</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Set within Control's mysterious Federal Bureau of Control, and revisiting a number of familiar locations from that game, FBC: Firebreak is a three-player PVE shooter spin-off from Remedy set to launch on 17th June.
</p>
<p>
The past year has seen mixed results for other new shooters, with the success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> but also the failure of Concord. During a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-multiplayer-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-asks-the-question-what-happens-when-the-offices-post-it-notes-fight-back">recent Q&amp;A session attended by Eurogamer</a>, Remedy said it was confident its new offering would find a niche. 
</p>
<p>
"It's not that we are arrogant," said Remedy's Thomas Puha, "but since the inception of this game, we've very carefully thought [about] who the audience is, and that dictates everything from how we built it - such as how easy it should be to get into, how long the sessions are... we are not going to do a game that [feels like] another job."
</p>
<p>
When FBC: Firebreak does arrive, it'll be sold for the comparatively cheap price of £33/$40/€40 and also be available via both Xbox Game Pass (including PC Game Pass) and PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium.
</p>
<p>
Planning to give it a try?

            <p>
Nintendo has revealed a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> firmware option that caps its battery charging at around 90 percent. 
</p>
<p>
The option is designed to ensure the device's battery lasts longer over time, at the expense of obviously leaving the device with slightly less juice.
</p>
<p>
The option can be found in the Switch 2's settings menu, under its System settings option. Here you can toggle on the "Stop Charging Around 90 Percent" option.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Nintendo detailed the feature today via its smartphone Nintendo Today app, and included a video (posted by others on social media, and embedded above) showing the option in action. 
</p>
<p>
The Switch 2's settings menu offers more detail on how the option works, stating that the feature "shortens the amount of time the system can be used while unplugged but can help reduce loss of battery capacity over time. 
</p>
<p>
"Even if turned on," Nintendo continues, "the system may charge to 100 percent to ensure accurate battery-level display".
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 isn't the first device to have this feature, but it is the first time a Nintendo console or handheld has provided such an option. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo has said it expects to sell 15m Switch 2 consoles during the current financial year, once the hotly-anticipated console arrives on 5th June. Speaking to investors last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-predicts-switch-2-will-outsell-its-predecessor-at-launch-despite-demand-exceeding-expectations">Nintendo said this total would see Switch 2 selling at a faster rate than Switch 1</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-sales-forecast-not-affected-by-production-or-tariffs-nintendo-reiterates">had not been constrained by production issues or the threat of higher prices from tariffs</a>.

            <p>
It's been an intriguing 24 hours in the Oblivion Remastered community, after the sighting of a mysterious ghost horse captured fans' imagination and began making headlines. But now, after some scrutiny and deduction, Oblivion players reckon they've figured out what's going on.
</p>
<p>
The story began over the weekend when - wiggly line flashback - user TaricIsNotSupport <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1kk6y0z/uhhhh_guys_is_this_new/">shared an eye-catching discovery on the Oblivion subreddit</a>, curious to know if it was new to the remaster or just something they'd missed before. "So I was crafting stupid spells in Frostcrag Spire [when] I noticed something suuuuuuper strange in the distance," they wrote. "I did as any of us of the right mind would do and B-lined it over there like a maniac. To my amazement [it] was this spectral horse with no name. I have played thousands of hours of the original Oblivion... yet this is the first I have ever seen this horse."
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1kk6y0z/uhhhh_guys_is_this_new/">Uhhhh, guys, is this new?</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TaricIsNotASupport/">u/TaricIsNotASupport</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/">oblivion</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>
All this came with the assurance they were Oblivioning on PlayStation - and thus, it wasn't the result of a mod - and a video showing the aforementioned ghost horse swishing nonchalantly (and translucently) by the side of a cliff. With the community's interest piqued, TaricIsNotSupport <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1kk7rmg/to_the_people_asking_if_i_can_ride_or_interact/">returned with a second post</a>, this time showing their character riding the phantom equine atop snow-covered mountains. "He fast travels and even gets stabled!", they enthusiastically added. "By all accounts it's now my steed!"
</p>
<p>
As you might expect, TaricIsNotSupport's post was greeted with a mixture of skepticism - given the original Oblivion has been pretty well stripped of secrets in the 19 years since its release - and enthusiasm for a new mystery to solve. After all, the possibility developer Virtuos might have squeaked a couple of Easter eggs into its remaster couldn't entirely be dismissed. Some set to work poring over previously accumulated Oblivion knowledge, while others posited - given <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a>' notoriously buggy releases - it was possibly a spell-based glitch.
</p>
<p>
Alas, it now appears the latter is true. After some experimentation, subredditor Famous-Escape-2491 shared the news they'd <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1kl8s6h/spectral_horse_debunk/">managed to replicate the spectral horse effect</a> using a combination of spells. "Looks like it is due to the glitches where spell visual effects are lingering past their expiration," they wrote. "I was able to recreate the visual using 100 percent chameleon, and Command Creature." They also provided a video as proof.
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1kl8s6h/spectral_horse_debunk/">Spectral Horse Debunk</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Famous-Escape-2491/">u/Famous-Escape-2491</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/">oblivion</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>
Famous-Escape-2491 also cautioned against a witch-hunt, noting that rather than being a deliberate wind-up, there was every chance the original poster could "genuinely be unaware" how the spectral steed came to be. "Looking at his posts before that one," they added, "it looks like he plays around with spells - a lot. And considering the weird glitches I've seen, I can't rule out with 100 percent certainty that he may be truthful... I don't want to add to any negativity towards the guy, especially not knowing the specifics of how his scenario occurred."
</p>
<p>
So there you go; Oblivion Remastered's horse ghost is seemingly toast, debunked by community ingenuity and a scientific thirst for answers. If you're feeling a little deflated all this excitement was for nought, Bethesda is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-asks-the-elder-scrolls-fans-to-suggest-oblivion-remastered-improvements-with-difficulty-scaling-among-top-ideas">currently canvassing fans to suggest improvements</a> to its hugely-popular game. So maybe it'll add a real ghost horse if we ask nicely? And if it's <em>more</em> answers you want, you can always <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/oblivion-remastered-tips-tricks-and-guides">check out Eurogamer's Oblivion Remastered guide</a>. 
</p>
<p>
I've asked Bethesda for comment on Oblivion Remastered's ghost horse mystery and will update this story if it replies with anything other than, "LOL".
