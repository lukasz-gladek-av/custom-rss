            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a>'s director has acknowledged the game's controversial nomination for best indie game at The Game Awards 2023, admitting Mintrocket is not an indie studio.</p>
<p>Mintrocket is a subsidiary of South Korean developer and publisher Nexon, but its game was nominated for the Best Independent Game award, ultimately missing out to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-stars">Sea of Stars</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in an interview with Japanese site <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/635/G063598/20250627083/">4gamer</a>, director Hwang Jae-ho stated "there's nothing indie about [Dave the Diver]" considering it was made at Nexon.</p>

<p>"I wonder if people mistook us for an indie studio just because we're developing games as a small team, or just because our art styles and game systems tend to be unique," he said (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/dave-the-diver-director-addresses-controversial-best-indie-game-nomination-from-2023-theres-nothing-indie-about-us-we-didnt-apply-for-it/">Automaton</a>). "For some reason, we also ended up getting nominated for the Best Indie Game award, which caused some people to go, 'Hey, isn't that a Nexon game?', but it's not like we applied for the award ourselves (laughs)."</p>
<p>Nominees for The Game Awards are chosen by an international jury of global game media outlets. As Hwang noted, Nexon therefore had nothing to do with the nomination.</p>
<p>Essentially, the media got it wrong, perhaps due to Mintrocket being considered a small team, or due to the pixel art style.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, ahead of the game's release, Nexon vice president <a href="https://www.gametoc.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=69776">Dae-Hwon Kim stated in an interview</a> Dave the Diver isn't an indie game, despite appearances.</p>
<p>Later, The Game Awards producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> confused matters. "Independent can mean different things to different people, and it's sort of a broad term," he said (as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/keighley-weighs-in-on-debate-over-dave-the-diver-qualifying-for-best-indie-game/">VGC</a>). "You can argue, does independent mean the budget of the game, does independent mean where the source of financing was, does it mean the team size? Is it the kind of independent spirit of the game, meaning a smaller game that's sort of different?"</p>
<p>He then deferred to the 120 global media outlets that voted to determine the interpretation. Now, Hwang is finally ending the debate.</p>
<p>Dave the Diver received widespread critical acclaim and is still receiving updates two years after its release. Its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-delays-in-the-jungle-dlc-but-sure-knows-how-to-soften-the-blow-with-these-other-announcements">In The Jungle DLC starring Godzilla has been delayed into next year</a>, however, after first being revealed in 2024.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-director-finally-ends-indie-debate-after-controversial-the-game-awards-2023-nomination]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Well, here is something I didn't see coming. Quite out of the blue, Rockstar has released an update for Red Dead Online, which boasts four new adventures.</p>
<p>The update is known as Strange Tales of the West, and those four missions are Strange Tales of The Plague, Strange Tales of Modern Science, Strange Tales of The Bayou and Strange Tales of The Wilderness. This update has really come as a surprise: back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-confirms-end-of-major-red-dead-online-support">Rockstar told fans not to expect any further major updates for Red Dead Online</a>. So, what's this we have here now, Rockstar?</p>
<p>Rockstar has also released a new trailer for Red Dead Online's Strange Tales of the West update, which as noted by <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato">SynthPotato</a>, the last time that happened was several years ago, with Blood Money. You can check out the trailer for Strange Tales of the West below. It's listed as volume one, so perhaps there is even more to come down the line.</p>

<p>Along with Rockstar itself, PlayStation also shared the latest Red Dead Online trailer. "Starting to feel like all this marketing is part of something much bigger for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>," mused social media user <a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_">videotechuk_</a>, who also revealed this update comes with a new zombie 'infected' mode.</p>
<p>"It's highly unusual for both Rockstar and PlayStation to come out today to market new Red Dead Online content."</p>
<p>Some are speculating the team is now gearing up for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-next-gen-update-switch-2-port-reports-suggest">that previously rumoured next gen Red Dead Redemption 2 update alongside Switch 2 port</a>. Eurogamer has asked Rockstar for comment on the latest update, and what it all means for the future of the series.</p>
<p>In the meantime, though, fans are just happy to see that Red Dead Online is not, in fact, dead, with plenty of celebratory posts popping up on the likes of reddit.</p>
<p>"Author Theodore Levin can't believe the rumours and missives he's been receiving from the four corners of the American frontier. He's working on an anthology of these unexplained and weird phenomena and he needs your help investigating the wildest claims that cross his desk," reads the blurb for Strange Tales of the West, <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/o327292o933k29/strange-tales-of-the-west-emerge-in-red-dead-online">as shared by Rockstar</a>.</p>
<p>"Strange Tales of the West will require steely resolve and courage in the face of the odd, twisted, and downright supernatural. Embark upon these four new Telegram Missions by picking up Mr. Levin's letter at any Post Office or from your Camp's Lockbox, then opening it via your Satchel or launching Telegram Missions from your Player Menu."</p>

        <p>Got a loisonce for that Starfield Mod, guvnor?</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Nexus Mods is implementing sweeping changes to the website in order to follow UK and EU laws. These changes include an age verification check for EU and UK users, which will be coming in the near future.</p>
<p>In addition, Nexus Mods will be taking steps to remove "illegal content" from the website, to protect children as demanded in the UK's Online Safety Act. A new tag system for adult content will be implemented, including pornographic, suicide, and depressions.</p>
<p>The Nexus Mods team is also overhauling the website's blocking system. Users can now "Ignore" other users, which replaced the old Block Author function. People you block won't be able to comment or otherwise interact with the media you post. Finally, any images featuring pornographic content can only be shared using the supporter tier of the website's media share feature.</p>

<p>At the end of the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15319">official post announcing these changes</a>, the Nexus Mods team stated they "are not optional for us. They are part of complying with legislation, and we are committed to keeping our platform safe for everyone."</p>
<p>The previous owner - Dark0ne - hopped into the comments to support the new team in charge in light of these changes. He wrote: "We did not write these laws, we have no control over these laws. Nexus Mods is not an underground website operating on the dark web - it's a legitimate business that has to follow the laws of the countries it operates in. If we don't follow these new laws then we will get fined out of existence (the fine in the UK alone is 10 percent of worldwide revenue or £18m ($25m USD) - whichever is higher)."</p>
<p>Dark0ne continued: "Whoever owned Nexus Mods, whether it was still me or the new ownership, would have had to have dealt with it this year no matter what. Frankly, I'm relieved that it is not me who has to deal with this or be responsible for the content on the site directly because I have some big misgivings about how it is being enforced. However, if it was me, I would still have followed the letter of the law, and I'd have been doing what is written above. Because I'd have to."</p>
<p>Let's take a look at these two pieces of legislation Nexus Mods is citing as the force pushing these changes. The <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2025-0043/">UK's Online Safety Act</a> essentially is an online content moderation bill forcing platforms to take steps to stop kids from seeing adult or illegal content.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer">UK's Department of Science, Innovation, and Technology online safety bill explainer</a>: "The Act will give providers new duties to implement systems and processes to reduce risks their services are used for illegal activity, and to take down illegal content when it does appear."</p>
<p>The UK law places emphasis on protecting kids and the removal of CSAM (child sexual abuse material), "content that amounts to terrorism", assisting-suicide, and equally dire content.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Services_Act">EU's Digital Services Act</a> is focused largely on "illegal content", essentially demanding all large platforms take steps to remove such harmful content or risk hefty fines.</p>
<p>This sort of content was already not allowed on Nexus Mods, but the terms and services are being updated to make the guidelines absolutely clear, so mod creators can understand what's allowed under UK law.</p>
<p>Community reaction to these changes are mixed. Some are coming from a place of understanding, noting Nexus Mods can't really do much about legislation impacting large websites. Others are welcoming the changes, happy the website will be scoured from illegal content and younger audiences will be protected.</p>
<p>There are, however, plenty of people anxious about how age verification will work. A lot of the future changes coming to Nexus Mods are still vague, due in large part to the team still in the process of figuring them out. Age verification <em>is </em>coming, but in what form? Is it going to be a standard "are you 18?" check box, something which would protect Nexus Mods but all kids will just lie through, or will it request some form of evidence to prove one's age?</p>
<p>If it's the latter, how will this data be protected? It's all a messy soupy problem Nexus Mods will have to fix. It's a real optics roadbump for Nexus Mods, given this sweeping change to content moderation and age verification comes only a few weeks after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/end-of-an-era-nexus-mods-has-been-sold-to-an-unknown-party-after-24-years">Nexus Mods changed ownership to growth-focused company Chosen</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/nexus-mods-is-getting-age-verification-for-uk-and-eu-users-weeks-after-changing-owners]]></content:encoded>
