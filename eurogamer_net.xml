            <p>
Space can be a lonely place, what with it being - as a wise man once famously put it - so vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big and all. Which is where <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> new Voyagers update comes in. Now, those long treks across the infinite expanse needn't be quite so lonely thanks to the introduction of multi-crew space ships you can build, pilot, and stroll around with friends.
</p>
<p>
Customisable ships - not to be confused with No Man's Sky's existing customisable freighters, which essentially serve as gargantuan deep space bases - have been at the top of many a fan's wishlist for quite some time. And today's Voyagers update look to deliver and then some. After progressing to a certain point in the story, players gain access to a hangar-like workshop where new Corvette spaceships can be engineered both outside and within. Customisable components include hulls, wings, landing gear, engine parts, thrusters, and weapons, and all can be arranged to suit players' whims.
</p>
<p>
And then there's the habitable interior. "Add sleeping quarters," developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hello-games">Hello Games</a> explains, "and you are ready to welcome a crew of friends on board. Add a mission radar and you are ready for adventure. A teleporter and you have an away team." There's also talk of med-bays and war rooms, or you can just add a window and watch the universe go by. And for thrillseekers, it's even possible to flip open the Corvette's airlock and go for a space walk together or, once within a planet's atmosphere, sky dive to the ground.

<p>
While newcomers to No Man's Sky won't have immediate access to Corvette construction given its unlock requirements, they'll still be able to experience the feature in a brand-new limited-time Expedition. Alongside the usual array of cosmetic rewards, this'll also unlock some ship parts players might find useful when trying to build their own vehicles in the core sim.
</p><p>
Hello Games says it's had to rework "almost every part" of No Man's Sky to accommodate Corvettes and their relative spaces, and to ensure crews can still roam their ship's corridors and continue editing during the likes of warp jumps and planetary approaches. Much of the tech, it says, is shared with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-studio-unveils-procedural-fantasy-planet-adventure-light-no-fire">upcoming Light No Fire</a>, which will feature vast oceans players can similarly explore together on a single boat. This isn't the first time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-borrows-some-of-light-no-fires-fancy-tech-for-a-planetary-overhaul-in-latest-update">No Man's Sky has adopted technology implemented for Hello Games' Earth-sized planet sim</a>.
</p>
<p>
And it sounds like Hello Games is still far from done. "The most exciting thing about Voyagers for me," writes Hello Games' boss Sean Murray, "is the possibilities it opens in the future for No Man's Sky, and I can't wait to see where the team takes it from here."

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> publisher Paradox appears to be rethinking its plan to charge for two of the six playable clans in the game.</p>
<p>Community developer DebbieElla told the Bloodlines 2 Discord community last night (spotted by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-chinese-room-will-make-adjustments-after-feedback-about-locking-2-clans-behind-day-one-dlc-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2.1281309/">ResetEra</a>): "We are listening to your feedback about the Lasombra and Toreador clan access, and we're making adjustments ahead of launch to reflect this. We will share more information about what this means as soon as possible."</p>
<p>The comment comes a week after Paradox announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-all-these-years-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-gets-an-actual-proper-release-date">the release date for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>, which is 21st October, along with pricing details for the game. It was then we learned the companies intended to charge £20 extra to access two clans in the game, via a Shadows and Silk content pack.</p>
<p>The Shadows and Silk pack can be bought alone for £18.69/€22/$22, or as part of a Premium Edition for £75/€90/$90, which also includes a cosmetic-focused Santa Monica Memories pack. For reference, the Standard Edition of the game costs £50/€60/$60.</p>

<p>At a glance, this might not seem untoward. Plenty of games sell additional content at launch and bundle it with premium editions of a game. The base price of Bloodlines 2 even appears to have been adjusted because of it, so it's cheaper than other full-priced games. But the problem comes from the content being charged for itself: the clans.</p><p>The clans in Bloodlines 2 are a core part of the game. Choosing one is equivalent to choosing your character class and therefore the playstyle you're opting for. Clans also determine the storied group you belong to in the world and give you access to different clothing options and clan-specific non-player characters. Clans are not superfluous, cosmetic content.</p>
<p>What's more, the locked Toreador and Lasombra clans are highly desirable. Toreador are a clan built around the iconic archetype of vampires as seductive, sexy beings, and come fitted with the power to enthrall their prey by, yes, kissing them. Lasombra, on the other hand, do their work in the shadows, and can manipulate shadows to tangle and hold enemies and teleport themselves. I tried both clans briefly in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-action-than-rpg-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-struggles-to-convince-after-a-few-hours-play">the Bloodlines 2 preview build I played</a> and enjoyed them, especially Lasombra.</p>

<p>Important caveat: you can access powers from another clan in Bloodlines 2, so you're not locked to only doing things your clan offers. Every time you gain a higher tier of power, you'll see other powers listed to the left and right of them that belong to other clans. You can unlock them but doing so is costly and complicated. You need to pay a higher skill-point cost for them as well as a price related to other 'currencies' in the game, which are usually earned by drinking special types of blood, and you need to find certain NPCs to teach these powers to you.</p>
<p>It's a faff, in other words, so it's more likely your experience of Bloodlines 2 will be unlocking your clan-specific powers first before branching into other clan's abilities. Your clan choice, therefore, is an important one, and so the decision to paywall access to a third of them is notable.</p><p>The justification for doing it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-chinese-room-defend-bloodlines-2s-paywalled-vampire-clans-we-have-been-expanding-it-from-where-we-originally-planned-to-land-it">as relayed by developer The Chinese Room to Rock Paper Shotgun at Gamescom</a>, was these two clans represented content developed beyond what was originally planned for the game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-chinese-room-is-developing-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">The Chinese Room inherited development of Bloodlines 2 </a>from Hardsuit Labs, remember - it didn't originate it. So The Chinese Room's reasoning was this was additional content developed for the game, so it would sell it as such at release. But if the content is developed during a game's main development period, is it really additional? And if it appears alongside other content in the game, only with a padlock over it, is it really additive or withheld?</p>
<p>Portioning off parts of a game to be sold around release is nothing new. Paradox itself has a track record of leveraging paid-for downloadable content as a significant source of income for games it makes. It was expected, to a degree, here. But Paradox has chosen the wrong approach. Carving off core gameplay will never be an acceptable proposition, and its decision has tainted the upcoming arrival of an excruciatingly long-awaited game. Here's hoping the "adjustments" being considered will turn this situation around.</p>
