            <p>The latest UK charts for physical video game sales are here. This week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach has - perhaps unsurprisingly - taken the top spot, according to data for the week ending 28th June. This has seen Kojima Production's cinematic and widely praised release bump <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> down a place, to number two.</p>
<p>While Death Stranding 2 was indeed the top selling game last week physically, according to The Game Business' <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1939386768211509434">Chris Dring</a> these debut sales were 66 percent lower than that of the original Death Stranding game. This is largely due to the current market being more digital-focused.</p>
<p>To compare further, Dring stated Death Stranding 2's physical sales were 33 percent lower than fellow PS5 exclusive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> had on its release. Of course, the two games are clearly targeted at quite different audiences.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The developer behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/a-short-hike">A Short Hike</a> has shelved development on an RPG but is releasing it as a demo, allowing players to enjoy it nonetheless.</p>
<p>Adam "adamgryu" Robinson-Yu started Untitled Paper RPG back in 2016, saying, "I was nostalgic for the old style of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/paper-mario">Paper Mario</a> and thought - well, I make games, why not try making the game I want to see? I started cooking something up in Unity and… it looked cool! I thought, maybe I really could make this game."</p>
<p>Now, almost 10 years later, Robinson-Yu said they felt "overwhelmed", adding "the scope felt too big, I didn't have a story", doubts crept in about the turn-based combat, and "in general, started to lose the joy that I felt working on it".</p>

<p>"After releasing A Short Hike and working on the subsequent updates and ports… I didn't really want to go back to this game?" Robinson-Yu admitted. "The development for the RPG had become difficult, which was why I took a break from it in the first place. I might return to this project someday, but I've been working on other things and don't see myself making time for this RPG in near future."</p>
<p>Consequently, if you pop on over to the <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/paper-game#download">official website</a>, you can download a demo with one to two hours of content for both PC and Mac.</p>
<p>"Some people still ask about this game! I figured maybe sharing the demo is better than nothing," Robinson-Yu added, explaining why it's been released as a demo. "There is 1-2 hours of gameplay in the current build, after all. There's some stuff in there that I'm proud of, even if there's also some stuff that I find embarrassing! Hope you enjoy taking a peek behind the curtain at a game partway through an aimless development."</p>
<p>"Just finished a few minutes ago," said one player in the comments. "This was a wonderful demo. I had a gut feeling you wouldn't go back to this, but I never expected you'd actually drop a demo of what you have put together. It already has so much of the personality, humour, attention to detail and innate Nintendo-esque playfulness that defined your work on A Short Hike - and this was first!</p>
<p>"Thank you for taking the big leap of putting this out there!"</p>
<p>As for what else Robinson-Yu has planned? That includes an action aventure game, a "micro-RPG with a claymation asethetic", and an online platforming roguelike.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/a-short-hike-dev-halts-work-on-unfinished-rpg-saying-i-might-never-finish-this-so-im-releasing-the-demo]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Void Interactive has confirmed the console port of its violent shooter, Ready or Not, has been changed "as absolutely required by our first party partners", including tweaks to dismemberment/gore, nudity, mistreatment of children, and "explicit representations of violence". And in some instances, these changes may be applied to the PC version, too.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1144200/announcements/detail/526472884483260568">update</a> posted to Steam, the team said that after some changes, the game secured a PEGI 18 / USK 18 / ESRB M-rating, and was "fortunate enough [...] to pass certification for the launch on our first submission". Void was now "relieved" to be finished with the console launch certification process and says any changes made "remain faithful to the original tonality of the game".</p>

<p>"Maintaining multiple versions of the game with different assets and system mechanics increases the likelihood of bugs to occur in future updates, and subsequent challenges keeping the game updated across multiple versions," the team explained, justifying why it's had to tweak the PC version, too. "Think lighting or optimisation issues, for example (or any number of unexpected bugs from maintaining different versions).</p>
<p>"If the in-game assets were not the same, it would make crossplay unusable; the game content must be equal or basically equal for multiplayer to work. Different versions of assets affects multiplayer replication, which is the ability for the server to understand what’s happening in-game and host players in the same lobby/server."</p>
<p>Player-induced dismemberment "still has a large presence" in the game, "but is a little more limited as to when it occurs", and you can't, for example, keep dismembering an enemy once it's dead. Tangentially, character art "involving torture were turned down slightly to be less over-the-top". The team has also had to "cover up" some characters "a bit more".</p>
<p>"Although we already make a substantial effort to present mistreatment against children in the game in a responsible way, we made slight thematic expansions of this philosophy in order to better meet certification standards," the team explained when it came to violence against children. "For example, the child on Twisted Nerve has had an animation change to be unconscious/sleeping, instead of the previously convulsive animation from before that had a violent appearance.</p>
<p>"The changes with the console version are small enough that most people here wouldn't notice if we didn't say anything, but we want to be transparent. It's largely just evidence and nudity that's altered, and the texture changes don't affect the PC version." In-game evidence of "illicit child stuff" has also been censored, but only in the console version.</p>
<p>Some fans have responded to the changes by review-bombing the game on Steam, citing "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052063771/recommended/1144200">cowardly</a>" "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199497107322/recommended/1144200/">censorship</a>".</p>
<p>Ready or Not will release for consoles on 15th July, 2025.</p>
<p>Void Interactive lost the publisher for Ready or Not days after it confirmed the game would include a school shooting mission. The game was released in early access on 17th December, but in a statement on Twitter shortly afterwards, Void Interactive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/swat-game-loses-publisher-following-school-shooting-comments">said it had parted ways with publisher Team17</a>.</p>
<p>Though no reasons were given at the time, the change came shortly after a developer responded to a Reddit post about including a school shooting with the statement: "You better believe it's gonna". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tactical-fps-ready-or-not-returns-to-steam-after-a-trademark-dispute">Ready or Not was also briefly taken offline in 2022 following a trademark dispute.</a></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ready-or-not-adjusts-in-game-violence-and-nudity-on-pc-to-secure-ps5-and-xbox-release]]></content:encoded>
