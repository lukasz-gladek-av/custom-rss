            <p>Mob Entertainment has announced that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/poppy-playtime">Poppy Playtime</a> Chapter 4 will be making its unsettling way onto consoles later this month.</p>
<p>The latest chapter in the series is set for release on Nintendo Switch, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10012036">PlayStation</a> and Xbox on 25th June. It will retail for $19.99, the PR has said. I have asked for clarification on its UK pricing, though the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/poppy-playtime-chapter-4/9n31k5cww4k8">Microsoft Store here in Blighty</a> has it listed for £16.74, so assume this will be the same on other platforms.</p>
<p>"Brace yourself for the darkest chapter yet in the epic Poppy Playtime saga," reads the official blurb, adding that players will be "pushed deeper into the undiscovered depths of the Playtime Co. factory, far below anything the world knew". You can check out a trailer for Poppy Playtime Chapter 4 below.</p>

<p>The latest chapter in the Poppy Playtime series promises players "terrifying" new threats, along with "shocking" revelations.</p>
<p>"Can you outwit the unnatural new creations lurking in the shadows? Can you survive here long enough to eventually unravel the mysteries behind the experiments? Every step will test your courage, every puzzle will challenge your mind, and every corner may be your last," the studio teases.</p>
<p>Poppy Playtime Chapter 4 previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-chapter-4-release-announced-for-pc">arrived on PC back in January of this year</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in May of last year, the studio announced a Poppy Playtime film adaptation was in the works with Legendary Entertainment and Angry Films.</p>
<p>"When we first started this journey, we followed our passion and created a series of games and brands with the purpose of inspiring and entertaining. We've always dreamed big and are thrilled to have created something that has captured the hearts of tens of millions around the world," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-the-cult-horror-game-is-getting-a-film-adaptation">Mob Entertainment co-founders Zach Belanger and Seth Belanger said at the time</a>.</p>
<p>"This movie deal is a great logical next step in the growth of our transmedia entertainment company."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> has received an update that offers visual improvements when played on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a>, a nice bonus for fans who want to pick up and play the RPG on the new console.</p>
<p>These improvements include graphic enhancements such as new shadow and reflection efforts, as well as an extension to the distance objects are rendered at. For example, you can now see a forest off into the distance clearly, whereas before it may have looked like a low-poly blur of green shrubbery.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/patchnote/ver_1_3_0/">In the official update blog post uploaded to the games' official website</a>, we see that exact example in a side-by-side comparison, as well as a pair of screenshots showing water effects on the Switch vs the Switch 2. Water now has lovely reflections of light on it. A little thing for some, but a little boost for those willing to make the leap to a new console, cosy RPG in hand.</p>

<p>Other features of this update include an automatic lock-on feature that should make combat a little easier, as well as an adjustment to the Hagram build feature allowing players to press the cancel button and return a moved object to its original position.</p>
<p>God's Touch was adjusted too! It can now be cancelled by attacking or dodging, plus the button assigned to activating God's Touch has been relocated on the game pad. Game pad users also have an increased selection of key configurations, and all players can benefit from a new depth of field graphical option.</p>
<p>For those unaware, Fantasy Life i; The Girl Who Steals Time is a very popular RPG that got off to an outstanding start,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-hits-500000-sales-in-three-days"> selling 500,000 copies in just three days</a>.

            <p>The PlayStation published <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> made its way onto PC last night, and has got off to a very good start indeed.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?compare=1151640,1659420,1817070,1817190,1888930,2322010,2531310,2561580,2651280,3489700">SteamDB</a>, Stellar Blade has already welcomed a peak player count of 99,980, less than 24 hours since its release on PC. This means it currently has the highest peak concurrent player count for a PlayStation published single player game on the platform.</p>
<p>To compare, Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered has a peak player count of 66,436, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Complete Edition has a peak of 56,557.

<p>As for what players are saying, right now Stellar Blade is sitting quite happily with an "overwhelmingly positive" Steam review average. "In a world full of unoptimised slop it really is great to see a game run so smoothly," reads one such review.</p>
<p>So, yes, things are going well for Stellar Blade's PC release. Back in February of this year, Shift Up stated in a financial report it expects <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-pc-sales-expected-to-exceed-console-says-shift-up">the PC version to exceed console sales</a>.</p>
<p>"In the AAA game market, PC devices have a higher market share than consoles, so we expect the performance of the PC version to exceed that of the console version," the company said at the time. "We are particularly observing trends such as the significant expansion of the single-player action game market in the Asian gaming industry."</p>

<p>Not sure if the game is for you? In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">Eurogamer's original Stellar Blade review</a> we noted it "has a fair bit of weirdness", but " its killer tunes and vibey, flow-state combat - plus a transformative hard mode - are enough to leave you entranced".
