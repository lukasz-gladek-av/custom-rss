            <p>Amazon has released the first official image of Sophie Turner as Lara Croft, ahead of the release of its Tomb Raider TV series.</p>
<p>The wardrobe check image, which you can see yourself below, shows Turner in an outfit very reminiscent of classic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider games</a>. She's got the pistols, the shorts, everything you'd expect from a (hopefully) faithful adaptation of the video game series.</p>

<p>Set to release on Amazon Prime, the show hasn't got an official release date as of writing. We do, however, know about various casting decisions for the show ahead of a proper trailer release. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-traitors-celia-imrie-and-more-announced-for-amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Celia Imrie, Jason Isaacs, Sagourney Weaver and more have been confirmed for various roles</a> alongside the Game of Thrones star.</p><p>We also know that the show will inter-connect with the narrative present in the Tomb Raider games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-adaptation-will-reinvent-the-franchise-and-interconnect-with-the-games">rather than being a standalone project or a continuation of the Angelina Jolie movies</a>. This tidbit comes from Story Kitchen, a production company working on the series.</p>

            <p>Are you excited for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> and Xbox Series X/S? If you haven't already tried out the demo to see how it'll run on both platforms, then a new update from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> might get you even more hyped for the adventures of Cloud and co. on non-PlayStation and PC platforms. The publisher has announced that next Thursday, 22nd January, 2026, a patch for the PS5 and PC versions will launch that will update existing versions of the game will all the bells and whistles coming to the new platform versions of the game. Per <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/2011740264772305213">a tweet</a> from the company, this new patch introduces "Streamlined Progression, including the ability to keep HP and MP topped up", and the option to "always hit for 9,999 damage". Boosters include the option to toggle HP full, MP full, Limit gauge full, and maximum damage dealt - all of which can be turned on and off individually or as a set.</p>
<p>If you wanted to blast through the story again to enjoy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-final-fantasy-7-interview-part-3-hamaguchi">all the differences</a> from the original game before the launch of Part 3 (which, I imagine, we'll get <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-story-completed-producer-very-satisfied-as-development-continues-without-delay">an update about</a> sooner rather than later), this will make a replay pretty effortless. It remains to be seen whether these 'boosters' (as similar mechanics are called in older remasters in the Final Fantasy canon) will affect trophy unlocks on the PS5 version - if they don't, well, it'll make Platinum clean-ups easier for those of us that care about that kind of thing.</p>
<p>"I feel that the way people enjoy content has become more flexible these days, as we see with video streaming platforms, and that people also want the same thing from games, with options to tailor the experience based on the time they have and their levels of interest," said director Naoki Hamaguchi in a previous message about these updates. "I have also had personal experiences where I wanted to play something with the limited time I have but gave up because of the time it takes to level up characters or traverse the game.</p>
<p>"That’s exactly why I think that the Streamlined Progression feature is very effective - to give players smooth access to the story."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remakes-progression-helping-boosts-arent-exclusive-to-switch-2-and-xbox-will-also-arrive-via-patch-for-ps5-and-pc">We already knew</a> that this update was coming to the PS5/PC versions of the game, we just didn't know when. It's nice that Square Enix is ensuring parity with the new versions of the title, and not just leaving pre-existing customers to linger in anticipation as Switch and Xbox users get all the fun new bells and whistles.</p><p>Square Enix has confirmed the whole trilogy will be coming to Xbox and Switch 2, as well as PlayStation 5 and PC. So if you wanted to start your journey into Midgar with a bang, the publisher has you covered. Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> has hinted that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-producer-hints-at-possible-switch-2-version">the latest title in the series may also be headed to Switch2</a> soon.</p>

            <p>Over a thousand games from a single developer have been suddenly removed from the PlayStation store in what appears to be a massive move by Sony to shift shovelware games off the PS5 and PS5 store.</p>
<p>The developer in question was ThiGames, which prior to the wipe yesterday was the fourth highest ranked developer on the PlayStation Store in terms of quantity. <a href="https://x.com/robthanatos/status/2011487254724952207">According to RobThanatos who first spotted the change</a>, all of ThiGames released games have been totally removed from the store. The only exception being trophies tied to these titles, which remain present to those who unlocked them.</p>
<p>As of writing, there has been no statement from either Sony or ThiGames as to why this widespread removal of games has happened. It is, however, worth noting that ThiGames is known for games of a particular quality. Take The Jumping Fries, in which you play fries and jump around. See also The Jumping Taco, The Jumping Hot Dog, The Jumping Soda, and The Jumping Taco TURBO. Eat your heart out, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-2">Street Fighter 2</a>.</p>

<p>As for why these games had a playerbase? Well, if you refer to the video above you'll find a full platinum trophy guide for The Jumping Taco TURBO. You may notice that the video is 95 seconds in length. That is because the trophy lists attached to these games are incredibly simple, in The Jumping Taco's case a collection of 'Jump x times' milestones. As such, these games (now removed) were valuable to those keen to inflate their PlayStation trophy collection.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-quietly-removes-slop-shovelware-ps5-games-following-investigation">This is not the first time Sony has removed shovelware games from its PS5 store</a>. Roughly a year ago, the company took action against Randomspin. That developer was suspected of using AI and/or recycled assets, and was quietly removed. It too was releasing a massive number of games within a relatively short period of time, much like ThiGames.</p>
<p>Would you be happy to see similar action taken by Sony on other developers on the PlayStation Store? Let us know below!</p>
