Until Dawn remake studio Ballistic Moon has reportedly "effectively closed", amid claims only a handful of employees "at most" remain - none of them developers.
</p>
<p>
Ballistic Moon, which is based in the UK, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-remake-studio-ballistic-moon-lays-off-staff-ahead-of-the-games-release-in-october">confirmed a round of redundancies last year</a>, saying it had made the "tough decision to significantly scale down our team to secure the future of our studio." However, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-effectively-closed/">new report by Insider Gaming</a> claims the studio quietly made a second round of redundancies toward the end of last year.
</p>
<p>
According to the publication's sources, roughly 40 employees were let go in October, with remaining staff kept on to provide post-launch support for Ballistic's Until Dawn remake. However, it's claimed these developers - equating to around 20 employees - lost their jobs in December, leaving only the studio's founders and "possibly" a handful of employees "at most". Reportedly, Ballistic's entire PR, marketing, and development teams are now gone.

<p>
"People are sharing bugs they've found in the game to make the team aware," a source told the publication, "but there is no one working on patch support for the game anymore."
</p>
<p>
Insider Gaming claims the job losses follow unsuccessful attempts by Ballistic's founders to pitch new projects, secure funding, and keep things "moving forward". It's also said discussions were had with Sony to secure funding for additional Until Dawn updates, possibly even another game, but they never reached fruition. Eurogamer has reached out to Ballistic for comment.
</p>
<p>
Word of additional redundancies at Ballistic comes as job cuts and studio closures continue across the games industry. February alone saw the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and Warner Bros. Games San Diego shut their doors</a>, with layoffs also confirmed at Marvel Rivals' US development team, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/callisto-protocol-studio-confirms-layoffs-as-former-employee-claims-most-of-the-devs-affected">The Callisto Protocol developer Striking Distance</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surgeon-simulator-developer-suffers-more-layoffs-says-it-will-scale-back-operations">Surgeon Simulator studio Bossa Games</a>. This week has also seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-layoffs-at-playstation-following-live-service-cancellations">further job losses at PlayStation</a> following the cancellation of multiple live-service games, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/still-wakes-the-deep-publisher-confirms-small-number-of-layoffs-as-its-sold-to-investment-firm">Still Wakes the Deep publisher Secret Mode confirmed a "small number" of layoffs</a>, following its sale to an investment firm.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> boss Neil Druckmann has cast doubt on the possibility of third The Last of Us game, telling fans, "Don't bet on there being more."
</p>
<p>
Fans have been dreaming of a potential third entry in the series ever since the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-a-gut-wrenching-sequel">release of The Last of Us Part 2 in 2020</a>. And while Naughty Dog and Sony have managed to remaster both the original The Last of Us (for a second time) and The Last of Us Part 2 since then, there's been no concrete word of a third series instalment.
</p>
<p>
Which isn't to say Naughty Dog has been entirely quiet on the matter. Back in 2021, Druckmann <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-3-has-a-story-outline-neil-druckmann-hopes-will-one-day-see-the-light-of-day">confirmed he'd penned a story outline for a potential The Last of Us Part 3</a> and admitted there'd been "quite a bit" discussion about a sequel. He <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-moving-on-from-uncharted-open-to-the-last-of-us-part-3-if-it-has-a-compelling-story">addressed a possible third series entry again</a> in 2023 - while Naughty Dog's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">now-canned The Last of Us multiplayer game</a> was still in the works - saying he was open to it, but only if the team could come up with a "compelling story".

<p>
And if that wasn't enough, Druckmann <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-3-could-be-one-more-chapter-to-this-story-says-co-creator-druckmann">returned to the subject of The Last of Us Part 3 again last year</a>, explaining that while he'd struggled to come up with a worthwhile concept for the game previously, "recently that's changed". And just to hammer home the point, he added, "So it does feel like there's probably one more chapter to this story."
</p>
<p>
All of which is to say that Druckmann's left enough of a breadcrumb trail over the last few years, that The Last of Us Part 3 feels like it might be closer to happening than not. And even though Naughty Dog is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">currently full steam ahead on its single-player sci-fi game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, the studio's previous confirmation it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-neil-druckmann-says">had "multiple single-player projects" in the works</a> still left room for hope.
</p>
<p>
In a new <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/">interview with Variety</a>, however, Druckmann has cast doubt on a possible The Last of Us Part 3. When asked about a potential third game, he replied, "I guess the only thing I would say is don't bet on there being more of Last of Us. This could be it."
</p>
<p>
It's unclear why Druckmann is suddenly less keen to fan the flames of speculation where a third The Last of Us title is concerned, but even if another game never happens, there's still new The Last of Us material on the way. HBO's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbos-the-last-of-us-wins-eight-emmys-including-outstanding-guest-actor-for-nick-offermans-bill">critically acclaimed TV show</a> returns for a second season soon, and it'll begin adapting the events of the second game. However, Druckmann and show runner Craig Mazin previously confirmed the series will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-discusses-series-overall-length">likely take two or three seasons to cover all of The Last of Us Part 2</a>, and it's already clear plenty of new material will be in there.
</p>
<p>
Recent season two casting news, for instance, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-additions-reveal-how-show-is-expanding-upon-the-game">suggested the show will be more explicitly tackling events only mentioned in passing during the second game</a>. And, of course, even if Naughty Dog never gets around to making The Last of Us Part 3, that doesn't mean Druckmann's story treatment for post-Part 2 couldn't eventually make it to the small screen.
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us season two runs for seven episodes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">starting on 13th April in the US</a>. And as for Naughty Dog's Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, there's no hint of a release date for that yet.
