            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/after-switch-2-design-leaks-nintendo-keen-to-announce-console-as-soon-as-possible-analyst<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Nintendo will have been watching the recent stream of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> design leaks and is likely now keen to unveil its under-wraps new console as soon as possible, an analyst has said.
</p>
<p>
We've had a fair idea what Switch 2 will look like for a while - at least since a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">prototype console shell and internal components surfaced online in late September</a>. But recent weeks have seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/latest-switch-2-leaks-appear-legitimate-according-to-new-report">further images posted</a>, this time by accessory companies <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">now taking orders for Switch 2 add-ons</a>, which show <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-accessory-maker-pulls-trailer-showing-blurry-mockup-of-nintendos-next-console-design">close estimations for Nintendo's next console</a> in greater detail.
</p>
<p>
In other words, it's now widely expected that Switch 2 will simply look like a slightly larger Switch 1, now with magnetic Joy-Con attachments and an additional button below Home on the right Joy-Con.
</p>
<p>
So, when will Nintendo finally unveil Switch 2? In early November, industry analyst Serkan Toto, CEO of Japanese game industry consultancy Kantan Games, told Eurogamer that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-now-very-unlikely-before-2025-analyst-says">the company had now run out of time to reveal its Switch successor in 2024</a>.
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">Nintendo has set itself a deadline of 31st March 2025</a> to show off its Switch successor, but, considering the leaks, and the falling sales of Switch 1, Toto suggested to Eurogamer today that the company was unlikely to wait that long. 
</p>
<p>
"Nintendo will not have much time in January, so a potential announcement early in the month could make sense," Toto said. "You can bet that Nintendo is aware of all the leaks and not happy about them, even if some of them will turn out to be made up. 
</p>
<p>
"It is actually getting so bad with those leaks that they might cause Nintendo to release information earlier than planned."
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 is widely expected to arrive later in 2025, and while Nintendo is yet to offer any suggestion of timing, we don't have too long now to wait and find out.
</p>
<p>
When Switch 2 does arrive, fans expect next year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-gets-gorgeous-first-gameplay-trailer-and-its-out-next-year">long-awaited blockbuster Metroid Prime 4</a> to launch on Nintendo's new hardware. Nintendo has also confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">Switch 2 will be backwards compatible</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-music-adds-mario-64-tunes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Wahoo! Etc. You can now listen to tunes from Nintendo's seminal <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a> via the Nintendo Music app.
</p>
<p>
Today's additions bring 49 minutes of Super Mario 64 melodies to your ears, across 36 tracks. These include the game's memorable opening theme, that bit of music which plays as you muck about with Mario's face, and the theme for Cool, Cool, Mountain - where you toss the penguin to its death.
</p>
<p>
Want something more chilled? Dire, Dire Docks is an absolute banger. You also have two versions of Piranha Plant's Lullaby to choose from.</p>
<p>Of course, the game's best theme is "Slider" - what you'll know best as Princess Peach's Slide. And yes, you can extend this track up to an hour in length.
