            <p>Bid numbers in the "multiple millions" are reportedly on the table for the adaptation of EA's fan-favourite co-op adventure, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/tom-cruise-ana-de-armas-jon-chu-sydney-sweeney-movies-1236400979/">Deadline</a>, which said the movie business is "on a much-needed hot streak" after the "smash results" of the Minecraft screen adaptation. Debuting last month, A Minecraft Movie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">generated $301m worldwide on its first weekend</a> and has been such a success that there are already talks about a sequel, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">director Jared Hess has teased where the film series could go next</a>.</p>

            <p>Just a year after release, Activision is "streamlining" and ending support for Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, ceasing all seasonal content.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/WarzoneMobile/status/1923470814357385447">statement</a>, the developer said while it understood "this news may be disappointing", the mobile shooter had "not met [its] expectations with mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences."</p>

<p>"We deeply appreciate your dedication and passion for Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile. Going forward, we will be streamlining the scope of the game. This decision was made after careful consideration of various factors and while we're proud of the accomplishment in bringing Call of Duty: Warzone to mobile in an authentic way, it unfortunately has not met our expectations with mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences," the statement began.</p>
<p>"As a result, we will no longer be delivering new seasonal content and gameplay updates to the mobile version. Effective immediately, players will no longer be able to purchase Call of Duty Points or Black Cell using real currency in Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile. Sunday, May 18, 2025 will be the last day the game can be downloaded from the Google Play and Apple’s App Store and social features across both mobile platforms will be retired."</p>
<p>Players who install the game before next Monday, 19th May, will still be able to play, complete with cross-progression and shared inventories. They'll also be able to use unspent COD Points. After Monday, however, the game will no longer be downloadable from mobile stores, nor will players be able to spend any further real currency on COD Points or Battle Passes.</p>
<p>It's not clear how long the game will stay online, but Activision <a href="https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-service-changes">stressed</a>, "refunds are not available for previously purchased in-game content on unused COD Points".</p>
<p>"We know that this news may be disappointing, and we truly appreciate the support, passion, feedback, and dedication from our community," the statement added. "We have special incentives for Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile players in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-mobile">Call of Duty: Mobile</a> and encourage our players to try it for free."</p>
<p>Activision's sibling Call of Duty mobile game, which is different from Warzone, is seemingly faring much better. In May 2022, the publisher revealed<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-mobile-reaches-650m-downloads"> the mobile title had reached an impressive 650 million downloads</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
