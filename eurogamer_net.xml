<p>Using the mouse controls, the standard analogue stick will be disabled as players use both joycons to play the game and navigate the UI. Players will be able to choose in the settings whether or not they prefer to use the left, right, or both Joycons to play via dedicated control schemes.</p>
<p>For those who log on to Fortnite on the Nintendo Switch 2 before 31st March, 2026, a free emote will be their prize. This Wishing Star emote is exclusive to Switch 2 players for now, though Epic does note that the emote may be sold in the store following the March 2026 cutoff.</p>
<p>Epic also confirms in a FAQ that the Nintendo Switch pro controller will be usable when playing Fortnite on the Switch 2, and those who already linked their Epic and Nintendo accounts will not have to redo the process on the new console.</p>
<p>As a final note, the Save The World game within Fortnite is the only unavailable experience on the Switch 2 version, everything else is playable. Save The World, for those unaware, is the PvE Co-Op building game that first came out in Early Access in 2017,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-save-the-world-mode-will-no-longer-go-free-to-play-this-year"> before getting a full release in 2020</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/balatro">Balatro</a> dev Localthunk has revealed a lovely little reference hidden inside one of the game's many cards, one that calls back to his home town of Regina, Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>Posting this tidbit of Balatro lore on Twitter, Localthunk offered some development context for the 'Ride the Bus' card to their followers, as well as a side-by-side of the card art and its real life inspiration.</p>
<p>"Pointless Balatro lore: When I started Balatro dev I was living in my hometown of Regina, Saskatchewan," he wrote. "I had a bus stop outside my apartment (similar to the one in this image) and I based the art of 'Ride the Bus' on that bus stop!"</p>

<p>Who doesn't love a bit of local love hidden inside video games. My mind immediately goes to Driver on the PS1, in which the developers hid a secret recreation of Newcastle in the UK. It remains true that the place in which a game is made can often seep inside the work of the creatives living there. A nice thought, especially for those from Regina. <a href="https://chl.ca/whl-pats/">Let's go Pats</a>!</p> <div>

<p>Balatro has proven exceptionally popular since its release back in February last year. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-passes-5m-copies-sold-as-developer-implores-fans-to-play-more-indie-games">As of January 2025, it has surpassed 5m copies sold</a>, and was estimated to have generated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-has-made-almost-44m-from-its-mobile-release-alone">$4.4m two months after release on mobile alone</a>. </p>
<p>It's also proven itself to be an awards magnet, taking home multiple awards at the Game Developers Choice awards including  Game of the Year, Best Design, Best Debut, and Innovation Award. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-creator-impressed-onlookers-with-his-card-skills-at-public-event-without-being-recognised">Mr. Thunk even played the game at the conference while remaining totally anonymous</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-surpasses-elden-ring-nightreign-on-steams-top-sellers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a> has surpassed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> on Steam's Top Sellers chart, one day before its early launch for Deluxe and Ultimate Edition owners. Only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter Strike 2</a> seems able to keep the Survival MMO at bay.</p>
<p>The game previously hit a concurrent player peak of 37,889 during a closed weekend beta, initially limited to those invited <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/funcom-has-heard-your-feedback-and-opened-the-dune-awakening-beta-to-all-pre-orderers">but opened up to pre-orderers near the conclusion</a>. These folks were able to play through the same early portion as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-proves-mmos-can-still-be-interesting-and-try-new-things">our lovely Bertie dived into in the Eurogamer preview</a>.</p>
<p>It has managed to slip past Elden Ring Nightreign, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-gets-strong-start-on-steam-reaching-over-300k-concurrent-peak">which had a strong start on Steam</a> before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">recently surpassing the 3.5m sales mark across all platforms</a>. It's worth noting of course that Nightreign came out last Friday, so it was bound to start trickling down the Top Sellers chart sooner or later.</p>

<p>Dune Awakening, the next big release from Funcom, releases for all players on 10th June, but those looking to hop in tomorrow will have to drop at least Â£58.50 / $69.99 / â‚¬69.99  for the Deluxe Edition. Obviously, there's no way to differentiate which version Steam users are buying to cause this surge up the store page, but it's certainly a good indicator for initial interest.</p>
<p>Recently, Funcom peeled back the curtain on the mid - end game experience in Dune Awakening <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMpSKFSWjMM">in a lengthy live stream</a>, providing much-needed information on what those who sink dozens if not hundreds of hours into the game will actually be doing. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.vg247.com/">VG247</a> also <a href="https://www.vg247.com/dune-awakenings-creative-director-speaks-on-the-end-game-and-how-the-landsraad-will-give-key-roles-to-crafter-and-killer-alike">interviewed the creative director on the Landsraad system</a>, a rotating semi-randomised set of server wide tasks the Atreides and Harkonnen will be battling over.</p>
<p>For those unaware the game follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-devs-explain-their-alt-history-approach-to-the-vast-intricate-follow-up-to-conan-exiles">an alternate history of Frank Herbert's sci-fi series of novels</a>, though aesthetically more aligned with the recent films by Denis Villeneuve. Its creators at Funcom were responsible for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/conan-exiles">Conan Exiles</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-secret-world-preview-2">The Secret World</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/anarchy-online">Anarchy Online.</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
