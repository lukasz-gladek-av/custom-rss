            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> production capacity and US tariffs didn't factor into sales predictions Nintendo said, as its forecasts were criticised by investors for being conservative.</p>
<p>Following its latest financial report where Nintendo predicted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-predicts-switch-2-will-outsell-its-predecessor-at-launch-despite-demand-exceeding-expectations">Switch 2 sales would slightly outsell its predecessor</a>, multiple investors probed the company on why it hadn't estimated higher sales during a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250509e.pdf">Q&amp;A</a>.</p>
<p>"We are forecasting Nintendo Switch 2 hardware sales of 15m units for this fiscal year," said Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa. "We set this figure with the aim of reaching the same level of sales we achieved with Nintendo Switch in the roughly 10-month period between its launch in March 2017 and December that year."</p>

<p>The "limits of our hardware production capacity were not a factor" in setting the sales volume forecast, he continued, and "the tariff situation in the US or a possibility of a recession did not affect our sales volume forecast either".</p>
<p>"Our first goal is to get off to the same start we did with Nintendo Switch, and we are working to strengthen our production capacity so we can respond flexibly to demand," said Furukawa.</p>
<p>In a follow-up question, the president continued: "We recognise the positive feedback from the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience events and the situation with applications for randomly selected drawings for pre-orders on My Nintendo Store in Japan. But the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware is priced relatively high compared to Nintendo Switch, so even if there is momentum around the launch, we know it will not be easy to keep that momentum going over the long term through the holiday season and beyond.</p>
<p>"We have been working to ramp up Nintendo Switch 2 hardware production since even before we held the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience events and began My Nintendo Store applications. Our sales volume forecast was not determined based on any limit to production capacity."</p>
<p>Demand for the Switch 2 in Japan in particular has far exceeded expectations - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-admits-switch-2-demand-far-exceeds-expectations-in-japan-as-company-president-offers-stark-warning-over-stock">Furukawa previously warned of stock issues</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo predicted 45m sales of software in its financial report, but Furukawa noted this figure does not include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> units bundled with the console. Including these units, software sales are expected to surpass the 52m units sold for the original Switch. This is partly due to the "more robust lineup" at launch than the previous console.</p>
<p>Further, Furukawa stated the forecast was calculated maintaining current US tariff rates throughout the fiscal year. This has, however, resulted in a "negative impact of several tens of billions of yen at the profit level". The Switch 2 hardware also has a lower profit margin compared to the original Switch.</p>
<p>Should tariffs change, the company will consider price adjustments accordingly.</p>
<p>"Our basic policy is that for any country or region, if tariffs are imposed, we recognise them as a part of the cost and incorporate them into the price," said Furukawa. "However, this year marks our first new dedicated video game system launch in eight years, so given our unique situation, our priority is to maintain the momentum of our platforms, which is extremely important for our dedicated video game platform business, and to rapidly expand the install base of our new hardware. Consequently, if the assumptions on tariffs change, we will consider what kind of price adjustments would be appropriate, taking into account various factors such as the market conditions."</p>
<p>Furukawa's comments <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-tariffs-werent-factored-into-switch-2-price-but-its-something-were-going-to-have-to-address">echo those of Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser</a>, who admitted tariffs were "something we're going to have to address".</p>
<p>Later, Furukawa also commented on the increased price of hardware and software compared to the previous console.</p>
<p>"When determining hardware prices, we consider not only the manufacturing cost, but also various factors such as consumers' impression of the price, the vast differences in exchange rates compared to the Nintendo Switch launch, and the market conditions in each region," said Furukawa.</p>
<p>"For software, in addition to the same factors, we also take into account rises in costs, due to aspects such as increased game file size and extended development periods, when determining price.</p>
<p>"Going forward, we will continue to consider appropriate prices for each title when it comes to software prices. Hardware involves special factors such as tariffs, and we will take into account factors like those we have just described, while conducting careful and repeated deliberations when determining price."</p>
<p>Bowser previously stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">higher price tag for Mario Kart World was an example of "variable pricing"</a> and was not establishing a more expensive "benchmark".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sinking-city">The Sinking City</a> Remastered - the Unreal Engine 5 spruce-up of developer Frogwares' 2019 Lovecraft-inspired detective adventure - has slithered out of its tenebrous seclusion sooner than expected, and is available now for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.
</p>
<p>
For the uninitiated, The Sinking City tells the story of troubled private investigator Charles Reed as he travels to the supernaturally flooded city of Oakmont, Massachusetts, in search of a way to quell his hellish visions. There's a bit of gunplay as the cosmic horror begins to take hold, but mostly it's a game of exploration and investigation, playing out across a series of open-ended cases and the titular open world.
</p>
<p>
All that's true of The Sinking City Remastered, of course, but Frogwares is also promising an "upgraded visual experience alongside some requested quality-of-life features". There's talk of enhanced and fully relit locations with additional levels of detail and objects, for instance, alongside 4K textures, improved reflections, "various" gameplay adjustments, and new accessibility features. There's also a photo mode and, on PC at least, support for the likes of DLSS, FSR and TSR upscaling.

<p>
To mark The Sinking City Remastered's arrival, Frogwares has released a new trailer showcasing some of the differences between the 2019 original and its new Unreal Engine 5 update. And if that's got you in the mood for some eldritch adventuring, The Sinking City Remastered gets its digital release today on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/750130/The_Sinking_City_Remastered/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP5205-PPSA01772_00-TSCUA00000000004">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/the-sinking-city-remastered/9p3xq5qwlfjj">Xbox Series X/S</a> - and it'll be available as a free upgrade for all existing owners.
</p>
<p>
Frogwares' remaster comes ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sinking-city-2">The Sinking City 2</a>, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sinking-city-2-gets-first-gameplay-trailer-smashes-crowdfunding-goal-in-less-than-a-day">successfully crowdfunded on Kickstarter</a> earlier this year. The sequel is again set in 1920s America, but this time sees players exploring the flooded streets and crumbling buildings of Arkham in an survival horror-style adventure said to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sinking-city-2-will-pivot-to-a-horror-focus">shift away from the deduction focus of its predecessor</a> in favour of combat and exploration.
</p>
<p>
All this activity follows Frogwares' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frogwares-now-sole-publisher-of-the-sinking-city-following-dispute-with-nacon">lengthy dispute with publisher Nacon</a> over the rights to the original The Sinking City. Since a resolution was last year, the studio has taken over as The Sinking City's publisher, updated the Steam build, and released new DLC. The Ukrainian studio also found time to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frogwares-remaking-sherlock-holmes-and-cthulhu-crossover-the-awakened">crowdfund and release 2023's Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened</a>, as it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sherlock-holmes-developer-frogwares-shares-update-on-life-in-ukraine-amid-ongoing-war-with-russia">continued to adjust to life during Russia's ongoing invasion</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We plan to do big things with The Sinking City IP, starting with the sequel and then beyond," Frogwares publishing director Sergiy Oganesyan wrote in a statement accompanying today's remaster news. "So, after our rather well-known struggles with the original, it feels amazing to have this positive moment be part of the game's twisted history and for us to be the ones to fully decide it. Making it free to all our existing fans is our way of giving back to them for having supported us all this time through thick and thin."

            <p>
The Fallout TV series has already been renewed for a third season on Amazon Prime.
</p>
<p>
That's despite the show's second season still being months away - and indeed, we now know Fallout's next batch of episodes will debut in December 2025.
</p>
<p>
More than 100 million people have watched Fallout's first season to date, Amazon has revealed (thanks, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/fallout-renewed-season-3-release-date-season-2-1236394393/">Variety</a>), making it one of the streamer's top three launches ever.
</p>
<p>
Amazon is now moving quickly to make more of the show, and begin teasing its second batch of episodes with another longing look at the Las Vegas skyline at the end of the below trailer.

This video, released for Amazon's Upfront event, sees a pre-Ghoul Walton Goggins getting pitched advertising campaigns for various products (it's a humorous nod to Upfront itself, where Amazon seeks marketing pitches from brands). And yes - that is Amy Acker, AKA Fred from Angel! More of her character please.
</p>
<p>"We are absolutely thrilled that our global Prime Video customers will be able to delve deeper into the wonderfully surreal and captivating world of Fallout," said Amazon TV boss Vernon Sanders paying tribute to the show's writing and production teams. "Together with our amazing partners at Bethesda Games and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda">Bethesda Softworks</a>, we are delighted to announce a third season of Fallout, well ahead of the much-anticipated debut of season two."</p>
<p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-show-could-run-for-five-six-seasons-says-actor">Fallout actor Aaron Moten revealed that he expected the show to run for "five, six" seasons</a> in total.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> will release on PC next month, according to a trailer posted too early on the PlayStation YouTube channel and since removed.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-gets-confirmed-pc-release-and-goddess-of-victory-nikke-dlc">PC version of the action game was announced back in February</a> but without a full date. Now we know it will launch on 11th June across Steam and the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>The PC version will come with a number of extras, including an unlocked framerate, higher resolution environment textures, DLSS 4 and FSR 3, ultrawide monitor support, and more.</p>

<p>Further, there will be a new boss fight against cyber warrior Mann, as well as 25 new costumes for protagonist Eve.</p>
<p>Additional content from the console release will likely be included, like the NieR: Automata DLC and photo mode.</p>
<p>More DLC based on Shift Up's other big franchise Goddess of Victory: Nikke is also set to arrive on console alongside the PC release (and presumably on PC too), though it's not part of the leaked trailer - but is in the trailer above.</p>
<p>Shift Up stated in a financial report from February it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-pc-sales-expected-to-exceed-console-says-shift-up">expects the PC version to exceed console sales</a>.</p>
<p>"In the AAA game market, PC devices have a higher market share than consoles, so we expect the performance of the PC version to exceed that of the console version," the company said. "We are particularly observing trends such as the significant expansion of the single-player action game market in the Asian gaming industry."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-stellar-blade-on-ps5-pro-a-simple-but-hugely-effective-upgrade">game received a PS5 Pro patch</a> in time for the new console's release, which Digital Foundry described as a "hugely effective upgrade". Soon we'll be able to see how the PC version compares.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
