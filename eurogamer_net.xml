            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Battlefield 6 was officially unveiled earlier this month, and it looks like so far the community is keen for the upcoming release, despite the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042s-opening-weekend-has-been-a-disaster">somewhat lacklustre initial reception to its predecessor Battlefield 2042</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7355565272528826369-FoP1?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACr_MyIB0LsPQAIci9zs45L99nTb3k_h6f8">a LinkedIn post</a> shared by Alinea Analytics CEO Rickard Linder, following the debut of Battlefield 6's reveal trailer last week, the game racked up nearly 500,000 Steam wishlists over the weekend (thanks, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wishlist-on-steam-half-million/">Insider Gaming</a>). Linder added roughly 60 percent of those who added Battlefield 6 to their wishlist had played <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>.</p>
<p>This isn't too shabby when you consider that former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-review-dices-magic-fps-formula-gets-spread-too-thin">Eurogamer editor in chief Martin Robinson called Battlefield 2042 "the weakest Battlefield in some time"</a> when it first released in 2021. To be fair, the team did work on improving Battlefield 2042, and in 2023 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-with-humility-and-hustle-dice-might-yet-win-the-war">Eurogamer noted DICE had "course-corrected in dramatic fashion"</a>, though the developer would likely "have to wait for the next iteration to see its efforts rewarded". Given those wishlist numbers, it seems this may indeed be the case.</p>

<p>Like I said, we got our first look at Battlefield 6 last week, courtesy of a new trailer. While a firm release date was not provided as part of this reveal, the disclaimer URL featured in the video takes you to a page that says: "This promotional offer expires October 10, 2025. Code expires October 10, 2027." <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-finally-revealed-with-a-dedicated-multiplayer-reveal-coming-next-week">This indicates that pre-sell offers end on October 10, and that a release date for Battlefield 6 may be October 11, 2025</a>.</p>
<p>A separate multiplayer reveal is scheduled for later this week, on 31st July.</p>
<p>Aside from what has been officially announced, we already know a fair amount about the next Battlefield entry. Leaks from the Battlefield Labs tests revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-leak-confirms-return-of-fan-favourite-mode">Rush will be coming back to Battlefield 6</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-single-player-campaign-details-leak-online">single player details have spilled out into the internet</a>, and a variety of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-most-important-leaks-battlefield-6">weapons that'll be usable in the full release have made their way online, too</a>. Then, just this weekend, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leaks-keep-on-coming-this-time-its-the-battle-royale-map">Battlefield 6's Battle Royale map popped up online</a>.</p>

<p>Also recently shared via the world that is social media are images from the Battlefield 6 alpha showing that the 'Battlefield stretch neck' - which is exactly as it sounds, with players having overly stretched necks - is back (see image above).</p>
<p>"It is an absolute classic that dates all the way back to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-3">Battlefield 3</a> beta," <a href="https://x.com/rivaLxfactor/status/1949885360613323210">reads a post on X</a>. "It is a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>"Battlefield is so back."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-lukewarm-reception-to-battlefield-2042-fans-seem-to-be-getting-behind-battlefield-6-as-steam-wishlist-numbers-soar]]></content:encoded>
