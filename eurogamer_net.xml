            <p>Open-world extraction shooter Exoborne from former The Division developers begins its playtest today over on Steam.</p>
<p>The studio, Sharkmob, was formed in 2017 by core members of The Division team from Ubisoft, and previously created battle royale Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodhunt, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/12-months-on-battle-royale-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt-is-ending-development">shut down a year after release</a>.</p>
<p>Now it's launching a new project, first revealed at 2023's The Game Awards, that sees players in Exo-Rigs battling in teams in extreme weather conditions like violent tornadoes. Check out a gameplay walkthrough in the video below.</p>

<p>Alongside team-based extraction gameplay in this post-climate change world, Sharkmob promises an evolving narrative, dynamic public events like high-stakes missions for rewards, and plenty of Exo-Rig customisation to "harness the fierce forces of nature".</p>
<p>The public playtest will be worldwide and is accessible via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2705130/Exoborne/">Steam</a>. It will run from today until 17th February (1pm UK time).</p>
<p>It's not clear how much of the game will be included in the playtest, but it's certainly a great opportunity to get to grips with the game's team-based tactical action, vertical movement, and those weather effects.</p>
<p>Though the test is PC only, the game is set for release across PS5 and Xbox Series X/S too. It's being developed in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>There's also no final release date yet, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/post-apocalypse-extraction-shooter-exoborne-announced-by-ex-division-devs">Sharkmob has confirmed it will be a premium release</a> and not free-to-play.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
