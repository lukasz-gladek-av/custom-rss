Humanoid Origin, the studio founded by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> director Casey Hudson in 2021, is ending development of its untitled sci-fi game and shutting its doors, after an "an unexpected shortfall of funding left [it] unable to sustain operations."
</p>
<p>
Hudson, who also served as BioWare general manager before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/casey-hudson-and-mark-darrah-announce-departure-from-bioware">departing the studio</a> in 2020, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-bioware-boss-announces-new-studio-working-on-fresh-ip">announced</a> the establishment of <a href="https://humanoidorigin.com/">Humanoid Origin</a> (initially Humanoid Studios) in June 2021, teasing it was working on an "all-new IP". A year later, Hudson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-director-casey-hudson-working-on-all-new-science-fiction-universe">shared a little more information</a> on the "multi-platform AAA game", as well as early concept art, calling it a "character-driven narrative in an all-new science-fiction universe".
</p>
<p>
Today, however, Hudson <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/humanoid-origin_earlier-today-we-informed-our-staff-that-activity-7266889657370447874-9uwE/">released a statement</a> announcing the project's termination and the closure of the studio. "Earlier today, we informed our staff that Humanoid Origin will be shutting down," he wrote. "Despite efforts to shield the studio from broader challenges in the industry, an unexpected shortfall of funding left us unable to sustain operations."
</p>
<p>
"We're heartbroken that we will not be able to bring our new science-fiction universe to completion," Hudson continued. "Our main concern at this time however is for our team, and we are committed to supporting them in their transition to new employment. 
</p>
<p>
"In our time together, the team achieved incredible progress, and demonstrated that it's possible to do amazing work while fostering a culture of fun and creativity. We thank them for their talent, courage, and friendship. 
</p>
<p>
"Thank you to everyone who supported us throughout our journey."
</p>
<p>
Humanoid Origin is the latest studio to be impacted in what continues to be a devastating year for games industry employees, with <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">over 14,000 people estimated to have lost their jobs</a> so far. That's compared to the 10,500 games industry workers who were laid off across the entirety of 2023. Back in March, GamesIndustry.biz's Chris Tring, writing for Eurogamer, took a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">closer look</a> at the circumstances leading to such massive numbers of job cuts over the last few years.

Amazon's intriguing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-working-on-animated-anthology-tv-series-featuring-spelunky-and-other-video-game-worlds">Secret Level anthology series</a> is almost upon, bringing 15 episodes of brand-new stories set in familiar video game worlds. And following on from its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-latest-secret-level-trailer-includes-sifu-megaman-spelunky-and-a-nightmarish-pac-man">recent series trailer</a>, Amazon is now releasing individual teasers for each episode, offering a closer look at the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/spelunky">Spelunky</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a>, and, of course, that posthumous turn for Concord.
</p>
<p>
Secret Level, if it's so far managed to pass you by, comes from the creative team behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>â€™s sci-fi anthology series Love, Death &amp; Robots. Like that show, Secret Level is all about the flashy CGI animation, but here, episodes draw inspiration from existing video games - featuring familiar settings and characters in new adventures - rather than sci-fi tales.
</p>
<p>
Armored Core, Concord, Crossfire, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Exodus, Honor of Kings, Mega Man, New World: Aeternum, Pac-Man, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, Spelunky, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a>, Warhammer 40K, plus a number of PlayStation Studios games all feature in Secret Level's inaugural season, and we've seen brief glimpses of at least some of these already. However, as part of its big pre-release push, Amazon is now highlighting each individual episode on social media, publishing brisk 20-second-long teaser trailers revealing a little more than what's been shown before.

Concord, above, is arguably the most fascinating of these, if only because it effectively serves as an unanticipated eulogy for Sony's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-unceremoniously-goes-offline-with-an-anticlimactic-error-message">ill-fated 5v5 shooter Concord</a> - in an episode Secret Level creator Tim Miller recently said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-episode-in-amazons-secret-level-series-shows-potential-of-world-and-characters-says-creator">showed the "potential of this world and the characters"</a>. But there's more too, with Amazon also sharing a look at <a href="https://x.com/SecretLevelonPV/status/1858533196943520132">The Queen's Cradle</a>, based on Dungeons &amp; Dragons, as well as Sifu's <a href="https://x.com/SecretLevelonPV/status/1858895581684339092">It Takes a Life</a>, Unreal Tournament's <a href="https://x.com/SecretLevelonPV/status/1859258173858709977">Xan</a>, the Spelunky themed <a href="https://x.com/SecretLevelonPV/status/1859620355314213027">Tally</a>, plus <a href="https://x.com/SecretLevelonPV/status/1859982744383590403">And They Shall Know No Fear</a> - a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-getting-an-animated-sequel-in-amazons-new-secret-level-series">sequel</a> to the events of Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2.

You can see all Amazon's currently released teaser trailers by clicking on their episode titles above, and if you're left sufficiently intrigued, Secret Level - which stars the likes of Keanu Reeves, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kevin Hart, Ariana Greenblatt, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Clive Standen, and Laura Bailey - launches via Prime Video on 10th December.
