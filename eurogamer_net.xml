            <p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers has today received a new patch on PC, offering improved performance and much-needed balance adjustments to tweak some of its infuriatingly cheap difficulty.</p>
<p>As a result, the rougher edges of the Soulslike are being smoothed out, allowing the more unique elements of the game to shine through.</p>
<p>Initially, Wuchang didn't sit well with me. I previewed the game back at the Game Developer Conference but, thrown into a demo partway through the game with little explanation of its intricacies, it all felt intensely derivative. I expected that to continue when playing the game in full, but instead I've been pleasantly surprised.</p>

<p>Part of the issue with Wuchang is it doesn't explain its best ideas very well. The early game is filled with terminology and functions - skyborn might, alacrity, feathering, to name three - but with little explanation or clarity. That leads to frustration and at first I was simply playing this like any other Soulslike without really engaging in its systems.</p><p>But there are interesting ideas here. Take skyborn might: this is an extra resource that's spent on special abilities and magic spells alike, and is gained through last-minute perfect dodges (as well as other means later unlocked on the skill tree). This is the core of combat and, once fully comprehended, lends Wuchang its own peculiar combat rhythm. It's almost <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>-esque, with protagonist Wuchang swiftly dancing around enemies before attacking with typical Soulslike heft, aided by beautiful wuxia animations.</p>
<p>Then there's the madness gauge that, when full after repeatedly dying, forces the player to fight a demonic reflection of Wuchang to regain lost currency. Sure, it's a fun twist on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>, but being able to lure your demon to fighting other enemies for you is wonderfully cheeky.</p>
<p>Elements like this ensure Wuchang isn't just another derivative Soulslike but does have its own identity within the typical confines of the genre - the looping level design, say, or the high level of difficulty. Along with its multiple weapon types, unlockable special moves (disciplines), buffing weapons through acupuncture (tempering), and gradually expanding Wuchang's stats on a Sphere Grid-esque skill tree, there is a surprising amount of depth here once players overcome any initial Soulslike fatigue. Much like last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a>, once you get past all that costume fetishisation, there's some really strong combat here.</p>
<p>But it's also too rough around the edges, particularly when it comes to that difficulty level. Wuchang takes an <em>age </em>to get off the ground when knocked down, for instance, with enemy combos seemingly perfectly timed to knock you back down again. Similarly, healing takes far too long, turning boss battles into a frustrating lesson on when to heal, rather than when to attack.</p><p>Thankfully, both of these frustrations have been tweaked in the new patch: the invincibility frames of Wuchang's get-up animation have been adjusted and her healing animation sped up (and can now be cancelled with a dodge). Other tweaks include making it easier for light attacks to interrupt enemy animations, and reducing the number of traps, while a future update will allow players to choose to respawn at shrines or a boss door after death.</p>

</figure>
<p>These are all very welcome changes that arrive on top of a number of performance optimisations on PC. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/498329191821869869">patch notes</a> don't mention console updates, though presumably this will follow soon - I've been playing the game on PS5 and even now there are stutters and poor textures that mar the twisted, grotesque visuals.</p>
<p>It's these sorts of details, I think, that separate the derivative Soulslikes from the original work of FromSoftware. Sure, the Dark Souls and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> studio released plenty of post-launch patches to adjust difficulty levels, but to me its games are challenging without feeling cheap. That's a distinction many lesser developers haven't quite mastered.</p><p>Wuchang, at times, has felt like a laborious slog despite its interesting twist on the formula. But it's reassuring to see its developer offer tweaks to improve the experience - now it deserves to stand alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-overture-difficulty-options">Lies of P</a> as Soulslikes able to transcend the ever-present FromSoftware comparison.</p>

            <p>Katsuhiro Harada spoke to Eurogamer at Evo earlier this month about the future of the Tekken series without him at the helm. The legendary game director had previously stated <a href="https://www.vg247.com/tekken-8-leads-uncertain-future-tekken-team">that the next Tekken game could likely be his last before </a>leaving for other ventures..</p>
<p>When asked by Eurogamer whether the Tekken team would be ready for a future without him, Harada responded (via translation courtesy of game designer Michael Murray): "There are two types of games. A game that solely focuses on its story and setting, and games where the gameplay and the game's systems are the focus. So when you divide games into those two categories, a series that's narrative-focused is hard to envision when a major person driving it is gone.</p>
<p>Harada continues: "But for Tekken, [I] feel that it's the latter. Of course people are in love with the characters and the story, but it's mainly a 3D fighting game where you launch your opponent, do aerial juggles, etc. [I] feel over the past 30 years the gameplay has been polished and everything is in place, so it's much easier to continue with someone else.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that Harada (paired with Michael Murray, who has also stated they might only have one more Tekken in him) are more than just developers closed off from the outside world. For years, Harada and Murray have been traveling the world and acting as direct links to the Tekken community. The recently revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a> character - Miary Zo - was designed after the team including Harada travelled to Madagascar personally to research the region and its culture.</p><p>When asked whether this approach is important to maintain for a post-Harada Tekken, Harada via Murray responded thus: "We're public figures for Tekken, sure. Compared to other people outside of the company - and this is [my] personal opinion not the official stance of Bandai Namco - it really depends [on the game]. There are other games out there - even fighting games - where there is no public figure to attach to it.</p>
<p>"For Tekken we stand out, but that's because when we first started doing community interaction Evo was much smaller, other tournaments were much smaller, the community was smaller. We were right at the time also when arcades across the world disappeared. So it was like, where do you see your audience and find out what they want? We personally felt it was better to go to these events and interact with people, to get a broad sampling and make our mind up about what to do with the game.</p>
<p>"That doesn't mean that's necessary perhaps. Other games are successful without that, it's not like you have to do that or a game won't succeed. It's just what we felt was necessary for us at that time."</p>
<p>Murray would add his own personal perspective as well, noting: "Personally I feel similarly. At the time there was no internet and forums, there were just arcades. Now it's just the internet! But, is that really where you want to take all your information from? I think you have to make the best decision at the time. Personally, I don't know if we would continue doing things the same way we've always done. I don't get paid a stipend for talking to people on the internet either (laugh)."</p><p>The idea of Tekken without Harada at the helm is a bizarre one, so tied together the two entities are. Though with Harada already exploring new ventures such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-labyrinth">Shadow Labyrinth</a>, perhaps the slow departure is starting already. Whether or not the series can maintain its momentum without its lifelong lead is a big question, perhaps most for the person meant to fill his shoes.</p>
