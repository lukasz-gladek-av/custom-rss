            <p>Nintendo has released a new update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> launch game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, which now makes it easier to locate collectibles you've found in its open world.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Free Roam map now displays the locations of P Switches you've run over, as well as Peach Medallions obtained. You can also now fast travel to P Switches.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Free Roam, it's now easier to encounter UFOs and the "conditions for the appearance of some Peach Medallions" have been adjusted.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-0-review">Yakuza 0</a> Director's Cut is heading to current gen platforms in December, but existing owners won't get a free upgrade.</p>
<p>This Director's Cut was first released on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> in June as a launch game, but RGG Studio has announced it will now be heading to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam on 8th December.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> will be coming to Switch 2 on 13th November, and then on 8th December will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam alongside Yakuza 0 Director's Cut.</p>

<p>Essentially, by the end of this year all three games will be available across all current gen consoles. Then, next year, Yakuza Kiwami 3 and its Dark Ties spin-off will be released, meaning the first four games in the series will be available.</p><p>However, there's a catch. Across the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10015829">PlayStation Store</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/yakuza-0-directors-cut/9nrkltwn2zq7">Xbox Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2988580/Yakuza_0_Directors_Cut/">Steam</a>, there will be no free upgrade path from the original Yakuza 0 release to the Director's Cut. In addition, save data cannot be carried over to the new version.</p>
<p>Further, on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, the Director's Cut version's Red Light Raid online multiplayer will be added in a post-launch update (the Steam version presumably will have it at launch). There's no release date yet for this update.</p>
<p>This multiplayer mode is a key addition for the Director's Cut, which sees players teaming up with friends to take down hordes of enemies. It's disappointing it won't be included at launch, plus <a href="https://www.sega.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Sega has confirmed</a> cross-play will not be supported, so you'll need to play with friends on the same platform.</p>
<p>The reveal followed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-kiwami-3-is-real-and-coming-early-2026-alongside-brand-new-prequel-spin-off-launching-on-the-same-day">official unveiling of Yakuza Kiwami 3</a> earlier in the RGG Direct, which will come with a new prequel spin-off called Dark Ties. RGG also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-studios-next-game-stranger-than-heaven-still-a-long-way-off-as-teased-in-jazzy-behind-the-scenes-video">teased its next project, Stranger Than Heaven</a>.</p>

            <p>Yakuza studio Ryu Ga Gotoku's next project, Stranger Than Heaven, was teased at its RGG Summit as part of the Tokyo Games Show.</p>
<p>Previously known as Project Century, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-studios-project-century-gets-a-proper-name-and-a-stylish-new-trailer">Stranger Than Heaven was properly unveiled earlier this year</a> with a trailer revealing the name.</p>
<p>Now a further tease has been shown: the summit closed with a fresh look at the game alongside footage of the team working on the project. Check it out at the end of the stream below.</p>

<p>The footage shows a female jazz singer, also part of the previous reveal, but behind the scenes footage also includes glimpses of other areas of development.</p>
<p>It's not much to go on and somewhat proves the game is a way off yet. As per <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20250618_Management_large_MTG_all_e.pdf">Sega's last financial report</a>, Stranger Than Heaven is expected to release in or beyond the company's next financial year ending March 2027.</p>
<p>Little else is known about the game, though its codename does suggest it'll take place in multiple time periods. At the least, the reveal trailer took place in 1943.</p>
<p>Also at the RGG Summit, the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-kiwami-3-is-real-and-coming-early-2026-alongside-brand-new-prequel-spin-off-launching-on-the-same-day">officially revealed Yakuza Kiwami 3</a>, its latest remake.</p>

<p>This leak arrives the morning prior to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-next-playstation-state-of-play-airing-tomorrow-extended-look-at-housemarques-saros-confirmed">Sony's next State of Play livestream</a>, which was announced yesterday and will kick off at 10PM UK time tonight. We already know it will feature <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returnal-studio-heads-to-a-hostile-shape-shifting-planet-for-newly-unveiled-saros">Housemarque's upcoming game Saros</a>, but the official blog noted it'll focus on both PlayStation Studios and third-party games. So, an official Nioh 3 trailer or reveal wouldn't be off the table!</p>
<p>What's more, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-3-announced-and-theres-a-demo-out-now">game was first revealed at the last State of Play in June</a>, accompanied by a limited time demo. The trailer showed off its dual Ninja and Samurai playstyles.</p>
<p>A 6th February release date lands Nioh 3 in relatively clear waters. The day prior, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-7-is-getting-a-full-remake-and-its-not-hd-2d">Dragon Quest 7: Reimagined is making a splash</a> on all modern consoles, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-binding-of-isaac-creators-mewgenics-finally-gets-a-release-date-almost-13-years-after-it-was-announced">Mewgenics is the current indie to look out for</a> on the 10th February. But other than that, the coast appears clear.</p>

<p>News of Kiwami 3 leaked last week, but was revealed today at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VZM3ysP4vg">RGG Summit</a> as part of the Tokyo Game Show.</p>
<p>The game has been remade in the studio's Dragon Engine, but 16 years later the region of Okinawa in Japan has changed since the original production, meaning the visuals have been totally redone.</p>
<p>As for Dark Ties, this will take place back in Kamurocho as players follow Yakuza 3's villain Yoshitaka Mine ahead of the events of the main game, to understand how he became Kiryu's adversary.</p>
<p>Dark Ties will be a separate game, but will come packaged alongside Yakuza Kiwami 3 to offer a complete story.</p>
<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Yakuza 3 Gaiden: Dark Ties will be available from 12th February 2026 across PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, and PC (Steam).</p>
<p>More details and footage were revealed in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5_-kp17jCw">RGG Direct that followed</a>. </p>
<p>This latest Kiwami game follows this year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-review">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a> released in February, and last year's new mainline game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>. As such, RGG Studio is continuing its annual release cycle for the series.</p>
