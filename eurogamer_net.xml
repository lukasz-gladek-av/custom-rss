            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> team has shared a new piece of artwork for the mobile game's 9th anniversary, hinting that a few familiar faces may be joining very soon.</p>
<p>This artwork reveals Paradox Pokémon - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-scarlet-violet-paradox-iron-valiant-roaring-moon-locations-9015">first appeared in  Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> - could well be heading to Pokémon Go. Paradox Pokémon are a special collection of Pokémon, and are either a futuristic or prehistoric version of a present day Pokémon. In the new artwork, we can see both Great Tusk (an Ancient Pokémon) and Iron Treads (a Future Pokémon).</p>

<p>In addition to these two, we can see a Mega Butterfree, another yet-to-be-released Pokémon for PoGo. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-gen-6-list-x-y-kalos-region-7002">steel/ghost type Pokémon Aegislash is also in the artwork</a>, and will be arriving with the Steel and Scales event this month.</p>
<p>In addition to potential and confirmed upcoming Pokémon, it also looks like a new feature will be coming to PoGo. This is based on the character towards the left-hand side of the anniversary artwork, who is getting a thumbs up from a wrist communicator. <a href="https://x.com/ThatMonadoBoy/status/1941996071514763526">Some have suggested remote trading</a>, but it remains to be seen for now. Any thoughts?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the inclusion of Zygarde 50 percent Forme may well be hinting at a future Route / Zygarde event. Hopefully the Pokémon Go team will reveal all soon, stay tuned!</p>

        <p>As EU petition surpasses 1m signatures.</p>

            <p>
Last week, Stop Killing Games - the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">consumer-driven initiative</a> demanding games publishers leave their titles in a playable state once support is terminated - surpassed 1m signatures. But now, EU industry body Video Games Europe - which represents the likes of Ubisoft, Take-Two, Warner Bros., Riot Games, Activision Blizzard, Microsoft, and Nintendo - has weighed in, insisting the initiative's proposals would make games "prohibitively expensive to create".
</p>
<p>
Stop Killing Games was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-aims-to-mount-political-and-legal-challenges-to-games-going-offline">launched last April by Accursed Farms YouTuber Ross Scott</a>, calling upon video game fans around the world to petition their local governments regarding the increasingly common occurrence of purchased games becoming unplayable due to publisher actions. The games preservation movement was prompted by Ubisoft's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">shut down open-world racer The Crew's servers last March</a>, preventing access to both its multiplayer and single-player content due to its always-online nature. More controversy followed shortly after, when the publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown">began revoking customers' licenses to the game,</a> permanently removing it from their libraries and preventing hopes of resurrecting it through private servers.
</p>
<p>
After a year of campaigning and with an official deadline looming, last week finally saw Stop Killing Games' European petition surpass the 1m signatures needed for it to be submitted to the EU for verification and then, potentially, either progress to a public hearing or full debate session at the European Parliament. However, as that milestone was reached, organiser Scott <a href="https://x.com/accursedfarms/status/1940798871678210158">warned many of those signatures could be invalid</a> due to mistakes or deliberate spoofing (a practice he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmkCQJrc9n4">later noted</a> was illegal on official government petitions such as this), suggesting the real tally was likely around 600–700k genuine signatures. As such, he encouraged EU citizens to continue signing it legitimately before the deadline to ensure it passes the approval process.
</p>
<p>
Yet while the exact number of legitimate petition signatures remains unclear at present, it seems the threat of its success - and a potential parliamentary hearing - has spooked video games publishers enough to spur them into action. A statement from industry body and lobbying group Video Games Europe, which represents over 30 major publishers and national trade associations around Europe, has now been <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/news/statement-on-stop-killing-games/">shared on its website</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We appreciate the passion of our community," it reads. "However, the decision to discontinue online services is multi-faceted, never taken lightly and must be an option for companies when an online experience is no longer commercially viable. We understand that it can be disappointing for players but, when it does happen, the industry ensures that players are given fair notice of the prospective changes in compliance with local consumer protection laws."
</p>
<p>
"Private servers are not always a viable alternative option for players," it continues, "as the protections we put in place to secure players' data, remove illegal content, and combat unsafe community content would not exist and would leave rights holders liable. In addition, many titles are designed from the ground-up to be online-only; in effect, these proposals would curtail developer choice by making these video games prohibitively expensive to create.
</p>
<p>
"We welcome the opportunity to discuss our position with policy makers and those who have led the European Citizens Initiative in the coming months."
</p>
<p>
Stop Killing Games organiser Scott <a href="https://x.com/accursedfarms/status/1941562023973883972">shared a brief response to Video Games Europe's statement on social media</a>, calling its arguments against allowing customers to keep their purchases "flimsy". Scott added he'd provide a more lengthy video response soon.
</p>
<p>
Away from Stop Killing Games' EU activities, the initiative's <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074">official UK petition</a> has now surpassed over 150K signatures. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/favourite-game-no-longer-playable-uk-government-says-it-wont-tighten-rules-to-punish-publishers-who-switch-off-servers">previous government response</a>, mandatory for any parliamentary petition that surpasses 10K signatures, said: "There are no plans to amend UK consumer law on disabling video games". However, having now passed the 100K signatures threshold, the petition must now be considered for a debate in parliament.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The writer and producer of sci-fi anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners said he doesn't want to write a jolly story for the series, because "when people are sad", it makes him "a bit happy".</p>
<p>Edgerunners is an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-edgerunners-shows-cd-projekts-cyberpunk-is-still-worth-fighting-for">animated spin-off of CD Projekt Red's Cyberpunk 2077</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-cyberpunk-2077-anime-edgerunners-arrives-13th-september">first debuted in 2022</a>. Following acclaim, a second season is now in production for Netflix. </p><p>

News of this next season arrived during Anime Expo, along with a new trailer. "Night City lives on," reads the official blurb. You can check out the trailer below.

<p>At the same event, a Cyberpunk: Edgerunners panel was held, where writer Bartosz Sztybor was asked about the human stories told within Edgerunners' dystopian world. Here, the show's writer replied that this type of narrative is incredibly important for CDPR, and the team always wants to "write stories that are character driven".</p>
<p>Sztybor then elaborated on this point further stating: "But the other thing is that we are a company from Poland. I'm from Poland and people in Poland are sad. They are born sad, they die sad, so I just wanted to make the whole world sad." This was met with plenty of laughter from his audience.</p>
<p>When asked if he had ever considered changing things up a bit, and perhaps offering up some joyful story lines, Sztybor replied, "no", with the panel's host joking the writer liked to feast on others' misery.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for the second season of Edgerunners yet, with the team merely saying it will arrive on Netflix when it is ready. We do know, though, that it will comprise 10 episodes, and feature a standalone story within the world of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>The Edgerunners team promise "a raw chronicle of redemption and revenge" on the second season's debut. "In a city that thrives in the spotlight of violence, one question remains: when the world is blinded by spectacle, what extremes do you have to go to make your story matter," the blurb teases.</p>
<p>As for Cyberpunk 2077 itself, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">it is now available on Switch 2</a>. Our pals at Digital Foundry have taken the game out for a spin on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> already, asking the question: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-can-the-new-nintendo-console-handle-it">Can the new Nintendo console handle it?</a></p>
<p>In addition, the team at CDPR are currently cooking up another update for Cyberpunk 2077, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-new-update-will-have-scope-similar-to-22-as-cd-projekt-announces-delay">which will have "scope similar" to 2.2</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/when-people-are-sad-im-a-bit-happy-cyberpunk-edgerunners-season-two-is-going-to-be-sadder-bloodier-and-darker]]></content:encoded>
