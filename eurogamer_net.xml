            <p>Sucker Punch's upcoming PlayStation 5 exclusive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> is getting its own official popcorn bucket, but it's proven so popular it has already sold out online.</p>
<p>The bucket itself was available to pre-order from <a href="https://t.co/Kre862VVjF">AlamoMart</a>, and is shaped like a traditional Japanese rice basket. It was released for pre-order to coincide with Alamo Drafthouse's "curated" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/way-samurai">Way of the Samurai</a> film programme, which will showcase five films that helped define the genre. This series of films will <a href="https://x.com/alamodrafthouse/status/1945892543234805970/photo/1">be hosted in August</a> at select Alamo Drafthouse theaters.</p>

<p>Anyway, the hand painted Ghost of Yōtei Popcorn Bucket, as it is known, itself retailed for $40. That's around £30 here in the UK, though not factoring in any shipping costs. It was designed by Sony's own artists, and has a 100oz capacity.</p>
<p>"Elevate your movie snack game with the limited-edition Ghost of Yōtei Popcorn Bucket," the description reads, with Alamo Drafthouse calling it "the perfect keepsake for any aspiring warrior".</p>
<p>A perfect keepsake it may well be, but even though the popcorn bucket was only revealed last night, it has already sold out online. Sorry for any of you who were looking forward to reaching into a Ghost of Yōtei-themed food vessel, but that chap just simply isn't available any more. I have popped my email address into the 'Notify Me When Available' tab, so will let you know if this changes.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can check out how the Ghost of Yōtei Popcorn Bucket looks from different angles below.</p>

<p>While this popcorn bucket isn't currently available for purchase, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-limited-edition-ghost-of-yotei-ps5-bundles-with-designs-rooted-in-traditional-japanese-art-announced">PlayStation and developer Sucker Punch have also got some Ghost of Yōtei-themed PS5s and controllers</a> in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Revealed during last week's dedicated Ghost of Yōtei State of Play - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yoteis-gorgeous-gameplay-deep-dive-reveals-refined-combat-lo-fi-beats-mode-and-more">which provided us with an overview of gameplay, different modes, weapons and more</a> - this hardware is "rooted in traditional Japanese art".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-popcorn-bucket-proves-bizarrely-popular-sells-out-within-hours]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The next round of Everdark Sovereigns will be added to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> on 31st July, with four enhanced Nightlords available to beat.</p>
<p>In a nod towards live service updates, these <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-update-brings-new-challenges-and-a-welcome-live-service-twist">extra challenging Everdark Sovereigns were added to the game on a rotating basis last month</a>, with three added individually over three weeks. Then, last week, FromSoftware announced these would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-nightfarers-youll-get-another-chance-to-beat-elden-ring-nightreigns-sovereign-super-bosses">rotate again before new additions arrived</a>.</p>
<p>Now we know the enhanced Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast and Fissure in the Fog will arrive on 31st July - so that's immediately after the current rotation concludes.</p>

<p>While not confirmed, presumably these will be added to the game one at a time on a rotating basis over the course of four weeks. And after that? Perhaps they'll come round again.</p>
<p>Still, what players are really after is a duo mode. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">FromSoftware confirmed at the start of last month the mode is on the way</a>, but no further details have been provided.</p> <div>

<p>We also know DLC is on the way and due before the end of the year, but it's unknown when or what this will include. While more content will be very welcome, it's somewhat frustrating this isn't being doled out more frequently.</p>
<p>Still, we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-things-wed-love-to-see-in-elden-ring-nightreigns-dlc">speculated on what we'd like to see in the Elden Ring: Nightreign DLC</a>, from new Nightfarers to more classic Dark Souls bosses.</p>
<p>And after that?
