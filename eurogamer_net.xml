            <p>The Witcher author Andrzej Sapkowski has discussed a key plot point in the video game series that was actually a mistake in his novels, but "video game people have clung to the idea with remarkable tenacity".</p>
<p>Sapkowski took part in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1nuhirk/asynchronous_ama_andrzej_sapkowski_answers/">reddit AMA</a> yesterday, where one user asked for his thoughts on the additional Witcher schools added to the games.</p>
<p>"The issue of 'witcher schools' requires - I apologise - a longer explanation," Sapkowski began. "A single sentence about some 'school of the Wolf' mysteriously made its way into The Last Wish. I later deemed it unworthy of development and narratively incorrect, even detrimental to the plot. Therefore, later I never included or referenced any Witcher Gryffindors or Slytherins again. Never.</p>

<p>"However, that one sentence was enough. Adaptors, particularly video game people, have clung to the idea with remarkable tenacity and have wonderfully multiplied these 'witcher schools'. Completely unnecessary."</p>
<p>Sapkowski added he was "uncertain about what to do with this situation", and provided a couple of suggestions without confirming which route he'll take.</p>
<p>The path of least resistance, he said, would be to remove the sentence in future editions of The Last Wish, but he may also "expand and clarify the matter somehow in subsequent books". He continued: "Perhaps I'll shed some light on the issue of Witcher medallions, their significance, and their connection to specific individuals? There are many possibilities, and the sky is the limit."</p><p>The idea of Witcher schools certainly appears core to CD Projekt Red's forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. The game was first teased with an image of a medallion, which the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-red-confirms-new-witcher-medallion-is-a-lynx">studio later confirmed was shaped after a lynx</a>. This led fans to believe the game would focus on Ciri and a new Witcher school of the Lynx.</p>
<p>Sapkowski was also asked for his thoughts more broadly on adaptations of his work (like the games and Netflix's TV series), which he believes are inherently inferior.</p>
<p>"I'll put it this way: there's the original and then there are adaptations," he said. "Regardless of the quality of these adaptations, there are no dependencies or points of convergence between the literary original and its adaptation. The original stands alone, and every adaptation stands alone; you can't translate words into images without losing something, and there can't be any connections here.</p>
<p>"Moreover, adaptations are mostly visualisations, which means transforming written words into images, and there is no need to prove the superiority of the written word over images, it is obvious. The written word always and decidedly triumphs over images, and no picture - animated or otherwise - can match the power of the written word."</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Sapkowski doesn't listen to the "Toss a Coin to Your Witcher" song very often as he's "not particularly susceptible to songs". And his favourite dinosaur is a Pterodactyl.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-unreal-tech-demo-was-running-on-a-standard-ps5-at-60fps-with-ray-tracing">tech demo for The Witcher 4 was shown earlier this year at the State of Unreal stream</a>, though CDPR later confirmed this was simply a tech demo and wouldn't necessarily be indicative of the final game.</p>

            <p>An early copy of this week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> patch notes has been accidentally leaked on the official French Borderlands 4 website, giving us a peek at a massive buff for the game's most underwhelming vault hunter.</p>
<p>The leak, <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/fr-FR/borderlands-4/update-notes/">which can be viewed here</a>, remains labelled as the 25th September's patch notes. However, scrolling down provides a substantial list of changes to each of the four playable vault hunters that'll be added to the game later this week. While we don't know when this week we can expect this patch, this leak makes clear that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-best-amon-build">Amon</a> is getting a staggering 66 buffs across all three of his skill trees.</p>
<p>These include bug fixes, so his Primal Surge passive now properly restores shields and ammo, as well as a fix for his Crucible Axes which should now properly detect nearby enemies when used. In addition, Wall of Flame has been changed so Vengeance cannot be triggered by it prior to the activation of Scourge. If this all sounds like a bunch of gibberish, in short this means Amon's kit now works like it's meant to.</p>

<p>Then comes a wave of numerical buffs to various abilities across each of Amon's skill trees. There are too many to dive into them all, but highlights include Scourge's maximum Vengeance being increased by 50 percent allowing Amon to absorb and deal more damage with the whip. The whip got a flat 27 percent damage increase too, which is chunky.</p><p>The Onslaughter action skill has earned itself a 78 percent damage boost which is massive, and it now also can hit enemies equipped with shields more consistently which is a nice bug fix. Also on the same skill tree as the Onslaughter action skill, we've seen both Fellfrost and Fulminating Fist get a 71 percent and 69 percent damage boost respectively. So in short, a good time to be an Amon player.</p>
<p>These buffs and more are expected to drop later this week, and a substantial number of the changes seem to be focused on balancing things out for endgame players. It's worth noting a lot of these changes are giant buffs and bug fixes, while the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-best-vex-build"> popular Vex knife crit build</a> currently melting bosses remains untouched.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 is getting a steady stream of patches and updates aimed at polishing the experience post-launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-patch-adds-fov-sliders-somehow-both-improves-and-worsens-stability-at-the-same-time">with prior patches focused largely on improving performance across all platforms</a>.

            <p>A new UK game studio has been launched by Tom Stone, former managing director of TT Games - the studio behind the Lego Star Wars, Batman, and Harry Potter games - to create a game based on Peter Pan.</p>
<p>Second Star Games, based in Manchester, comprises industry veterans (including developers from the Lego games) and is in collaboration with Great Ormond Street Hospital Charity.</p>
<p>And as you may have guessed from the studio name, it's working on a fantasy-adventure game called Neverland: A Peter Pan Adventure, with details expected soon.</p>
<p>The Neverland game is where GOSH comes in - the hospital charity owns the rights to Peter Pan, which were donated by author J.M. Barrie back in 1929.</p>
<p>As such, royalties from all sales of the game will go to GOSH Charity, raising funds to help treat seriously ill children across the UK.</p>
<p>While details of the game are yet to be revealed, some concept art has been shared.</p>

<p>"We are delighted to be working with expert partners Second Star Games to bring the magical world of Neverland to life for a generation of young gamers," said GOSH Charity's senior brand licensing manager Jenny Martin.</p>
<p>"Neverland, a place of adventure and imagination, provides an amazing backdrop to what we know will be a first-class game. What's more, every game sold will help raise funds to support seriously ill children at Great Ormond Street Hospital. We can't wait for this next chapter in our Neverland journey."</p>
<p>Grahame 'Chily' Chilton will be the lead investor in Second Star, following his investment into the first Lego Star Wars game and his previous role on the GOSH Charity fundraising board.</p>

            <p>A stealth patch to Prototype has stoked the fires of hope surrounding a remaster of the beloved third-person gory super hero action game, thanks to some mysterious additions to the games' credits. It also broke a bunch of mods in the process, unfortunately.</p>
<p>The patch, which was introduced on the 29th September, came without prior warning nor any fanfare, with the game receiving no Steam news post to coincide with the update. Instead, Prototype's loyal community had to dig in and figure out what was going on.</p>
<p>These players discovered a real surprise when they hit the game's credits, as several new companies' now appear. This includes staff at Iron Galaxy, the Activision-owned developer that previously worked on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>, as well as the Spyro Reignited Trilogy. There's also a mention of a Ubisoft Connect Version, which does not exist.</p>

<p>Further digging was done by some of the game's better known modders and dataminers, who delved into the game post-update for further discoveries. User Nixson discovered locomotion and parkour tests previously absent from the game, which indicate some degree of fresh testing being done in-game. These findings were then<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PrototypeGame/comments/1nu2oqp/prototype_remaster_might_just_be_in_the_works/"> posted on the Prototype Reddit</a>, where remaining fans gathered in excitement.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jxhctt/upcoming_call_of_duty_black_ops_7_leaks_and/">Rumours surrounding a Prototype remaster have been circulating since earlier this year</a>, though further breadcrumbs have been absent ever since. So while this patch has reignited hype around a potential Prototype remaster, a sad side effect is that mods for the game appear to have been broken by this update. Thankfully, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/prototype/mods/52">crucial mods like PrototypeFix</a>, which resolves crashing issues on modern hardware, have been updated and now work without issue.</p>
<p>If you've not played Prototype, why not check out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prototype-review">Eurogamer's old Prototype review</a>. In it, Tom Bramwell wrote: "Prototype is a game of riotous, gore-splattering ultraviolence. That's all it wants to be, and in many respects it does a solid, and often spectacular job. The victims may be plot, atmosphere and the difficulty curve, but then great power always comes at a cost."</p>
