            <p>Sony has announced the three monthly games coming to PS Plus in August, available for Premium, Extra, and Essential subscribers.</p>
<p>The three games, available from 5th August, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lies of P (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Day Z (PS4)</li>
<li>My Hero One's Justice 2 (PS4)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> is absolutely the biggest draw here, the popular Pinocchio-inspired soulslike from South Korean developer Round 8 Studio.</p>
<p>The game recently received a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-overture-difficulty-options">DLC expansion called Overture</a>, but presumably that's not included in this PS Plus offer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Those keen to get their hands on Xbox's recently announced handheld consoles ROG Ally and Ally X may be able to preorder the devices as of next month.</p>
<p>According to the ever reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-vous-devoile-la-date-douverture-des-ventes-60300">Dealabs</a>, preorders will go live on 20th August. That's the day <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> kicks off, with the convention in Cologne running between 20th and 24th August. During this time, attendees will be able to go <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-xbox-branded-asus-handheld-finally-gets-an-official-reveal">hands-on with the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X</a>.</p>
<p>Dealabs added that the devices will be priced thus: €599 for the Xbox Ally and €899 for the Xbox Ally X. That's around £518 and £777 here in the UK. Current suggestion is Xbox's handheld devices will then be available in October, although an exact date has not yet been specified. Previously, Xbox said the devices would be available this "holiday" period, across select countries.</p>

<p>The Xbox ROG Ally and ROG Ally X are both powered by Windows 11, and feature an "immersive" full-screen Xbox experience, plus an aggregated gaming library with access to installed games from a range of PC stores, including Steam, Battle.net, and GOG. And, of course, the machine supports Xbox Play Anywhere titles, of which there are now over 1,000.</p>
<p>Those opting for the standard Xbox ROG Ally can expect an AMD Ryzen Z2 A Processor within, alongside 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage, while the Ally X upgrades that to an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor and 24GB of high-speed RAM.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Xbox laid out its Gamescom plans, when it confirmed that not only will those in attendance be able to give the ROG Ally and Ally X a shot, but also that<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-has-laid-out-its-gamescom-plans-and-they-include-a-playable-demo-of-hollow-knight-silksong"> its booth will include a playable demo of Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Other games available to try out on the company's upcoming handheld devices include Roblox, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-handheld-consoles-rog-ally-and-ally-x-preorders-open-during-gamescom-report-says]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers will continue to receive updates, its developer has promised, to optimise performance and adjust its difficulty.</p>
<p>The soulslike game released last week and immediately hit a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuchang-fallen-feathers-follows-in-black-myth-wukongs-footsteps-with-strong-steam-launch">strong peak concurrent player count on Steam</a>, but the reaction was mixed due to poor performance on both PC and consoles. Leenzee, the game's developer, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuchang-fallen-feathers-studio-acknowledges-performance-issues-patch-on-the-way">quickly released patches to address performance issues</a>.</p>
<p>That's set to continue, as the studio yesterday released a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/">blog post on Steam</a> detailing further planned adjustments.</p>

<p>Many of those adjustments focus on performance and visuals. Players can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed crashes across different devices</li>
<li>Improveed frame rates and reduce lag on certain graphics cards</li>
<li>Optimised default settings for some graphics cards</li>
<li>Enhanced texture quality in low-resolution areas</li>
<li>Improved asset detail and precision in some regions</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, Leenzee will make some balance tweaks in response to the game's difficulty.</p>
<p>One of the biggest changes will be correcting the speed of getting up after being knocked down. Right now, the game's difficulty can feel cheap due to how long it takes for Wuchang (the player character) to get up, often leading to players getting stunlocked in long combos.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the number of traps will be reduced along with the damage dealt, certain low-level monsters will have their resistances lowered, and monsters and bosses will see improved AI logic.</p>
<p>As a soulslike, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers thrives on high challenge. However, the difficulty curve can be a little erratic at times, with some bosses feeling significantly more difficult than others.</p>
<p>"First and foremost, we sincerely apologise for the inconvenience and appreciate everyone for their continued patience and understanding regarding the recent issues surrounding the launch of Wuchang: Fallen Feathers," wrote Leenzee on Steam. "Your experience and feedback is so valuable foundation for our team. We will provide a comprehensive explanation about the game content soon.</p>
<p>"Since the game's launch, we have been closely monitoring all community channels. Every voice - from criticism to suggestions - has been received, carefully listened to, and actively discussed to find solutions."</p>
<p>Leenzee's efforts follow others in the genre, after the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> all received plenty of updates tweaking the level of difficulty.</p>
<p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers reached a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2277560/charts/">new peak concurrent player count</a> a few days ago of over 131K players. This is higher than the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sekiro-tips-and-tricks-6009">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a>.</p>
<p>"Familiarity stalks you at every turn in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, a competent, cool and pretty soulslike with a nice twist on death but few true surprises," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review">Wuchang review</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/wuchang-fallen-feathers-studio-to-continue-optimising-performance-and-rebalance-cheap-difficulty]]></content:encoded>
