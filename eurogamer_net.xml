            <p>
Excitement continues to mount ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' release next month, but if there's one big question mark around the whole thing, it's just what sort of performance improvements Capcom has been cooking up since its rather wobby public beta. And the publisher has now given a brief update on performance, alongside confirmation it's "looking into" lowering the game's recommended GPU requirements on PC.
</p>
<p>
Monster Hunter Wilds' first public beta went live last October, and it immediately became clear there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-has-graphical-problems-but-capcom-promises-final-game-in-a-better-state">still work to be done</a> on the performance front. Players soon took to the internet highlighting everything from erratic framerates, even on decently beefy PCs, to unfortunate visual glitches making the whole thing look like Capcom's lead platform was the N64.
</p>
<p>
At the time, the publisher moved to remind players Monster Hunter Wilds was "still in development", offering assurances the full game was "already in a more improved state compared to the beta test", and that it was "committed to ensuring the quality of the final product." There was hope among fans some of these improvements might be evident in Monster Hunter Wilds' second open beta, scheduled to run from 7th-9th February, but Capcom recently confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-gets-second-open-beta-ahead-of-february-release">that wouldn't be the case</a>.

<p>
The company has, though, now provided a short update on performance, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a>'s <a href="https://x.com/DEMonsterHunter/status/1880661617249034446">official German social media channel</a> recently posting (as per Google translate) that the team "has been addressing rendering issues from the open beta test and is continually working on improvements for launch". These assurances were accompanied by a video offering what Capcom called a "look at our updated Prioritise Performance more for PS5", albeit not a particularly illuminating one given the less-than-stellar quality of X's video player. Prioritise Performance mode (AKA Prioritise Framerate) targets up to 60fps on PS5 and Xbox Series X, compared to 30fps when using Prioritise Graphics mode.
</p><p>
Capcom also noted it's aiming to improve PC performance in a "similar way", and that it's additionally "looking into whether we can lower the recommended GPU requirements". The publisher raised a few eyebrows last September, when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-specs-revealed">revealed</a> Monster Hunter Wilds would require an RTX 2070 Super/RTX 4060/RX 6700XT to reach 60fps (with Frame Generation) at 1080p, so word there may be improvements here - particularly given the open beta's erratic performance on mid-range hardware - is encouraging.
</p>
<p>
Monster Hunter Wilds launches for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 on 28th February, and the Character Creation, Story Trial and Slay Doshaguma Quest seen in last year's first open beta will all be available again when beta #2 kicks off earlier in the month.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale was quite taken with Monster Hunter Wilds' "familiar thrill of the hunt, player customisation, and extravagant combat" when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-cuts-out-the-clunk-and-plays-like-the-most-streamlined-beginner-friendly-entry-yet">went hands-on in August</a>, so hopefully Capcom can iron our those remaining wrinkles before launch.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> developer Bend Studio says it "still plans on creating cool shit", following Sony's decision to cancel its unannounced live-service game - amid claims Bend and the similarly affected Bluepoint only found out about the cancellations "at the same time as everyone else".
</p>
<p>
Word that Sony had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">cancelled two more first-party live service games</a> - this time in development at its Bend and Bluepoint studios - emerged via by Bloomberg last week. Sony, of course, announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">plans to invest heavily in live service titles</a> back in 2022, under the watch of then-PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, but the company has cancelled numerous live service games - including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/footage-of-insomniacs-seemingly-canceled-live-service-spider-man-the-great-web-appears-online">co-op Spider-man from developer Insomniac</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">The Last of Us multiplayer game</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-studio-firesprite-has-been-shedding-talent-amidst-accusations-of-toxic-culture-staff-say">Twisted Metal project at Firesprite</a> - since Ryan's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-two-playstation-ceos-to-replace-jim-ryan">departure last year</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for the latest casualties of Sony's apparent strategic rethink, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier claimed Bluepoint had been developing an unannounced live service God of War game. And while no details of Bend's canned project were shared, the studio previously said it was working on a new IP which would include multiplayer and "[build] upon the open-world systems of Days Gone". It's unclear, however, if this is the same game that's now been axed.

<p>
Regardless, Bend has now broken its silence following the news, thanking fans for their support and offering assurances it's not done yet. "I'll keep this short," Bend community manager Kevin McAllister wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/vikingdad278/status/1880403782976307623">message shared on social media</a>. "Thanks for the love and support everyone, especially to those that have reached out. P.S. We still plan on creating cool shit."
</p><p>
As to what's next for Bluepoint and Bend, that remains uncertain. According to journalist Jeff Grubb in his latest Game Mess Mornings video show (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bluepoint-and-bend-staff-learned-their-live-service-ps5-games-were-cancelled-at-the-same-time-as-everyone-else/">VGC</a>), both teams have had little time to process the news. "The two studios found out at the same time as everyone else," Grubb told listeners, "so people will be going into work today wondering, 'Hey, okay, what are we doing next?'. And what they're going to have to do next, very likely, is pitch something to Sony, and the landscape of that has changed pretty drastically.”
</p>
<p>
"A couple of years ago," he continued, "you'd bring to PlayStation your pitch, that is: 'It's a live service game, we know you want to hear that'... And now they have to go back to the drawing board, and come up with a pitch that PlayStation wants to hear, when no one really knows what they want to hear, and so it's a rough situation."
</p>
<p>
<em><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Bloomberg's Jason Schreier has weighed on Grubb's claims, calling them "not true". In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lg6yoxuvs22e">post on BlueSky</a>, Shreier wrote, "People across the org were informed [of the cancellations] before my article went out last week." Sony is yet to respond to Eurogamer's request for comment, but we'll updated the story if it provides clarity on the situation.</em>
</p>
<p>
Following last week's cancellations, Sony told Bloomberg "neither of the two affected PlayStation studios will be shut down", adding that the "highly accomplished teams" would be "working closely with each studio to determine what are the next projects".
</p>
<p>
Sony's continuing shift away from live service titles follows the high-profile failure of last year's Concord, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">pulled from sale just two weeks after its launch</a> amid low player numbers. Back in 2023 it was reported the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-live-service-pivot-may-not-pay-off-the-way-jim-ryan-had-once-hoped-says-industry-insider">company was "uncomfortable"</a> about former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan's decision to focus heavily on live service games.
