            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> actor Charlie Cox has vowed to play the game after all the praise he's received, despite only spending four hours in the recording booth and knowing very little about it.</p>
<p>The actor, known for his roles in Daredevil and Stardust, voices Gustave in Sandfall Interactive's well-praised RPG. But Cox hasn't played a game since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a>.</p>
<p>"I remember being in the studio and thinking, 'this is beautiful, the visuals are extraordinary'," Cox said during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHK8HD2scfY">Q&amp;A at GalaxyCon</a> in New Orleans. "They've come a long way since Mario 64, which is probably the last computer game I played."</p>

<p>Previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/daredevils-charlie-cox-feels-like-a-total-fraud-following-clair-obscur-expedition-33-praise">Cox revealed he recorded most of his lines for the game in a single four hour session</a> and now feels "like a total fraud". He reiterated this point at GalaxyCon after being confused by a fan question, as he's unfamiliar with the full game.</p>
<p>"I wanna play the game," he said. "I need to play the game. I need to get a console first, and then I need to play the game."</p>
<p>When the fan told him he did a fantastic job, he replied: "People keep telling me that and I feel like a fraud because I just did the voice."</p>

            <p>The voice actors for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s Toad and Peach have been announced, following the surprise recasting of Samantha Kelly last month.</p>
<p>Back in June, Kelly - who had voiced Toad and Princess Peach for 18 years - revealed she would no longer be providing their vocals for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> era. This came as a surprise to Kelly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/princess-peach-voice-actor-confirms-shes-been-replaced-after-18-years-in-the-role">who was only informed by Nintendo when Mario Kart World released without her name attached to the project</a>.</p>
<p>"I'm grateful that I got to do these voices for so many years. Peach and Toad are such strong and beautiful characters that I pray they live forever no matter who voices them," Kelly said at the time. "Thank you for so many years of friendship and joy. I'm sad that it's over, I truly would have wanted to voice Peach and Toad forever."</p>
<p>Now, Toad and Peach's new voice actors have been revealed, and they are played by Paul Castro Jr. and Courtney Lin respectively. Castro Jr.has also lent his vocals to the likes of NEO: The World Ends with You, while Lin's previous credits include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/neon-white">Neon White</a>.</p>

<p>Sharing the news, <a href="https://x.com/PaulCastroJr/status/1947503212095017462">Castro Jr. called the role of Toad a "childhood dream"</a>, adding he "can't thank Nintendo enough" for the opportunity.</p>
<p>Lin, meanwhile, <a href="https://x.com/thecourtneylin/status/1947399822946013624">said she was "eternally grateful" to Nintendo for "trusting me to help carry the legacy of this icon"</a>. Lin also voiced Baby Peach in Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>"These characters are so much bigger than ourselves. I am so honoured and honestly can still hardly believe it. I have so much respect for all of the Peaches that came before me, especially the one I grew up with," Lin continued. "I will do my best with every opportunity I am given, and I hope you all have been enjoying the game. Wahooo!! Sweet."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's been five years since artist Alexander "Red888guns" Berezin's efforts to reimagine the grim world of Fallout as a 3D Doom-style shooter had us wondering what a more substantial version of their vision might look like. And finally we have an answer thanks to a newly shared, and stunningly atmospheric, Fallout: Bakersfield trailer.
</p>
<p>
When Fallout: Bakersfield <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-fallout-re-imagined-in-3d-looks-incredible">first came to our attention</a>, it was little more than an animated gif, presenting a vision of what Fallout's originally isometric universe - or more specifically, the ghoul city of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/necropolis">Necropolis</a> (AKA Bakersfield, California) - might look like when presented using the first-person action and iconography of the original Doom. But since then, Red888guns has been turning that proof-of-concept into something closer to reality.
</p>
<p>
Two years later, Red888guns gave us our <a href="https://youtu.be/FMjJM9HAqqk?si=U1v0Vkd-651-5UWz">first progress update on the project</a>, improving on that once mostly static image with approximately ten seconds of footage featuring a player blasting their way through an enormously atmospheric slice of first-person action, built using the GZDoom Engine. And with a few more years having passed since then, we've finally been given another taste, and the results are more impressive than ever.

<p>
Red888guns' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e8WrmOibpM">latest Fallout: Bakersfield reveal</a> begins with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fr1KDYGkeo">nod to Fallout 1's trailer</a>, the camera slowly zooming out from an old-fashioned transistor radio (rather than the black and white television set) to reveal the surrounding ghoul-populated desolation of Bakersfield, all to the old-school warbling of the Ink Spots' I'd Climb The Highest Mountain.
</p>
<p>
From there, as the mood darkens, the trailer switches to a player-controlled first-person camera, initially as our jumpsuited protagonist quietly explores the filthy, decimated world, and next as they confront a group of gun-toting mutants using a blood-stained knife. After that there's some shooting, some classic Fallout fridge looting, and even a dialogue tree conversation with a big bad before things go seriously south.
</p>
<p>
Red888guns (who's also serving as an artist on developer New Blood's long-teased but still unannounced Fallout-inspired CRPG) is developing Fallout: Bakersfield alongside Denis Berezin, and a brief progress update at the end of the trailer reveals their non-commercial Doom 1993 total conversion is 60 percent complete. A heavily obfuscated release date is also seen, confirming it'll be out ??.??.202?. So mark your calendars as best you can.
</p>
<p>
Fallout, of course, has had something of resurgence in recent times, thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-series-passes-impressive-viewer-milestone-after-six-months">Amazon's well-received live-action TV adaptation</a>. Season two - which visits a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-leaks-give-first-look-at-new-vegas">much-loved location</a> - airs this December, and in the game itself, last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-fan-made-mod-out-today">saw the release of the impressive Fallout: London</a>.

            <p>
Stop Killing Games figurehead Ross Scott says "serious accusations" and "false claims" have been filed against the game preservation movement's European initiative, accusing the campaign of violating EU rules. All this comes as support continues to gain momentum, with the official EU petition having now surpassed 1.4m signatures.
</p>
<p>
Scott <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQN_ZA5WRpo">discussed the latest developments</a> in a video update on YouTube, revealing the <a href="https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2024/000007_en">Stop Destroying Videogames EU initiative</a> - which he reiterated is distinct from the Stop Killing Games campaign and has its own organisers, despite often being discussed under the same banner - had "received a serious accusation from an anonymous source".
</p>
<p>
Specifically, Stop Destroying Videogames has been notified of a Transparency Complaint, claiming its campaign violates EU rules by failing to "provide clear, accurate and comprehensive information on the sources of funding for the initiative exceeding EUR 500 per sponsor". Stop Destroying Videogames is accused of including a "false 'no funding' declaration" on its petition and of "systemic concealment of major contribution".
</p>
<p>
Stop Destroying Videogames, for context, makes use of the European Citizens Initiative, an official EU mechanism designed to provide a way for citizens to propose a legal act to the European Commission. In Stop Destroying Videogames' case, the aim is to convince the EU to pass regulations preventing "the remote disabling of video games by the publishers, before providing reasonable means to continue functioning of said video games without the involvement from the side of the publisher." 
</p>
<p>
Stop Destroying Videogames' petition has <a href="https://x.com/accursedfarms/status/1947025316452454853">now surpassed 1.4m signatures</a>. That's well above the 1m needed for it to be submitted to the EU for verification and then, potentially, either progress to a public hearing or full debate session at the European Parliament - and, it's hoped, well above the threshold needed to ensure it stays above 1m after mistakes or deliberate spoofing are filtered out. However, a complaint potentially marks a bump in the road.
</p>
<p>
The gist of the complaint is that Scott's work as a volunteer on the EU initiative "far exceeds any reasonable volunteer threshold" and that "professional time investment constitutes quantifiable in-kind contribution under transparency regulations". The complaint also provides "evidence" - based on several seemingly off-the-cuff statements made by Scott and some imaginative maths - that his involvement equates to €63,000-147,000 in professional contributions, and, as such, a failure to declare this supposedly significant source of funding violates EU rules. 
</p>
<p>
The trouble is, the figure mentioned in the complaint is entirely speculative, based on an assumed hourly rate of €50-75, generated from an imagined 12-14 hours work a day across "many" weeks - an assumed workload Scott scoffed at, saying "that would have killed me", despite admitting to focussing on Stop Killing Games 12-14 hours a day on at least a "some" occasions. "Maybe that would mean something if I was a professional and had a rate for anything," he added, noting "nobody was hiring me for this, it's all volunteer time". Scott also stressed he's just a "promoter" of the EU initiative, and has "no actual authority" over the decisions its organisers make. "It's only my perception that this is my one chance to fix the problem of destroying games that's pushed me so hard," he said.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Scott rejects the claims made in the anonymous complaint, noting he's spent zero Euros on financial support. Moreover, he claims Stop Destroying Videogames' organisers "literally asked EU representatives if it was okay for me to assist them in the capacity I have been back in spring 2024... [and] they said what I've been doing is fine". The big question, though, is what impact, if any, the complaint could have on the EU initiative. Despite Scott's suggestion of potentially "serious" ramifications, the <a href="https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/how-it-works/faq_en">Citizens Initiatives website</a> only says the Commission will "contact the organisers of the initiative to establish the facts and ask them to correct any inaccuracies on funding/support", with no talk of specific penalties for violations.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the video sees a clearly frustrated Scott discussing what the complaint means for the future of the campaign, his own involvement, and how supporters can respond. Much of it, however, is based on Scott's apparently unsubstantiated assumption the complaint was filed by a games industry representative, despite him earlier admitting, "We'll never know [where the complaint came from], it's anonymous".
</p>
<p>
"I'll just say the timing of this is awfully hot on the heels of an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-proposals-for-game-preservation-prohibitively-expensive-major-publishers-insist">industry lobby group giving some very bad statements about the movement</a>," he continued, "in some cases I think outright lying about it. But I don't know it was them; maybe it was a different lobbying group or maybe it was just some political hatchet man hired by the industry. But someone was trying to kill the initiative, filing paperwork to the European Union accusing the initiative and myself of violating the rules, maybe even committing a crime, I'm not sure. That's not small thing. This is the industry playing dirty now."
</p>
<p>
The sense, perhaps, is the campaign's escalating visibility is starting to make Scott uneasy - "I am so out of my league on this...," he says at one point, "I have never been a political target before, so this is all uncharted territory for me" - but he ends on an upbeat note to supporters, highlighting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-stop-killing-games-momentum-continues-top-eu-politician-offers-support-a-game-once-sold-belongs-to-the-customer">a number of European parliament members are now among them</a>. "I have no idea what's coming down the pipeline now," he concluded, "but all this resistance means we're throwing around some real power to fix things so let's keep at it."
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-aims-to-mount-political-and-legal-challenges-to-games-going-offline">inadvertently kickstarted the Stop Killing Games campaign</a> when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">took The Crew offline</a> last year, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-own-shareholders-demand-response-to-the-stop-killing-games-consumer-movement">recently asked about the initiative</a> during a shareholder meeting. "We are doing our best to make sure that things go well for all players and buyers, because obviously, support for all games cannot last forever," Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot ventured in response. "But clearly this is a far-reaching issue, and we're working on it."
