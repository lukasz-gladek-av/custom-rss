            <p>Nowadays everything is an Xbox, and that includes Sony's PS5. Last month, the console's best-selling games all came from its rival publisher.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/05/playstation-store-april-2025s-top-downloads/?sf277169095=1">shared by Sony</a>, the number one downloaded game on PS5 for April in Europe was the newly-released <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a>, followed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> and Minecraft.</p>
<p>In the US and Canada it was a similar story: Oblivion top, followed by Minecraft and Forza Horizon 5.</p>

<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> was also a best-seller (fourth in Europe, sixth in the US) - a game that has been heavily promoted by Xbox and is also available on Game Pass.</p>
<p>Additionally, the previously Xbox exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> has been selling well on Sony's console, too.</p>
<p>Microsoft began its <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/">"This is an Xbox" campaign</a> in November last year as it builds a "future defined by player choice".</p>
<p>It's been heavily memed, but clearly it's working as games previously exclusive to Xbox consoles make their way to PS5 and top the charts.</p>
<p>Indeed, as we reported back in January this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-the-top-selling-game-on-xbox-and-playstation-last-quarter">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was the best-selling game across both Xbox and PlayStation</a> over the previous quarter. Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">notoriously acquired Activision</a> - and the rights to Call of Duty - back in 2023 for $68.7bn.</p>
<p>Oblivion Remastered released at the end of April and has seen big success on Steam as well as on consoles - within its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-off-to-a-good-start-on-steam">first day it reached a peak of 182,298 concurrent players</a>, which has since risen to 216,784.</p>
<p>"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> is deservedly one of Xbox's most successful franchises," wrote Eurogamer's Tom Orry on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-now-has-one-of-the-greatest-racing-games-of-all-time-and-it-feels-like-im-cheating-on-my-xbox">one of the greatest racing games of all time</a>.

            <p>Someone has already decoded the strange, banana-like text in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. They have found the mon-key to unlocking it all, if you will. </p>
<p>As shared by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/random-youtuber-cracks-donkey-kong-bananzas-secret-language-before-launch">Nintendo Life</a>, last week YouTuber 2Chrispy released a video detailing how he had gone about deciphering the strange text seen throughout Donkey Kong Bananza's trailers, gameplay footage, website and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">even the Nintendo Today app</a>.</p>

<p>The YouTuber said after he spotted the language in Donkey Kong Bananza, he began to wonder if Nintendo had in fact hidden a secret alphabet in its upcoming game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/imagining-and-deciphering-writing-systems-for-games">much like it had done in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>. And, it turns out it has.</p>
<p>Thanks to more patience than I could ever hope to possess and a good recollection of the Nintendo Treehouse presentation, 2Chrispy used the in-game term 'Chip Exchange' as a starting point. As a reminder, because I had forgotten, during Nintendo's Donkey Kong Banaza Treehouse stream, a notice appeared when the player picked up a Banandium Chip. "Trade these for bananas at any Chip Exchange," this pop up read.</p>
<p>2Chrispy realised the symbol for the Banandium Chip also showed up in the game above a sign with that strange text. The YouTuber noticed the text beneath this symbol had the same number of characters as the word 'Exchange'. Additionally, the text started and ended with the same symbol, which looked a bit like a back to front E. Using this new found information, he started to fill out his "Bananabet", looking for recurring patterns in the game's text and using tools such as a word finder to keep the decoding efforts going.</p>
<p>Other words 2Chrispy managed to find included the likes of 'Welcome' and 'Hint'. There is even an in-game sign players will be able to find, which according to 2Chrispy's translations reads:</p>
<p>"Message. Thank you for reading. Someone."</p>
<p>All in all, this really is quite an impressive feat from the YouTuber, and if you are interested in Donkey Kong Bananza's world building, I really suggest checking out 2Chrispy's video (see below). It's a fascinating and really rather engaging watch.</p>

            <p>Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida has addressed the debate around rising game prices, and discussed the "impossible equation" of inflation and expensive development costs.</p>
<p>Nintendo has been criticised by some fans for the increased price of its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">Switch 2 games</a>, with launch game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> costing £75/$80 - something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">Nintendo has called an example of "variable pricing"</a>. Microsoft, meanwhile, has said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">some new first-party Xbox games will rise to $80 beginning later this year</a>. Reports have also suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">the forthcoming GTA 6 could cost as much as £80/$100</a>. </p>
<p>Speaking to French outlet <a href="https://playstationinside.fr/interview-shuhei-yoshida-playstation-inside-english-version">PlayStation Inside</a>, Yoshida gave his view on the current situation.</p>

<p>"I think it was going to happen sooner or later, maybe not from Nintendo, but it was going to happen eventually," he said. "We live in contrasting times, where inflation is real and significant, but people expect games that are ever more ambitious and therefore expensive to develop to cost the same. It's an impossible equation."</p>
<p>Yoshida stated the "heart of the matter lies in production costs", as nowadays games are "more technologically demanding than ever before".</p>
<p>He suggests that the "proliferation of remasters and remakes" is a way for the industry to diversify, with these projects being "a kind of 'easy' solution to bring in profits that ultimately help finance new games".</p>
<p>"So I don't know if Rockstar will jump at the chance to set the price of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> at €90 or more, to speak with your currency, but the situation is this," said Yoshida. "And we could even add subscription platforms and games as a service, which, while providing huge revenues in their own right, also help to finance AAA down the line."</p>
<p>He then pointed to the recent release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> from French studio Sandfall Interactive as an example of AA success. The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-500k-sales-in-one-day">hit a million sales within three days</a> and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-calls-clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-shining-example-of-french-audacity">praised by French President Macron</a>.</p>
<p>"In any case, a balance must be found between production costs and game prices," said Yoshida. "GTA 6 will obviously be a case in point, but if you take the example of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the game is just as phenomenal visually, despite the fact that the team only has around thirty people. This is one of the ways forward, I think, because you can make excellent games with tighter teams and budgets without compromising quality."</p>
<p>One potential way of reducing costs is using AI, which Yoshida discussed elsewhere in the interview. He believes AI can be used "creatively to improve games" but stated "AI are tools, not ends in themselves".</p>
<p>"AI will become a very important tool in the future if developers learn to use its good features," he said. "We're already seeing this today, and in any case it should be seen as a simple continuation of what has always been done in video games, because AI has been used in video games for as long as they have existed in reality.</p>
<p>"Designers and developers therefore need to master these new generative tools. It's just a matter of time, as long as we keep human artists at the heart of the project. Generative AI and its other emanations can and should be used to speed up processes and tedious tasks that don't impact on the artistic aspect of games, especially for small studios that don't have the manpower. This could also help to lower game production costs, making the video game economy more viable – as long as it doesn't lead to redundancies, of course."</p>
<p>As for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, he's most looking forward to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-focus-hasnt-shifted-to-multiplayer-miyazaki-says-despite-elden-ring-nightreign-and-the-duskbloods">Duskbloods from FromSoftware</a>. "I'm curious to see what FromSoftware will do with a Switch exclusive on a technical level, and it's always interesting to see what they come up with, especially after Elden Ring," he said.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement">Yoshida left PlayStation last year</a>, he's been particularly vocal with his views on the industry: he stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-losing-their-identity-former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida-shares-damning-switch-2-verdict">Nintendo is losing its identity</a> following the Switch 2 reveal, he admitted to playing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-was-great-former-playstation-exec-says-but-naughty-dog-couldnt-make-it-alongside-new-ip">Naughty Dog's ill-fate The Last of Us Online</a>, and claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nier-automata-revived-the-japanese-games-industry-says-former-sony-exec-shuhei-yoshida">NieR: Automata revived the Japanese games industry</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is a big game with a lot of side characters and you can traverse its world relatively freely - so freely that, 40 hours since you last saw someone, it can often be difficult to remember who they were, and why they wanted you to go kill that dude. 
</p>
<p>
Well, today's 1.0.4 update for Assassin's Creed Shadows addresses this by adding in Codex entries for the game's main cast of characters, sidekicks, antagonists and supporting antagonists, which will unlock as you meet them.
</p>
<p>
It's something that previous <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-games-order">Assassin's Creed games</a> had previously but which Shadows eschewed, keeping its Codex more for historical and cultural details. Now it's back, following feedback from fans.

<p>
Today's Assassin's Creed Shadows update is set to go live at 2pm UK time (10am Eastern, 7am Pacific) and weigh in at around 4.6GB on PS5, 8.5GB on Steam or 20GB on Xbox Series X/S.
</p>
<p>
As previously announced, today also brings the first of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-post-launch-roadmap-features-regular-new-story-missions-parkour-updates-new-game-plus">Shadows' free post-launch story missions that add more moments with some of the game's secondary characters</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The Works of Luis Frois centres on Yasuke's Jesuit friend who you meet a couple of times during Shadows' existing runtime. Today's new quest can be played by either Yasuke or Naoe, and also features Lady Satoko. Who is she? Well, you can now go remind yourself in the Codex.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's post-launch roadmap for Assassin's Creed Shadows looks set to offer another of these free story quests on a monthly basis - similar to the Lost Tales of Greece offered for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a> back in the day. Shadows' first paid expansion, meanwhile, will launch later in 2025.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the changes in today's patch are mostly minor bug fixes, though it's interesting to see Ubisoft further tweak the ability for environmental destruction around religious buildings in the game. "All props near an altar or a religion building will now be static, preventing any destruction," Ubisoft notes, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-day-one-patch-detailed-includes-destructible-shrine-changes-after-concern-over-copycats">previously locking down larger items at these in-game sites</a>.
</p>
<p>
Last month, a website leak suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pegi-website-leak-suggests-assassins-creed-shadows-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">Assassin's Creed Shadows would launch on Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Last week, Eurogamer published an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/working-in-the-shadows-how-an-assassins-creed-researcher-braved-the-backlash">interview with a historical researcher who worked on Assassin's Creed Shadows and braved the game's cultural backlash</a>.

            <p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> series is celebrating its third anniversary this week. The first video game in the series launched to critical acclaim on 5th May 2022, with a sequel - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector">Starward Vector</a> - then releasing earlier this year.</p>
<p>As part of its anniversary celebrations, developer Jump Over The Age has released a free to download solo tabletop game known as Spindlejack.</p>

<p>Spindlejack "puts players into the seat of a courier on the space station Far Spindle, a familiar location from Starward Vector. Players will navigate the station, earn Cryo, build their reputation, make their mark on the courier scene, and try to survive in a hostile system".</p>
<p>As shared by Jump Over The Age, the free tabletop game mirrors "the hard decisions and emergent storytelling that fans have come to know and love from the series". If that all sounds like your thing, <a href="https://jump-over-the-age.itch.io/citizen-sleeper-spindlejack">you can download Spindlejack here</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to releasing a new Citizen Sleeper tabletop game, the developer has also shared some interesting Citizen Sleeper-related stats. Since the series debut in 2022, the games have welcomed over two million players.</p>
<p>26 percent of the first game's players joined a commune, while 19 percent made bootleg booze from mushrooms (actually assumed this would be higher). Six percent went on to become a part of the fungal network and 1.5 percent left Lem and Mina waiting on the dock as they instead set off for a new life alone. To quote Jump Over The Age, "you monsters".</p>
<p>As for the second game in the series, 29 percent of Starward Vector players adopted a stray cat. Again, I really assumed this would be higher. 35 percent of the sequel's players got lucky with a glitched dice, 18 percent allowed Surya to turn their ship  into a flying billboard and 1.5 percent managed to complete the game on dangerous difficulty. "You heroes," says the Citizen Sleeper team. Can confirm, I am absolutely not part of that 1.5 percent.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the developer has said it will be adding French, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese localisation to Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector later this year.</p>

<p>Citizen Sleeper received <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-review-a-gentle-cerebral-game-of-belonging-and-survival">very positive reviews</a> on its release, and was nominated for a number of BAFTAs. Its sequel similarly received positive reviews, with our Bertie calling it "terrific".</p>
<p>"With a new found sense of tension, and showpiece Contract missions, Citizen Sleeper is transformed. This follow-up has improved the RPG formula in every way," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-2-review">Eurogamer's Citizen Sleeper 2 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/new-ecco-the-dolphin-game-on-the-way-reviving-the-mega-drive-icon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A new Ecco the Dolphin game is in development, alongside remasters of the original two Mega Drive games.</p>
<p>The new game will have "contemporary play and GPU sensibilities" and has been revealed alongside a new countdown on the <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/">game's website</a>. It's unclear if this is counting to a final release date or further news, but either way it's currently 8510 hours away - that's 354 days and 14 hours from now, which points to 25th April 2026.</p>
<p>News of a new entry was confirmed by series creator Ed Annunziata in an interview with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/">Xbox Wire</a>, as part of a celebration of Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.</p>

<p>Annunziata and the entire original team are behind both the remasters and the new project.</p>
<p>Ecco the Dolphin was first released in 1992 for the Mega Drive and was followed by a sequel, The Tides of Time, in 1994.</p>
<p>Both games are 2D side-scrollers focused on the titular Ecco, who explores vibrant ocean environments with his sonar abilities. I still have my copy of the first game from when I was a kid: its shimmering oceans are gorgeous, but the puzzle gameplay gets very hard very quickly - not to mention its incredibly weird, alien story.</p>
<p>It's unknown yet if the new game will be 2D or 3D, but the original games were followed by the 3D Defender of the Future on the Dreamcast, though Annunziata wasn't involved with this one.</p>
<p>That game is not as well regarded and its proposed sequel was cancelled due to declining sales of the Dreamcast. Annunziata attempted to raise a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ecco-the-dolphin-creator-launches-kickstarter-for-spiritual-successor-the-big-blue">Kickstarter for a spiritual successor back in 2013</a>, but was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Speaking to Xbox Wire, Annunziata discussed the role of the gaming community in raising awareness about global issues.</p>
<p>"I feel gamers possess a higher than average IQ than the average human," he said. "Not only because they are frequently fully engaged and challenged mentally with real-time systems and information technology, but they are highly socially connected as well. Like the ocean, a gaming community is an ecosystem – games like Ecco can and should be a conduit to join these realms.</p>
<p>"I have high expectations of gamers for all the above-stated reasons. But there is something else gamers possess that can make the difference, and that is love. A universal love of games and gaming gives us all something we all share, when games like Ecco reach the hearts of gaming communities, that love can really make things happen in the real world."</p>
<p>Back in January of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/freshly-filed-sega-trademarks-hint-at-the-return-of-another-classic-series-25-years-after-its-last-entry">Sega filed a new trademark for Ecco the Dolphin</a>, hinting a new project was on the way.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Another one of Microsoft's key franchises will arrive on PlayStation this year, via a revamped edition of the original Gears of War game.</p>
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded's announcement comes almost 20 years since the series first made its Xbox debut.</p>
<p>This modernised version of the original Gears of War will launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th August. It will cost $40, and also be available via Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.</p>
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded has been developed by The Coalition in partnership with Sumo Interactive and Disbelief. It will feature faster frame rates and "deeper visual fidelity", with the studios promising "clarity, smoothness, and immersion that matches the power of today's hardware", Microsoft has said.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date/">laid out in an Xbox post</a>, Gears of War: Reloaded players can expect the following enhancements on the game's release this summer:</p>
<ul>
<li>4K resolution</li>
<li>60 FPS in Campaign</li>
<li>120 FPS in Multiplayer</li>
<li>High Dynamic Range (HDR)</li>
<li>Dolby Vision &amp; 7.1.4 Dolby Atmos</li>
<li>7.1.4 3D Spatial Audio</li>
<li>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)</li>
<li>4K assets and remastered textures</li>
<li>Enhanced post-processing visual effects</li>
<li>Improved shadows and reflections</li>
<li>Super resolution with improved anti-aliasing</li>
<li>Zero loading screens during Campaign</li>
</ul>
<p>Reloaded will also boast some platform specific features, and support cross-play and cross-progression.</p>

<p>Those who already own the digital version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gears-of-war-ultimate-edition">Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</a> will receive a free upgrade to Gears of War: Reloaded, but only if they purchased the game prior to this announcement. So, if you decide to plump for Gears of War: Ultimate Edition on Xbox now, you will not be eligible for that free upgrade when Reloaded releases.</p>
<p>"As we approach the 20th anniversary of Gears of War in 2026, we're reflecting on what this franchise means. It's about the stories we've told, the friendships we've built, and the unforgettable moments we've shared together," The Coalition studio head Mike Crump said yesterday. </p>
<p>"With Gears of War: Reloaded, we're opening that door to more players than ever."</p>

<p>The next new entry in the series will be Gears of War: E-Day, a prequel title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marcus-fenix-returns-in-gears-of-war-prequel-e-day">set 14 years before the events of the original game</a>. Gears of War: E-Day is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bulletstorm-studio-confirms-project-maverick-is-a-gears-of-war-game">being co-developed with People Can Fly</a>. </p>
<p>Late last year, it was revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-is-so-back-as-original-voice-talents-are-confirmed-for-gears-of-war-e-day">John DiMiaggio and Carlos Ferro will be reprising their roles as Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago</a> in Gears of War: E-Day. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
