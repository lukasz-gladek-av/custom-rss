            <p>Good news, ghost-hunting fans - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> has outlined the road ahead for the spooky sim in 2025 will include maps reworks, new ghost-hunting equipment, "thrilling seasonal events", and a brand-new location, too.</p>
<p>With two million copies sold since it came out of early access last October - bringing the total sales across all platforms to 22 million - the first update is Chronicle, which will refresh Phasmo's humble journal and rework the way in which we can record our findings and capture evidence.</p>

<p>The Photos tab will be replaced with a media tab that encapsulates not just polaroid images, but also videos and sound recordings, too, with your first "capture" of any media deemed "Unique".</p>
<p>Also on the cards is a complete rework of Bleasdale Farmhouse (good; I <em>always</em> die there) with "visual enhancements and a complete redesign of the layout, including new locations for ghosts to haunt".</p>

<p>Interestingly, this map will also encompass a new outdoor space just beyond the living room.</p>
<p>The game's other terrifying farmhouse, Grafton, is also getting updated later this year.</p>
<p>"We're beyond excited for the new updates and reworks coming to Phasmophobia this year," said Daniel "Dknighter" Knight, director of Kinetic Games and lead developer of Phasmophobia.</p>
<p>"Our early access period so far has given us a fantastic opportunity to listen to our players, and the big changes we're making are a direct reflection of the feedback we're seeing.</p>
<p>"We're really proud of the direction Phasmophobia is going in, thanks in no small part to our amazing community, and we can't wait to see what everyone thinks of some of the surprises in store for 2025."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-is-getting-more-expensive-later-today">Phasmophobia's price was bumped from £10.99 to a very precise £16.75 ($20/€19.50) last September</a>, with the team saying the price hike was due to "the amount of content and playtime added to the game since Early Access started almost four years ago".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sony has seemingly delisted a number of games following an investigation into the prevalence of "spam" titles on digital storefronts.</p>
<p>After an investigation by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-could-make-fart-fart-boobie-fart-the-game-and-maybe-it-would-eventually-get-taken-down-devs-reveal-why-the-consoles-are-drowning-in-eslop">IGN</a> found differing approaches to quality control across Nintendo, PC, PlayStation, and Xbox stores, players believe they've found evidence that Sony has removed some questionable developers from the PlayStation Store.</p>

</div><figcaption>Xbox Developer Direct - four promising games also coming to PlayStation.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afaO_AuPw0o" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>For example, most games from developer <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/publisher/RandomSpin-Games">RandomSpin</a> - including Supermarket Simulator Pro, Bodycam Shooter, and Backrooms Inside The Escape, all of which are allegedly thought to use AI and/or recycled assets - have disappeared, leading some to speculate that Sony has responded to criticism.</p>
<p>As detailed on <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/news/ps5-spam-games-delisted-february-2025">TrueTrophies</a> and <a href="https://forum.psnprofiles.com/topic/159499-upcoming-server-shutdowns-delistings/page/35/#comment-3142794">PSNProfiles</a>, the developer has released <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/publisher/RandomSpin-Games">dozens of games in 2024 alone</a>, in some cases releasing multiple games a month, leading some to speculate about the quality of its products.</p>
<p>This issue isn't unique to just PS5, of course. Just days after the creative director of indie hit Unpacking, Wren Brier, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unpacking-developer-calls-out-nintendo-after-reporting-cheap-fakes-on-its-eshop">called out Nintendo due to the prominence of copycat games on its Switch eShop</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-black-myth-wukong-copycat-games-are-popping-up-on-nintendo-eshop">Chinese fans spotted a game called Wukong Sun: Black Legend had popped up, too</a> with misleading artwork to match its name.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtimes-going-after-google">Poppy Playtime developer Mob Entertainment is suing Google for failing to remove "scam" apps from the Google Play store</a>. In legal papers filed last month, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/poppy-playtime">Poppy Playtime</a>'s creators accused Daigo Game 2020 Inc. of releasing "scam" apps intentionally advertised with names like Poppy Playtime: Chapter 3 and Poppy Playtime: Chapter 4 well before the instalments had been officially released for mobile devices.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
