            <p>Hytale boss Simon Collins-Laflamme has called the Minecraft-like's recent early access launch "the most challenging but rewarding experience" of his life.</p>
<p>Hytale <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-a-brand-new-game-from-giants-of-the-minecraft-community">started development in 2015</a> and soon began garnering a lot of attention. However, Riot Games, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-snaps-up-studio-behind-promising-minecraft-like-sandbox-game-hytale">acquired Hytale developer Hypixel Studios in 2020</a>, opted to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-minecraft-like-hytale-cancelled-after-ten-years-in-development">cancel the project last June</a>. Thankfully, though, Hytale was saved when Hypixel co-founder Collins-Laflamme <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-saved-riot-sells-cancelled-minecraft-like-game-back-to-its-original-co-founder">successfully re-acquired the game from Riot</a> at the end of last year. Then, seven days ago, and after years of waiting, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-launch-million-players">Hytale finally released in early access</a>.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the past week, Collins-Laflamme has now thanked the community for its support, and offered a "big thank you" to the "rebuilt Hytale team" for trusting him to get the game "to the finish line" in just a few months.</p>
<p>"I haven't been involved with Hytale development for many years and coming back was a big unknown and risk for me, and my family," Collins-Laflamme <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2013636980626595976">wrote on social media</a>. "I fully trusted the people and it just worked. Amazing team, every single one made a big difference."</p><p>Ahead of Hytale's release, Hypixel announced its Minecraft-alike <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-awaited-minecraft-a-like-hytale-has-already-sold-enough-to-fund-the-next-two-years-of-development-and-its-not-even-out-yet">had already sold enough copies to fund the next two years of development</a>. "Combined with my personal commitment of ten years," Collins-Laflamme said at the time, "we are looking very strong for the future."</p>

<p>Or, if you are unsure if Hytale is for you, our Matt has already given it a shot. "This week's early access release feels like a splendid start; a flexible, well-featured - and already enjoyable - foundation with plenty of polish and attention to detail," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytales-early-access-launch-isnt-quite-ready-to-step-out-of-minecrafts-shadow-but-im-still-having-a-blast">Eurogamer's Hytale Now Playing feature</a>.</p>

            <p>Raymond Bartos, producer on the World of Warcraft team, has announced his new role at a rival studio. He'll now be working on a whole new MMO, the much-anticipated and very mysterious Riot Games MMO no less.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7417390270268329984/">In a post on Bartos' Linkedin</a>, he wrote the following alongside a collection of pictures at Riot Games' LA office: "From my very first conversation with Riot, I immediately gravitated toward their values--and I was genuinely impressed by how clearly those values showed up throughout the interview process. It made it obvious that kindness, respect, and care aren't just words here, but something the team truly lives by.</p>
<p>"I'm deeply grateful for the opportunity to join such an inspiring group of people, and I can't wait to get started--showing up every day to provide value for Riot gamers and help deliver an MMO experience players truly enjoy."</p>

<p>Bartos was part of the team which shipped the popular Plunderstorm mode for World of Warcraft, as well as multiple limited-time remix modes and the game's 20th anniversary event. Bartos also noted he'll be working alongside one Orlando Salvatore, another former World of Warcraft veteran who jumped ship to Riot Games late last year.</p><p>There are in fact quite a few big names, formerly of Blizzard, that have ended up working on this MMO. Natalia Leenhardt was an 11-year alumni at the company before joining Amazon Game Studios in 2021 for New World, later joining the Riot Games MMO team in 2023. Kevin Carter joined Riot back in 2017 after over ten years at Blizzard, and of course the old executive producer on the Riot MMO Greg Street was a legendary World of Warcraft developer,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/league-of-legends-mmo-producer-departing-riot-games"> though he left back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>So what do we know about the Riot MMO? Not much! We know it's set in the Runeterra universe, like most of Riot Games' works are. We know the game had a "reset in direction" some years ago, and that there's been very little in the way of on-the-record discussion about it. That is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkyjsM31Epk">except for an interview with League lore content creator Necrit back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>So there's been no word of any sort of reveal as of yet, nor any sort of timeline as to when we're likely to see it happen. Still, the continued hiring of staff is certainly a good indicator that serious work is being done.</p>

            <p>Kenny Sun and Friends' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ball-x-pit-review">Ball x Pit</a> was among <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-50-best-games-of-2025-ranked">Eurogamer's favourite games of 2025</a>, so imagine our excitement when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCmmoL2Mtq0">it was confirmed</a> free content drops were set to arrive this year. Now, the wait for the first major update is almost over.</p>
<p>On 19th January, publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2062430/view/99775316462930481?l=english">the game's official channels</a> confirmed The Regal Update is coming on 26th January to all platforms. That's really soon and before we expected, but with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-video-games-2026-releases#section-2">February looking far busier</a> than January when it comes to new game releases, I guess it makes sense to push it out now.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>BALL x PIT’s first FREE major update, The Regal Update, launches on January 26th on all platforms! </p><p>Adding:<br>🤠2 new characters - The Carouser &amp; The Falconer<br>🏐8 new balls<br>🎯New passives<br>✨Plus a nice surprise you’re going to love! <a href="https://t.co/t0tYlwjOXk">pic.twitter.com/t0tYlwjOXk</a></p></div>— BALL x PIT 🏐 OUT NOW (@BALLxPIT) <a href="https://twitter.com/BALLxPIT/status/2013296280261234716?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>As explained by the official posts and the short but goofy trailer, we can expect to get two new characters, eight new balls, and an unspecified number of new passives. We're also taking bets on what that extra surprise might be. Patch notes should be with us soon.</p>
<p>The first hunter (more like juggler) is The Carouser, "whose returning balls orbit around him." Start thinking about those area-of-effect and defensive builds now. The other one makes use of two ball-shooting birds to up the DPS and is fittingly called The Falconer. As for the eight new balls, the powers that be have decided to keep them a secret, but looking at the many possible combos already in the game, getting several new additions to the arsenal at once will shake meta builds up for sure.</p><p>Similarly, there's no word on the teased new passives, but a fair criticism of the game is its lack of an actual endgame beyond re-doing the entire journey on a higher level of difficulty or maxing out stats that kinda become pointless past a certain point. In a space dominated by roguelite winners with a more ambitious approach to endgame loops, we're curious to see whether the team behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ball-x-pit-the-kenny-sun-story">Ball x Pit</a> can keep the diehards busy in the long run.</p>
