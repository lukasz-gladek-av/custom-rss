            <p>Earlier this month and after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mystery-tony-hawk-remaster-now-mentioned-by-pro-skater-involved-in-the-game-even-though-activision-hasnt-announced-it-yet">a few unintentional slips</a>, Activision officially announced that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4</a> are coming back, with the two games getting remade from the ground up.</p>
<p>If you are anything like me, one of the things you will recall fondly when thinking back to those hazy days of playing Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 on their initial release are the games' soundtracks. Grinding and flipping along to the likes of Alien Ant Farm and Sum 41. Ah, those were the days.</p>
<p>Anyway, with the upcoming combined remakes, players are probably interested in finding out what the soundtrack will include. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-official-announcement-reveals-deluxe-edition-with-doom-slayer">On that initial announcement</a>, Activision promised the remakes will include songs from the original games such as Ace of Spades by Motörhead, as well as new tracks which "capture the spirit of modern skate culture". And now, we know more songs that will be included on the games' combined rerelease, thanks to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWU4xkATYcbh7">Spotify</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/more-of-thps-3-4-remastereds-soundtrack-revealed-song-list-so-far">IGN</a>).</p>
