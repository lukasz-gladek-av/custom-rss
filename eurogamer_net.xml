            <p>Sonic the Hedgehog isn't loved by everyone, but most people can agree that the music in his games is generally top-tier stuff. We expect the soundtrack to the upcoming Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will be stellar, and Sega has released a brand new video that highlights six of the tunes in the game.</p>
<p>The video below, which runs for almost eight minutes, features a mix of six remixed tracks from CrossWorlds put together by Kanon Oguni!. These tracks from the official soundtrack are said to be inspired by courses in the game based on Sonic Unleashed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-colours">Sonic Colors</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-sa2-dc">Sonic Adventure 2</a>.</p>

            <p>Elysium Game Studio has released a brand-new gameplay trailer for its third- and first-person action RPG, Neo Berlin 2087. According to the developer's official website, the game is coming to PS5, Xbox Series consoles, and PC.</p>
<p>The game first appeared in a pre-alpha footage gameplay trailer two years ago, and also made an appearance at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> last year. Elias Toufexis, known as the voice of Adam Jensen in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex-human-revolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a>, and as Seraphim in Netflix's Blood of Zeus, announced last year that he'd signed on to play the main character.</p>
