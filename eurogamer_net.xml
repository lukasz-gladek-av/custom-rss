            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> players have woken up to find certain special cosmetics on their account; skins that they absolutely should not have.</p>
<p>The Battlefield 6 equivalent of getting someone else's expensive takeout order instead of your own, Phantom Edition skins are showing up seemingly at random for the lucky few. These skins, which are meant to be included with the extra pricey version of Battlefield 6, fit out your four available classes with slick military black camo.</p>
<p>Several players have taken to community hubs <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o84sd0/phantom_edition_rewards_without_actually_owning/">including Reddit</a> to figure out whether this is a shared problem, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o84tgt/i_log_into_the_game_and_see_that_i_got_the_skins/">their stories being corroborated</a> by fellow users. It's unclear what the full scope of this accidental skin rollout is at this time, but it's big enough to garner continued interest and confusion from a subset of the playerbase.</p>

<p>So how could this have happened? Well, a number of legitimate Phantom Edition owners <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2807960/discussions/0/591784592221159192/"> were <em>meant</em> to have obtained these Phantom Edition skins at launch but didn't</a>. This was during the initial days post-launch, and resulted <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1976709597147615733">in official communications from Battlefield Studios</a> that these issues would be resolved soon.</p><p>However, there hasn't been an update to this promise yet! It's entirely possible these mysterious gifted premium skins are a consequence of developer efforts to remedy that problem. So, if you're a surprise owner of some special Phantom Edition skins, maybe keep it quiet and your fancy new threads will fall under the radar.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-sold-over-seven-million-copies-in-five-days-data-analyst-company-claims">Battlefield 6 has proven exceptionally popular since its launch last weekend</a>. In the days following, there have been a series of updates and bug fixes including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-ladder-launching-one-of-the-games-funnest-bugs-will-soon-be-gone">the death of "Ladder Launching"</a>, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/your-conquest-matches-in-battlefield-6-will-be-getting-shorter-heres-why">adjustment to Conquest Mode ticket counts</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-issues-fix-for-jump-momentum-bug-and-is-monitoring-breakthrough-player-counts">a hasty fix to momentum issues</a>.</p>

            <p>A new interim Pokémon game has arrived, and this time in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, the action all takes place in one big city. It feels large to begin with. But how large actually is it?</p>
<p>The measurements have been done. Lumiose City, as it's known, is not even seven minutes big. You can run the entire circumference of the city in roughly six-and-a-half minutes. The figure (6:19 specifically) was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1o7tmfh/it_takes_less_than_7_minutes_to_run_the/">first touted on Reddit</a>, but has been separately confirmed, in the name of science, by Eurogamer's guides gurus Lottie and Marie.</p>
<p>"It took me 6:13 mins, give or take a second," said Lottie. "This includes having the delays as I entered and exited five Wild Zones along my way, because I'm close to the game's end and have nearly unlocked them all."</p>
<p>Marie came in just behind Lottie at 6 minutes 20 seconds. "That was at full sprint speed and charging through the Wild Zones without getting stopped," she said.</p>
<p>Given that Pokémon Legends: Z-A only has one city to explore, a playing space that size will seem disappointing to some. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">as Chris pointed out in his Pokémon Legends Z-A review</a>, there are multiple levels of it to explore, such as rooftops and on scaffolding, and there's a strangely hypnotic loop in scouring these places for power-ups over the course of the game.</p>
<p>Still, it is rather small, and far cry from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-far-lands-over-14-years-later-the-edge-of-a-minecraft-world-has-been-reached">the 14 years it took one man to recently reach the end of a Minecraft world</a>.</p>
<p>Chris awarded Pokémon Legends: Z-A three stars. "It's a mix of older ideas with new ones, and one that arguably finds the most enjoyable balance yet," he wrote. "But at least as proof of concepts go, I'm now convinced this one could really work."</p>
