            <p>Microsoft has acknowledged it has supplied AI technology to the Israel Ministry of Defense (IMOD) but has stated it "found no evidence" the technology had been used to "target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza".</p>
<p>Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/05/15/statement-technology-israel-gaza/">published a statement last week</a>, where it admitted to providing IMOD with "software, professional services, Azure cloud services, and Azure AI services, including language translation". It added: "As with many governments around the world, we also work with the Israeli government to protect its national cyberspace against external threats".</p>
<p>The statement follows reports of Israel using AI in its conflict in Gaza, which has resulted in thousands of Palestinian deaths. As reported by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/03/israel-gaza-ai-database-hamas-airstrikes">The Guardian</a> last year, the Israeli military employed its own AI system, called Lavender, with intelligence sources claiming Israeli military officials permitted large numbers of Palestinian civilians to be killed.</p>
<p>As Microsoft has now acknowledged, there were concerns from its employees and the public regarding the use of its Azure and AI technologies by the Israeli military. In response, it has conducted an internal review, alongside an external firm the company has omitted to name.</p>
<p>"Based on these reviews, including interviewing dozens of employees and assessing documents, we have found no evidence to date that Microsoft's Azure and AI technologies have been used to target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza," the company said.</p>
<p>"Our relationship with the IMOD is structured as a standard commercial relationship," it continued. "Like all our customers, the IMOD's use of our technology is bound by Microsoft's terms of service and conditions of use, including our Acceptable Use Policy and our AI Code of Conduct. These require customers to implement core responsible AI practices - such as human oversight and access controls - and prohibit the use of our cloud and AI services in any manner that inflicts harm on individuals or organisations or affects individuals in any way that is prohibited by law."</p>
<p>Microsoft noted it does occasionally provide special access to its technologies beyond the terms of its commercial agreements. It did this in the weeks following 7th October 2023 by providing limited emergency support to the Israeli government to help rescue hostages, but with "significant oversight and on a limited basis".</p>
<p>It also noted militaries "typically use their own proprietary software or applications from defense-related providers for the types of surveillance and operations that have been the subject of our employees' questions. Microsoft has not created or provided such software or solutions to the IMOD."</p>
<p>The company also acknowledged it does not have visibility into how its customers use its technology on their own servers, typically the case for "on premise software". As such, it does not have visibility to the IMOD's government cloud operations.</p>
<p>"In sum, Microsoft has long defended the cybersecurity of the State of Israel and the people who live there," the statement concludes.</p>
<p>"We similarly have long been committed to other nations and people across the Middle East. Our commitment to human rights guides how we engage in complex environments and how our technology is used. We share the profound concern over the loss of civilian life in both Israel and Gaza and have supported humanitarian assistance in both places. The work we do everywhere in the world is informed and governed by our Human Rights Commitments. Based on everything we currently know, we believe Microsoft has abided by these Commitments in Israel and Gaza."</p>
<p>Last year, a group of current and former Microsoft employees launched the <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/petition/">No Azure for Apartheid petition</a>, which currently has 1527 signatures. The group has now called for Microsoft to make this investigation public.</p>
<p>"It's very clear that their intention with this statement is not to actually address their worker concerns, but rather to make a PR stunt to whitewash their image that their relationship with the Israeli military has tarnished," said former employee Hossam Nasr to Israeli newspaper <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-05-17/ty-article/microsoft-says-it-provided-ai-to-israel-for-gaza-war-but-denies-use-to-harm-palestinians/00000196-dbd0-d9a9-a99e-fbd5a6f80000">Haaretz</a>. Nasr was fired in October for helping to organise an unauthorised vigil for Palestinians killed in Gaza at Microsoft's headquarters.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">RockPaperShotgun</a> reported, the international Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement called for a boycott of Microsoft products last month in protest against the company's reported connections with the Israeli military. Back in February, the <a href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/first-winner/2025/as-israel-uses-u-s-made-ai-models-in-war-concerns-arise-about-techs-role-in-who-lives-and-who-dies/">Associated Press published a report into the use of AI technology by the Israeli military</a>, including Microsoft and OpenAI.</p>
<p>Similarly, the developer of indie role-player <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indie-developer-pulls-game-from-xbox-in-support-of-pro-palestine-boycott">Tenderfoot Tactics removed the game from sale on Xbox</a> in support of the boycott.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Developer Housemarque, known for the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/returnal">Returnal</a> and Nex Machina, has no plans to go down the free-to-play or live-service route any time soon.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer at the developer's 30th anniversary event in Finland last week, studio head Ilari Kuittinen and creative director Gregory Louden said "as long as people are buying premium games", Hoursemarque will remain a studio which provides just that.</p>
<p>"Our philosophy is that [our games] are an experience for a certain time of your life, and you experience that within a few days, or weeks, or whatever," Kuittinen said. The studio head added Housemarque's titles are a bit "like movies or TV series", which are there for a certain "phase" of a person's life. "And I believe that's really cool. You don't need to spend the rest of your free time with our games," he said.</p>

<p>"It's a unique experience," Kuittinen continued. "You have it, you get something out of it. Maybe you come back to it, but you don't need to play it for the rest of your life."</p>
<p>Louden added the studio is currently "fully focused on single player and premium" with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returnal-studio-heads-to-a-hostile-shape-shifting-planet-for-newly-unveiled-saros">upcoming PS5 title Saros</a>, and Housemarque - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buys-returnal-developer-housemarque">which was acquired by Sony in 2021</a> - aims to make sure it is around for another 30 years by continuing to make "amazing games" and keeping up that "momentum".</p>
<p>"You just need to keep creating special games," the creative director said, before Housemarque's brand director Mikael Haveri added: "We are only as strong as our latest game."</p>
<p>Haveri acknowledged that Housemarque hadn't necessarily had the easiest of journeys to where it is now, and the team is "aware of pitfalls out there", so it needs to keep making "good games" to thrive.</p>
<p>"It's almost like a responsibility, we're very lucky to be in the position we are in, and we should keep pushing the medium and keep showing what we can do and keep pushing our gameplay and our story and our technology, and just keep growing," Louden furthered. "That's the future for the next 30 years - it's just creating better."</p>

<p>Back in February 2022, Sony stated it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">aimed to launch over 10 new live-service games</a> over the coming years. A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-exec-jim-ryan-believes-live-service-games-will-dominate-over-subscriptions">then-Sony exec Jim Ryan said he believed live-service games were a key part of gaming's future</a>, confident in PlayStation's live-service push.</p>
<p>Since then the company has dialled back its plans and just this month, the Sony published live-service shooter Fairgames was reportedly delayed, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fairgames-reportedly-delayed-into-next-year-as-haven-founder-jade-raymond-exits">Haven Studios founder Jade Raymond made her exit from the company</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
