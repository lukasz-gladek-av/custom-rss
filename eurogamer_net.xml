With the weekend finally in sight (we just need to make it through <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">this year's Summer Geoff Fest</a> first), it's all change on the Epic Games Store. A fresh set of freebies is now available to download and keep, and one of them is Arkane Studios' ultra stylish <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deathloop">Deathloop</a>.
</p>
<p>
Epic's latest free games - which replace <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/herere-this-weeks-free-epic-games-store-games">last week's offerings of Tiny Tina's Wonderlands and Limbo</a> - can be claimed right now, and come in both PC and mobile flavours. You will, of course, need to be in the EU to access Epic's mobile store on iOS, but it's available worldwide via Android devices. But regardless of how you get there, here's what's free right now:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Deathloop (PC)</li>
<li>Ogu and the Secret Forest (mobile)</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a aria-label="DEATHLOOP - Official Launch Trailer: Countdown to Freedom" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8phmhAoxeIs?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
Deathloop, if you're unfamiliar, traps players on the 1960s-styled island of Blackreef, where they'll need to assassinate eight key targets before they can finally escape. The trouble is, the entire place is caught in a time loop, meaning everything needs to be done before the day resets. And worse, another assassin is on your trail. It's part exploratory immersive sim, part chaotic shooter and was good enough to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deathloop-review">earn itself a Eurogamer Essential</a> back in the day.
</p>
<p>
As for Epic's other freebie this week, Ogu and the Secret Forest is a hand-drawn exploration adventure promising puzzles, mysteries, and more. "Befriend bouncy characters," explains the official blurb, "and defeat strange creatures to unravel the mystery of the charming world."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/deathloop">Deathloop</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/ogu-and-the-secret-forest-ffc421">Ogu and the Secret Forest</a> are available to download and keep via the Epic Games Store now and will remain so until next Thursday, 12th June. After that, Two Point Studios' fantastic Theme Hospital spiritual successor <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/two-point-hospital">Two Point Hospital</a> will take their place.

June is here, which means Amazon has refreshed its Prime Gaming offerings for another month, and - following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prime-gaming-members-get-22-more-games-in-may">bumper-packed May</a> - it's a comparatively quiet one this time around. In total, June brings nine new games for subscribers to download, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/thief-deadly-shadows">Thief: Deadly Shadows</a>.
</p>
<p>
As usual, Prime Gaming's June additions arrive across four scheduled content drops, and the first of these is available to claim right now. Point yourself in the <a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/home">direction of Amazon's website</a> and you're able to grab tactical turn-based Games Workshop adaptation Mordheim: City of the Damned, as well as retro-inspired point-and-click sci-fi adventure The Abandoned Planet.
</p>
<p>
Then, as June trundles onwards and summer vaguely threatens to emerge, members can look forward to the likes of Thief: Deadly Shadows, the third game in the classic stealth series, and minimalist railway puzzler Station to Station. That's alongside the acclaimed Jupiter Hell, a grimy top-down turn-based sci-fi shooter, plus guns-and-sorcery cRPG Dark Envoy.
</p>
<p>
You'll find the full list of Junes's titles (plus the digital stores they can be grabbed from) below.

In addition to the above, Prime Gaming subscribers in the UK, US, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Austria, the Netherlands, and Poland get the usual access to a rotating selection of titles via Amazon's cloud gaming service, Luna. In June, these include  <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-dc-super-villains">Lego DC Super-Villains</a>, House of Golf 2, RiMS Racing, Mail Mole, Garfield Kart - Furious Racing, The Jackbox Survey Scramble, Ultrakill, Spells &amp; Secrets, and Qube 10th Anniversary.
</p>
<p>
Those are available alongside Luna regulars <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout New Vegas</a>: Ultimate Edition, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-3-game-year-edition">Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition</a>, Fortnite, and Trackmania.
