            <p>
More Xbox first-party titles have been confirmed for PS5 - and it's good news for strategy fans, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/age-of-mythology-retold">Age of Mythology: Retold</a> Edition and Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition both on the way. That's alongside a variety of upcoming expansion releases across all platforms.
</p>
<p>
First up is Age of Mythology: Retold Edition, a remaster of the 2002 original, which comes to PS5 on 4th March. This twist on the Age of Empires strategy formula swaps history for monsters and gods as players battle as either the Greek, Norse, Egyptian, or Atlantean pantheons.
</p>
<p>
Its 4th March arrival coincides with the launch of Age of Mythology: Retold's Immortal Pillars expansion. This includes the new Chinese pantheon, 12 new gods with unique powers and mythological units, a nine-level campaign inspired by Chinese mythology, and seven new maps. PlayStation 5 owners can pick it up alongside the base game, but it also comes to PC and Xbox on the same day. Cross-play is supported across all platforms, and all Mythology: Retold updates will hit Xbox, PS5, and PC simultaneously from this point onward.

<p>
Then, sometime this "spring", PlayStation 5 owners can get their hands on Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition. This includes all the expansions released for the 1999 original, plus improved visuals, gameplay refinements, cross-play, and more. As with Age of Mythology: Retold, new DLC launches alongside Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition's PlayStation 5 release, and will be available across all platforms. Microsoft isn't talking specifics yet but says to expect "fresh new content" and "new civilisations for Ranked play."
</p><p>
In other Age of Empires news, Microsoft has announced two new expansions for Age of Empires 4, both coming in 2025 and both focused on "shorter and repeatable experiences". The first of these, Knights of Cross and Rose, arrives this "spring", promising "two well-known armies inspired by history" plus a "solo mode that will challenge even the most skilled strategists." Additional details can be found in <a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/news/whats-coming-in-2025-for-age-of-empires-and-age-of-mythology/">Microsoft's announcement</a>.
</p>
<p>

It continues the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-confirms-multiplatform-future-is-here-to-stay">multi-console release strategy</a> Microsoft's announced last year - one that's so far seen <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, Grounded, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, and Pentiment come to PlayStation, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, Doom: The Dark Ages, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2 all on the way.
</p>
<p>

            <p>
We were big fans of developer Bugbear Entertainment's demolition derby racer Wreckfest when it launched back in 2018, so there was some excitement when a sequel was announced last year. And now, the studio has now confirmed similarly enthusiastic sorts can slam pedal to the metal from 20th March, when Wreckfest 2 launches into Steam early access.
</p>
<p>
Wreckfest 2 promises what Bugbear is calling the "next evolution of full-contact racing", and there's talk of an overhauled physics engine, more intricate component damage simulation, and "even higher crash fidelity" - all working together to conjure "absolute vehicular mayhem".
</p>
<p>
Course-wise, Bugbear is promising a blend of high-speed circuits, "crazy courses with obstacles and jumps", plus intersections and oncoming traffic. Initially these'll be available in Racing, Derby, and multiplayer modes - supporting up to 34 players - with more to come. Sometime into Wreckfrest 2's early access release, for instance, Bugbear is introducing a revamped career mode designed to adapt to individuals' playstyles, plus a skill-based matchmaking system and server queues for online players.

<p>
Vehicle customisation also has a major role, and players can spruce up their cars with new armour and component types suited to different driving approaches. New components will arrive as early access continues, with other future additions set to include tournaments, high-score challenges putting players in "unconventional vehicles", and mod support.
</p><p>
Bugbear says the goal of early access is to ensure Wreckfest 2 is "shaped by [player] feedback" from day one. And while there's no indication of how long early access will last as yet, the original Wreckfest notably remained in early access for four years. The results, however, were worth it, with Martin Robison calling it a game of "primal pleasures" and "little by way of pretension" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wreckfest-2-gothic-1-remake-gameplay-and-everything-else-from-thq-nordics-showcase">his Recommended review</a>.
</p>
<p>
So if you're eager to get behind the wheel as Wreckfest 2 heads toward the early access finish line, you can do so when <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203190/Wreckfest_2/">it comes to Steam</a> on 20th March.
