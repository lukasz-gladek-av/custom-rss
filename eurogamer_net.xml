        <p>The companies "will continue to work together on the smooth transition of services and operations".</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Amplitude Studios has reestablished itself as an independent studio after management bought back the studio from Sega.</p>
<p>Sega says the sale follows a "period of close consultation" between Amplitude and Sega management and "concludes the structural reforms that have been taking place in Sega's European business". The publisher previously canned its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-has-cancelled-hyenas">plans to launch live-service shooter Hyenas</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/total-war-developer-creative-assembly-refocusing-on-strategy-games-after-hyenas-failure">job losses at UK studio Creative Assembly as a result</a>.</p>
<p>Sega acquired Amplitude in 2016. It has released <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/endless-space-2">Endless Space 2</a>, Humankind, and Endless Dungeon over that time.</p>

<p>"Sega Europe has today announced the sale of Amplitude Studios following a management buyout from senior leaders and employees at the Parisian studio. The move will see Amplitude go back to its roots as an independent organisation and concludes the structural reforms that have been taking place in Sega's European business," Sega said in a statement to press.</p><p>"The decision to part ways follows a period of close consultation between Sega Europe and Amplitude. As an independent studio once more, Amplitude will focus on its in-development projects and growing its own franchises, while Sega will continue to advance its strong and diverse stable of Japanese and Western IP.</p>
<p>"While Amplitude is no longer a part of the Sega family of studios, the two entities will continue to work together on the smooth transition of services and operations, ensuring minimum disruption for Amplitude employees and continuity of service for players of Amplitude games," Sega concluded.</p>
<p>"Amplitude is backed by strong, meaningful franchises, and our team is committed to creating the best games possible," said Romain de Waubert de Genlis, studio director.</p>
<p>"This decision allows us to be more agile in our approach while continuing to shape the vision that we've had from the beginning, empowering us to push boundaries and be closer than ever to our community."</p>

            <p>Sales of Sony's PS5 consoles have now passed 65m units.</p>
<p>Sony says the growth in its game and network services division can be attributed to rising sales of its third party games, DLC, and PlayStation Plus subscriptions.</p>

<p>Despite hardware sales falling, however - compared to the same quarter last year, console sales dropped from 8.2m to 6.2m - PlayStation is reporting better hardware profitability.</p>
<p>Software sales are up, too. 131.3m games shipped in the first half of the financial year, of which 11.3m were first-party games. 1.5m of those alone come from Astro Bot, which only debuted at the beginning of September. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> has sold 13m copies across both PS5 and PC.</p>
<p>The report also attributed its earnings boost to "a new sports title" - thought to be <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a> - and "an action RPG title from China", which is likely <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>.</p>
<p>PlayStation Plus subscriptions, however, have stalled at 116m. Whilst that's up from 107m year-over-year, there has been no additional growth since last quarter.</p>
<p>"We intend to build on an optimum title portfolio during the current mid-range plan period, that combines single-player games, which are our strength and which have a higher predictability of becoming hits due to our proven IP, with live service games that pursue upside, while taking on a certain amount of risk upon release," Sony said.</p>
<p>Don't forget, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">PS5 Pro is out now,</a> and we recently learned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-was-already-working-on-ps5-pro-before-playstation-5-launch">Sony was working on the PS5 Pro console before it released the base PlayStation 5</a>.</p>

            <p>Sony's president Hiroki Totoki has reflected on the brief release and failure of the company's live-service flop, Concord.</p>
<p>Concord was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-exclusive-pvp-shooter-concord-is-firewalk-studios-first-game">debut game from FireWalk Studios</a>, which on its announcement promised  players a "unique universe of vibrant worlds, and its rich cast of colourful characters". However, despite high hopes from Sony, the game failed to take off, and after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-sales-fail-to-lift-off-on-steam-where-just-660-people-played-at-launch">a lacklustre launch</a>, the sci-fi shooter was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">taken offline just two weeks after its PS5 and PC debut</a>.</p>
<p>In a Q&amp;A following Sony's latest financial report, management was asked more about Concord, and the company's live service push. Here, Totoki said events from recent months had been a learning experience.</p>

<p>"Currently, we are still in the process of learning," Totoki said via an interpreter (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-president-reflects-on-why-concord-failed/">VGC</a>). "And basically, with regards to new IP, of course, you don't know the result until you actually try it.</p>
<p>"So for us, for our reflection, we probably need to have a lot of gates, including user testing or internal evaluation, and the timing of such gates. And then we need to bring them forward, and we should have done those gates much earlier than we did.</p>
<p>"Also, we have a siloed organisation, so going beyond the boundaries of those organisations in terms of development, and also sales, I think that could have been much smoother.</p>
<p>"And then going forward, in our own titles and in third-party titles, we do have many different windows. And we want to be able to select the right and optimal window so that we can deploy them on our own platform without cannibalisation, so that we can maximise our performance in terms of title launches.</p>
<p>"That's all I have."</p>

<p>Elsewhere during the same call, senior vice president for finance and IR at Sony, Sadahiko Hayakawa, noted the company had released two live service games, each with very different levels of success</p>
<p>"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> was a huge hit, while Concord ended up being shut down. We gained a lot of experience and learned a lot from both," the executive said.</p>
<p>"We intend to share the lessons learned from our successes and failures across our studios, including in the areas of title development management as well as the process of continually adding expanded content and scaling the service after its release so as to strengthen our development management system.</p><p>"We intend to build on an optimum title portfolio during the current mid-range plan period that combines single-player games - which are our strengths and which have a higher predictability of becoming hits due to our proven IP - with live-service games that pursue upside while taking on a certain amount of risk upon release."</p>
<p>On its release in February, Helldivers 2 soon became beloved by swathes of players wanting to do their bit for liberty by squashing Terminids and, on occasion, each other. On <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/553850/charts/">Steam</a>, it reached a peak player count of 458,709. In contrast, Concord's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/charts/">Steam</a> all-time peak sits at just 697.</p>
<p>Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">shut down Concord developer Firewalk Studios in October</a>, extinguishing hopes for any kind of revival.</p>
<p>In September, Totoki said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-concord-flops-sony-exec-says-company-doesnt-have-enough-original-ip">Sony didn't have enough original franchises</a> which it has "fostered from the beginning".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair has revealed details of Nintendo and The Pokémon Company's lawsuit which alleges that the game infringes on multiple patents. 
</p>
<p>
The monster battling and catching game had frequently been compared with Pokémon since its launch for PC and Xbox Series X/S in January. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company's lawsuit was filed</a> just weeks before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-is-officially-out-today-on-playstation">Palworld's PlayStation 5 version launched at the end of September</a>.
</p>
<p>
Today, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108">revealed</a> that the lawsuit relates to three patents filed between February and July this year - after Palworld's launch. However, they relate to a pre-existing "parent" patent filed by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company in December 2021, preceding Palworld's launch, meaning they could indeed still apply to Palworld now.
</p>

<p>
The developer also stated that Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are seeking "an injunction against Palworld", presumably to block its future sale within the Japanese jurisdiction of the patent lawsuit, as well as a fine of 10m yen (around £50k) split between the two firms, plus "late payment damages".
</p>
<p>
So, what are the patents Palworld is accused of infringing on?
</p>
<p>
As expected and sniffed out by fans and industry watchers previously, Nintendo's patents numbered 7545191, 7493117 and 7528390 lie at the heart of this legal action. These all cover gameplay mechanics such as the capture of digital creatures and the ability to ride on them. 
</p>
<p>
We previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-looks-to-hinge-on-pokeball-patent">highlighted the first of these patents in particular as likely behind the Palworld lawsuit</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The patent in question describes how a character catches a Pokémon by aiming and throwing a capture item, like a Pokéball, at a creature. Upon successful capture, the creature then becomes "owned by the player".
</p>
<p>
In Palworld, players catch Pals by aiming and throwing a capture item, named a Pal Sphere, at a creature. Upon successful capture, the creature then becomes owned by the player.
</p>
<p>
Japanese patent attorney Kiyoshi Kurihara previously dubbed the document a "killer patent" that would be "easy to infringe". 
</p>
<p>
Writing today, Palworld said once again <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-vows-to-fight-nintendo-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-fans-and-indie-developers">it would continue to fight the case</a>. "We will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings," it said.

<p>"On Borderlands, nearly everything that could go wrong did go wrong: it sat on the shelf for too long during the pandemic, and reshoots and rising interest rates took it outside the safety zone of our usual strict financial models," the Lionsgate boss said during Thursday's earnings call.</p><p>"Coupled with softer-than-anticipated results for other releases in the quarter", Felthemier said there was "less margin for error than ever before", with "several of [its] other releases in the quarter, though cushioned by financial models that worked as intended, [also not] living up to either our standards or our projections".</p>
<p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said in Take-Two's own earnings call earlier this week that though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-film-benefited-game-sales-despite-being-disappointing-flop-take-two-boss-says">"disappointing", the movie hasn't hurt the Borderlands video game series</a>. In fact, it gave it a boost.</p>
<p>This year's Cate Blanchett-fronted film was branded a "disaster" and "huge misfire" by viewers. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-borderlands-movie-impressions-brand-it-a-disaster-and-a-huge-misfire">one review called it a "lifeless, unfunny, and visually repulsive dud"</a>.</p>
<p>The adaptation generated just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-earned-4m-on-its-opening-day">$4m across 3125 locations on its opening day</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youll-be-able-to-watch-the-borderlands-film-at-home-very-soon-it-seems">quickly getting shifted onto streaming services</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After earning <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-off-to-strong-start-reportedly-earns-12m-in-four-days">$12m in its first four days</a>, Pokémon TCG Pocket has now passed 30m downloads after a week.
</p>
<p>
The smash-hit digital version of Pokémon's trading card game is off to a strong start, then - and at this pace looks set to hit 50m downloads faster than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> did back in 2016. Pokémon Go went on to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-has-now-been-downloaded-1bn-times">rack up 500m downloads in its first three months</a>, climbing to 1bn downloads by August 2019.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-focus-is-on-pack-opening-but-theres-a-promising-version-of-the-card-game-underneath">Pokémon TCG Pocket is heavily built around the opening of trading card game packs</a>, something the game's own social media account nodded to when sharing today's news.
</p>
<p>
"T-t-t-thirty million?! How many packs have been opened, then?" the game's social media account wrote on X. Sadly, it did not provide an answer.
</p>
<p>
"On behalf of everyone working on the game and me, thank you for all your support! Seriously. If you haven't downloaded it, try it and let us know what you think."

            <p>Following on from her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-adds-schitts-creek-star-catherine-ohara-to-its-cast">role in the second season of HBO's The Last of Us adaptation</a>, Home Alone star Catherine O'Hara has joined the second season of… ok, no she hasn't just joined the second season <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a>. But, the son she left at home has.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/11/macaulay-culkin-cast-fallout-season-2-1236170530/">Deadline</a>'s sources, Macaulay Culkin has joined the cast for season two of Fallout, in a recurring role. Further details on his part remain slim for now, however Culkin is said to be playing "a crazy genius-type character" when the show's second season rolls around.</p>
<p>As Deadline notes, Culkin has already worked with Amazon before, cameoing in its adult animated series The Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy, alongside his brothers.</p>

<p>Culkin will be joining cast members Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten, Kyle MacLachlan and Walton Goggins - who play wide-eyed vault dweller Lucy, squire of the Brotherhood of Steel Maximus, disgraced (at least, in the eyes of many) Vault-Tec executive Hank MacLean and the gunslinging Ghoul, respectively - when the Amazon's Fallout series makes its return.</p><p>As for when that will be? According to Leslie Uggams, who starred as Vault 33 Overseer Betty Pearson in the first season of Fallout, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-filming-begins-a-lot-sooner-than-expected">filming for season two will begin this month</a>. Meanwhile, in June, Fallout's showrunners said they wanted to get the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallouts-second-season-will-be-out-as-fast-as-humanly-possible">second season of Amazon's adaptation out as soon as it is possible</a>.</p>
