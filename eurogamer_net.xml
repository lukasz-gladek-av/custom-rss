            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country-returns">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a> HD is set to release on Switch in January and will come with a new, easier difficulty mode.</p>
<p>While Original Mode will preserve the high difficulty of the original release, the new Modern Mode will give the titular gorilla three hearts by default instead of two, plus players can carry up to nine items to help out.</p>
<p>The more forgiving option is detailed in a new gameplay trailer for the game released by Nintendo. Check it out below.</p>

<p>The HD re-release of Rare's game takes inspiration from both its original Wii release and its subsequent 3DS release.</p>
<p>The 3DS release, for instance, also featured an easier difficulty mode known as New Mode. Here Donkey Kong had an extra heart and a wider variety of items available to buy in Kranky Kong's shop.</p>
<p>And like the Wii release, players on Switch will be able to use Joy-con motion controls to slap the ground.</p>
<p>Co-op mode will also be included with one pair of Joy-con controllers.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns released on the Wii in 2010, followed by its 3DS release in 2013. Its sequel, Tropical Freeze, came to WiiU in 2014 and was then ported to Switch in 2018.</p>
<p>The release of Donkey Kong Country Returns HD on Switch follows the addition of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-land-is-available-now-via-nintendo-switch-online">Donkey Kong Land Game Boy games to Switch Online</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p>It's all to celebrate the opening of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-miyamoto-take-a-tour-of-super-nintendo-worlds-new-donkey-kong-country-theme-park-expansion">Donkey Kong Country theme park expansion at Universal Studios Japan</a>, after a six month delay.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Pokémon Company is teaming up with Wallace and Gromit maker Aardman for a "special project" due in 2027.</p>
<p>Though it's unclear exactly what the project will be, Aardman will be bringing its "unique style of storytelling to the Pokémon universe in brand-new adventures" - presumably a film or TV series.</p>
<p>Aardman is best known for its stop-motion Wallace and Gromit films, but has also dabbled in video games with Shaun the Sheep and Chicken Run spin-offs, as well as the BAFTA-nominated 11-11: Memories Retold set in WW1.</p>

<p>"This is a dream partnership for Pokémon," said Taito Okiura, VP of marketing and media at The Pokémon Company. "Aardman are masters of their craft, and we have been blown away by their talent and creativity. What we have been working on together ensures our global Pokémon fans are in for a treat!"</p>
<p>"It's a huge honour to be working with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/the-pokemon-company">The Pokémon Company International</a> - we feel sincerely privileged to be trusted with bringing their characters and world to life in a brand-new way," added Sean Clarke, managing director of Aardman.</p>
<p>"Bringing together Pokémon, the world's biggest entertainment brand, together with our love of craft, character and comedic storytelling feels incredibly exciting. Aardman and TPCi share an emphasis on heritage and attention to detail as well as putting our fans and audiences at the heart of what we do, which we know will steer us right as we together create charming, original and new stories for audiences around the world."</p><div>

            <p>It's the most wonderful time of the year, and the lovely <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> lot are embracing the festive season and gifting us all with a Winter Wonder update.</p>
<p>This is a gift, so the update will be free for those who have completed Astro Bot. In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/11/astro-bot-winter-wonder-update-out-tomorrow/?sf275746168=1">PlayStation blog</a> update, developer Team Asobi said it was the studio's way of saying thank you for all the kind words and support since Astro Bot's release back in September.</p>
<p>As for what is actually included, this update adds a new level for players to platform their way through, and yes, it has a wintery theme. Team Asobi is keeping further detail pretty schtum for now, as it says it wants to keep things as much of a surprise as possible. However, the developer has said to expect its snowy level to be filled  with "shiny presents, a good dose of jingle bells, and brand-new special bots to add to your crew".</p>

<p>"This winter update was made with every user in mind, meaning it is a celebration enjoyable for children and adults alike," the Astro Bot team furthered, "so, no hair-pulling challenge this time! :) We had a lot of fun making this special present for you all, and we hope you enjoy it very much, too."</p><p>The update will go live tomorrow, 12th December, at 6pm Pacific time. That's 2am on 13th December, for those of us on the chilly shores of Blighty (where I live, it was -8C last night and I am still defrosting).</p>
<p>Again, to access this Winter Wonder update, players will need to have completed Astro Bot. An internet connection is also required.</p>
