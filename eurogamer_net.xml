            <p>Sony is ending its PlayStation Stars loyalty programme, in its current form, after three years.</p>
<p>The programme first started in July 2022 and allowed players to earn reward points to be redeemed for PSN wallet funds and other products on the store. It became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-stars-program-now-available-in-uk">available in the UK</a> later that year.</p>
<p>However, Sony is now ending support for the programme as it evaluates "the types of activities our players respond best to", though it could return in some form in the future.</p>

<p>From today, new members to the PlayStation Stars programme will no longer be accepted and if current members cancel they won't be able to rejoin this version of the programme - all earned Points will be lost.</p>
<p>Current PlayStation Stars members can still earn points and products until 23rd July 3:59pm UK time (7:59am PDT, 11:59pm JST). No new campaigns will be available after this time.</p>
<p>This version of PlayStation Stars will fully end on 2nd November 2026. Current members can still earn points until this time. Digital Collectibles will still be accessible after these changes take place.</p>
<p>"Since launching the programme, we've learned a lot from evaluating the types of activities our players respond best to, and as a company, we are always evolving with player and industry trends," said the company on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/21/playstation-stars-coming-to-a-close-as-sie-evaluates-new-ways-to-evolve-future-loyalty-program-efforts/?sf277358162=1">PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>
<p>"Through this evaluation, we have decided to refocus our efforts and will be winding down the current version of PlayStation Stars. We will continue to evaluate our key findings from this programme, and are looking into ways to build upon these learnings."</p>
<p>At the launch of PlayStation Stars, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-stars-loyalty-programme-announced">Sony confirmed its Digital Collectibles were not NFTs, were not tradable, and did not leverage blockchain technology</a>.</p>
<p>It's unclear how the programme will evolve, but it would seem this isn't the last time we'll see PlayStation Stars.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
