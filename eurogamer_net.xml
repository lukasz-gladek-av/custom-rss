            <p>EA and Dice have detailed what's changing in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> Beta in its second week, which kicks off today and runs until 17th August.</p>
<p>Changes are being made to the All-Out Warfare playlist and there is now more control over map and mode selection thanks to custom search. New players will still be able to access training and general gameplay overviews for classes, Breakthrough, and Conquest.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Playlists Adjustments</strong></p>
<p>During Week 2, we're delivering more variety and choice for how you‚Äôd like to play with more playlists rotating between multiple different game modes. As an example, the All-Out Warfare playlist will include both Breakthrough, Conquest, and Rush. The in-game descriptions for each mode will tell you which modes are included in the rotation.</p>
<p>Rotating through multiple modes within playlists helps us understand what our community enjoys as we shape the launch experience, and enables us to keep more fan-favorite modes available at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Search Options</strong></p>
<p>Based on your previous feedback and to give you more control over map and mode selection, we're introducing a new feature called Custom Search.</p>
<p>This feature allows you to choose your favorite combinations of maps and modes. For example, if you want to play Conquest on Siege of Cairo, then matchmaking will prioritize putting you in a match with this combo, if available. Note that this is not a Server Browser (which is not being tested this week).</p>
<p>During Open Beta, Custom Search will be available for Open Weapon mode playlists so you can mix and match maps and modes as you prefer.</p>
<p><strong>Weekend 2 Playlists Overview</strong></p>
<p>Here is an overview of what the Open Beta Weekend 2 playlists will look like:</p>
<p><strong>Day 1, Thursday 14th</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conquest</li>
<li>Rush</li>
<li>Attack &amp; Defend (Breakthrough, Rush)</li>
<li>Close Quarters; Fast-paced playlist on smaller maps (Domination, King of the Hill)</li>
<li>Closed Weapons All-Out Warfare (Conquest, Breakthrough)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Day 2, Friday 15th</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conquest</li>
<li>Squad Deathmatch</li>
<li>Close Quarters; Fast-paced playlist on smaller maps (Domination, King of the Hill, Squad Deathmatch)</li>
<li>All-Out Warfare; Epic battles across expansive maps (Conquest, Breakthrough, Rush)</li>
<li>Closed Weapons All-Out Warfare (Conquest, Breakthrough)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Day 3-4, Saturday 16th - Sunday 17th</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conquest</li>
<li>Close Quarters; Fast-paced playlist on smaller maps (Domination, King of the Hill, Squad Deathmatch).</li>
<li>All-Out Warfare; Epic battles across expansive maps (Conquest, Breakthrough, Rush)</li>
<li>Closed Weapons All-Out Warfare (Conquest, Breakthrough)</li>
<li>Rotating through playlists daily is specific for the Open Beta while we're still able to test and gather feedback, and is not planned for launch.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other details to note:</strong></p>
<p>Training Grounds will continue to offer the Firing Range and gameplay introductions for classes, Breakthrough, and Conquest.</p>
<p>Players at career rank 15 and below can access Initiation Mode, which includes AI Soldiers. This initiation experience is tailored for new players and will shift from Breakthrough to Conquest. Separately, there will be a non-playable introduction to Rush as well.</p>
<p>Thank you for your feedback and enthusiasm over this weekend. We look forward to seeing how these playlist options work in the matchmaking and the flexibility they offer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Battlefield 6 releases on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series consoles on 10th October.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG: Battlegrounds</a> team has announced that the game will cease to be playable on last-generation PS4 and Xbox One consoles starting 13th November. All development and support for the game will be focused on the PS5 and Xbox Series consoles going forward.</p>
<p>According to the PUBG team, this decision was made to ensure players have a more stable gameplay environment (less crashes) and to improve visuals and performance.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>End of Support for PS4 and Xbox One / Transition to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</strong></p>
<p><strong>Transition Schedule</strong></p>
<p>During the live server maintenance on November 13, 2025</p>
<p><em>Please note that the schedule is subject to change depending on the review process of each platform. Any updates will be shared separately.</em></p>
<p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p>
<p>After the live server maintenance on November 13, PUBG Console will only be available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS will no longer be downloadable or playable on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p>
<p>Your existing account data and purchased items will be securely preserved. You can log in on a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S at any time after the transition and continue playing with your existing account‚Äîno separate transfer process required.</p>
<p>PlayStation users will need to download the PS5 version of PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS from the PlayStation Store after November 13 in order to continue playing. Xbox users who already have the game installed will receive the current-gen version automatically via Smart Delivery starting November 13.</p>
<p><strong>Refund Information</strong></p>
<p>Refunds for BATTLEGROUNDS Plus and PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS will be handled in accordance with each platform's refund policy and procedures. For more details, please contact the customer support team of your respective platform.</p>
<p><strong>Supported Specs After Transition to Current-Gen Consoles</strong></p>
<p>Following the transition of PUBG Console to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on November 13, the supported specifications will be as follows:</p>
<table data-mobile-mode="scroll">
<tbody><tr>
<th></th>
<th>Xbox Series S</th>
<th>Xbox Series X</th>
<th>PlayStation 5</th>
<th>PlayStation 5 Pro</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Resolution</th>
<td>1080p/1440p</td>
<td>2160p</td>
<td>1440p</td>
<td>2160p</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>FPS</th>
<td>60fps/30fps</td>
<td>60fps</td>
<td>60fps</td>
<td>60fps</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Xbox Series S supports either 1080p at 60fps or 1440p at 30fps, and you can choose between the two settings.</p>
<p>Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 Pro support Dynamic 4K resolution.</p>
<p>The supported specifications for current-gen consoles were determined through extensive technical review and internal testing to ensure the most stable and optimized PUBG Console gameplay experience. In particular, memory and graphical specifications have been carefully configured with future content updates in mind, to ensure the system is well-prepared to support them smoothly.</p>
<p>As PUBG Console supports cross-play between platforms, fairness across all platforms was one of our top priorities. With this in mind, our goal is to provide a stable 60fps experience across all platforms. To account for differences in hardware performance, Xbox Series S will offer selectable options such as Resolution Mode and Performance Mode.</p>
