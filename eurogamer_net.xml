            <p>More games have been added to the Video Game Hall of Fame, including Rare's brilliant first-person shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/goldeneye-007-review">GoldenEye 007</a>.</p>
<p>The Strong Museum's <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/exhibits/world-video-game-hall-of-fame/">Video Game Hall of Fame</a> was established back in 2015, with a goal to recognise individual electronic games from arcade to console and everything in between which have "enjoyed popularity over a sustained period and have exerted influence on the video game industry or on popular culture and society in general".</p>
<p>And now, having missed out on being inducted to this Hall of Fame back in 2023, N64 classic GoldenEye 007 has finally made the cut.</p>

<p>"GoldenEye surpassed its contemporaries to become the third best-selling game on the Nintendo 64, beaten only by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-64">Mario Kart 64</a>," the <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/games/goldeneye-007/">Video Game Hall of Fame team wrote of GoldenEye 007</a>.</p>
<p>"Critics lauded it as the premier example of a first-person shooter to succeed on a console rather than a PC, and it is still considered one of the best multiplayer experiences ever produced on a Nintendo system."</p>
<p>This is honestly one of my favourite games of all time. When it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/goldeneye-007-comes-to-nintendo-switch-online-xbox-game-pass-this-friday">released on Xbox in 2023</a>, I spent quite a bit of time besting my family in the multiplayer. And, thanks to the introduction of Achievements with this Xbox release, I can still look back at my unforgiving gaming dominance with pride... (see below)</p>

<p>Other games inducted into the Strong Museum's World Video Game Hall of Fame this year are Defender, Quake and Tamagotchi. Since its conception in 2015, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-first-video-game-hall-of-fame-selects-its-inaugural-class">49 games have been added to the Strong Museum's World Video Game Hall of Fame</a>. These include classics such as the original Tomb Raider, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-ocarina-of-time-is-finally-in-the-video-game-hall-of-fame">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>, Tetris and Pac-Man.</p>
<p>As for the future of James Bond games, Hitman developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has one in the pipeline, known for now as Project 007. This release will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy">kick off a new trilogy of games</a>, IOI hopes. </p>

            <p>Nintendo has updated its Nintendo Account Agreement with a severe warning against "unauthorised use", in a bid to prevent emulation and piracy.</p>
<p>All those with a Nintendo account will have received an email (including Eurogamer) linking to the updated policy. And, as <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/nintendo-emulation-hacking-brick-warning-terms-of-service">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a> spotted, the wording for the Licence for Digital Products section has been altered.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://accounts.nintendo.com/term/eula/GB?lang=en-GB">agreement for UK accounts</a> now states digital products are "licensed only for personal and non-commercial use", and that any "unauthorised use of a Digital Product may result in the Digital Product becoming unusable".</p>

<p>This differs slightly from the US, which states: "You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with the foregoing restrictions Nintendo may render the Nintendo Account Services and/or the applicable Nintendo device permanently unusable in whole or in part."</p>
<p>For comparison, here's the original wording (effective since April 2021): "You are not allowed to lease, rent, sublicense, publish, copy, modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble all or any portion of the Nintendo Account Services without Nintendo's written consent, or unless otherwise expressly permitted by applicable law."</p>
<p>And here's the UK update in full: "Any Digital Products registered to your Nintendo Account and any updates of such Digital Products are licensed only for personal and non-commercial use on a User Device. Digital Products must not be used for any other purpose. In particular, without NOE's written consent, you must neither lease nor rent Digital Products nor sublicense, publish, copy, modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any portion of Digital Products other than as expressly permitted by applicable law. Such unauthorised use of a Digital Product may result in the Digital Product becoming unusable."</p>
<p>The US update is as follows: "Without limitation, you agree that you may not (a) publish, copy, modify, reverse engineer, lease, rent, decompile, disassemble, distribute, offer for sale, or create derivative works of any portion of the Nintendo Account Services; (b) bypass, modify, decrypt, defeat, tamper with, or otherwise circumvent any of the functions or protections of the Nintendo Account Services, including through the use of any hardware or software that would cause the Nintendo Account Services to operate other than in accordance with its documentation and intended use; (c) obtain, install or use any unauthorised copies of Nintendo Account Services; or (d) exploit the Nintendo Account Services in any manner other than to use them in accordance with the applicable documentation and intended use, in each case, without Nintendo's written consent or express authorisation, or unless otherwise expressly permitted by applicable law. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with the foregoing restrictions Nintendo may render the Nintendo Account Services and/or the applicable Nintendo device permanently unusable in whole or in part."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://accounts.nintendo.com/term/privacy_policy/GB?lang=en-GB">Nintendo Account Privacy Policy</a> has also been updated ahead of the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>. Now, Nintendo will be able to record video and voice chats stored on your console for a limited period of time - if you give consent.</p>
<p>This is intended for anyone who encounters "language or behaviour that may violate applicable laws", with the company able to review the last three minutes of recorded footage. This is to ensure a "safe and family-friendly online environment".</p>
<p>The update comes ahead of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-finally-explains-what-switch-2s-mysterious-c-button-does">Game Chat feature on Switch 2</a>, where players can essentially video call each other during gameplay.</p>
<p>Back in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-latest-legal-win-against-piracy-significant-for-the-entire-games-industry">Nintendo shared a legal victory over French file-sharing company Dstorage</a>, which it stated was "significant...for the entire games industry".</p>
<p>It followed a string of moves against piracy, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">shutdown of Switch emulator Yuzu</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-streamer-who-said-he-could-broadcast-its-pirated-games-all-day">lawsuit against a streamer who regularly played pirated copies of Nintendo games ahead of release</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bam Margera will officially return in the remake of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>, but as a secret skater.</p>
<p>Margera first appeared in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</a> and returned in each subsequent game in the series. However, when the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-official-announcement-reveals-deluxe-edition-with-doom-slayer">remake was announced back in March</a>, fans noticed the skater missing from the playable line-up.</p>
<p>Now, Activision has confirmed in a social media post he'll be making his return, along with a video of Margera joking about missing flights in the past due to getting sucked into the second game.</p>

<p>It's unclear why Margera was initially left out of the line-up, with fans speculating it may be related to legal issues he's faced following struggles with drug and alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>However, skating podcast The Nine Club co-host Roger Bagley claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-reportedly-intervened-to-get-bam-margera-in-pro-skater-3-4-remake-after-activision-said-no">Margera would still appear thanks to the insistence of Tony Hawk himself</a>.</p>
<p>"Well, here's what happened," Bagley explained in a livestream. "The game was already done. Tony called up Activision and was like, 'Hey, we're putting Bam in the thing', and they were like, 'Hey, we can't'. He goes, 'No, you're gonna do it', and basically made them fly Bam back out there to get body-scanned and everything else, and get him back in the game."</p>
<p>The last minute addition would perhaps explain why he's a secret unlockable skater, rather than being available from the start.</p>

<p>The confirmed skater roster features both classic skaters and newer additions, including Tony Hawk, Bucky Lasek, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Geoff Rowley, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Chad Muska, Eric Koston, Rodney Mullen, Jamie Thomas, Rune Glifberg, Bob Burnquist, Rayssa Leal, Chloe Covell, Jamie Foy, Zion Wright, and Yuto Horigome.</p>
<p>The remake of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will arrive on 11th July across PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Switch and PC (Steam, Battle.net, Microsoft Store). It will be coming to Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC too.</p>
<p>Fans also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-is-switching-up-how-thps4-works">spotted some changes to the career mode in the fourth game</a> - objectives will now need to be completed under a timer instead of exploring levels freely.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a> will be a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> launch game, but developer Toby Fox has announced the RPG will be cross-compatible with both Switch consoles.</p>
<p>That means if you buy the Switch 1 version now, you can get the Switch 2 version later at no additional cost. Similarly, on the PlayStation Store, you get both the PS4 and PS5 versions at once.</p>
<p>Fox also <a href="https://toby.fangamer.com/newsletters/release-time/">confirmed the release times for the game</a>, with the Switch 2 version being available from 5th June at midnight local time in each respective region. That does mean Japanese players will have access to the game much earlier than those in the US.</p>

<p>For other platforms, though, the game will launch at a specific time globally - that's midnight Japan time on 5th June, meaning it's actually out on 4th June in other countries.</p>
<p>As such, the launch times for the game will be as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Switch 2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>5th June 12am local time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam, Switch, PS4, PS5</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>5th June 12am JST</li>
<li>4th June 4pm UK</li>
<li>4th June 5pm CET</li>
<li>4th June 11am EDT</li>
<li>4th June 8am PDT</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, Fox shared a handful of trophies that will be available on the PlayStation version of the game. He noted players will need to complete the current "room" where a trophy unlocks in order to receive it.</p>
<p>He added: "But, really, I think you'll enjoy the game more if you don't pay attention to whether you get the trophies."</p>
<p>Deltarune is Fox's follow-up to the cult classic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/undertale">Undertale</a>. Though development began in 2012, it's been released episodically as a series of chapters - the first two were available for free when released in 2018 and 2021 respectively.</p>
<p>This release next month will therefore at long last mark the game's complete release.</p>
<p>"Toby Fox is in a weird position," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-is-a-game-about-playing-and-its-bloody-brilliant">Eurogamer's preview of the first two Deltarune chapters</a>. "On one level, he has every artist's dream: near unlimited resources, plenty of time, and an eager fanbase willing to lick the dregs of an idea from his outstretched fingertip. He can make whatever he likes. But whatever he makes, be it a cupcake or a clothing brand or a package holiday business, will be compared, inevitably, to Undertale."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
