            <p>
Following last week's announcement that long-running MMO The Elder Scrolls Online would be moving away from traditional major expansions to focus on smaller seasonal updates, developer ZeniMax Online has insisted the big shake-up is in no way related to last year's sweeping layoffs at parent company Microsoft, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenimax-employees-discuss-chaos-of-microsofts-inhumane-mass-layoffs-in-new-report">heavily impacted</a> the studio.
</p>
<p>
Last July, in a year that saw Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella boast "record performance" and a revenue increase to $281.7bn, the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">announced mass layoffs</a> affecting over 9000 employees across the company, marking its third round of significant job cuts since 2023. The move - which impacted numerous Xbox studios including Rare, Turn 10, The Initiative, and Raven Software - was accompanied by multiple project cancellations.

<p>
ZeniMax Online Studios' in-development sci-fi MMO Project Blackbird was one of the games impacted, and its cancellation coincided with nearly 200 job cuts at the studio. But following last week's announcement that <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/69137">The Elder Scrolls Online would be shifting to smaller seasonal releases</a>, executive producer Susan Kath has insisted the two events are unrelated.
</p>
<p>
"Seasons is not in any way a response to [the layoffs]," Kath <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-smaller-expansions-are-not-in-any-way-a-result-of-last-years-layoffs">recently told RockPaperShotgun</a>. "We kicked off the Season work at least 12 to 14 months ago. We started making the changes in the team to move in this direction, knowing that this was our intent."
</p><p>
Kath describes 2025 as a "hard year for the studio", but acknowledges Blackbird's cancellation could be seen as a positive for ESO. "Ultimately, we had a lot of people doing double duty on those projects, splitting their time between projects," she continued. "[They] are now devoted 100 percent to Elder Scrolls Online. So, in fact, in some capacities, we actually increased the number of folks available as we came out of that because they weren't managing two products anymore. They were only devoted to one title."
</p>
<p>
ZeniMax first publicly discussed the idea of smaller updates for The Elder Scrolls Online shortly after the layoffs. In September, studio game director Rich Lambert <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-elder-scrolls-online-heads-on-the-aftermath-of-microsofts-cuts-and-the-future-of-the-long-running-mmo">told GamesIndustry.biz</a> the MMO was in "a bit of a transition year", and that the team was now looking to get "smaller, more bite-sized things out quicker". The aim, he said, was to launch these smaller updates roughly every six to nine months, compared to the 12-15 month release schedule for traditional expansions. And last week, ZeniMax formalised its plans, announcing a move to smaller, quarterly - and free - seasons, starting 2nd April, which will also see many earlier paid expansions rolled into the base game. This change coincides with the introduction of a seasonal (but not time-limited) battle pass, featuring a free tier and two paid extensions.

<p>
In a press briefing attended by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">RPS</a> ahead of the announcement, Elder Scrolls Online game director Nick Giaomini insisted the shift would give the team the "flexibility to make our game more exciting and invest in addressing long standing pain points, add features and improvements players have been asking for, and update and iterate on the core game, rather than always just chasing something brand new."
</p><p>
"To say that [the layoffs] didn't impact us wouldn't be right," Giacomini added. "We're putting on a strong face. We're human. It absolutely impacted us. But, you know, the team rallied. We're excited about the future. We're excited that we're making all these big changes."

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon</a> is celebrating its 30th anniversary on 27th February, and we're collectively dying to see what might be revealed about the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-teraleak-reveals-unannounced-games-seemingly-laying-out-franchises-major-releases-through-2030">long-rumoured next mainline game</a> and other projects. Moreover, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokopia</a> aims to shake things up with a new take on town life sims in early March. In its beginnings, however, the series took a long time to figure out.</p>
<p>This is what The Pokémon Company president and CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara said during a brief appearance at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HNNugGXKQ0">New York Game Awards</a> through a special video (hat tip to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/pokemons-game-boy-development-process-took-a-great-deal-of-trial-and-error">Nintendo Life</a>). The franchise as a whole <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokemon-to-receive-prestigious-award-at-the-15th-annual-new-york-game-awards">received the Andrew Yoon Legend Award</a>, which celebrates a "sustained body of work demonstrating exceptional artistic achievement and innovation."</p>
<p>Ishihara took this opportunity to reflect on the series' humble origins. The games were made with "limited resources" back then, and he underlined Red and Green took "a great deal of trial and error" to get right and to the finish line. He even revealed the entire process ended up lasting six years, which is shocking to learn about when you consider dev cycles back in the day were substantially shorter than nowadays. What now feels normal rarely happened back then.</p>
<p>We know it all paid off in the end, and much like us, Ishihara believes it was all about having a strong base-level idea the team was confident about: "Still, we all felt confident in the main gameplay elements that would become the foundation of the Pokémon video game series: catch, raise, trade, and battle." These elements were designed with nostalgic themes and warm feelings in mind, as it was all tied to "fundamental experiences" many players had as children who connected with nature.</p><p>That said, he was "uncertain at first" about its appeal outside Japan as many formative childhood experiences aren't shared. Needless to say, there was nothing to be scared of. After that initial hit, Pokémon's core themes of friendship and our (often very complicated) relationship with the world shaped the franchise's identity.</p>
<p>No comments on the next main game from Ishihara beyond continuing to use those tenets as a "major driving force," but that could change soon.</p>

            <p>One of the original Tomb Raider creators has shared some details on a previous request from a Japanese publisher, which asked the team to give Lara Croft an anime-style redesign to make her more widely appealing.</p>
<p>According to Paul Douglas - who in his own words "co-created Tomb Raider half a lifetime ago" - publisher Victor Interactive wanted the team to change up Lara's in-game look to "appeal more to a Japanese audience".</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>The Tomb Raider creator said this redesign request included ideas for Lara to have "huge eyes/head etc". Douglas added the publisher went so far as to send over a fax with some design suggestions late in Tomb Raider's development. However, fellow Tomb Raider developer Toby Gard "didn't really want to alter Lara", Douglas said on his <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cnhyv.bsky.social/post/3mcq3dxcwv22o">Bluesky account</a> (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/CoreDesign_com">@CoreDesign_com</a>).</p>
<p>In order to keep both parties happy, a compromise was reached. This saw Tomb Raider's manual and guide feature more "manga-style" characters, though Douglas is "not sure who did that render or illustrations".</p>
<p><a href="https://xcancel.com/cnhyv/status/1362414841424728073">Back in 2021</a>, Douglas shared some images of these characters, with a few extra background notes. At this time, the Tomb Raider co-creator said he believed Victor "just assumed altering all the models would only take a few days of work".  However, this was "early days of 3D... 🙄", so would of course take considerable time.</p>
<p>"It started out as a request to change all the in-game and cutscene models.Then just in-game. Then just Lara. Then just Lara's head…"</p>
<p>You can check out more of these manga-style Tomb Raider images below.</p>

<p>The original Tomb Raider is currently getting a from the ground up remake, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards">known as Legacy of Atlantis</a>. This will be released later this year, across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam.</p>
<p>Along with the remake, Crystal Dynamics is also working on the next <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> entry with Amazon. It's known as Catalyst, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards">takes Lara to Northern India</a>. Earlier this week, Eva La Dare - known to many as Sheva Alomar in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-5">Resident Evil 5</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-5-and-street-fighter-actor-confirms-tomb-raider-catalyst-role">announced she was part of Tomb Raider: Catalyst's cast</a>.</p>

            <p>A top-to-bottom Atari-themed hotel is increasingly close to becoming a reality. A location has been found - in the centre of Phoenix, Arizona - and the company responsible, Intersection Development, says construction will begin late 2026 with a prospective opening date of late 2028.</p>
<p>The architectural company designing the building, Räkkhaus, revealed updated designs and features for the hotel. Renders show a large but not enormous building bearing the Atari logo and decked out with bright lighting everywhere. To me it looks like an arcade version of an Ibis.</p>
<figure>
 


</figure>
<p>But to borrow from the press release's much more poetic language: the Atari Hotel uses the "visual language" of Tron and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> to create a "glowing monolith of light and motion" (I bet the neighbours are pleased). The "fractured" design on the outside of the building is supposed to evoke pixel grids, and the streaks of light on the inside are supposed to remind us of arcade circuitry.</p><p>A defining feature will apparently be an LED-lit "breezeway" (pictured top) - a passage wrapped in programmable LEDs - which can be programmed to suit whatever event or season makes sense at the time. Räkkhaus reckons it'll feel like a portal from the outside world into the hotel.</p>

</figure>

</figure>
<p>The 90,000 sqft building will also feature a 20,000 sqft concert center, an esports venue, several restaurants, retail spaces and an "oversized pool designed for high-energy parties and gatherings". There will be 72 rooms in the building - a nod to Atari being founded in 1972 - as well as 19 suites and a "Baller Suite" penthouse with a private pool, spa and sun deck.</p><p>Räkkhaus creative director Zac Cohen called it: "A tower defined by motion, responsive surfaces, and a frame that glows with its own internal logic. This is placemaking at a new scale, a building that will be truly unique in the world."</p>
<figure>
 


</figure>
<p>However, there's still a slight question over the Atari Hotel securing the rest of the funding it needs in order to be built. Because although $14m has been raised in investment to get things going, the total budget is estimated at $124m, according to the <a href="https://www.atarihotels.com/">Atari Hotels website</a>.</p>
<p>Intersection hopes to make the money by asking the public to invest. For a minimum investment of $500, you can own a piece of the project - the land, the building and the Atari Hotel name, apparently - as well as receive various owner perks.</p><p>"You're helping turn an iconic gaming legacy into a real destination and you'll share in the success of the project along the way. Think of it as owning a piece of the experience, not just the idea," says the Atari Hotel website FAQ.</p>

<p>It's not clear what will happen if the money is not raised by the public, though, and whether the Atari Hotel will be constructed anyway.</p>
<p><a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2026/jan/16/atari-hotel-project-in-las-vegas-quietly-powers-do/">The Atari Hotels were first announced six years ago in 2020</a>, as part of a masterplan to build a chain of them around the US. The first were earmarked for Las Vegas, Nevada, and Phoenix, Arizona, but the Vegas plans have been dropped along the way. <a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2026/jan/16/atari-hotel-project-in-las-vegas-quietly-powers-do/">The Las Vegas Sun reported</a> that the company explored deals in the city but none came to fruition.</p>
<p>Originally an architectural company called Gensler was attached to the Atari Hotel project and shared concept images that were much grander, featuring taller buildings with far more elaborate structures and designs. These new designs are more mundane, but perhaps more realistic as a result. Phoenix also makes sense as a starting place with both Räkkhaus and Intersection having offices in the city.</p>

            <p>With the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-the-switch-2-getting-more-expensive-soon-nintendo-says-theres-no-immediate-impact-but-will-keep-an-eye-on-volatile-memory-market">menace of price hikes</a> looming over every piece of gaming hardware and early 2026 reports that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-source-blames-switch-2-holiday-sales-slowdown-on-the-economic-landscape-and-the-absence-of-a-major-western-game-despite-the-release-of-metroid-prime-4-beyond">Nintendo Switch 2 was below Switch 1's sales curve over its first December period</a> in the US and Europe, many have started to wonder if we were looking at a strong start with bad legs for the newest hybrid console. But, in Japan at least, that doesn't seem to be the case.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japans-console-game-market-grew-by-138-8-in-2025-driven-by-the-nintendo-switch-2/">Automaton West</a> (from original reports by Kadokawa Game Linkage and Famitsu), we have learned Japan's console game market saw a big boost year-on-year in 2025, with a 138.8 percent growth across the board. It reached 418.13 billion yen, which amounts to around $2.64 billion. These figures are based on physical software and hardware sales as reported through the end of 2025, so they include the bulk of the Christmas shopping we typically see every December.</p>
<p>Mind you, we haven't seen the more specific data for the Christmas period, but overall, Japan's console game market is looking remarkably strong, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pierre485.bsky.social/post/3mbwj5lp24s2o">outpacing Switch 1's first year</a> (and every other console's, it seems) in Nintendo's home turf. Things look even better when we take into account that digital sales, DLC, and in-game purchases are not accounted for in the aforementioned reports.</p>
<p>Moreover, the original Switch continued to perform well given its age and the presence of Nintendo's second hybrid console, with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendos-japan-dominance-continues-as-switch-2-fuels-40-market-growth-in-2025/">1.52 million units reportedly sold in 2025</a>, putting it above PS5's sales in Japan last year. It must be noted <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/466770/2025-japan-sales-comparison-charts-through-december-switch-2-vs-ps5-vs-xbox-series-vs-switch/">other charts aren't as optimistic</a>, but the information shared shows the Japanese market favours Nintendo's hardware.</p>
<p>When it comes to best-selling physical games in Japan, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> (2.668 million units) and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> (2.534 million units) conquered the top spots with the Switch 1 &amp; 2 releases combined.</p>
<p>Looking at what early 2026 has in store for us and the strong focus on iconic JRPG series like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-demo-now-available-on-switch-2-and-xbox-series-xs-so-you-can-check-out-performance-on-nintendos-console">Final Fantasy</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-are-developing-this-to-be-the-masterpiece-version-dragon-quest-7s-producer-on-taking-a-scalpel-to-the-structure-of-a-classic">Dragon Quest</a> making the jump to Switch 2 before first-party heavy hitters start to arrive, we're not expecting a slowdown of that market's growth.</p>

            <p>Marathon has swiftly climbed Steam's Top Sellers list following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-release-date-reportedly-leaks-via-xbox-store-pre-order-trailer">reveal of its 5th March release date</a>.</p>
<p>Bungie's extraction shooter, which has up until now lived in the realm of closed betas and behind-closed-doors tests, was made available for pre-order overnight. In those midnight hours many wallets were opened by keen members of the public, landing on the number seven spot.</p>
<p>It lies currently behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, at third. There's also EA Sports FC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a>, and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. Those three currently ranking well due to substantial discounts on the PC marketplace. Marathon is currently retailing for £34.99 / $39.99.</p>

<p>It's a great first showing for the extraction shooter, which has until now had to power through a turbulent development process at Bungie. Only last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-art-lead-departs-bungie-of-his-own-volition-ahead-of-games-new-release-date">its art lead left the company</a>, and prior to that the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-still-lives-as-bungie-announces-new-closed-technical-test-ahead-of-public-update">underwent drastic design changes</a> to the game following a mixed reception to initial public betas.</p><p>It follows on the heels of Arc Raiders, another extraction shooter which took the world by storm last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-robot-bosses-set-to-become-even-scarier-pve-escalate-embark">growing in popularity through the winter holidays</a>. Whether that game has set the stage for wider extraction shooter popularity, allowing Marathon to launch to a comparable level of success, will be made clear as early as March.</p>

            <p>A mod for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> which enabled the game to be playable in VR has been removed following a legal takedown notice by CD Projekt.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, prolific VR modder Luke Ross said the Cyberpunk 2077 and Witcher 3 studio had issued a DMCA notice against him, requesting the removal of his Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod.</p>

<p>However, it wasn't actually the mod itself that the team took issue with. Rather, CD Projekt requested the removal after Ross put his mod behind a Patreon paywall, effectively selling its content. This is at odds with the Cyberpunk 2077 studio's official 'Fan Guidelines' document, which states any content created with its games can not be used for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>"We're happy for you to accept reasonable donations in connection with your fan content, but you're not allowed to make people pay for it or have it behind any sort of paywall (e.g. don't make content only available to paid subscribers)," <a href="https://www.cdprojektred.com/en/fan-content">this document reads</a>.</p><p>Despite this, Ross has admitted he feels "bitter" about being forced to remove his Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod. "In the end it amounted to the same iron-clad corpo logic: every little action that a company takes is in the name of money, but everything that modders do must be absolutely for free," Ross wrote in a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/148437771">very to the point Patreon post</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/luke-ross-cyberpunk-pc-vr-mod-dmca-takedown/">roadtovr</a>).</p>
<p>"As usual they stretch the concept of 'derivative work' until it's paper-thin, as though a system that allows visualising 40+ games in fully immersive 3D VR was somehow built making use of their intellectual property," Ross continued.</p>
<p>"And as usual they give absolutely zero f***s about how playing their game in VR made people happy." According to <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/2013313704004120925?s=20">@SynthPotato</a>, Ross generates $20k monthly from paid mods.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, our Ian took Ross' Cyberpunk 2077 mod out for a spin. You can check out his adventures in the video below. </p>

<p>Despite the legal issues between Ross and CD Projekt, he is not giving up his VR modding endeavours. In his same post, he announced the release of a new VR mode for Larian's acclaimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in CDPR-related news, earlier this month Cyberpunk 2 creative director Igor Sarzynski revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-dont-we-see-male-v-in-post-launch-cyberpunk-2077-marketing-the-cyberpunk-2-creative-director-has-a-very-simple-explanation">why male V disappeared from the game's marketing after Cyberpunk 2077 launched its 2.0 update</a>.</p>
