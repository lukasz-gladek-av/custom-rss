            <p>
Here's a small but notable detail that might have passed you by amid the chaos of information that's spiralled out of last week's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> reveal: the souped-up Switch 2 Edition of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> won't include any of its paid DLC.
</p>
<p>
That perhaps isn't a huge surprise given Nintendo has never claimed otherwise, but it seems the company's Switch 2 Edition sales pitch - which has had an air of 'definitive edition' about it - might have led to some confusion. 
</p>
<p>
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is, to recap, one of six special Switch 2 Editions - basically, enhanced versions of existing Switch games - revealed during last week's Direct, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and Pokémon Legends Z-A also getting similar spruce-ups.

<p>
Each Switch 2 Edition includes frame rate and resolutions bumps, alongside a variety of game-specific features, and is available to purchase as a standalone digital or physical release. And that's in addition to the paid upgrade path Nintendo is offering to anyone who already owns the Switch 1 original. It's just convoluted enough to be a little confusing, and the fact Nintendo is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-edition-ports-of-og-switch-games-cost-65-in-uk">selling its Switch 2 Editions at a premium price</a> compared to the originals has muddied the waters further - but the company has now moved to clarify Breath of the Wild's Switch 2 Edition doesn't come with its previously released paid DLC.
</p>
<p>
"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition does not include The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Expansion Pass DLC," the company <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-nintendo-switch-2-edition-wont-include-the-dlc">wrote in a statement to IGN</a>. "That DLC is available as a separate purchase." As such, anyone looking for the full Breath of the Wild experience on Switch 2 will be needing to set aside just shy of £85 based on Nintendo's own pricing.
</p>
<p>
That sounds like a lot for an eight-year-old game and its DLC, but it's far from the only price point that's raised eyebrows following Switch 2's reveal. The cost of the console itself has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-treehouse-live-viewers-have-very-clear-message-for-nintendo">received plenty of pushback from fans</a> - and that was before the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-tariffs-werent-factored-into-switch-2-price-but-its-something-were-going-to-have-to-address">potential impact of US tariffs</a> - and then there's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">£75 price tag for Mario Kart World</a>, or the news Nintendo is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-charging-for-switch-2s-tutorial-game-because-of-the-amount-of-care-and-work-put-into-it">charging $10 USD for Switch 2's Welcome Tour tutorial game</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-reveals-a-proper-generational-upgrade-though-its-biggest-new-idea-remains-unproven">console looks promising</a> and its two flagship games have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-keeping-quiet-about-donkey-kong-bananzas-developer-but-it-feels-like-a-souped-up-super-mario-odyssey">received plenty of praise</a> after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">some early hands-on time</a> - but it's clear Nintendo has work to do to shake off the lingering controversy around Switch 2.
