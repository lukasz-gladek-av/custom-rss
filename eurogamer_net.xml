            <p>Crush 40 musician and Sonic songwriter Johnny Gioeli is suing Sega of America over ownership of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-sa2-dc">Sonic Adventure 2</a> theme song Live and Learn.</p>
<p>Gioeli has claimed Sega only has rights to the lyrics of the song and not the "master recording and musical composition", the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/806228650/Live-and-Learn-lawsuit-via-Polygon">lawsuit</a> reads (as shared by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/498953/sonic-music-live-and-learn-copyright-lawsuit-crush-40-sega">Polygon</a>), but "unbeknownst" to the songwriter Sega has "exploited and licensed" the song to "at least 25 video games, television shows, live performances/events, and films".</p>
<p>Live and Learn features heavily in the latest film, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>, though Gioeli previously confirmed to <a href="https://aftermath.site/sonic-movie-live-and-learn">Aftermath</a> a deal was signed for its use with Paramount.</p>

<p>In the lawsuit, Gioeli claims he was paid $3000 to write lyrics for an as-yet-untitled song to be included in Sonic Adventure 2. He then "ended up arranging, producing, recording, and performing vocals on Live and Learn, which was produced out of his home studio in California using his own equipment without the supervision, control, or involvement" of Sega.</p>
<p>Further, Sega's assertion it owns full control over the master recording and music composition is "without basis" as there is no agreement in place with Gioeli to transfer rights beyond the lyrics.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Gioeli has "maintained his songwriting registration" for the song for over 20 years. The songwriter holds the <a href="https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/36292721">copyright</a> for Live and Learn, where he's listed as having authorship over the music and lyrics. The date of this registration is 2024.</p><p>Gioeli does admit the "composition is likely jointly owned", the lawsuit reads, and is therefore seeking a Court decision to determine the ownership of the song. The writer is also seeking $500,000 in damages, and a further $500,000 in restitution.</p>
<p>Gioeli has worked with Sega composer Jun Senoue on multiple Sonic soundtracks, together writing and performing under the name Sons of Angels, which was later changed to Crush 40.</p>
<p>While his work on Live and Learn was "expressly limited in scope to lyrics" as per his agreement with Sega, Gioeli received demos of instrumental portions from Senoue and a back and forth ensued with Gioeli's input.</p>
<p>Gioeli "controlled and oversaw the recording process, produced the recording, directed the arrangement and of the song, directed the recording process for other musicians, and recorded and performed the vocals", the lawsuit reads.</p>
<p>Gioeli worked with Sega for over 20 years, from 1998's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-adventure">Sonic Adventure</a> to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-sonic-racing">Team Sonic Racing</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-sonic-at-olympic-games-tokyo-2020">Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>However, the lawsuit states he was made aware by a fan of Crush 40 that Live and Learn was present in other well-known games, including the likes of Sonic Generations, multiple Yakuza games, multiple Super Smash Bros. games, and the recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>.</p><p>"I have no comment other than my desire to maintain the preservation of a long standing beautiful relationship with Sega," Gioeli told Polygon. "I do not want fans to draw conclusions or be disrupted from the beautiful memories we have made collectively with this music. I believe and hope we will come to a peaceful settlement that will be fair and just."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Sega for further comment.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-review">Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film</a> releases this week, capping off Sega's Year of Shadow.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The developer of Catly has updated the game's Steam page with a proper gameplay trailer and screenshots, following allegations its game and trailer have been made with generative AI and blockchain technology.</p>
<p>The trailer (on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2987350/Catly/">Steam</a> but not yet YouTube) shows various cats wandering through surreal natural environments, as well as customisation options for cat types and multiple outfits.</p>
<p>It also shows off the hyper-realistic fur in-game, which developer SuperAuthenti previously confirmed has been made in Unreal Engine 5.</p>

<p>Catly was first revealed at last week's The Game Awards, described as an "open-world adventure" where players build their dream island and care for cats through "dressing up, building, farming, racing, skiing, and much more", according to the Steam page.</p><p>Further gameplay details have been added. An online mode will allow players to collaborate from around the world on their cat creations and complete challenges with island residents. There will be farming sim elements as well as island building, plus templates and tools to design personalised outfits, furniture, houses, and gardens.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/catly-developer-denies-using-generative-ai-or-blockchain-technology-in-its-open-world-cat-game">SuperAuthenti came under fire following the game's reveal</a> due to allegations it used generative AI for its game and trailer, as well as suspected links to blockchain technology.</p>
<p>The studio's co-founder, Kevin Yeung, also co-founded TenthPlanet - a studio reportedly working on two blockchain games. The Steam page also includes a testimonial from known web3 investor and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> producer Thomas Vu.</p>
<p>SuperAuthenti said generative AI had not been used for the game or trailer. "In fact we are very surprised by such speculations," it said in a statement from a PR representative. "We do not think there are any existing AI tools that can produce a video like that. Industry experts have echoed this opinion."</p>
<p>It added Catly is "not a blockchain game" and "there are no <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a>".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo's next console will be called Switch 2, feature magnetic Joy-Con controllers, and could be announced in January.</p>
<p>That's according to a new report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld">The Verge</a>, after speaking with a mystery reddit leaker who claimed to have got their hands on a final version of the Switch 2 console and its dock.</p>
<p>The internet has been inundated with possible leaks of the new console recently, most notably from case manufacturer <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/grip/nintendo-switch-2-cases">Dbrand</a> and a reddit user called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hdvb2d/ive_come_from_the_future/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">NextHandheld</a> who The Verge has since spoken with. "I've now heard and seen enough to think they might be legit," the report reads.</p>

<p>NextHandheld was able to show The Verge two photos of a possible Switch 2 dock and one of the inside of a possible controller rail (with certification logos and copper contacts exposed), which also shows a metal U-shaped kickstand.</p>
<p>The dock featured the same logo as the Nintendo Switch but with a 2 included, seemingly confirming Switch 2 will be the official name. NextHandheld's source claims an announcement to reveal the console will be made in January.</p>
<p>The controller rail image proves a rumour the Joy-Con controllers will attach magnetically to the console, with NextHandheld claiming there's a physical magnetic click when attached. A larger button will then release the controllers.</p>
<p>Further, NextHandheld claims the controllers will have magnetic Hall effect joysticks, which don't contain the deteriorating sensor material of the current Switch model and can be recalibrated easily. Essentially, this could mean the end of Joy-Con drift.</p>
<p>Lastly, NextHandheld claims the Switch 2 will launch in dark grey, with a white version to follow along with a model based on a Nintendo game yet to receive a themed Switch. However, they admit to not being able to turn on the console or play games, so there's plenty we still don't know.</p>
<p>For instance, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">Nintendo has officially confirmed backwards compatibility</a> for the new console, we don't know if this will be via physical cartridges or digital-only.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">Switch 2 accessories were already made available</a> at the start of the month via Chinese sellers, while accessories manufacturer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-accessory-maker-pulls-trailer-showing-blurry-mockup-of-nintendos-next-console-design">Satisfye removed a trailer</a> showing the blurry outlines of the console.</p>
<p>At the least, it's clear we're edging ever closer to a full reveal.</p>

            <p>Sony has increased its shares in FromSoftware owner Kadokawa as the two companies agree to form a "strategic capital and business alliance".</p>
<p>Sony already held shares in the company, but with the increase it now holds approximately 10 percent of the company's shares to become its largest shareholder, though this is not a full acquisition as previously suspected.</p>
<p>The two companies will adapt Kadokawa IP into live-action film and TV dramas globally, co-produce anime works, expand global distribution of Kadokawa's anime works, further expand publishing of Kadokawa's games, and develop human resources.</p>

</div><figcaption>Is Sony buying FromSoftware's parent company the next big games industry acquisition?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvqusIyhV2M" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202412/24-1219E/">press release</a> from Sony reads: Kadokawa and Sony "intend to further strengthen [their] collaboration to maximise both companies' IP value globally and facilitate wider and deeper collaboration", joining forces for content, discovering new creators, and "media mixes of both companies' IP".</p>
<p>Sony has acquired 12,054,100 new shares in Kadokawa for approximately 50bn yen, around £251.7m. Chinese conglomerate <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> holds 6.86 percent of shares compared to Sony's 10 percent.</p>
<p>Kadokawa is a major name in anime publishing, meaning Sony globally will now be a strong force in the industry.</p>
<p>Further expanding Kadokawa's games is the exciting bit for players, though, with the potential for more Bloodborne and Demon's Souls games with Sony, as well as big screen adaptations of FromSoftware's games.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted FromSoftware for further comment.</p>
<p>"We are very pleased to conclude this capital and business alliance agreement with Sony," said Kadokawa CEO Takeshi Natsuno. "This alliance is expected to not only further strengthen our IP creation capabilities, but also increase our IP media mix options with Sony's support for global expansion, allowing us to deliver our IP to more users around the world. We are confident that this will greatly contribute to maximising the value of our IP and increasing our corporate value in the mid- to long-term. We intend to do our utmost to ensure that our collaborative efforts with Sony produce great results in the global market."</p><p>"Through this capital and business alliance, we will become the largest shareholder of Kadokawa, which consistently creates a wide variety of IP, including publications and books, such as light novels and comics, as well as games and anime," said Sony president, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki. "By combining Kadokawa's extensive IP and IP creation ecosystem with the strengths of Sony, which has promoted the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games, we plan to work closely together to realize Kadokawa's 'Global Media Mix' strategy, aimed at maximizing the value of its IP, and Sony's long-term vision, 'Creative Entertainment Vision'."</p>
<p>News of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware">Sony potentially acquiring Kadokawa</a> broke in November, from a report from Reuters. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-acknowledges-takeover-interest-from-sony">Kadokawa followed up to officially acknowledge Sony's takeover interest</a>, which Sony also later confirmed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/employees-at-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-reportedly-thrilled-about-possible-sony-takeover">Employees at FromSoftware were reportedly "thrilled"</a> at the possibility of a Sony takeover, due to disappointment with current management's response to a ransomware cyberattack earlier this year.</p>
<p>In addition to its 14 percent stake in FromSoftware specifically, Sony has ownership of the Bloodborne and Demon's Souls franchises. FromSoftware owns the rights to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> and Sekiro.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, FromSoftware publisher Bandai Namco revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-has-now-sold-286m-copies-outselling-the-dark-souls-series-combined-prior-to-release">Elden Ring has sold 28.6m copies</a>.</p>
<p>At last week's The Game Awards, FromSoftware announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-is-making-more-elden-ring-after-all-with-the-co-op-elden-ring-night-reign">Elden Ring spin-off Nightreign</a>, a co-op roguelite in a parallel world.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
