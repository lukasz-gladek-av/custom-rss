            <p>
EA Sports FC 26's hype machine has officially been switched to its 'on' position, with a first trailer - featuring a smattering of gameplay from this year's iteration - and plenty of promises around "innovations powered by community feedback". That's alongside confirmation of a 26th September launch on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSi0iJYSQ24">trailer itself</a> immediately kicks off with a cheeky wink to fans' demands for gameplay, before showing just that, albeit amid various cinematic bits, and plenty of other onscreen chaos. The big theme this time around, though, is that EA has - so it suggests - really, <em>really</em> listened to fans, with promise of an "overhauled gameplay experience, powered by [community] feedback".
</p>
<p>
The top-level stuff includes "refined gameplay fundamentals", including "improved dribbling responsiveness and fluidity, re-tuned run curves for more explosive player movement, all new reinforcement-learning-driven goalkeeper positioning, close-body volumetric animations, [and] more versatile Playstyles and Player Roles". But EA's <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/The-Club-Is-Yours-With-EA-SPORTS-FC-26-Jude-Bellingham-and-Jamal-Musiala-Revealed-as-Cover-Stars-of-EA-SPORTS-FCS-Most-Community-Driven-Title/default.aspx">announcement</a> goes further, with talk of new Competitive and Authentic gameplay presets - the first (designed for Football Ultimate Team and Clubs) being focused on "consistency and enhanced responsiveness", while the latter promises "the most true-to-football experience ever in Career".

<p>
Elsewhere, Manager Career gets a new Manager Live "hub", promising regularly released new scenarios and "ever-changing variable-length Challenges", and there are new classes - Archetypes - for Clubs and Player Career. "Develop your abilities," EA says, "by upgrading attributes and unlocking Archetype Perks to give your player a distinct feel on the pitch."
</p>
<p>
Finally, for now at least, there's talk of Live Events and Tournament modes, as well as a refreshed Rivals and Champs experience. And all this comes in a game promising 20,000 athletes, 750 clubs &amp; national teams, 120 stadiums, and 35 leagues.
</p>
<p>
EA Sports FC 26 - which this year features Jude Bellingham and Jamal Musiala as its cover stars, and Zlatan IbrahimoviÄ‡ as its Ultimate Edition star - launches for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Switch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, and Amazon Luna on 26th September. There's also a week's early access for Ultimate Edition purchasers, beginning on 19th September. Additionally, EA Play members can get stuck into a 10-hour early access trial on the same day.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a> - which got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc-25-review">three star review</a> from Eurogamer - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-ea-sports-fc-25-and-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-as-it-lowers-financial-forecast">'underperformed' for EA</a>, which might go some way to explaining its frantic grasp for fan approval this time around.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Skate developer Full Circle has shared a fresh look at the upcoming reboot's neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-later-ea-has-finally-announced-a-new-skate">revival of EA's Skate games was first announced back in 2020</a>, and with that early access release due some time this year, the team has been sharing a few snippets of what players can expect via a series of dedicated blog posts known as The Grind.</p>
<p>Volume four of The Grind was released last night, complete with a glance at Skate's neighbourhoods. First up, there is Hedgemont, where players will begin their skating shenanigans. Then, players will be able to venture further afield to Gullcrest Village, Market Mile, and Brickswich.</p>

<p>"One of the sickest spots in Gullcrest Village is the House of Rolling Reverence (the church)," Full Circle says. This "communal place of shredding" includes plenty of pews and stained glass windows.</p>
<p>Market Mile, meanwhile, boasts tall buildings, elevated walkways and San Vansterdam's coast. "Don't let the shiny veneer fool you - there are some hidden (and not-so-hidden) gems here," the Skate team teases. "The skatepark to the left of the neighborhood is ripe for throwdowns, and near the south side, you've got a community park to add to and tear it up."</p>
<p>Last up, there is Brickswich, which comes with a stadium to grind on. "The city is vertical, so get climbing," Full Circle says.</p>
<p>Additionally, the team has said its music for the upcoming reboot will be detailed next month. Let's hope Skate has Hozier on the soundtrack, because EA wants to take us to church.</p>
<p>You can find further information on Skate's neighborhood's <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-grind-vol-four">via The Grind</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the Skate reboot team revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-wont-be-playable-offline-to-offer-a-massively-multiplayer-sandbox-thats-always-online-and-always-evolving">the game won't be playable offline</a>, in order to offer a "massively multiplayer" sandbox that's "always online and always evolving".</p>
<p>On its eventual release, Skate will be coming to PlayStation, Xbox and PC. Furthermore, it will also have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-latest-skate-entry-is-live-service-free-to-play-game">cross-play and cross-progression support</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-skate-has-a-communal-place-of-shredding-full-of-pews-and-stained-glass]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Surgent Studios has revealed the full cast for its forthcoming psychological horror game, Dead Take.</p>
<p>Headlined by Ben Starr and Neil Newbon, the cast will also include Jane Perry (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/returnal">Returnal</a>) and Alanah Pearce (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>). In addition, there will be cameo appearance from the likes of Laura Bailey (The Last of Us Part 2), Matthew Mercer (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>), and Sam Lake (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>).</p>
<p>Alongside the cast list comes a new trailer for the game, which you can watch below. The trailer shows off the game's splicing mechanic, where live-action clips are merged to form new clues to solve the game's mysterious narrative.</p>

<p>The full cast list is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ben Starr</li>
<li>Neil Newbon</li>
<li>Jane Perry</li>
<li>Matt Mercer</li>
<li>Laura Bailey</li>
<li>Sam Lake</li>
<li>Alanah Pearce</li>
<li>Travis Willingham</li>
<li>CDawgVA</li>
</ul>
<p>"Dead Take is about actors. So we needed actors who've lived it," said Abubakar Salim, creative director of Dead Take. "It's a game about the high of ambition and the rot underneath it. The lies we tell ourselves to get in the spotlight, and the monsters we become to stay there. Everyone in this cast has felt that pressure. This was a chance to bleed it out."</p>
<p>Salim previously discussed with Eurogamer how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-newbon-and-ben-starr-lead-surgent-studios-new-live-action-psychological-horror-blurring-film-and-game-boundaries">Dead Take will blur the boundaries between game and film</a>.</p>
<p>"You're going to be watching Ben and Neil do their work on screen as actors," said Salim. "And the reason why is because I didn't want them to hide behind animated characters, or 3D characters. I wanted to show you them. That's essentially something that I really wanted to hammer in as well, while using these guys, is because we're so used to seeing them behind Astarion or Clive. What are they as actors when you see them in the flesh?"</p>
<p>Dead Take is due for release on 31st July on PC (via Steam and Epic).</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/surgent-studios-reveals-full-cast-for-dead-take-including-sam-lake-jane-perry-and-laura-bailey]]></content:encoded>
