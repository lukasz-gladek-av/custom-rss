            <p>Pragmata - Capcom's long in the pipeline astronaut and small girl-starring game - has had its release window narrowed down once again.</p>
<p>Pragmata will arrive on PS5 at some point in 2026, the developer announced during this evening's State of Play. The game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcoms-next-gen-project-pragamata-wont-launch-until-2022">once planned for a 2022 release</a>, having been originally revealed in 2020.</p>
<p>The news was shared with a new trailer, which you can check out below. "A Science Fiction adventure with a unique two-in-one twist of action and strategy," reads the description.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/it-looks-like-switch-2s-finally-fixed-its-predecessors-painfully-sluggish-eshop<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> is finally getting into the public's hands, meaning answers for all sorts of previously unanswered questions are beginning to emerge as the system gets a thorough go-over. And, if you were wondering, it looks like one of the original Switch's most exasperating features - its horribly sluggish eShop experience - has now been resolved with the new console.
</p>
<p>
Switch's eShop was, of course, a notoriously exhausting experience; it was terribly organised, overflowing with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-eshop-game-furry-hentai-tangram-raises-eyebrows-and-questions-over-whats-allowed-on-switch">boobily provocative shovelware</a>, and above all else, <em>slow</em>. Switching between store sections could cause the eShop to hang, while scrolling though the 2,000+ titles perpetually on sale would inevitably prove so traumatic for the system it would squeal and force a full page reload. In fact, the experience was so poor on-machine, it was almost always easier to shop via Nintendo's website version.
</p>
<p>
With Switch 2, however, it looks like significant performance improvements have arrived. We already had some inkling this would be the case, of course; a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-1/">recent interview</a> with Nintendo's Switch 2 development team highlighted a variety of promised eShop upgrades, including assurance it now "runs smoothly". And footage now circulating following today's Switch 2 release in certain timezones suggests that's very much the case.
</p>
<p>
VGC, for instance, has <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/get-your-first-look-at-the-nintendo-switch-2-eshop/">uploaded four and a half minutes of red-hot Switch 2 eShop action</a>. That's 270 seconds of pure, unadulterated storefront browsing, so you might want to steel yourself before clicking 'play'. The main takeaway, though, is that this thing flies on Switch 2, with barely a hiccup or hitch to be seen. Eurogamer editor-in-chief Tom Orry also brought encouraging word based on his own (admittedly fairly unscientific) eShop explorations. "It's almost instant," he declared when asked about loading times.
</p>
<p>
So there you go! Five paragraphs on Switch 2's digital storefront running faster! And if it's more of that you want, you'll be able to smoothly scroll yourself into an erotic frenzy when Nintendo's latest console arrives tomorrow, 5th June. We'll be taking a bit of time before we deliver our final verdict on the machine, but until then, why not check out our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/virtual-boy-switch-2-review">review of Nintendo's <em>other</em> controversial, expensive handheld</a>?

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> is almost upon us (and in some territories, <em>actually</em> upon us), and with its arrival comes Nintendo's much-touted day one update. We already knew it was an important one, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-reportedly-already-out-in-the-wild-but-needs-a-day-one-update-to-function">unlocking a significant amount of the console's basic functionality</a>, but Nintendo's patch notes make it clear you won't be doing much of anything right out of the box on launch day without it.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/au/support/articles/system-update-information-for-nintendo-switch-2/">20.1.1 patch</a> is available to download now (not especially useful in the UK at the moment, of course), and opens up a whole raft of fairly fundamental features you otherwise won't have access to, including the ability to play a substantial number of games.
</p>
<p>
Once installed, your inert electronic Nintendo lump will be positively transformed, now capable of running Switch software, accessing Switch Online features including Game Chat, opening Nintendo's eShop, and more. Notably, the update is also required to use MicroSD Express cards and to run <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-physical-releases-will-just-have-a-download-key-on-the-card">Switch 2 software shipped on game-key cards</a> - which seems to be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-most-switch-2-third-party-physical-releases-dont-have-the-game-on-the-card">vast majority of third-party physical releases</a> right now.
</p>
<p>
You'll be prompted to install the update as part of Switch 2's set-up process, otherwise you'll later see the prompt when trying to access any of the features it's used for. Nintendo hasn't explicitly revealed its download size, but early word suggests it's pretty svelt - you might just be able to fit in a cuppa while you wait, though, if you turn the kettle on quick. Patch notes!
</p>
<p><em><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 Version 20.1.1</h3>
<p>The following features have been added:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of compatible Nintendo Switch software</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch Online</li>
<li>GameChat</li>
<li>GameShare</li>
<li>System transfer from Nintendo Switch</li>
<li>Virtual game cards</li>
<li>Nintendo eShop</li>
<li>News</li>
<li>Upload of screenshots and videos to the server - Nintendo Switch App on a smart device is needed to view and download screenshots and videos uploaded to the server</li>
<li>Link with the smart device apps Nintendo Switch Parental Controls and Nintendo Switch App</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch App on a smart device is needed to view and download screenshots and videos uploaded to the server</li>
<li>Linking to a Nintendo Account is required for network features, with some exceptions.</li>
<li>Updating to version 20.1.1 is required to use Nintendo Switch 2 game-key cards.</li>
<li>Updating to version 20.1.1 is required to use a microSD Express card.</li>
</ul></em></p><p>

Will Switch 2's 20.1.1 update turn Nintendo's latest console into a must-have machine? It'll be a little while before Eurogamer's ready to share our final verdict, but you can at least read our review of Nintendo's <em>other</em> controversial, expensive handheld until then. As for the machine's launch day games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-a-couple-of-hours-mario-kart-worlds-open-world-left-me-slightly-underwhelmed-but-is-there-more-to-it">Mario Kart World left Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell wondering if there might be more to see</a> after some underwhelming first impressions, while Welcome Tour, conversely, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/welcome-tour-is-the-switch-2s-welcome-surprise-and-might-even-be-worth-your-8-quid">proven to be an unexpectedly welcome surprise</a>. Even if it does cost £8.
