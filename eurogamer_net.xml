            <p>Rovio has announced a third <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/angry-birds">Angry Birds</a> film is on the way, due for release on 29th January 2027 to rival new Zelda and Sonic films.</p>
<p>The Angry Birds Movie 3, from Paramount, will see the likes of Jason Sudeikis (Ted Lasso), Josh Gad (Frozen), Rachel Bloom (Crazy Ex-Girlfriend), and Danny McBridge (The Righteous Gemstones) reprise their roles as the coloured birds from the hit mobile game.</p>
<p>The third film will also feature the likes of Keke Palmer (Nope), Lily James (Cinderella), Sam Richardson (Ted Lasso), Nikki Glaser (Golden Globe Awards), and Emma Myers (A Minecraft Movie).</p>

<p>John Rice will once again direct, following his work on the first Angry Birds film, while Thurop Van Orman will continue as screenplay writer from the sequel.</p>
<p>"We're very excited to be partnering with Paramount Pictures and extremely proud of our incredible cast," said John Cohen, producer. "Not only do we have Jason, Josh, Rachel and Danny returning to voice their fantastic characters, but they're surrounded by an all-star ensemble of comedic talent. These are some of the funniest people out there today, and we're so thrilled to have them all on board."</p>
<p>The first two Angry Birds films have grossed over $500m worldwide.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">A Minecraft Movie had the biggest US domestic opening weekend ever for a video game adaptation</a> last week and generated $301m worldwide on its first weekend. There are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">already talks for a sequel</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the third <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-film-franchise-surpasses-1bn-in-global-box-office-revenue">Sonic the Hedgehog film led to the film franchise surpassing $1bn</a> at the global box office.</p>
<p>So far, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-is-the-biggest-video-game-adaptation-ever">biggest video game film adaptation ever remains Nintendo's The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, which earned $500m globally in a single film. But perhaps this will be usurped by Minecraft.</p>
<p>No doubt the success of these films has spurred Paramount into creating a third Angry Birds film.</p>
<p>However, there is stiff competition. Next year will see the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">release of a second Mario film in April</a>, as Nintendo looks to capitalise on its previous success.</p>
<p>Then in 2027, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-movie-gets-a-release-date-but-its-still-a-few-years-away">Sonic the Hedgehog 4</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-movie-release-date-revealed-by-nintendo-and-its-not-as-far-away-as-you-might-have-feared">The Legend of Zelda</a> films will be released in March, following The Angry Birds Movie 3 two months prior.</p>
<p>Which film adaptation are you most excited to watch?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>' previously announced cross-save feature will not be launching on PlayStation 4 and PS5 at the same time as other platforms due to a "legal issue".</p>
<p>Writing on social media, developer Poncle said the team had run into an issue last minute, which "requires us to share info on our partners that we're unable to". As such, the "chances of cross-save coming to PlayStation consoles are now very slim", it said.</p>

<p>But while the chances are slim, they are "not impossible" the Vampire Survivors developer continued, stating it is going to keep working with PlayStation to get the issue sorted.</p>
<p>"We're so sorry to build up any anticipation for this feature on PlayStation only to change plans at the last minute," Poncle wrote, before closing:</p>
<p>"For anyone wanting Cross-Save just to unlock trophies, it's worth noting that PS Trophies are automatically disabled on a platform level for all games when using a save file from another platform."</p>
<p>As for other platforms, cross-save will be coming to Vampire Survivors via PC, Xbox and mobile devices in coming weeks. It will then arrive for those playing on Nintendo Switch at an unspecified later date, as well as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a> if the developer "can do so without breaching any privacy commitments".</p>

<p>At last night's BAFTAs, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">Vampire Survivors was deemed the best Evolving Game</a>, winning out against <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> Online, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>, Sea of Thieves and World of Warcraft. The game previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-wins-best-game-at-bafta-game-awards">scooped itself up the BAFTA for Best Game in 2023</a>, beating out heavy hitters including the likes of Elden Ring and God of War: Ragnarök. It also won the award for Game Design.</p>
<p>Not only that, Vampire Survivors is also getting its own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-animated-tv-series-in-the-works">animated TV series</a>. I wonder what will be necks for this breakout hit that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-review-near-endless-rpg-popcorn">Christian Donlan described as "near-endless RPG popcorn"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>UK actors' union Equity is calling on the games industry to improve conditions for performers.</p>
<p>A protest took place outside last night's BAFTA Games Awards, as Equity members held placards reading "Union contracts in gaming now".</p>
<p>Performers are seeking better pay and terms and conditions for their work in the industry as part of union-negotiated agreements, which is common practice in the US but less so in the UK.</p>
<p>"It is great to see the successes of the video games industry on show at the BAFTA Games Awards, and for the incredible achievements of its workforce to be celebrated across the categories - from performers, to designers, developers and more," said John Barclay, Equity’s assistant general secretary for recorded media.</p>
<p>"But Equity is here to make sure the poor practice frequently reported by Equity members does not continue to be ignored by industry leaders. The video games industry is worth over £7bn in the UK alone and in attendance tonight are bosses from some of the richest companies in the world. Yet these companies continue to ignore Equity's calls to work with us to introduce union-negotiated agreements in the UK that would improve pay, terms and conditions for our members - something that is normal practice in the US."</p>
<p>He continued: "Pay for video game performers in the UK has stagnated despite games companies receiving almost £200m in tax breaks; performers do not have proper protections from artificial intelligence or NDA misuse; and they need safer workplaces so they don’t injure their vocals or bodies, or experience improper recordings of intimate scenes. In an industry that generates enormous wealth, Equity members deserve better."</p>
<p>The protest took place outside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">this year's BAFTA Games Awards</a>, where <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> took home multiple awards.</p>

<p>This action was part of Equity's ongoing Game On! campaign to improve the standards for performers working in the games industry.</p>
<p>It mirrors the SAG-AFTRA strike that continues over in the US, largely against the lack of AI protections for performers.</p>
<p>Last month, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal">US union warned of "alarming loopholes" for "AI abuse"</a> in the latest proposal to end industrial action. Negotiators on behalf of video game companies responded that "meaningful progress" had been made.</p>
<p>Following news of the SAG-AFTRA strike last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-union-equity-stands-in-solidarity-with-sag-aftra-but-wont-authorise-its-own-strike">Equity stated it stands "in solidarity", but would not be authorising a strike</a>.</p>
<p>"Voice and performance capture artists are a vital part of this multibillion-dollar industry, bringing to life characters that make games successful," read a statement from Equity at the time. "We stand shoulder to shoulder with SAG-AFTRA as partners in a global fight to secure fair pay and protect our members' rights, which could not be more urgent as we move forward with artificial intelligence innovation."</p>
<p>However a strike in the UK has not been issued, as "industrial relations legislation in the United Kingdom is very restrictive" and the "employment status of Equity members makes it even more difficult to overcome those hurdles in this context".</p>
<p>At the start of the year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why">Eurogamer spoke with voice actor Jennifer Hale</a> (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta-3">Bayonetta 3</a>) about the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike and why it's taking so long to resolve.</p>
<p>"It's a huge issue for all of us and the repercussions are vast," she said. "So to me, it makes sense that everyone needs to take their time. As performers - and we saw this in the writers strike and the theatrical contract strike - we're just the canary in the coal mine."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Blizzard has shared a roadmap for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, taking us through the rest of this year and teasing a bit of what's to come in 2026.</p>
<p>This roadmap <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-backtracks-on-diablo-4-annual-expansions-next-due-in-2026">reiterates that another hellish expansion is on the way</a>, but it won't be available until next year. Along with that new expansion, 2026 also promises players a new ranking system, leaderboards and a new <em>something</em>. I only say <em>something </em>here, because the rest of the roadmap's text has been engulfed by fire, but I am going to make an educated guess and say it will probably be a new class.</p>
<p>But, before all of that, there is plenty of Diablo 4 chaos slated for 2025.</p>

<p>Coming up next on the roadmap is the April to July season, which is known as Belial's Return. "Belial, Lord of Lies has returned to warp reality to his will. Daring wanderers can clash with Belial and two bosses from Vessel of Hatred as part of the updated Lair Boss system," <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24189529/the-age-of-hatred-persists-diablo-iv-2025-roadmap">reads the season's official blurb</a>.</p>
<p>There's also an "earnable feline pet" on the way in the coming months, as well as a "new IP collab" and some quality of life tweaks to lair bosses.</p>
<p>Then between July and September, Diablo 4 players will be welcoming Sins of the Horadrim, which will return to Nightmare Dungeons. Players can expect new activities here, as well as interactions "that let you progress the dungeon’s intensity as you hunt down the barons of Hell" (sounds chill).</p>
<p>During this time, Blizzard will also be introducing keyboard and mouse support for consoles as a permanent addition to the game, something the developer said has been a much requested feature. Between July and September, there will also be an earnable pet available, although the team did not specify what kind.</p>
<p>Moving into the colder months of September to December, we then have Infernal Chaos, which will bring Infernal Horde Updates. As you may have surmised given that these months come with the header Infernal Chaos, this means things are going to get "more chaotic" for players, as the Diablo 4 team puts "new choices into your hands".</p>
<p>There will also be a new variety of powers to earn here, known as chaos powers. Advanced options between Infernal Waves will also be making a showing during these months as well. Again, Blizzard has teased an earnable pet and a "new IP collab" for between September and December, but again has kept further details under wraps for now.</p>

<p>Diablo 4 will celebrate its second anniversary this June. On its initial release back in 2023, we awarded Diablo 4 four out of five stars. "Like the Blizzard hits of old, Diablo 4 is a designer's game at heart, built on intricacy and depth. A sense of fearful overcompensation holds it back," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-review-richness-luxury-and-compromise">Eurogamer's original Diablo 4 review</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, we have also been treated to a major expansion known as Vessel of Hatred. This expansion also earned itself four Eurogamer stars.</p>
<p>"A polished, bewitching upgrade that sinks its claws into you - featuring perhaps the best character class in Diablo's history," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review">Eurogamer's Vessel of Hatred review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A sequel to the newly-released A Minecraft Movie is already being discussed.</p>
<p>This should perhaps come as no surprise given the film's record breaking opening - the Jack Black and Jason Momoa-fronted A Minecraft Movie debuted just last week, generating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">$301m worldwide on its first weekend</a>.</p>
<p>Now just a few short days later, A Minecraft Movie's director Jared Hess has revealed there are already talks of a sequel, with the filmmaker teasing where things could go next (<strong>please be aware of spoilers for A Minecraft Movie below</strong>).</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/minecraft-movie-sequel-plans-director-jared-hess-jack-black-jason-momoa-1236362421/">Deadline</a>, Hess - who was also at the helm of 2004's Napoleon Dynamite - expressed his excitement about potentially being part of another Minecraft film. "It would be so much fun. We had so much fun making this movie," Hess said before adding:</p>
<p>"It's such an expansive world in the game, and there were so many things that we didn't tap into that we wanted to. I would have a blast doing the sequel, and it seems like there's already talk about it happening, so I'm super excited. It'll be so much fun to go back into the world. The fans are just having such a good time.</p>
<p>"We  teased it in the end credits, and the fans seem to be going wild for it."</p>
<p>So, what exactly did Hess and the rest of the A Minecraft Movie crew tease that made fans go so wild? The arrival of Alex, of course! Alex is one of the nine default player skins in Minecraft, and is often shown alongside Steve (played in the film by Black) in promotional artwork and such.</p>
<p>In A Minecraft Movie's post credits scene, we don't see Alex's face. However, Alex introduces herself to Black's Steve after he decides to pop back to the real world at the end of the film. She now lives in the house Steve once did, you see, and she invites him in.</p>
<p>Alex is "the other massively critical character in Minecraft," Hess said, "so that's the one that we will be bringing to the table without a doubt."</p>
