            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> publisher Bandai Namco has released some player statistics from the game's network test last month, and it seems players were struggling to finish it.</p>
<p>The online co-op game takes place over three in-game days, defeating bosses each night to progress the next. However, the final boss of the cycle - Nightlord Gladius, Beast of Night - was only defeated 58,615 times.</p>
<p>The publisher hasn't released total player numbers, but looking at the <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-infographic">remaining stats</a> we can get an idea of how popular the test was.</p>

<p>For instance, a total of 23,627,489 attacks were used to save downed players. Considering it takes around three hits to revive a player in this way (sometimes more), that's about 7.9m revives.</p>
<p>Further, the mini bosses strewn across the world were defeated from between 99,000 times to 195,000 times, depending on how often they appeared over the day cycle.</p>
<p>Lastly, 37,957,453,867 runes were lost during the test, when not retrieved after death. That's a lot of death - and a lot of heartache.</p>
<p>In all, it seems players were struggling to get to grips with Nightreign. The shift to online co-op and a faster pace may have proven a challenge for players, whether through poor explanation from FromSoftware or just not enough time to master the game during the test.</p>
<p>And that's when players even managed to get on - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-first-network-test-suffers-server-issues-due-to-congestion">first of several tests over that weekend was a disaster</a>, with players completely unable to log into a match. This was resolved for the remainder of the weekend.</p>
<p>Of course, FromSoftware's games are known for being difficult. In particular, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> caused much debate with its difficulty level. Just give it time and somebody will be finishing Nightreign with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-beaten-with-an-actual-banana">banana controller</a>.</p>
<p>Personally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">I had a great time playing Nightreign</a> and enjoyed its new style of challenge, as well as working with others - though I had a decent chunk of time with it during the preview.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-announced-by-fromsoftware">Elden Ring: Nightreign is set for release on 30th May 2025</a> across PS4, PS5, Xbox consoles, and PC (Steam).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Toby Fox's cult RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/undertale">Undertale</a> is getting a one-night-only live orchestral concert event to celebrate the game's 10th anniversary.</p>
<p>The Determination Symphony, as it is known, will take place at London's Eventim Apollo on 22nd June, and act as a celebration of all things Undertale.</p>
<p>Undertale originally made its way into our hearts and minds back in 2015. It tells the story of a child who tumbles into the Underground, a strange world beneath the Earth's surface.</p>

<p>During the concert, patrons will also be able to "fall into the Underground" (although, I assume metaphorically and emotionally here, rather than literally) all while being accompanied by a live orchestra, which will be performing arrangements of the game's soundtrack alongside on-screen gameplay.</p>

<p>For those interested, tickets to The Determination Symphony will be available on Friday 28th March, and can be purchased at <a href="http://www.eventimapollo.com/">www.eventimapollo.com</a>. </p>
<p>I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-music-played-at-the-popes-latest-audience">wonder if The Pope will show up</a>?</p>
<p>As for the game, here is what Eurogamer's former editor in chief Martin Robinson said when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-review">he reviewed the PlayStation Vita version of Undertale</a> back in 2017:</p>
<p>"Undertale dances happily in the footsteps of Shigesato Itoi's Mother series, and like those games before it, it's a JRPG that's endlessly playful and inventive."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
