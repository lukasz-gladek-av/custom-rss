            <p>A Skibidi Toilet bundle is now available in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, if you're keen to flush away your V-Bucks.</p>
<p>The bundle, priced at 2,900 V-Bucks but currently discounted to 2,200, includes Skibidi Toilet back bling, a Plungerman outfit, and his plunger as a pickaxe.</p>
<p>News of the bundle leaked earlier this week, with the <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1869050071574024652">official Fortnite account then teasing its inclusion</a> with some easily deciphered emojis. Now it's officially available in the item shop.</p>

<p>For the unaware, Skibidi Toilet is an animated web series created by Alexey Gerasimov on his YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DaFuqBoom">DaFuq!?Boom!</a>. The series is known for its absurd humour and its creation in Garry's Mod using assets from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> and Counter-Strike.</p>
<p>The series has since become a popular meme, which Epic is now leaning into with this addition to Fortnite. I guess anything goes these days.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has quietly released a new game based on its Captain Laserhawk animated series, which features beloved mascot Rayman and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a>.</p>
<p>Captain Laserhawk: The G.A.M.E., as spotted by Game File's Stephen Totilo (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/500114/ubisoft-nft-game-captain-laserhawk-game-file">Polygon</a>), is a PC top-down multiplayer shooter that uses cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Though it's technically in early access, Totilo described it as "the most basic top-down shooter imaginable".</p>
<p>Players require an NFT Niji Warrior ID card to play, which itself requires a crypto wallet to purchase (the NFT costs $25.63).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-wild-far-cry-blood-dragon-anime-captain-laserhawk-welcomes-rayman-in-new-trailer">Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix</a> was created by Ubisoft for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> and released last year. It's based on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-3-review">Far Cry 3</a> spin-off Blood Dragon and features multiple characters from across Ubisoft's games, including Rayman.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://edenonline.ubisoft.com/faq">FAQ</a> for this game based on the series, it's a "transmedia gaming adventure where the community drives the narrative through innovative governance".</p>
<p>It continues: "Eden Online is the layer which gives power to the community when it comes to decision making for the game updates each season.</p>
<p>"Eligibility to play the game in early access will be reflected by ownership of a Citizen ID Card. Eden Online has a limited capacity of 10,000 seats for citizenship."</p>
<p>Once an ID has been purchased, which Totilo stated is a convoluted process, it's customised with a cartoon headshot and further details to make it unique. Then, as a <a href="https://medium.com/@UBISOFT-CAPTAIN-LASERHAWK/the-niji-warrior-id-your-gateway-to-elite-gaming-privileges-in-captain-laserhawk-6fff29b24f23">Medium post</a> on the game reads, your "Niji Warrior NFT is dynamic", meaning it "evolves by capturing your in-game accomplishments, growing in uniqueness and value, and showcasing your dedication and skill".</p>
<p>You can then sell your ID as an NFT, though it's unclear why anyone would wish to.</p>
<p>Rayman, meanwhile, features as the announcer of the game's deathmatches.</p>
<p>Back in 2021, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-quartz-is-an-energy-efficient-nft-platform-for-aaa-games">Ubisoft announced Quartz</a>, its "energy-efficient" NFT platform for AAA games, though it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-appears-to-have-sold-a-grand-total-of-15-nfts">didn't appear to be a success</a>.</p>
<p>Despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-to-continue-with-nft-platform-quartz-despite-criticism">criticism</a>, Ubisoft has ploughed on. Back in October this year it quietly released its first-ever blockchain game,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-first-ever-blockchain-game-with-nfts-costing-up-to-50k"> tactical NFT battler Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles</a> where players purchase NFT figurines to battle using cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Now it's added Captain Laserhawk: The G.A.M.E. to its growing NFT portfolio.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A sequel to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> is being considered "positively" but studio Tango Gameworks is "considering various opportunities" before fully committing.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-director-i-want-to-cherish-this-ip">IGN</a>, studio head Colin Mack, Hi-Fi Rush director John Johanas, and Hi-Fi Rush project manager Kazuaki Egashira discussed the future of the franchise.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Microsoft closed Tango Gameworks</a> it was acquired by Krafton. At the time of the acquisition a sequel to rhythm action game Hi-Fi Rush had begun, but Mack has now clarified the studio is considering its options.</p>

<p>"We are considering a sequel positively," said Mack. "We are not yet at the stage where we can say specifically, 'This is what we're going to do'."</p>
<p>"Many of our staff have a lot of love for [Hi-Fi Rush], so we feel like we have options," added Johanas. "We're currently at the stage of considering various opportunities."</p>
<p>Johanas stated many members of the development team have a "strong attachment" to Hi-Fi Rush, adding: "Not only the game but also the characters and the world are beloved by us, so I want to cherish this IP."</p>
<p>However he believes it's "important to try new things", which is seemingly a philosophy that itself led to the development of Hi-Fi Rush - a clear change in tone for the studio following <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-evil-within">The Evil Within</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, Egashira said creating new experiences is "in the DNA of Tango Gameworks".</p>
<p>"Hi-Fi Rush became popular as a new IP, but if Hi-Fi Rush were to stay the same forever, it would eventually become outdated," he said. "I think Tango Gameworks is about taking on new challenges. I hope to continue to work in a way that puts developers at the centre, without losing our passion."</p>
<p>As previously reported, Krafton head of corporate development Maria Park stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-2-already-in-development-six-months-when-krafton-acquired-tango-gameworks">a build for a Hi-Fi Rush sequel was about six months old</a> ahead of the studio acquisition.</p>
<p>"[Tango] want to make sure [it] surpasses the expectations of the existing fans," said Park. "For instance, some of the feedback about Hi-Fi Rush was that some people felt it was [just] going through factories, so now they want to give a more open world type of experience. I don't think it's going to be completely open world, but a more dynamic environment [that] you play in. Also, having more advanced technology applied to the rhythm action so that it feels more synchronised."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A fourth Sonic the Hedgehog film is on the way, with a spring 2027 release date.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-release-date-2027-1236254778/">Variety</a>, Paramount is currently preparing for a new film as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> releases in cinemas this weekend.</p>
<p>Fans have already been speculating which new characters will be introduced in the post-credits of the third film, who will undoubtedly be the focus of the inevitable fourth film.</p>

<p>The first two Sonic the Hedgehog films have earned a combined global box office total of $725.2m, with the third film expected to top the box office this Christmas season.</p>
<p>Plot details for Sonic the Hedgehog 4 are obviously being kept under wraps for the moment, so it's unclear who from the cast will return.</p>
<p>Jeff Fowler has directed all three Sonic films, with Ben Schwartz as the voice of the titular blue blur and Jim Carrey as antagonist Dr. Robotnik.</p>
<p>The third film introduces Shadow the Hedgehog from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-sa2-dc">Sonic Adventure 2</a> game, voiced here by Keanu Reeves.</p>
<p>"Sega and Paramount more closely align game and film worlds for an authentic Sonic romp with added Keanu cool," I wrote in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-review">Eurogamer Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film review</a>.</p>
<p>"Sonic 3 is a resounding success and fitting finale to the Year of Shadow. It's quippy and self-aware, balancing broad pop culture appeal with authenticity to its source material, while its flashy action thrills alongside an unbridled sense of cool that's only enhanced by Reeves as Shadow."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
