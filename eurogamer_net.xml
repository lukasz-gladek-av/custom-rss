            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> aims to run "smoothly" at 60fps across both Xbox Series X and its lesser-powered sibling, the Series S.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/indiana-jones-great-circle-runs-at-60-fps-on-xbox-series-x-s-interview">Windows Central</a>, creative director Axel Torvenius touched on the game's technical performance.</p>
<p>"It might be that we will release even more details in terms of specifics, technical details, as we get closer to launch, once we see all the telemetry on performance," the developer began. "But what I can tell you is that the ambition is that the game runs at 60fps on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, and that, you know, it shouldn't be compromised in the visuals or the experience of the product."</p>

<p>Torvenius said the Indiana Jones and the Great Circle team want the experience to feel "cohesive" for players, meaning the game should run "smoothly at 60" across both Xbox Series X and Series S.</p>
<p>The Series S console has tripped up developers in the past. Earlier this year, the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> admitted that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-on-xbox-series-s-will-be-a-challenge-developer-says">getting the game ready for Microsoft's lower-powered Xbox Series S would be a "challenge"</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-out-now-on-xbox">Baldur's Gate 3 famously released several months later on Xbox</a> due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-dev-says-xbox-version-still-coming-but-compromises-may-have-to-be-made">difficulties with split screen co-op</a> on the Series S console.</p><p>Things are looking up for Series S owners, however. Recently, the Stalker 2 team said it hopes to <a href="https://www.vg247.com/stalker-2-xbox-series-s-pc">provide a performance mode at 60fps</a> at some point for its upcoming release on the Series S console. While it hasn't promised anything at this time, developer GSC said: "We think it's possible."</p>

<p>For more on Indy, our Ian recently went hands on with the Great Circle.</p>
<p>"I think it's going to be something truly special and I can't wait to play more of it. It's shaping up to be a wonderful love letter to Indiana Jones, just like Rogue City was to Robocop, and anyone who counts themselves a fan of the movie trilogy (there's definitely only been three movies, don't know what you're talking about) should definitely have this on their radar," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-played-3-hours-of-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-and-it-nails-the-films-whip-cracking-sense-of-adventure">Eurogamer's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle preview</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A second crack at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> isn't something EA is looking into at the current time.</p>
<p>EA's CEO Andrew Wilson chatted to investors last night, during the company's quarterly earnings call. Here, Wilson was asked about the company's live-service efforts, and the next season of Respawn's shooter, Apex Legends.</p>
<p>The EA exec said the "level of innovation and creativity has to continue to scale with the community over time" in order to "maintain growth, and not just maintain size". He noted Apex is in "an incredibly good position" within the live-service market, with a "strong brand, a really strong mechanic, and a very committed global community".</p>

<p>EA understands a "need for meaningful systematic innovation that fundamentally changes the way the game plays", the exec continued, stating the development team is actively working on realising this. When further asked if EA and Respawn would consider an "Apex 2.0" or "a whole studs-up rebuild", Wilson said current trends show a second go at something typically doesn't perform as well as the original.</p><p>Said Wilson: "Typically, what we have seen in the context of live service-driven games at scale is, the 'version two' thing has almost never been as successful as the 'version one' thing. And so actually the objective right now is to ensure that we are continuing to support the global player base that we have, and deliver them new, innovative, creative content on a season-by-season basis, as well as build these other things, but build them in a way that players do not have to give up the progress that they've made or the investment that they've put into the existing ecosystem.</p>
<p>"Anytime we cause a global player community to have to choose between the investments they've made to date and future innovation and creativity, that's never a good place to put our community in."</p>
<p>Wilson said EA and Repsawn's objective is to "continue to innovate in the core experience [as shown in Apex Legend's seasons], and then build additional opportunities for engagement in different modalities of play beyond what the current core mechanic delivers". The exec said the team believed it "can do those two things together", and it doesn't "have to separate the experience in order to do so".</p>
<p>Wilson's comments bring to mind Blizzard's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> series. Despite huge popularity for the original, the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-the-moment-overwatch-1-died-forever">pulled Overwatch as it was out of service</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/so-far-overwatch-2-is-a-clever-but-underwhelming-free-to-play-compromise">replaced it with the free-to-play Overwatch 2</a>.</p>
<p>On its release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-apologises-still-working-on-overwatch-2-launch-woes">Overwatch 2 users were left unable to play for long periods</a>, stuck in queues, left without access to previously-unlocked characters and items, or locked out of the game entirely by the requirement to log-in using their mobile phones.</p><p>This year, things remain lukewarm for the rejigged shooter, and in February <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> announced plans to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-is-revitalising-the-overwatch-2-experience">make "major changes" to Overwatch 2</a> as part of a "revitalisation" of the shooter that hoped to "make PvP gameplay more rewarding and fun", as well as "provide greater transparency for players in-game". In May, the developer announced plans to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-pve-mode-dropped-after-just-three-months">remove the Hero Mastery Gauntles PvE mode from the game three months after it launched</a> as it hadn't "resonated with players".</p>

<p>The company also announced its life-sim game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-gained-15m-new-players-in-the-past-year-despite-being-over-a-decade-old">The Sims 4 has managed to gain over 15m new players this year alone</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ubisoft has released its first-ever blockchain game, the tactical <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFT</a> battler Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-first-ever-blockchain-game">company announced the game last June</a> after years of dabbling in blockchain, but has only now quietly launched it.</p>
<p>The game is on PC and free to start, though players can purchase figurines with which to battle using either in-game gold or cryptocurrency. These figurines are NFTs and can be bought on the <a href="https://championstactics.ubisoft.com/marketplace?sort=price_desc">game's marketplace</a> from anywhere between $7 to $64,000 (almost £50k).</p>

<p>It appears to be possible to play the game without purchasing figurines, though those willing to pay the extortionate prices will surely have more success in battles.</p>
<p>Battles themselves are turn-based affairs against other players with squads of three figurines.</p>
<p>Francois Bodson, studio director at Ubisoft Paris, told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-just-quietly-launched-a-full-blown-nft-game">IGN</a> the game "offers deep strategic gameplay featuring unique in-game assets and several exciting innovations", comparing it to a physical trading card game.</p>
<p>Here's the statement in full: "The team inside the Ubisoft Paris studio developing Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles partnered with Ubisoft’s Strategic Innovation Lab and Oasys to ensure that our use of blockchain was done in service of delivering new and innovative gaming experiences for our players. Our shared goal is to explore new ways to play alongside bringing more value to players based on empowerment and ownership. Champions Tactics offers deep strategic gameplay featuring unique in-game assets and several exciting innovations. These include millions of procedurally generated figurines, each with distinct stats, assets shaped directly by players' choices, and an open marketplace letting players compose their teams on a peer-to-peer basis - much like a physical trading card game. For months, we have collaborated closely with our community through events and beta phases to build and refine Champions Tactics. We’re excited to keep expanding and enhancing the experience together."</p>
<p>Ubisoft did not comment on the game's Adults Only rating, presumably for its blockchain basis and use of cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Back in December 2021, Ubisoft launched its own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-quartz-is-an-energy-efficient-nft-platform-for-aaa-games">NFT platform called Quartz</a>, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-ghost-recon">Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon</a> Breakpoint as the first game to offer a beta trial. It did not fare well, appearing to have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-appears-to-have-sold-a-grand-total-of-15-nfts">initially only sold 15 NFTs</a>.</p>
<p>Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-nft-bosses-say-players-just-dont-get-it">Ubisoft's NFT bosses stated in an interview afterwards</a> that players just "don't get it".</p>
<p>It's interesting, therefore, for Ubisoft to have still released this project, considering other developers have slowly backpedalled on their enthusiasm for cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>That includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-seemingly-backtracks-from-earlier-nft-enthusiasm">EA boss Andrew Wilson</a>, after describing NFTs as "an important part of… the future of our industry".</p>
<p>"I believe that collectability will continue to be an important part of our industry and the games and experiences that we offer our players," he later said during an earnings call in February 2022.</p>
<p>"Whether that's part of the NFT and the blockchain? Well, that remains to be seen. And I think the way we think about it, is we want to deliver the best possible player experience we can. And so we're going to - we will evaluate that over time. But right now, it's not something that we're driving audience."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo subsidiary Mario Club Co., Ltd. isn't laying off employees.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a report from Japanese outlet <a href="https://leakpress.net/2024/10/74/">Leakpress</a> claimed Mario Club Co., Ltd. was letting go of approximately 150 of its 400 employees. It was said the layoffs were happening across various groups within the company.</p>

<p>However, in the time since this initial report, Nintendo has debunked these claims. In a statement provided to Eurogamer, a Nintendo spokesperson said:</p>
<p>"We have confirmed with Mario Club Co., Ltd. that the rumoured information in the report is untrue."</p>
<p>Mario Club Co., Ltd. is a game-testing and debugging team for many of Nintendo's games. Its credits include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/luigis-mansion-2-hd">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/princess-peach-showtime">Princess Peach: Showtime!</a> and Super Mario Bros.

<p>The initial report claiming layoffs at Mario Club Co., Ltd. said the condition was a little different from so-called 'eviction rooms', which is something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namco-reportedly-cuts-japanese-workforce-but-denies-pressuring-voluntary-leave">Bandai Namco was recently accused of</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, it was reported Bandai Namco staff were not being laid off directly, but were rather being sent to rooms with nothing to do. Essentially, the company was said to be putting pressure on staff to resign voluntarily, to avoid having to formally lay them off.</p><p>Elsewhere in Nintendo news, yesterday the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beloved-wii-u-exclusive-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-coming-to-nintendo-switch">company announced Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a>, a souped up version of the acclaimed 2015 sci-fi action-RPG released on Wii U, which will bring enhanced visuals and more on its Nintendo Switch release next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Following the news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">Sony has closed Concord studio Firewalk</a>, the live-service game's initial development deal reportedly cost $200m.</p>
<p>This, however, was not enough to cover the game's entire development costs, sources familiar with the agreement told <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290">Kotaku</a>. This cost also did not include the purchase of the Concord IP rights or Firewalk itself, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-acquires-firewalk-studios-as-it-continues-work-on-triple-a-multiplayer-exclusive">Sony acquired last year</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday's news detailed the human cost of closing the studio, which employed around 150-170 people. The $200m figure adds a sense of the financial cost of even beginning development.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-reportedly-cost-300m-to-make-amid-a-culture-of-toxic-positivity">report from September</a>, after the game was shut down, suggested the game had cost $400m to produce, with development rife with "toxic positivity".</p>
<p>A final statement from Firewalk shared last night on social media details what the studio achieved during its time on Concord.</p>
<p>"Firewalk began with the idea of bringing the joy of multiplayer to a larger audience," reads the statement.</p>
<p>The assembled team then grew a new startup, the statement continues, built a "customised next-generation FPS engine", managed an acquisition from Sony, and ultimately delivered "a great FPS experience to players - even if it landed much more narrowly than hoped against a heavily consolidated market".</p>

<p>"We took some risks along the way - marrying aspects of card battlers and fighting games with first-person-shooters - and although some of these and other aspects of the IP didn’t land as we hoped, the idea of putting new things into the world is critical to pushing the medium forward," the statement continues.</p><p>"The talent at Firewalk and the level of individual craft is truly world-class, and teams within Sony Interactive Entertainment and across the industry will be fortunate to work with them.  Please reach out to Recruiting at PlayStation for inquiries, and thank you to all the very many teams, partners and fans who supported us along the way."</p>
<p>Despite this hard work, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-has-sold-just-25000-copies-estimate-industry-analysts">Concord reportedly sold only 25,000 copies</a> - clearly not enough to recoup its huge costs. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">pulled offline at the start of September</a>.</p>
<p>"The PvP first-person shooter genre is a competitive space that's continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title," wrote SIE boss Hermen Hulst in an internal email shared yesterday. "We will take the lessons learned from Concord and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>EA's CEO Andrew Wilson said <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> is a "return to what made BioWare great".</p>
<p>During a Q&amp;A with investors in EA's quarterly earnings call, Wilson reflected on BioWare's recent history, which included looking back at beleaguered multiplayer shooter, Anthem.</p>
<p>The EA exec said this game was "probably the one people remember the most for not really living up to the expectations of what a 'BioWare game' should be". He noted the studio was trying to "do something very very different" to what had gone before, adding the "pieces of the puzzle" ultimately didn't come together as BioWare had hoped.</p>

</figure>
<p>Following Anthem, a "big shift" subsequently happened at the developer, which Wilson said saw the studio "really returning to BioWare-type games" and "returning to BioWare's strengths". And, that brings us to Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which is set to release across PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC on 31st October.</p><p>"The BioWare team has really rallied around what made BioWare a fan-favourite studio and a fan-favourite brand and the types of games they make; incredibly rich worlds, incredibly nuanced characters, really powerful and compelling stories with camaraderie and friendships and relationships, and decisions that matter in the context of gameplay," Wilson said.</p>
<p>"And I think it’s been that return to what made BioWare great and giving the studio the time to deliver against what makes BioWare great in the context of the Dragon Age world is what amounts to a game like Dragon Age: The Veilguard."</p>

<p>We recently awarded Dragon Age: The Veilguard five out of five stars.</p>
<p>"It is the strongest and loudest answer BioWare could have mustered for the people still doubting whether it could do it. The answer is yes, emphatically. The Veilguard is spectacular. BioWare is back," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Pokémon TCG Pocket, the digital trading card game, is now available on mobile.</p>
<p>It's free-to-start and allows players to split open booster packs to acquire digital versions of popular Pokémon trading cards - and then compete in battles.</p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-heading-to-mobile-this-year">first announced at the Pokémon Presents event in February</a> and is now finally available to download across iOS and Android devices.</p>

<p>One of the biggest draws are the "immersive cards" that allow players to dive into the artwork to explore the worlds within.</p>
<p>However, while free-to-start, there are microtransactions and multiple currencies in the store to acquire time boosters and other items, allowing players to open more packs.</p>
<p>Poké Gold costs 79p for five pieces, or up to £79.99 for 500 pieces. This can be used to buy bundles of items, costing from 45 pieces to 115 pieces.</p>
<p>That said, there are various freebies each day so, if you're willing to wait, you'll still have access to a decent chunk of the experience without paying - so far at least.</p>
<p>At launch, cards are from the Genetic Apex collection, which includes plenty of fan favourite Pokémon originating from the Kanto region.</p>
<p>Back in September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-focus-is-on-pack-opening-but-theres-a-promising-version-of-the-card-game-underneath">Eurogamer's Lottie Lynn went hands-on with the experience</a> stating while the focus is on opening card packs "there's a promising version of the card game underneath".</p>
<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket is expected to be a success, though it remains to be seen if it can reach the same levels as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>.</p>
<p>That game just launched its Gigantamax feature to a mixed response, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-gigantamax-battles-will-be-made-easier-in-response-to-mixed-feedback">Niantic acknowledging feedback to make the battles easier</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
