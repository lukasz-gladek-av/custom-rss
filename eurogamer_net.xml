            <p>
As more characters join the Sonic the Hedgehog movie series, fans have been curious when their favourite big cat - Big the Cat - will pop up.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-film-writers-reveal-the-big-the-cat-cameo-that-almost-was">IGN</a> alongside the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>, the movie series' writing duo Pat Casey and Josh Miller revealed a Big the Cat cameo had actually been written for the previous film - only to be left on the cutting room floor.
</p>
<p>
(There's no spoilers here for the new movie, we should add.)
</p>
<p>
In <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-the-hedgehog-2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>, Big the Cat would have popped up in skeletal form as Sonic passed through a cave. Within it, viewers would have gotten a quick glimpse at Big's decomposed body. Dark. 
</p>
<p>
Still, confusingly, this might not have been the Big the Cat fans know and love, the duo continued - which perhaps is why the sequence never made it on screen.
</p>
<p>
"In one draft of Sonic 2, when they're going through the snowy mountains to the cave, we had a bit, because Sonic 2 was sort of an Indiana Jones," Casey said. 
</p>
<p>
"Indiana Jones, it's a trope that at some point a skeleton pops out at you and scares you. So we were going to do that, but with a skeleton of a, I would say, a Big the Cat, not necessarily-"
</p>
<p>
"Not necessarily the Big the Cat," Miller interjected.
</p>
<p>
"But we ended up cutting it," Casey concluded. "It didn't make any sense."
</p>
<p>
So, no Big the Cat. But on the upside, for fans of the character, no dead Big the Cat either. 
</p>
<p>
Fans have previously celebrated whenever Big has popped up over the years - in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-frontiers-three-minute-explainer-video-is-probably-how-sega-should-have-started">Sonic Frontiers</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/big-the-cat-is-in-team-sonic-racing">Sonic Racing</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-sonic-prime-animated-series-gets-december-release-date">Sonic Prime</a> and even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/knuckles-shadow-and-big-the-cat-shown-in-sonics-lego-dimensions-level">Lego Dimensions</a>.

"Sega and Paramount more closely align game and film worlds for an authentic Sonic romp with added Keanu cool," Ed wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-review">Eurogamer's Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film review</a>.
