            <p>Happy late early December everyone! That can only mean one thing: we've opened voting for Eurogamer readers' top 50 games of the year, and a little earlier than last year, too. I'd love there to be a smart reason for this, but it's really because we simply won't have time to collate all the votes and comments and turn them into an article if we leave it any later.</p>
<p>In terms of actual games released, 2025 has been pretty good, I think. There's a nice and varied mix of games making up my personal top 10, so hopefully you'll have plenty to pick from.</p>
<p>As is the usual way, we're asking you for your ranked top five games of the year, with the option to also tell us why each of them had the special sauce. The rules are thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>DLC/expansions are <strong>not</strong> eligible, unless they are playable as 'standalone'</li>
<li>Ongoing games not released in 2025 are also <strong>not</strong> eligible</li>
<li>Ports of games not released in 2025 are also <strong>not</strong> eligible - but we're allowing Switch 2 versions if what's in the new version has been significantly altered/added to.</li>
<li>Games still in Early Access are <strong>not</strong> eligible</li>
<li>Remakes and significant remasters <strong>are</strong> eligible.</li>
<li>Games released from Early Access into '1.0' in 2025 <strong>are</strong> eligible.</li>
</ul>
<p>I attempted to provide you with every game released in 2025 via a dropdown box, but this failed for multiple reasons so we're going the old-fashioned way of typing the names into boxes.</p>
<p>If you are happy to provide your Eurogamer username, your words could form part of our final article. This is set to be published on December 30, a day before Eurogamer's own Game of the Year is revealed. I wonder which is going to have the most embarrassing top 10?</p>
<p>If you could get your votes and comments in by the end of Sunday, 14th December, I (and whoever else is tasked with turning an Excel sheet into a readable article) will be very grateful.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScn6Hvv-9yq_M1Mgcsv5eByRd0qRcelSkQZ6IZG5yqSN6bP3A/viewform?usp=publish-editor">the form</a> for your choices, so get voting now (unless you're waiting to play through <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and need a few more days with it).</p>
<p>Thanks, as always, for reading - and for sticking with us through 2025 even though we (I) said the Switch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> ports were reasonably priced.</p>

            <p>
Sega has broached the subject of AI following it latest earnings report, confirming its plans to leverage the technology in development as part of "efficiency improvements". However, it also says it intends to proceed "carefully" in order to identify "appropriate" uses.
</p>
<p>
The company shared its perspective during a Q&amp;A session coinciding with its Q2 earnings report, responding to a question inquiring if it would pursue larger projects or efficiency. "Rather than fully following the trend toward the large-scale development," its executives explained in an <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20251203_q2_major_QA_e.pdf">official translation</a>, "we will also pursue efficiency improvements, such as leveraging AI."
</p>
<p>
It also acknowledged the "strong resistance" AI adoption can face in "creative areas such as character creation", adding it intends to "proceed by carefully assessing appropriate use cases". It suggested one such area might include "streamlining the development processes" but did not elaborate further.
</p>
<p>
Sega is, of course, far from the only publisher to weigh in on AI in recent times, with some companies being less cautious than others. EA CEO Andrew Wilson, for instance, has boasted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-is-the-very-core-of-our-business-says-ea-ceo">AI is "the very core of our business"</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss Strauss Zelnick has taken a more measured approach, calling artificial intelligence an "oxymoron" and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-couldnt-be-made-by-ai-suggests-take-two-boss-there-is-no-creativity-that-can-exist-by-definition-in-any-ai-model">saying</a> "no creativity... can exist by definition in any AI model." Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/execs-pushing-ai-not-humane-creative-rockstar-co-founder-mad-cow-disease">compared the technology to "mad cow disease"</a>, describing the execs pushing it as "not the most humane or creative people".
</p><p>
Even so, a recent Tokyo Games Show survey reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI</a> in development. One of those studios - Let it Die: Inferno developer Supertrick Games - this week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-it-die-inferno-developer-responds-to-generative-ai-controversy">faced the issue head on</a> after receiving significant criticism for its extensive use of generative AI.
