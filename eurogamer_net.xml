            <p>
Amid reports of potential layoffs at BioWare, studio general manager Gary McKay has confirmed "many" employees have now been moved elsewhere in EA following the completion of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> - and that a remaining core team, which includes a number of now-confirmed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> veterans, is fully focused on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a>.
</p>
<p>
In <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/01/29/bioware-studio-update/">statement shared on BioWare's website</a>, McKay said the studio was currently "preparing for [its] next chapter", with a "core team" lead by Mike Gamble, Preston Watamaniuk, Derek Watts, and Parrish Ley now working on the next Mass Effect. However (reflecting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-isnt-ready-to-suddenly-have-a-team-of-250-300-people-working-on-it-now-dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-done">comments made by former studio veteran Mark Darrah</a> last week), McKay said the project is still at a stage that doesn't "require support from the full studio".
</p>
<p>
As a result, BioWare has downsized to what McKay calls a "more agile, focused studio". And while no specific numbers were shared, the move appears to have impacted a substantial number of staff, with McKay saying BioWare has been working to "match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit."

However, while his statement dances around any mention of layoffs, IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams">reports</a> a second group of BioWare employees have also had their roles terminated but not been placed in new positions - EA instead giving them time to apply for new roles within the company if they so choose. The publisher offered little clarity in a follow-up statement provided to IGN, saying it would not be "sharing numbers", but that "the studio has the right number of people in the right roles to work on Mass Effect at this stage of development."
</p><p>
Today's studio update comes a week after what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-dragon-age-the-veilguard-just-received-its-final-major-update">appeared to be Dragon Age: The Veilguard's final patch</a>, and follows EA's admission the fantasy RPG had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-ea-sports-fc-25-and-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-as-it-lowers-financial-forecast">sold below its expectations</a>. Mass Effect 5 (or whatever it's eventually named) was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-says-a-brand-new-mass-effect-game-is-in-development">confirmed to be in the the "early stages" of development</a> back in 2020.

            <p>
Sony is dropping its formerly mandatory PlayStation Network account requirements across a select number of its predominantly single-player titles on PC - but it's introducing in-game content "benefits" as an incentive to continue using one.
</p>
<p>
Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">faced a major backlash last May</a> when it announced it would be retroactively making PSN accounts mandatory for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> on PC - and while it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">eventually relented</a>, that hasn't stopped it from requiring PSN accounts to play an increasing number of its PC ports since then. It's a move that's proven contentious among PC players, particularly given its original justification for PSN accounts on PC - to ensure the "safety and security" of online play - is considerably less convincing when many affected titles are single-player games.
</p>
<p>
But now, Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/new-in-game-content-incentives-coming-to-playstation-games-on-pc/">announced</a> something of a U-turn, confirming it'll be removing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-is-the-latest-playstation-game-to-require-a-psn-account-on-pc">mandatory PSN account requirements</a> from a number of its previously released and upcoming PC titles: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarok</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Remastered, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> (which launches this week), and The Last of US Part 2 Remastered (currently due in April).

<p>
In all four cases, PlayStation Network accounts will become "optional", but Sony is still eager enough for players to sign up and log into PSN that it's announced a new in-game content unlock initiative coming "soon" to the above games on PC.
</p><p>
Players that sign into a PlayStation Network account for Marvel's Spider-Man 2, for instance, will unlock the Spider-Man 2099 Black Suit and the Miles Morales 2099 Suit early. PSN accounts will also grant access to the Nora Valiant outfit in Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered.
</p>
<p>
Over in God of War Ragnarok, a PSN account lets players unlock Kratos' Armour of the Black Bear set at the first Lost Items chest in the Realm Between Realms rather than waiting until New Game Plus, and there's also a resource bundle containing 500 Hacksilver and 250 XP.
</p>
<p>
As for The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, a PSN account unlocks an Ellie skin inspired by Jordan's jacket in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Naughty Dog's upcoming Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, as well as 50 additional points to activate bonus features and unlock extras.
</p>
<p>
Sony hasn't yet said if it'll be making PSN accounts optional for all its all future single-player-focused PC releases (or if the changes mean impacted games will now be available in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">territories without PSN</a>), but it did confirm more PSN incentives are on the way. "Game creators at PlayStation Studios will continue to work on bringing more benefits to players who sign up for a PSN account," it wrote, "so be sure to follow studio channels for more information."
