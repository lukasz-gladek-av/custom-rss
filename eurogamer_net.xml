            <p>
Here's a small but notable detail that might have passed you by amid the chaos of information that's spiralled out of last week's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> reveal: the souped-up Switch 2 Edition of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> won't include any of its paid DLC.
</p>
<p>
That perhaps isn't a huge surprise given Nintendo has never claimed otherwise, but it seems the company's Switch 2 Edition sales pitch - which has had an air of 'definitive edition' about it - might have led to some confusion. 
</p>
<p>
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is, to recap, one of six special Switch 2 Editions - basically, enhanced versions of existing Switch games - revealed during last week's Direct, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and Pokémon Legends Z-A also getting similar spruce-ups.

<p>
Each Switch 2 Edition includes frame rate and resolutions bumps, alongside a variety of game-specific features, and is available to purchase as a standalone digital or physical release. And that's in addition to the paid upgrade path Nintendo is offering to anyone who already owns the Switch 1 original. It's just convoluted enough to be a little confusing, and the fact Nintendo is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-edition-ports-of-og-switch-games-cost-65-in-uk">selling its Switch 2 Editions at a premium price</a> compared to the originals has muddied the waters further - but the company has now moved to clarify Breath of the Wild's Switch 2 Edition doesn't come with its previously released paid DLC.
</p>
<p>
"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition does not include The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Expansion Pass DLC," the company <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-nintendo-switch-2-edition-wont-include-the-dlc">wrote in a statement to IGN</a>. "That DLC is available as a separate purchase." As such, anyone looking for the full Breath of the Wild experience on Switch 2 will be needing to set aside just shy of £85 based on Nintendo's own pricing.
</p>
<p>
That sounds like a lot for an eight-year-old game and its DLC, but it's far from the only price point that's raised eyebrows following Switch 2's reveal. The cost of the console itself has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-treehouse-live-viewers-have-very-clear-message-for-nintendo">received plenty of pushback from fans</a> - and that was before the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-tariffs-werent-factored-into-switch-2-price-but-its-something-were-going-to-have-to-address">potential impact of US tariffs</a> - and then there's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">£75 price tag for Mario Kart World</a>, or the news Nintendo is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-charging-for-switch-2s-tutorial-game-because-of-the-amount-of-care-and-work-put-into-it">charging $10 USD for Switch 2's Welcome Tour tutorial game</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-reveals-a-proper-generational-upgrade-though-its-biggest-new-idea-remains-unproven">console looks promising</a> and its two flagship games have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-keeping-quiet-about-donkey-kong-bananzas-developer-but-it-feels-like-a-souped-up-super-mario-odyssey">received plenty of praise</a> after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">some early hands-on time</a> - but it's clear Nintendo has work to do to shake off the lingering controversy around Switch 2.

            <p>
I suspect I might be in a minority here, but I can confidently say I didn't use a single repair kit as I bumbled and faffed my way through MachineGames' excellent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> late last year - mainly because I was so enamoured by the game's ludicrous clobbering loop I couldn't take two steps forward without hoovering up another handful of melee-focused bric-a-brac. So I very much appreciate that Indy's latest update finally gives my never-diminishing stash of repair kits a purpose by letting me lob them at foes.
</p>
<p>
Besides that, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's Update 4 comes with a heap of tweaks and changes designed to further enhance its already excellent action, starting with two new Adventure Books that'll provide Indy with some additional whip-focused benefits. Open Season, for instance, creates a temporary window after whipping enemies in which they'll take increased damage from subsequent attacks. And with Sleight of Hand, Indy can pull an enemy's weapon towards him after disarming them with the whip.
</p>
<p>
That brings us to Update 4's dozen or so quality of life improvements. These include new one-liners for Indy during fights, meaning you'll get a bit of extra vocal variety while punching Nazis and other miscreants. And Machine Games says Ray-traced Global Illumination has also been improved across all platforms "at no performance cost".

<p>
Elsewhere, there's now a timer around Indy's health showing how long you'll need to wait until enemies call off a search, and a number of UI elements and effects - specifically the HUD's centre dot and "stealth" vignette while crouching - can now be toggled on or off. Additionally, the journal has seen some improvements while in its somewhat fiddly "lowered" state; you can see more of it, for starters, and it's now possible to switch between local and level maps.
</p>
<p>
Moving on, there's a new "Always Allow Skipping Cutscenes" option if you have absolutely no patience for cinematic chatter; there are a couple off new tutorials; the menu for purchasing Adventure Books and map information booklets has been improved; the PC version now supports the PlayStation DualSense Wireless Controller for advanced haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, and PlayStation or Steam Deck controllers will now show up in the controller configuration menu on PC. And for more on Update 4's lengthy list of bug fixes, you'll be <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/7gQFCUktT0FwdnHFlcZVOV/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-4?linkId=100000356791847">wanting to check out MachineGames' patch notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's fourth major update is now live on PC and Xbox, and it seems reasonable to expect all its additions and improvements will feature in the PlayStation 5 release when it launches next Thursday, 17th April. And it is, of course, well worth picking up. "Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones," we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">wrote in our five star review</a>, "The Great Circle is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames" - and that was before we went on to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-eurogamers-game-of-2024">name it Eurogamer's game of the year in 2024</a>.
