            <p>After months of waiting and numerous social media posts about Donkey Kong, Nintendo has finally unveiled its highly-anticipated Switch successor, now officially known as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>. Let's-a-go!</p>
<p>The Switch 2 was revealed this afternoon with a video giving us a brief look at its new design. This includes those magnetic Joy Cons and what looks like the previously rumoured mouse functionality. </p>
<p>The console is due out in 2025, with more news coming at a Nintendo Direct on 2nd April. You can check the Switch 2 announcement below.</p>

<p>As well as giving us a look at the new hardware, Nintendo also gave us a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">peep at a new Mario Kart game</a>. This snippet showed Nintendo regulars like Mario (or course), Peach, Luigi and Bowser - to name just a handful - making their way on a number of karts and bikes. Alas, nothing on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> just yet. </p><p>
Nintendo has said the Switch 2 will play exclusive games for the console, as well as both physical and digital Nintendo Switch games. It did note, however, certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p>If you are keen to give the console a go for yourself before its release (which remains TBA away from that aforementioned 2025 window), the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-switch-2-public-hands-on-tour">company will also hold Nintendo Switch 2 Experience events</a>. 
</p>
<p>For those in the UK, this event will be held in London between 11th and 13th April.</p>
<p>"Tickets will be made available through a free-to-enter, randomly selected draw. Enter the draw anytime during the registration period for a chance to attend," reads the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Campaigns/Nintendo-Switch-2-Experience-London-2722997.html">official line from Nintendo</a>. "Registrations for the London event are open from January 17th at 14:00 (UK time) until January 26th at 23:59 (UK time).</p>
<p>"A free Nintendo Account is required to register. It is only possible to register for one event across Europe."</p>

<p>Today's announcement comes months, nay years, since reports about Nintendo's next console first started making the rounds.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-demoed-switch-2-to-developers-at-gamescom">Eurogamer got word the system's capabilities had been demoed to developers around Gamescom</a>. In the time that followed, there were numerous further leaks regarding the Switch 2's overall design and functionality - A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">prototype console shell along with internal components</a> popped up online, chatter about its optical sensor made the rounds, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-switch-2-leaks-suggest-microsd-express-support-lack-of-switch-1-dock-compatibility">purported retail listings for Switch 2 MicroSD Express cards were found</a>, and that's not even all of them.</p><p>This was all happening without Nintendo itself uttering more than a scant few words about the hardware. In fact, the only thing the company confirmed was that it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-fiscal-year">reveal its Switch successor before the end of March</a> (which it now has), and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">console would be backward compatible with Switch 1 games</a>.</p>
<p><em>I am updating this story as news comes in. </em></p><p>So, what do you think of the upcoming Switch 2? Will you be getting one when it releases? Let us know.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida has discussed why the company's PS Vita handheld didn't sell well, stating Sony didn't have the resources to split between two platforms but originally it had similar capabilities to Nintendo's Switch.</p>
<p>Since its release in 2011, the Vita handheld is estimated to have sold 10-15m units - that's far less than the 80m of its predecessor, the PSP, and less than either the Wii U or the GameCube.</p>
<p>Speaking on the Kinda Funny Gamescast, Yoshida suggested why he felt Vita sales under-performed.</p>

<p>"There are multiple reasons why Vita didn't work," he said. "It worked in a way that people loved playing games, especially indie games, on PS Vita. It was lovely hardware."</p>
<p>"Several technical choices we as a company made weren't really good ones," he continued. "One of which was the proprietary memory cards. That was a mistake, people had to spend more money to get the memory cards."</p>
<p>Further, he admitted the back touch "was not necessary". "Sometimes the team made amazing prototypes that felt so good and that misled everyone involved," he said, noting it added cost to the hardware. Similarly the OLED screen increased the production cost of each unit.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Vita dev kit had a video output to allow the handheld to connect to screens, but this was removed for the consumer release.</p>
<p>"It was really a bad idea," Yoshida joked, in a nod to the Switch's capabilities. "The development team removed that feature just to save a few cents of cost."</p>
<p>Yoshida then concluded: "I think the biggest reason Vita didn't do as well as we had hoped was that we had to spread all of our efforts/resources into two different platforms. And we didn't have that resource."</p>
<p>He added Sony didn't have a big enough talent pool across its studios to support both its home consoles (PS3 and PS4) as well as the handheld Vita. And as the consoles were more popular, they were prioritised.</p>
<p>This, Yoshida believes, is why Nintendo has been successful, as the rival company has pooled its resources into a single platform with dual capabilities. He even joked the Switch is the Vita 2.</p>
<p>Still, PlayStation's legacy, said Yoshida, is providing cutting edge technology at affordable prices, so there was never a discussion of combining efforts into a single piece of hardware as Nintendo did.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>In the same interview, Yoshida also touched on Sony's live-service game aspirations and said he likely would've resisted the move towards live-service games had he been in Hermen Hulst's position as CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p>
<p>"For me, I was managing this annual budget, so I was responsible for allocating money to what kinds of games to make," said Yoshida. "If the company was considering [a focus on live-service games], it probably didn't make sense to stop making another God of War or single-player game, and put all the money into these service games.</p><p>"However, what they did after I moved on and Hermen [Hulst] took over is Sony added a lot more resources. I don't think they told Hermen to stop making single-player games. They said 'these games are great, just continue doing that, and we'll give you additional resources to work on these service games and try it'."</p>
<p>He continued: "I'm sure they knew it's risky. The chance of a game being successful in this hugely competitive genre would be small. However, the company, knowing that risk, gave Hermen the resources and chance to try it. I think that’s the way they did it. In my mind, that’s great, and hopefully some games will become successful.</p>
<p>"I'm lucky <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> did so well!" he joked, adding: "You cannot plan for success in this industry, that's the most fun part of this business. I hope that this strategy will work in the end.</p>
<p>"If I was in the position of Hermen, probably I would've tried to resist that direction. Maybe that's one of the reasons they removed me from the first-party, because they knew I wouldn't do it!"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement">Yoshida left PlayStation earlier this week</a> after over 30 years working for the company, including as boss of PlayStation Worldwide Studios between 2008 and 2019.</p>

The Switch eShop is slow, outdated, stuffed with shovelware and needs a drastic overhaul in time for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>. But if you don't want to wait, there's good news today! 
</p>

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-imminent-reports-suggest">Switch 2 reveal</a>? What Switch 2 reveal. No, we're talking about the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/eshop">Better eShop</a>, a fan-made project built by website Nintendo Life.
</p>
<p>
This browser-based eShop offers a super-quick interface that plugs into Nintendo's store back-end. It's a much faster way to browse, filters out the hentai, and allows users to still buy games directly from Nintendo.

<p>
Several fan-requested eShop features have been built in as standard, including the ability to read or submit user reviews, and create customisable game search filters. 
</p>
<p>
Filters enabled by default mean you won't see 6247 games that have already been selected as "low quality, low effort or other kinds of spam", five titles listed as "asset flips" and 156 titles "based around hentai".
</p>
<p>
Other cool features include a dark mode, and the ability to toggle on the iconic Wii Shop Channel music. It truly is update day!
</p>
<p>
Upcoming features include Wishlist functionality, screenshots, additional regions (Better eShop currently supports the UK, US and EU) and the ability to mute specific game publishers.
</p>
<p>
"Better eShop was built in less than a week," the site states. "It's quite possible that Nintendo will start blocking us from gathering the data - but until then, we will continue to build and improve the Better eShop."

The recent deluge of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> details will have left Nintendo "really mad" and prompted time-consuming investigations into where information has leaked from.
</p>
<p>
That's according to former Nintendo employees Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang, who worked at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> for more than a decade and experienced the company's processes when leaks erupted previously.
</p>
<p>
"This really does have a disruptive impact in what the company's trying to do now, which is to announce and launch a new console - which is hard enough as it is," Yang said on the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRh5csh7mI&amp;ab_channel=Kit%26Krysta">Kit &amp; Krysta</a> podcast.

While leaks of information from Nintendo's manufacturing supply chain - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-df-weekly-what-does-the-switch-2-motherboard-leak-say-about-system-performance">such as the Switch 2 motherboard</a> - may be dealt with overseas, the duo discussed information they felt may have trickled out from within Nintendo itself, from the team working on the Switch 2 launch. And when this sort of leak happens, Nintendo always investigates internally.
</p>
<p>
"They do have very good people that investigate these things," Ellis said. "They will eventually get to the bottom of it, but it takes time and it takes a lot of just talking to everybody involved. 
</p>
<p>
"This is hard work, this is a lot of work and the people working on this - and it's not the whole company, it's a small group of people, at this point, who are allowed to know this information - need to focus all of their efforts onto [Switch 2].
</p><p>
"But now... half of their day is going to be eaten up by [questions like] 'I have to talk to you about every step you have taken at this point, who have you talked to, where do you think this could have happened?' And, quite frankly, that's time they don't have."
</p>
<p>
Yang said the pair had been through similar processes during their time at the company, and that teams "basically have another full-time job of being part of the investigation into these leaks". 
</p>
<p>
"It's extremely disruptive, it's a high-stress situation as well because you really feel like you're in the hot seat," Yang concluded.
</p>
<p>
Leaks also limit Nintendo's desire to grow the teams working on under-wraps products, Ellis added, so as to avoid leaks spreading further. This then meant more work, as product launches neared, on a smaller circle of people.

Switch 2 has been widely-tipped for an imminent reveal, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-imminent-reports-suggest">reports the console could be unveiled later today</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The expectation is that Nintendo will first show off its long-awaited Switch 2 successor via a brief introductory video focused on the console hardware itself, before a longer look at a later date showcasing Switch 2 games.
