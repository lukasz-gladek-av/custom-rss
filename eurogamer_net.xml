            <p>
There's another Call of Duty collaboration on the way. Following crossovers from the likes of Tomb Raider, Crash Bandicoot, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>, and The Boys, Activision has revealed it's teaming up with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> to shove the streaming service's hugely popular Squid Game TV series into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone early next year.
</p>
<p>
Squid Game, which follows a group of players attempting to survive a series of deadly children's games in order to win a BIG CASH PRIZE, took the world by storm when it first aired on Netflix back in 2021. It's been a long time coming, but the show is finally set to return for a second series on 26th December, and Netflix's promotional efforts are now in full swing.
</p>
<p>
And so enter Call of Duty. Activision unveiled its impending Squid Game crossover via a thirty second teaser trailer, in which a dashingly behatted Operator discovers a mysterious envelope emblazoned with symbols one 'X' away from a PlayStation copyright claim. It all ends with the Call of Duty logo emerging in a sequence reminiscent of Squid Game's opening titles, after which we're informed the collaboration is set to begin in January 2025.

<p>
Beyond that, specifics are limited to the point of non-existent. We do know the crossover is coming to both Black Ops 6 and Warzone early next year, but whether it'll offer anything more substantial than romper-suit-style premium cosmetics remains to be seen.
</p><p>
Call of Duty's Squid Game collaboration won't be the first digital take on the hit Korean television show to barrel out in conjunction with Netflix's season two promotions, however. The streaming service's own internally developed Squid Game Unleashed - a multiplayer "party royale" for iOS and Android devices - launches for subscribers on 17th December. It's just one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-has-over-80-games-currently-in-development-and-plans-to-launch-one-each-month">more than 80 titles currently in development</a> as part of Netflix's continuing push into the world of gaming, although one of its most intriguing projects - a new AAA game led by Halo creative head Joseph Staten - has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-closes-aaa-internal-studio-led-by-halo-creative-head-joseph-staten">now been cancelled</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for Call of Duty, it seems to be having a strong 2024. Microsoft recently announced Black Ops 6 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-records-for-game-pass-subscriber-adds-on-launch-day-says-microsoft">managed to set a record</a> for most "Game Pass subscribers adds on launch day" - a record previously held by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> following its launch last year.

            <p>
As we thrust ourselves boots first into the season of giving, Amazon has announced its own bout of spirited subscriber-only generosity, bringing 18 titles to Prime Gaming in December.
</p>
<p>
December's offerings - as is customary for Prime Gaming - arrive over the course of several scheduled content drops, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-bounty-hunter">Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-underworld">Tomb Raider: Underworld</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overcooked-2">Overcooked 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-juarez-gunslinger">Call of Juarez: Gunslinger</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dredge-review-a-clever-fishing-sim-but-an-underwhelming-horror-game">fishing horror Dredge</a> all available to claim now.

<p>
Then, as December continues, Prime Gaming subscribers can get their mitts on the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/quake-ii">Quake 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-of-lana-review-pace-poise-and-something-more">beautiful side-scrolling puzzle-platformer Planet of Lana</a>.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> is reportedly  being targeted by a Russian disinformation campaign falsely claiming the post-apocalyptic shooter scans players' computers in order to help the Ukranian government "locate citizens suitable for mobilisation".
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.404media.co/stalker2-disinformation/">reported by 404 Media</a>, the claims have been made in a one-minute video - stamped with a fake Wired watermark, but in reality unconnected to the publication - that's being circulated on social media sites including Telegram and sent directly to journalists' inboxes.
</p>
<p>
The video falsely asserts "an embedded program was discovered in [Stalker 2]'s code that collects player data and transmits it to [developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a>]'s servers". It's claimed this data - said to include the device name, IP address, and the current location of the player - is "transmitted every second" without the user's knowledge and handed to the Ukranian government, because GSC "made a deal with the state" in order to secure funding for Stalker 2. "It's better to play using a VPN or boycott this game for your own safety", the video concludes.

<p>
404 Media says the video bears the hallmarks of an ongoing Russian disinformation campaign, previously dubbed Operation Matryoshka, intended to flood social media and journalists' inboxes with "false stories that usually paint NATO countries and Ukraine in a bad light, waste reporters' time, and make people distrust news outlets more broadly." Eurogamer has contacted GSC for comment on the video currently being circulated.
</p><p>
As to why Stalker 2 is now being targeted by a disinformation campaign, that's likely down to the game having become something a symbol of Ukranian resilience during Russian's invasion of the country (development has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-documentary-shares-personal-stories-from-development-against-the-backdrop-of-war">continued throughout the Russian bombardment</a>, with some developers remaining in Kyiv while others have relocated to Prague), coupled with its recent high-profile - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-sold-1-million-copies-so-far">enormously successful</a> - launch across Xbox Series X/S and PC.
</p>
<p>
Stalker 2's website was previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ukrainian-developer-stalker-2s-website-blocked-by-russia">blocked by the Russian government</a> after GSC posted a message calling for an end to its brutal invasion of Ukraine, and the studio has also been targeted by Russian hackers who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-studio-defiant-in-response-to-claimed-russian-hack">stole Stalker 2 development material</a> and threatened it with blackmail. "We are a Ukrainian company," GSC wrote at the time, "and like most Ukrainians, we have experienced many things that are much more terrifying: destroyed houses, ruined lives, and the deaths of our loved ones. Attempts to blackmail or intimidate us are completely futile".
</p>
<p>
Stalker 2 received a solid critical reception when it launched last week, despite its significant technical issues - Eurogamer called it a "compelling and often busted survival shooter that frustrates and satisfies at alternating pitch" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">our three star review</a>. Since then, GSC has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-dev-acknowledges-rough-edges-says-its-monitoring-feedback">pledged to fix the game's "rough edges"</a>, starting with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyls-first-patch-is-here-featuring-over-650-fixes">patch addressing over 650 issues</a>.
