            <p>Arcane Season 2 is the most popular show on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> right now, not just in the UK or US, but across 60+ countries worldwide.</p>
<p>As detailed by data collated by <a href="https://flixpatrol.com/title/arcane/">FlixPatrol</a> - official figures will likely come from Netflix later this week - Arcane leads the pack by a considerable margin and is presently number one on the streaming platform in 65 different countries.</p>

<p>This is great news for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> spin-off given both seasons of Arcane cost a total of approximately $250m USD to create and promote, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/league-of-legends-spin-off-arcane-most-expensive-animated-series-ever-report-says">making it the most expensive animated series of all time</a>.</p>
<p>The show's first nine episodes are said to have seen a production cost "north of $80m", while the second set of nine episodes - which will make up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-now-describes-arcane-season-two-as-the-final-chapter">the show's final season</a> - reportedly had a production cost "approaching" the $100m mark.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how the rest of the series will fare - right now, just three of the nine episodes are available to view. Episodes four, five and six will debut on 16th November, and the final three on 23rd, bringing the hit show to a close.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-2-review">Eurogamer's Arcane Season 2 review</a>, which earned a respectable four out of five stars, Chris T. said, "Some iffy pacing moments aside, Arcane's second and final season truly puts the money on screen. This is a striking, emotionally wrought, hard-punching climax."</p>
<p>Not all game TV and movie adaptations see the same success, of course, although Lara Croft fans were delighted to learn that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-animated-tomb-raider-series-is-returning-for-season-2-and-laras-teaming-up-with-an-old-pal">Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft Netflix show was coming back for a second season</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Has "no idea why" Embracer chose to abandon the franchise.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> creator Warren Spector reckons "if someone made Deus Ex today", the cyberpunk role-playing game "might be perceived as a documentary", given its themes of a dystopian world and evil factions competing to control it.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/deus-ex-director-warren-spector-thinks-that-if-someone-made-deus-ex-today-it-might-be-perceived-as-a-documentary-so-if-he-made-a-new-one-it-would-be-pretty-different/">PC Gamer</a>, Spector reflected on how the world - and game design - has changed in the 25 years since Deus Ex first debuted, adding "I wouldn't make Deus Ex again as it was in 2000 when it could be read as a believable fantasy".</p>

<p>"Y2K was around the corner, AI was becoming a thing, conspiracies were everywhere, terrorism was on the rise, bioengineering was in its infancy, techno-augmentation was in the works," Spector said, talking about how he leaned into real-life issues rather than "trying to convince people to be interested in something" more fantastical.</p>
<p>"All that stuff was floating around in the zeitgeist. Making a game about it was an obvious thing to do."</p>
<p>If he returned to the series now, however, Spector says he'd like to examine "other concerns that would be more relevant, more pressing, more worthy of exploration".</p>
<p>Spector also commented on Embracer's decision to cancel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-cancels-deus-ex-game-in-development-for-two-years">Eidos Montreal's new Deus Ex game</a> earlier this year, putting almost a hundred people out of work.</p>
<p>The project had been in development at Eidos Montreal for around two years, following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-sells-off-western-studios-and-ip-including-tomb-raider-and-deus-ex">acquisition by Embracer in 2022</a>. The decision to call an end to this project was part of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-confirms-900-employees-laid-off-in-previous-financial-quarter">Swedish conglomerate's ruthless restructuring</a> and cost-cutting measures.</p>
<p>"I really have no idea why Embracer would abandon the Deus Ex franchise, at least for now," Spector said. "From my perspective, the gameplay approach is still relevant, but the world and situation needs some updating."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Spector - who also created Epic Mickey - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-mickey-3-currently-impossible-warren-spector-says">said he was unavailable to work on a third game in the series</a>, despite the announcement it was being revived.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Players have until the end of the month to make their requests.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sony is discontinuing the PlayStation Camera adaptor for PSVR1 on PS5.</p>
<p>According to a brief update on the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/hardware/playstation-camera-adaptor/?">PlayStation website</a>, the device will be withdrawn on 26th November 2024, or "until supplies last".</p>

<p>The adaptor was introduced with the PS5. As a camera is required for PSVR the PS5's HD camera is not compatible, it's the only way to play PSVR1 on PS5.</p>
<p>If you have the tech and haven't yet reached out to secure an adaptor, now's the time to do it - especially as the offer's only good for as long as "supplies last".</p>
<p><a href="http://playstation.com/camera-adaptor">Head to the official website to put in a request</a>. You'll need to provide your PSVR processor unit serial number and - depending upon where you are in the world - your name, email, phone number, and shipping address. The processor unit's serial number should begin with the letter C, M, or P.</p>

<p>Ian also took a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metro-awakening-vr-review">Metro Awakening VR for Eurogamer</a>, awarding it three out of five stars, saying: "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metro-awakening">Metro Awakening</a> VR delivers some terrifying moments in its deep, thought-provoking story, but after a strong start, repetitive levels and pacing issues kill most of its momentum".

            <p>There's a whole generation of video game fans who don't know very much about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>, and that's one of the reasons we are getting a remake in the form of Delta: Snake Eater.</p>
<p>This revelation comes from series producer Noriaki Okamura, who told Play magazine the team realised "a lot of the newer, younger generation of gamers aren't familiar with the Metal Gear series anymore" (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metal-gear/metal-gear-solid-delta-exists-because-konami-was-starting-to-get-worried-that-the-younger-generation-of-gamers-arent-familiar-with-the-metal-gear-series-anymore/">GamesRadar</a>).</p>
<p>As such, Konami's upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> remake is being created with future generations in mind.</p>

<p>"It was basically our mission, our duty, to kind of continue making sure that the series lives on for future generations," Okamura explained. "After all, we leave behind much more than just DNA, as Solid Snake would say - but again, who is Solid Snake?"</p>
<p>As for why we are getting a remake of the third Metal Gear game, Okamura noted it takes place first chronologically. "That's where the original story started," he said, so it just made sense.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-announced">back in May last year</a>, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater retains the 2004 original's story - which follows Naked Snake on an operation deep within the Soviet jungle, some 31 years before the events of Metal Gear.</p>
<p>We still don't have a release date for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, despite a PlayStation blog previously suggesting the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-gives-2024-release-window-to-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-and-silent-hill-2-remake">remake would make its debut some time this year</a>.

<p>"Whisper it quietly, but Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater looks like the most exciting Konami project in years," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-metal-gear-solid-delta-what-tech-does-the-new-remake-bring">Digital Foundry's Tom Morgan wrote after some time with the game earlier this year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The GTA community is eager to hear more about the next instalment in the series, and once again have theorised Rockstar left a clue about the upcoming game in its GTA Online promotional material.</p>
<p>The material in question shows a character leaning on a car, while looking up at the Darnell Bros Garment Factory. But, it isn't the character or the factory that has caught the attention of eager fans. It is the moon that shines down on the scene from the upper corner.</p>

<p>The moon in this image is a waning gibbous, and the moon here in the real world will be at the same phase on 22nd November.

            <p>
Smash hit smartphone app Pokémon TCG Pocket will add its first big expansion of fresh cards in late January, according to a new leak. 
</p>
<p>
A datamine of the game's event schedule posted by <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1855422922384351518">Centro Leaks</a> suggests the game's currently-untitled first expansion will arrive on 29th January - with the caveats that final dates are still subject to change. 
</p>
<p>
That current plan would mean a roughly three-month window between the launch of Pokémon TCG Pocket and the arrival of a flurry of new cards - which feels about right?

<p>
That said, there's also suggestion of a special booster pack due for launch in December - which points to a smattering of extra cards arriving slightly sooner to tide fans over. 
</p>
<p>
Other upcoming additions to Pokémon TCG Pocket spotted in the datamine include a new card rarity, and rare picks being added to the Wonder Pick mechanic.

Pokémon TCG Pocket looks to be off to a great start, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-passes-30m-downloads-in-a-week">$12m earned over the game's first four days</a> and more than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-off-to-strong-start-reportedly-earns-12m-in-four-days">30m downloads after a week</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Pokémon TCG Pocket is heavily built around the opening of trading card game packs, though you can also play a simplified version of the classic trading card game via the app as well.

Nintendo will hold a special Direct broadcast later today - but, once again, it's not to announce <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Instead, the Super Nintendo World Direct will focus on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-expansion-for-super-nintendo-world-opens-in-spring-2024">upcoming addition of Donkey Kong Country</a> to Universal Studios Japan. 
</p>
<p>
Announcing the broadcast, which is scheduled for 10pm UK time tonight (that's 2pm Pacific or 5pm Eastern), Nintendo said the stream would last for roughly 10 minutes and that no information on upcoming games will be featured.

"Please note, there will be no game announcements or mentions of the Nintendo Switch successor during this presentation," Nintendo noted.

Super Nintendo World finally opened its doors at Universal Studios Japan in late 2020. A slightly smaller version, at Universal Studios Hollywood, opened in early 2023. 
</p>
<p>
Two other incarnations of Super Nintendo World are under construction and due to open in 2025. These will be located at Universal Studios Singapore and at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/universal-floridas-super-nintendo-world-park-gets-may-2025-opening-date">Universal Epic Universe in Florida, the latter of which will include Donkey Kong Country from the off</a>.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a> is set to add a new rollercoaster, Mine-Cart Madness, that is designed to make riders feel like their cart has jumped the track. Will we get to see Mario creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> riding it tonight?

While Nintendo fans wait for news on Switch 2, Nintendo itself has been busy releasing the last wave of major games for its current Switch hardware, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-the-nintendo-museum-a-joyful-celebration-of-machines-magic-and-the-art-of-play">opening a museum</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-music-app-sees-mario-maker-take-on-spotify-and-youtube-playlists">launching a smartphone music app</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-just-unveiled-an-alarm-clock-that-plays-mario-coin-noises-when-you-roll-over">announcing an alarm clock</a>.

Speaking to Eurogamer this month, a prominent video games industry analyst said it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-now-very-unlikely-before-2025-analyst-says">now "very unlikely" Nintendo still had plans to detail Switch 2 this year</a>.
