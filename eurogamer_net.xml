            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-reportedly-already-out-in-the-wild-but-needs-a-day-one-update-to-function<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
With a little over a week to go until <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s arrival, some customers are already claiming to have received their consoles - but anyone hoping to play ahead of release are apparently out of luck, as units reportedly won't function without a day one update.
</p>
<p>
As spotted <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/someone-got-their-hands-on-a-nintendo-switch-2-early-and-the-videos-already-been-taken-down">by IGN</a>, YouTuber Ali Almarzooqi initially uploaded an eight-second video showing them opening their Switch 2 box - or at least a convincing replica - to reveal the console within. Unfortunately, it didn't take long before the video was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpbiOytojJc">yanked as a result of a copyright claim by Web Capio</a>, a company that markets itself as selling "anti-piracy solutions."
</p>
<p>
In a since-nuked comment thread below the video, Almarzooqi (AKA a2dubai) responded to a viewer asking for "more video please" by explaining, "Nintendo locked the Switch 2. It needs [an] update to function, so I'm waiting for June 5th to unlock it.".

<p>
Notably, this doesn't seem to be an isolated incident. Gaming news and deals poster Wario64 revealed they'd received correspondence - seemingly included corroborating images - from another Switch 2 customer who'd received their console early. "I have no permission to post pics," Wario64 <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1927441748923457581">wrote in a post on social media</a>, "but can share that when they try to boot a Switch 1 game, a message prompts 'Please connect to the internet and update your system.' Needs update to boot a game."
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time we've heard word of a big launch-day patch for Switch 2, either. The Game Business' Chris Dring <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-media-outlets-will-not-have">recently reported</a> some press have been told they won't get the console for coverage before release due to a "significant day one patch". This, presumably, is the very same update currently thwarting early receivers from playing their games ahead of schedule. It's currently unclear if the update is simply coming in hot or if it's a deliberate ploy by Nintendo to prevent legitimate gameplay appearing online ahead of launch.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2, of course, arrives next Thursday, 5th June, and you can read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">everything we know about the machine</a> - and its launch day games - elsewhere on Eurogamer.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/more-claims-of-apple-dedicated-ios-gaming-app-surface-as-company-acquires-first-game-studio.1200003/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/more-claims-of-apple-dedicated-ios-gaming-app-surface-as-company-acquires-first-game-studio<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
A new report has lend further credence to last year's claims Apple is working on game-focused iOS app that'll integrate store, social features, achievements and more - with the company now said to be "seeking to sell gamers and developers on the idea that it’s a leader in the market."
</p>
<p>
Word that Apple was looking to expand its gaming strategy with a dedicated iOS app first surfaced last year, when news site 9to5 Mac reported efforts were underway at the company to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-reportedly-working-on-new-game-focused-ios-app-integrating-store-social-features-achievements-and-more">combine the functionality of iOS' App Store and its long-defunct Game Center service</a> - which previously offered a centralised place to view likes of challenges, leaderboards, and achievements before the app was removed from iOS in 2016.
</p>
<p>
And now, eight months later, Bloomberg has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-27/apple-to-debut-dedicated-gaming-app-within-days-of-switch-2-s-arrival">corroborated 9to5's story with a similar report</a>, saying Apple is looking to preinstall the new gaming app on iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV set-top boxes later this year. There's also talk of a Mac version, capable of displaying games downloaded outside of the App Store. As in 9to5's earlier report, Bloomberg - citing "people with knowledge of the matter" - says the app will serve as a launcher for games and centralise in-game achievements, leaderboards, communications, and other activities.

<p>
It'll reportedly also feature internally produced editorial content highlighting new games available within the app, which will include those from the App Store's game section and the company's Apple Arcade game subscription service. Bloomberg says the app is due to launch as part of Apple's next iOS version, iOS 19, and will be showcased during the company's Worldwide Developers Conference on 9th June ahead of a September arrival.
</p>
<p>
Apple's push to create a prominent games destination for iOS users does, of course, follow the EU's mandate last year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-returning-to-ios-says-epic-as-apple-agrees-to-alternative-app-marketplaces-in-eu">Apple must allow sideloading and alternate marketplaces</a> on its devices to comply with the Digital Markets Act. Since then, a number of third-party marketplaces have taken advantage of the EU's new rules, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-game-store-and-fortnite-now-available-in-eu-on-ipad">most notably the Epic Games Store</a>.
</p>
<p>
A new game-focused iOS app from Apple would mark another small step in the company's slowly evolving gaming strategy, which has so far included the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">launch of its Apple Arcade games subscription service in 2019</a>, new tools to help developer easily port their Mac games to iOS, and even a push to woo major publishers like Capcom and Ubisoft onto its platform in recent years - although efforts to sell full-price AAA games such as Resident Evil 7, Death Stranding, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> to iOS users have reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-has-reportedly-flopped-on-ios-with-under-2000-sales">proved disappointing</a>.
</p>
<p>
Reports of Apple's new app come as the company announces its first video game studio acquisition. It now owns RAC7, the two-person studio responsible for Apple Arcade hit Sneaky Sasquatch - although an Apple spokesperson <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/apple-acquires-rac7-sneaky-sasquatch/">told Digital Trends</a> the move was a "unique circumstance", as it saw an opportunity to help the team grow its game further.

            <p>

A month after EA announced it was ending its partnership with the World Rally Championship, and "pausing development" on all future rally games, publisher Nacon has revealed it'll be the new home of official WRC titles starting 2027, in an agreement initially spanning six years.
</p>
<p>
EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/codemasters-has-secured-the-official-wrc-licence">inherited the World Rally Championship license</a> as part of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-to-release-new-racing-game-every-year-after-codemasters-acquisition">acquisition of UK racing game specialist Codemasters</a> in 2021, and its first WRC title - EA Sports WRC - released two years later in 2023. Last month, however, the publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-its-pausing-development-on-future-rally-games-as-wrc-partnership-ends">revealed it had "reached the end of the road working on WRC"</a>, leaving the future of rally gaming somewhat uncertain given it also confirmed it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-it-is-reducing-roles-at-codemasters-and-redeploying-as-many-as-possible">laying off staff</a> and "pausing development plans on future rally titles".
</p>
<p>
But less than a month later, a fresh World Rally Championship deal has been struck with a new company, Nacon - the publisher behind the likes of RoboCop: Rogue City and last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-review-tech-issues-mar-the-return-of-the-original-name-in-open-world-racers">disappointing Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a>. It's perhaps not a huge surprise, given Nacon (formerly Bigben Interactive) previously held the WRC license between 2013 and 2022, and released nine titles in that time, culminating in WRC Generations.

<p>
As detailed in <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/05/26/3088220/0/en/PRESS-RELEASE-NACON-ANNOUNCES-AGREEMENT-WITH-WRC-PROMOTER-FOR-THE-PUBLISHING-OF-THE-OFFICIAL-GAMES-OF-THE-FIA-WORLD-RALLY-CHAMPIONSHIP-FROM-2027-TO-2032.html">today's announcement</a>, Nacon's new agreement "covers the development and publishing of the official WRC games and eSports competitions, granting [the company] exclusive rights for PC and consoles for six seasons, from 2027 through 2032."
</p>
<p>
Nacon adds it's now set to begin development of an "all-new WRC game series, aiming to deliver an immersive experience that faithfully reflects the reality of the championship and meets the expectations of both rally enthusiasts and new players". These titles will mark a "complete reboot of the franchise", and will include the likes of official rallies, vehicles, teams, drivers, and sponsors.
</p>
<p>
"After a comprehensive evaluation, we are delighted to have reached an agreement with Nacon," World Rally Championship chief marketing officer Arne Dirks said in a statement accompanying today's new. "[Its] vision for the franchise stands out, and their expertise in delivering great rally games is unquestioned. We look forward to breaking new ground together in this collaboration, to truly turn the WRC games into epic adventures and offer gaming experiences beyond rally as we know it today."
</p>
<p>
The most recent game to release under the WRC license was the Codemasters-developed EA Sports WRC, which launched in 2023. Eurogamer called it a "joyous and rugged display of rally racing, with exquisite handling, lightly flecked by technical issues", in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-wrc-review-a-bracing-and-richly-textured-celebration-of-rally">our four star review</a>.
