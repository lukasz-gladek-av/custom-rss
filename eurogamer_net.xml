            <p>A new Witcher novel is due out later this year, from original author Andrzej Sapkowski, which will follow a teen Geralt.</p>
<p>The prequel will be called Crossroads of Ravens in English (Rozdroże Kruków in Polish) and focus on an 18-year-old Geralt setting out from Kaer Morhen on his first mission where he'll "discover monsters, traitors, some new friends and some familiar faces, and just how deeply feared and despised Witchers can be".</p>
<p>Yes, Sapkowski stated he'd finished the Witcher saga back in 1999, but he returned in 2013 with Season of Storms, and now will return once again.</p>

<p>"In Rozdroże Kruków I return to the roots of Geralt's journey - not the fearless monster slayer we know, but a young Witcher just beginning to understand the burden of his destiny," said Sapkowski.</p>
<p>"Imagine Geralt, but younger, with fewer scars and a bit more haughtiness. This is a story of growth, of idealism meeting harsh reality, and of choices that forge a legend. It's about finding your place in a world that's constantly challenging you to be more than you thought you could be. As this new story finds its way to readers across the globe this year, I can't wait for them to walk alongside a younger Geralt - experiencing the trials that forged him and the journey that set him on the road to his destiny."</p>
<p>The novel will be released on 30th September in an English translation by David French, responsible for translating 6 of the last 8 Witcher books. For non-English speakers, it will be translated into more than 19 other languages.</p>
<p>The novel will differ from CD Projekt Red's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">recently revealed The Witcher 4</a>. Instead of going backwards, the next game will follow the previous games as sequels to the books and has Ciri as its protagonist instead of Geralt.</p>
<p>Don't worry gruff hero fans, Geralt will still make an appearance in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-talks-ciri-fan-reaction-playable-geralt-coyness-and-if-the-game-will-honour-your-previous-choices">will he be playable? The developers remain coy</a>.</p>
<p>Witcher 4 will compete with The Blood of Dawnwalker, a new game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz's new studio Rebel Wolves. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-directors-dark-fantasy-rpg-the-blood-of-the-dawnwalker-gets-first-trailer">game received its first trailer</a> at the start of the year.</p>
<p>The studio is supported by NetEase and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-directors-next-game-still-on-track-studio-says-despite-netease-funding-fears">recently confirmed it hasn't been affected by the Chinese conglomerate pulling funding</a>.</p>
<p>It also won't be the first time we see a young Geralt, as he features in Netflix anime Nightmare of the Wolf.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>'s eighth season will release a "couple of weeks" later than scheduled after Blizzard decided to serve "the game, not the plan".</p>
<p>Writing on social media, general manager of Diablo Rod Fergusson revealed development was taking a little longer than originally anticipated, but did soften the news by teasing "an old 'friend'" was making a return.</p>

<p>"In the spirit of serving the game, not the plan, Season 8 will take a couple of weeks longer to bake than we initially anticipated," Fergusson wrote.</p>
<p>"The team is hard at work on some great updates coming in the next season, so stay tuned. Looking forward to seeing an old 'friend'."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hey everyone - In the spirit of serving the game, not the plan, Season 8 will take a couple of weeks longer to bake than we initially anticipated. The team is hard at work on some great updates coming in the next season, so stay tuned. Looking forward to seeing an old "friend".</p>— Rod Fergusson (@RodFergusson) <a href="https://twitter.com/RodFergusson/status/1895218822615048571?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>That "old 'friend'" has got players excited - and speculating. Whilst Fergusson couldn't be drawn on who that friend - or foe, as the case may be - is, fans have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1izvosa/an_update_on_season_8_from_rod/">suggesting</a> all kinds of characters, from to Cain to Covetous Shen to Lyndon. Others posit it could be the return of Lorath, Tyrael, Zoltun Kulle, Eirena, or Kormac.</p>
<p>Right now, it's unclear exactly how long the season will be delayed for, but we'll keep you posted.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Ed reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-backtracks-on-diablo-4-annual-expansions-next-due-in-2026">Diablo 4's next expansion won't arrive until 2026</a>, marking a change in its annual plans.</p>
<p>Fergusson made the announcement at a DICE panel event, saying: "In 2025, or just before Season 8, we will have a 2025 roadmap for Diablo 4.</p>
<p>"Now, our second expansion won't be on that roadmap, because our second expansion is coming in 2026, but at least players will have the road ahead."</p>
<p>"A polished, bewitching upgrade that sinks its claws into you - featuring perhaps the best character class in Diablo's history," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review">Vessel of Hatred review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
