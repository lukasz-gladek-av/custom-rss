            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-randy-pitchford-seeks-to-justify-80-real-fans-comment<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Earlier this week, Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford made headlines, when a comment he had made on social media started making the rounds online. The comment was in response to one potential Borderlands 4 buyer, who in a post on X said "this game better not be 80 dollars". Pitchford then gave a slightly tone deaf reply, saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/80-for-borderlands-4-too-costly-randy-pitchford-says-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen">"real fans" would find a way to get their hands on a copy of the game no matter how much it cost</a>.</p>
<p>Pitchford's comment was met with a certain amount of backlash, and now the Gearbox head has shared another post in a bid to unmuddy the waters.</p>
<p>"If you want the truth, here it is," he wrote, with an accompanying video from an earlier interview where he was asked how much Borderlands 4 would retail for. Here, the Gearbox exec admitted he did not know how much Borderlands 4 will cost.</p>

<p>"It's an interesting time, right," Pitchford said. "On one level, we've got a competitive market place. The people who make those choices want to sell as many units as possible, and they want to be careful about people who are price sensitive. So, there are some folks who don't want to see prices go up, even the ones deciding what the prices are."</p>
<p>He went on to state that there are also "other folks accepting the reality that game budgets are increasing, and there's tariffs for the retail packaging" to consider.</p>
<p>"It's getting gnarly out there, guys," Pitchford said, adding Borderlands 4 has "more than twice" the development budget of its series predecessor. He reiterated that he really doesn't know the price, but when pre-orders go live, that's when we will all know how much Borderlands 4 will cost.</p>
<p>"Here's the philosophy we have, whatever the price is: we're entertainers. Yes, we want to get more resources so we can make bigger and better games - there is a reason why Borderlands 4 is so awesome," the studio head went on. "It's because you guys showed up and supported <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a>. And, we had the budget, we could more than double the budget and feel confident in that."</p>
<p>He said as a group of "artists", the studio wants everyone to be able to get their hands on Borderlands 4. "We want to make it as easy as possible for everybody to enjoy what we are creating" and that everyone who plays a Gearbox game feels like they "got the better end of the bargain".</p>
<p>In the video, Pitchford said "we're going to have a price set soon, and it might be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rising-game-prices-would-happen-sooner-or-later-says-former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida">new price that Nintendo and Microsoft have led with</a>" or "it might be that we stay back". Either way, "it's going to be the people at the publishing house that decide that".</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> will receive difficulty options in a free update due alongside its forthcoming DLC, Overture.</p>
<p>As a Soulslike game, Lies of P is certainly challenging. But the new difficulty options will ensure both the base game and the DLC are more approachable for newcomers.</p>
<p>"We wanted to make sure a wider audience of players could play the game," said game director Jiwon Choi (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lies-of-p-is-getting-difficulty-options-to-make-the-soulslike-more-accessible/">VGC</a>), adding the team had had "a lot of feedback" from players and the game's developers.</p>

<p>"So by making development adjustments and introducing these difficulty options, we can offer the experience to different types of players. This broadens the base."</p>
<p>The default difficulty for Lies of P will be named "Legendary Stalker", while two easier modes will be added named "Butterfly's Guidance" and "Awakened Puppet".</p>
<p>If you're after even more challenge, though, the game is also receiving a Battle Memories mode where players can replay bosses through five tiers of difficulty, including ultra hard modes.</p>
<p>What's more, a Death March boss rush mode will challenge players to take down as many bosses as possible with a limited pool of health and items.</p>
<p>Both of these modes will have bespoke rewards yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Lies of P: Overture is a prequel to the base game that was initially teased in 2023 following the game's release, along with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-sequel-confirmed-as-game-director-teases-dlc">confirmation a sequel is in development</a>. It was then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-prequel-dlc-revealed-named-overture">officially revealed earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>As a prequel, the DLC will follow the protagonist puppet during the final days of the city of Krat. It will feature new weapons such as slashing claws, a gunblade, and a ranged bow.</p>
<p>Lies of P: Overture will be released at some point this summer.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Eurogamer spoke with Choi about FromSoftware's forthcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, though the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-to-remain-single-player-despite-refreshing-elden-ring-nightreign-says-director">Lies of P team is focused solely on creating a single-player game</a>.</p>
<p>"I've tried [Nightreign] and it was very refreshing and new," he said. "So that obviously gave me the impression that they're good developers, they always push their boundaries, their imagination and vision, and it shows. In turn, that for some reason motivated me to deliver the Overture experience as good as it could be."</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> and Dark Souls creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a> has frequently discussed the high difficulty level of his games. Ahead of Elden Ring's release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-souls-creator-hidetaka-miyazaki-discusses-elden-ring-difficulty">he stated it would be more approachable than previous games</a>, and then last year said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/turning-down-elden-rings-difficulty-would-break-the-game-itself-says-miyazaki">turning down the challenge would "break the game itself"</a>.</p>
<p>Souls fans have long debated whether difficulty options should be included, but it's great to see other studios implementing what FromSoftware hasn't so far.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Following last week's PlayStation Plus catalogue additions for May, Sony has announced its next batch of departures, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> and more all leaving the service in June.
</p>
<p>
In total, PlayStation Plus' newly updated Last Chance to Play section confirms six titles are currently scheduled to be removed from the service next month, meaning the clock is ticking if you were hoping to see any of the following games' credits roll:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Monster Hunter Rise</li>
<li>Rogue Legacy 2</li>
<li>Inscryption</li>
<li>After Us</li>
<li>Kayak VR: Mirage</li>
<li>Avicii Invector</li>
</ul>

<p>
The good news is it's a considerably smaller list compared to last month, when Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-20-games-leaving-ps-plus-extra-premium-next-month">jettisoned over 22 titles</a> - including the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/payday-2">Payday 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a>, and Journey to the Savage Planet. But that's not to say none of June's removals will be missed; Monster Hunter Rise is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-rise-review-the-switchs-best-game-since-breath-of-the-wild">stellar entry in Capcom's long-running series</a>, while Rogue Legacy 2 - with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rogue-legacy-2-review-more-of-the-brilliant-same-in-this-impressive-sequel">jauntily compelling</a> permadeath platform exploration - and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inscryption-review-a-wonderful-nightmare-and-a-vividly-memorable-game-of-cards">wonderfully sinister Inscryption</a> both come highly recommended.
</p>
<p>
And if you've managed to miss the news of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-your-ps-plus-catalogue-additions-for-may">PlayStation Plus' latest additions</a> so far this month, these include Battlefield 5, Stalker: Legends of the Zone Trilogy, Humankind, and Sandland for Premium and Extra subscribers. Ark: Survival Ascended, Balatro, and Warhammer 40K: Boltgun, meanwhile, can be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-your-playstation-plus-games-for-may">picked up across all three membership tiers</a>. You can find more details in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">Eurogamer's full PlayStation Plus guide</a>.
