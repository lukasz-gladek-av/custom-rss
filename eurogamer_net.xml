            <p>Netflix has renewed Devil May Cry for a second season.</p>
<p>The adult animation series was created by Adi Shankar, and is - of course - based on Capcom's video games. Now, just a week since the first season's debut, the streaming service has announced a second season is on the cards, writing: "Let's dance."</p>

<p>The first series followed demon hunter Dante as he was pitted against the powerful White Rabbit who had ideas to unleash hell on earth, because things just aren't bad enough already.</p>
<p>The show made its debut on Netflix on 3rd April, and is currently the fourth most watched series on the streaming platform. According to <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/tv">Netflix charts</a>, Devil May Cry has already been viewed 5.3m times, equating to 21m hours.</p>
<p>Along with Johnny Yong Bosch as Dante, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-voice-actor-kevin-conroy-posthumously-stars-in-netflixs-devil-may-cry-anime">first series of Devil May Cry included legendary Batman voice actor Kevin Conroy as VP Baines</a>. Sharing the news of Conroy's inclusion in Devil May Cry earlier this year, series showrunner Adi Shankar said that the actor's lines were "recorded before he passed", and no AI was used.</p>
<p>"Mr Conroy gave it [an] amazingly nuanced performance," Shankar wrote on social media. "It was both a pleasure and an honour to work with him."</p>
<p>The first season's end credits include a dedication to Conroy.</p>

<p>Devil May Cry is not the only video game-related animated series to be returning for a second round on Netflix. Towards the end of last year, the platform announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-animated-tomb-raider-series-is-returning-for-season-2-and-laras-teaming-up-with-an-old-pal">Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft was also getting renewed for a second season</a>.</p>
<p>While more details remain slim for now, Netflix confirmed Sam Nishimura - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rhianna-pratchetts-stories-from-the-tomb-raider-reboot">a character first introduced in 2013's Tomb Raider reboot</a> - would be a part of the next series.</p></div>
