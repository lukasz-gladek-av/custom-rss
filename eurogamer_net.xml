            <p>Having Mario Kart World include a roster of characters from other Nintendo series would have been "incongruous".</p>
<p>That's according to Mario Kart World producer Kosuke Yabuki, who recently discussed why the likes of Legend of Zelda's silent hero Link and Animal Crossing's Isabelle weren't part of the game's line up of racers, as they were in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/mario-kart-world-nintendo-characters/">Nintendo Everything</a>, Yabuki told Ouest-France the inclusion of characters from other games in the Mario Kart World universe would have been both "incongruous" and, quite simply, unnecessary.</p>
<p>"It didn't seem necessary, given everything we could already do with Mario," Yabuki <a href="https://www.ouest-france.fr/gaming/super-mario/mario-kart/exclusif-mario-kart-world-le-producteur-kosuke-yabuki-devoile-les-secrets-de-sa-creation-0650c104-3ba2-11f0-88b0-943c4d024772">told the publication</a> (via machine translation). "We inevitably wonder how players will perceive this cast. But there are so many characters and so many costumes that there's sure to be something for everyone."</p>
<p>Now, this isn't to say that Mario Kart World doesn't include new characters along with the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Peach, Bowser, Luigi and other regular faces in the Switch 2's launch title</a>. It's just that these characters - such as the Piantas from Sunshine and of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cows-are-taking-over-mario-kart-world">course the Moo Moo Meadows Cow</a> - are <em>already </em>part of the Mario universe.</p>
<p>Yabuki said the Mario Kart World team always hoped these characters would "be a good surprise for players", and the "welcome was so warm that it surprised even us". As for the developer's personal favourite racer, well like us the producer has a bit of a soft spot for Cow.</p>

<p>Nintendo's approach is in contrast to Sega's forthcoming rival <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-might-be-the-most-mechanically-rich-kart-racer-ever-made-hands-on">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, which will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hatsune-miku-personas-joker-and-minecrafts-steve-join-the-roster-for-sonic-crossworlds">include plenty of characters from outside the Sonic universe</a> - including Hatsune Miku, Steve from Minecraft, and Spongebob Squarepants.</p>
<p>If you are still on the fence about giving Mario Kart World a spin, be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-review">sure to check out Eurogamer's review</a>, where our Tom said how the game "offers neat twists on the classic Mario Kart formula", calling it all "entertaining, snackable, fun".</p>
<p>Or, if you are already familiar with the bones of Mario Kart World, but need a little hand to get a bit more out of it (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unlocking-mirror-mode-in-mario-kart-world-is-so-obtuse-even-nintendo-got-the-details-wrong">like unlocking that infamous Mirror Mode</a>, for example), you can check out our guides.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a>, the producer of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>, has hinted a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> version of the game could be on the way.</p>
<p>During a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg-LRoukGVo&amp;t=12158s">livestream update</a> for MMORPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> on Friday, the development team shared release details for the newly available Xbox version of Final Fantasy 16.</p>
<p>Yoshida then commented: "Just Nintendo left" (shared on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-port-of-ffxvi-hinted-at-by-naoki-yoshida-and-kazutoyo-maehiro.1224171/">ResetEra</a>). The game's creative director Kazutoyo Maehiro then replied he "will do his best".</p>

<p>Of course, this could just be a passing joke, but it certainly appears to be hinting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> is considering a Switch 2 version of the latest in the mainline series.</p>
<p>Not only would this follow the Xbox version, but it would follow the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/full-final-fantasy-7-remake-series-heading-to-switch-2-director-suggests">Final Fantasy 7 Remake games also coming to Switch 2</a> - all as part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Square Enix's multiplatform strategy</a>.</p>
<p>Two questions remain, though: would Final Fantasy 16 run on Switch 2? And would it sell?</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjmzmgeqFYA">Digital Foundry reported</a>, the Xbox Series X/S version of Final Fantasy 16 has issues with a softer resolution implemented in order to secure a stable frame rate. It's unclear how the lower powered Switch 2 would be able to handle the game, especially in handheld mode.</p>
<p>It's also <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/06/final-fantasy-16-may-have-underperformed-on-ps5-but-its-doing-terribly-on-xbox">been reported</a> Final Fantasy 16 has not sold well on Xbox Series X/S so far, although Square Enix is yet to officially comment.</p>
<p>As such, while Square Enix's multiplatform strategy will certainly open up its games to more sales, perhaps there just isn't enough interest in Final Fantasy 16 specifically at this point, two years after its initial PS5 release. Maybe <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-and-final-fantasy-7-remake-are-finally-on-xbox-but-is-it-too-late">sales would have been stronger with a multiplatform launch</a>, though of course this still would not have factored in Switch 2.</p>
<p>Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-third-party-sales-reportedly-very-low-despite-record-breaking-console-launch">third-party games are reportedly not selling well on Switch 2</a> as Nintendo's own games - in this instance Mario Kart World - are dominating the system. We'll have to see how Final Fantasy 7 Remake sells on the system later this year to gauge how Final Fantasy 16 may fare.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-producer-hints-at-possible-switch-2-version]]></content:encoded>
