            <p>
Ousted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> studio founder Charlie Cleveland has hit back at claims made by former employer Krafton in a newly unsealed court document, accusing the publisher of deliberately hindering the Subnautica 2 project in order to avoid paying out a $250m bonus.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, Krafton announced Cleveland - alongside chief executive officer Ted Gill and special projects director Max McGuire - had all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-leadership-replaced-by-krafton-despite-looming-early-access">departed Subnautica studio Unknown Worlds</a>, but insisted it had "sought to keep the... co-founders and original creators of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> series involved in the game's development". Shortly after, though, it was claimed the team had been "pushed out", and that the move was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-delayed-by-publisher-krafton-just-months-before-alleged-250m-payout-to-developers">part of a plan by Krafton to avoid paying out a $250m bonus</a> for the development team.
</p>
<p>
The report was followed by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-delayed-by-publisher-krafton-just-months-before-alleged-250m-payout-to-developers">delay for Subnautica 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-drama-escalates-ousted-developers-launch-legal-action-as-krafton-accuses-them-of-abandoning-project">Krafton's own statement</a>, insisting Unknown Worlds' leadership team had "abandoned" their responsibilities. Specifically, the publisher said it had "asked [Cleveland] to devote himself to... Subnautica 2" but, "instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project".

<p>
However, as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-16/-subnautica-2-leaders-say-krafton-sabotaged-game-over-payout">reported by Bloomberg</a>, a lawsuit against Krafton, filed for breach of contract by Unknown Worlds' former leadership team, claims that Cleveland was, in fact, working on a Subnautica movie the publisher is said to have specifically asked the studio to develop. Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier later <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lu4as2noxc2b">noted on social media</a> that "Cleveland was also working on some sort of AI Christmas film, which Krafton was likely referring to. They just didn't mention the Subnautica film part of it."
</p>
<p>
As for the $250m bonus that increasingly appears to be at the centre of Krafton's fallout with the former leadership team, the lawsuit alleges things began to turn sour in early 2025, when Gill started negotiating bonuses for employees who weren't eligible under the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-company-krafton-buys-subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds">acquisition</a> terms. In one part of the complaint reviewed by Bloomberg, it's claimed: "After Krafton's leaders reviewed Gill's projections and evaluated the anticipated revenue and earnout numbers, everything changed."
</p>
<p>
It's alleged the combination of Subnautica's release on mobile and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, alongside the impending early access launch of Subnautica 2, meant the studio was now presenting Krafton with revenue projections significantly higher than Unknown Worlds' initial conservative estimates. It's claimed this is the point Krafton began pushing to delay Subnautica 2 into 2026, halted its publishing duties - including marketing and localisation - and refused to support Subnautica 2's planned summer release.
</p>
<p>
The lawsuit also alleges a senior Krafton executive told Gill "pulling these resources was a permissible way for [the company] to avoid supporting the earnout", and that Krafton later asked Unknown Worlds' leadership to accept a lower sum. It's around this time Krafton head Changhan Kim is alleged to have written to Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire describing Subnautica 2's progress as "slow and underwhelming", and accusing them of "failing to fulfil [their] responsibilities". This is despite the complaint's claim that pre-release tests for Subnautica 2 "drew high marks and confirmed that the game was ready to meet... lofty expectations."
</p>
<p>
According to Bloomberg, Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire are now seeking damages "in an amount to be determined at trial" following their termination.
</p>
<p>
All this comes after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-latest-subnautica-2-twist-krafton-confirms-this-leaked-internal-review-document-is-real">mysterious leak of an internal Krafton review document</a> this weekend, claiming Subnautica 2's planned early access release lacked "the freshness and volume expected of a sequel", and fell "short of meeting... high expectations". Almost immediately after, Krafton took the unusual step of announcing, unprompted, that the document was real, claiming that doing so would 'minimise speculation and ensure accurate communication with players'. It seems likely we'll hear again from Krafton soon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The credits for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> have shined a light on the game's voice cast, including one actor who is reprising his role from the Japanese dub of Super Mario Bros. Movie.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of cast spoilers for Donkey Kong Bananza below.</strong></p>

<p>Donkey Kong's emotive grunts and the like in Donkey Kong Bananza are all voiced by Kouji Takeda, who is credited as the game's main character in all of its various language options (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-credits-confirm-dks-new-voice-actor-and-theres-a-fresh-voice-for-pauline-too">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>If you think that name sounds familiar, that's because Takeda has also provided the voice of Donkey Kong in the Japanese dub of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, as well as the Japanese voice of Daruk in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, to name just two.</p>
<p>Takeda also voiced Nintendo's leading ape in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, replacing Takashi Nagasako, who previously voiced Donkey Kong for over two decades. And, DK isn't the only character with a new voice for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> era. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/princess-peach-voice-actor-confirms-shes-been-replaced-after-18-years-in-the-role">Samantha Kelly confirmed she'd been recast as the voice of Princess Peach and Toad after 18 years</a>.</p>
<p>As for Bananza's other lead, Pauline, she is voiced by Jenny Kidd for the English version. The character in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> is voiced by Kate Higgins, however in the Switch platformer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-wont-confirm-donkey-kongs-age-in-new-game-as-its-good-fodder-for-player-theories">Pauline is significantly older than in Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>

            <p>Sega has announced its forthcoming Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds release will have the full game on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> card, unlike many other third-party titles on Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is set for release across other consoles and PC in September, including the original Switch. The Switch 2 version will arrive digitally during this year's holiday season, with the physical version launching "early 2026".</p>
<p>Many third-party publishers have drawn ire from players for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-most-switch-2-third-party-physical-releases-dont-have-the-game-on-the-card">using Nintendo's game-key cards for Switch 2 games</a> - essentially containing a download key instead of the full game. That includes Sega's already-released Sonic x Shadow Generations.</p>

<p>With Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, though, the company has u-turned. "The physical version will feature the full base game on the cartridge," it said in a press release.</p>
<p>The game will cost £64.99 on Switch 2 for the standard edition, and £79.99 for the digital deluxe edition. That compares to £54.99 on the original Switch.</p>
<p>There will also be an upgrade pack for original Switch users, which will carry over progression to the Switch 2 version. An <a href="https://www.sega.com/news/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-faq">FAQ</a> on the game's website states this will be $10 (Eurogamer has asked for clarification on UK pricing), matching the difference between the consoles.</p>
<p>The news was shared along with a new trailer for the game, showing off its customisation options. Players will be able to tweak their vehicles to amend stats and weapon combos (known as gadgets), with Sega boasting over 70,000 unique combinations will be possible.</p>
<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will release across PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC and original Switch on 25th September. The game's unique gimmick allows players to choose how tracks morph into others across each lap, hence its title. That extends to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hatsune-miku-personas-joker-and-minecrafts-steve-join-the-roster-for-sonic-crossworlds">crossovers with other characters</a>, including Joker from Persona 5 and Ichiban from the Like A Dragon games, as well as vocaloid artist Hatsune Miku and Steve from Minecraft.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson stated the game "might be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-might-be-the-most-mechanically-rich-kart-racer-ever-made-hands-on">most mechanically rich kart racer ever made</a>" after going hands-on.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-will-buck-third-party-switch-2-trend-with-full-game-on-card]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Charlie Guillemot has addressed concerns of nepotism after being named co-CEO of Ubisoft's new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>-funded subsidiary, following in the footsteps of his father Yves Guillemot.</p>
<p>Ubisoft announced in March it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-new-business-for-assassins-creed-and-other-big-ips-with-116bn-tencent-investment">launching a new subsidiary with €1.16bn of investment from Chinese conglomerate Tencent</a>. This subsidiary will be the home of the company's biggest franchises: Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry.</p>
<p>Now the company has named Christophe Derennes and Charlie Guillemot as co-CEOs. Derennes has spent over 35 years at Ubisoft, co-founded Ubisoft's Montreal studio in 1997, and most recently served as managing director for the company's North American output.</p>

<p>Charlie Guillemot, meanwhile, began his career in 2014 at Owlient, a studio acquired by Ubisoft. The studio's biggest release, mobile game Tom Clancy's Elite Squad, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tom-clancys-elite-squad-shuts-down-a-year-after-launch">shut down a year after launch</a> having failed to find an audience. Before that, the game was embroiled in controversy following accusations of including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-pulls-black-lives-matter-raised-fist-from-new-tom-clancy-game-following-backlash">imagery promoting alt-right Black Lives Matter conspiracy theories</a>.</p>
<p>After this, Guillemot left Ubisoft to co-found <a href="https://www.unagi.games/">Unagi</a>, a company known for Web3 gaming, AI, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a>.</p>
<p>In a press release announcing its new subsidiary co-CEOs, Ubisoft stated: "Charlie Guillemot has built a hybrid career at the intersection of management and innovation. He brings an entrepreneurial perspective and a sharp understanding of evolving industry dynamics and players' expectations, shaped by his experience in game development. With a strong product mindset, deep tech culture, and a passion for games, he represents a new generation of leadership focused on innovation, quality, and putting players at the centre of decision-making."</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/ubisoft-spinoff-ceos-christophe-derennes-charlie-guillemot-1236453661/">Variety</a>, Guillemot then directly addressed any concerns of nepotism, following in the footsteps of his father.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm Yves' son," he said. "That's not something I hide from. But my appointment isn't only about family ties; it's about what Ubisoft needs at this moment."</p>
<p>He continued: "I've spent the last decade building experience both inside and outside Ubisoft, leading teams, managing brands, and navigating change in a fast-moving industry. I also made the conscious choice to step away when it made sense, to learn and grow elsewhere.</p>
<p>"What matters now isn't my name, it's the work ahead. Ubisoft is at a pivotal moment. What's expected of me is to help push the company forward by bringing energy, focus, and by relying on the incredible expertise that already exists across the teams. I see myself as someone here to contribute, support, and help create the right conditions are in place for everyone to do their best work."</p>
<p>In the same interview, the co-CEOs detailed how their roles will complement each other. Guillemot will be "in charge of the 'what'", focusing on creative direction and marketing of the company's brands. Derennes will be focused on production and technology - the "how".</p>
<p>In a separate <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/60h1Sq3PKN8WlNdlic2KLN/ubisoft-announces-christophe-derennes-and-charlie-guillemot-as-coceos-of-new-subsidiary">interview published by Ubisoft</a>, the pair also spoke of opportunities for growth in the games industry today.</p>
<p>"The biggest difference today is that the market is stable, compared to the previous decades in which there were massive disruptions one after the other which brought big changes - I'm thinking of the new console releases and the arrival of online gaming, to name a few," said Guillemot. "Of course, generative AI and cloud are likely to revolutionise game creation and the player experience in the long term, but what really matters today is standing out. That means being able to offer high-quality content, and sometimes that means shorter content, speaking to new generations that consume content in a different way. I'm convinced the industry will face new tech disruptions we can't fully predict yet. And Ubisoft intends to play an active role in shaping that future."</p>
<p>Derennes, meanwhile, spoke of expanding franchises beyond games. "Whether as references, as new ways of telling a story or as ever-expanding transmedia universes, video games' cultural impact as the tenth art is a reality. And this reality is exactly what we aim to capture with this new organisation," he said.</p>
