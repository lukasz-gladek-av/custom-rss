            <p>A popular Nintendo Switch piracy site has been seized by the FBI, as Nintendo continues its crackdown against piracy.</p>
<p>Nsw2u was a repository for Switch ROMs online, meaning players could download games without purchasing them to play on a hacked console or PC emulator. Now, as reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-piracy-nsw2u-roms-fbi-hack-emulator-zelda-1851786034">Kotaku</a>, the site has been taken down in accordance with a seizure warrant from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.</p>
<p>Dutch agency the FIOD, which investigates financial crimes in the Netherlands, was also involved.</p>
<p>The site has been on the EU's piracy watchlist since May of this year, so was blocked by ISPs in several EU countries, as <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/eu-piracy-watchlist-adds-ipfs-fitgirl-and-njalla-250523/">TorrentFreak</a> reported. Now, when attempting to view the site, a notice reads: "This website has been seized".</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Nintendo to clarify its role in seizing the piracy site.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, ahead of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-reserves-the-right-to-brick-your-console-following-unauthorised-use-in-bid-to-prevent-piracy">Nintendo updated its policy against piracy</a> with a severe warning against "unauthorised use" that could result in consoles being bricked.</p>
<p>Indeed, the company has been heavily cracking down on piracy in recent years. Back in March, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-latest-legal-win-against-piracy-significant-for-the-entire-games-industry">won a legal battle against a French file-sharing company</a> it described as "significant... for the entire games industry".</p>
<p>Last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">Switch emulator Yuzu was shut down</a>, with its developer agreeing to pay Nintendo $2.4m in damage.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-rom-site-seized-by-fbi-as-companys-crackdown-against-piracy-continues]]></content:encoded>
