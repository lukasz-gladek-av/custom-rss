            <p>Activision has confirmed that players who own <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> get a 30 percent XP boost in Warzone.</p>
<p>This little nugget of XP insight comes from a new Black Ops 6 and Warzone trailer, which was released yesterday. "Get Black Ops 6 and receive a XP boost in Warzone," the description reads, while the footage itself adds: "Level up faster in Warzone."</p>
<p>The After Action Report screen in Warzone has also been known to advertise a "premium XP boost" for players who purchase Black Ops 6, as noted by Charlie Intel on X.</p>

<p>In addition, Activision has released a fresh set of patch notes for <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-01-patch-notes">Call of Duty: Warzone Season 01</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes">Black Ops 6 Season 01</a>.</p>
<p>Here, it confirmed the Black Ops 6 team has addressed those indefinitely spawning zombies on the Terminus map. It has also issued a number of stability fixes.</p>
<p>In Warzone, meanwhile, the team has sorted an issue that allowed players to redeploy with the Specialist Perk Pack still active, among other tweaks.</p>

<p>"Right now, the world is crying out for a big shooter to come along with some new ideas, to grab the genre and the medium by the collar and give it a good shake, perhaps conjuring up a bit of renewed energy in the process. Its arrival on Game Pass for the first time, effectively buying it an instantly expanded player base, ought to give Call of Duty room to take some creative risks," our Chris wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">Eurogamer's Black Ops 6 multiplayer review</a>.</p>
<p>"But after such a promising campaign, Black Ops 6's multiplayer offering ultimately did the opposite for me, retreating to the safest of spaces in offering tightly confined, purely twitch-based shooting and little else."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-developer-cast-farscape-star-as-morrigan-after-hearing-her-beat-poet-rendition-of-noughties-rap-banger<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Dragon Age fan favourite character Morrigan found her voice after Farscape and Stargate SG-1 actress Claudia Black sent in a demo tape containing a surprising recording. 
</p>
<p>
Medieval poetry? Fantasy literature? No, it was Black giving a beat poet rendition of Smack That by Akon (feat. Eminem).
</p>
<p>
Writing on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lbdpsilhg22c">Bluesky</a>, Dragon Age creator David Gaider today revealed that BioWare had previously wanted Morrigan to be a teenager. There were also plans for the character to be Middle Eastern, though this fell through when legendary actress Shoreh Aghdashloo was no longer available to voice Morrigan's mum Flemeth.

<p>
As plans changed around him, Gaider recalls being given Black's recording and instantly becoming a fan. The rest is history. 
</p>
<p>
As a reminder, here are (some of) the lyrics to Smack That by Akon (feat. Eminem).
</p>
<p>
<em>I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow / Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo? / Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo? / And possibly bend you over? / Look back and watch me</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Smack that, all on the floor / Smack that, give me some more / 
Smack that, 'til you get sore / Smack that, oh</em>
</p>
<p>
"I lost my goddamn mind," Gaider wrote. "Yes, I still have the recording. No, you cannot have it.
</p>
<p>
"Naturally, we jumped on that immediately. As I recall, this was met with resistance from higher up - they had this image of Morrigan as young, like 18 years old (no idea where this came from) and complained that Claudia sounded 'too old'.
</p><p>
"The first two sessions we asked her to pitch her voice up and it was AWFUL. So Caroline [Livingstone, BioWare's veteran VO Director] and I did the sneaky thing, and on the third session we asked her to just... act. Use her natural voice. We loved her performance so much we had the feeling that the team would love it too and forget their nonsense. They did."
</p>
<p>
BioWare recently said that a Dragon Age trilogy remaster "wouldn't be easy", because hardly anyone at the studio still knows how its old engine works. This differs from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, which was made in the still-friendly Unreal Engine.
</p>
<p>
For now, then, there's the excellent Dragon Age Veilguard - in which Morrigan, of course, once again appears. "A fantasy role-playing game of astonishing spectacle," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-rolling-out-cross-save-support-from-today-as-ps5-pro-enhancements-arrive">joined the likes of No Man's Sky</a>, with confirmation it is now playable in 8K resolution on Sony's recently-released <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> console.</p>
<p>If PS5 Pro owners want to see the Dead Space spiritual successor running in 8K (and have the other kit required, such as a suitable TV), they will need to settle for 30fps. If higher framerates are more your thing, however, there is also the option to run the game at 60fps, but in 4K. Whichever you decide, though, developer Striking Distance Studios promises full ray tracing for both.</p>
<p>"Experience The Callisto Protocol like never before with the power of PlayStation 5 Pro," reads the game's latest, PS5 Pro flavoured trailer, announcing the update. You can check it out for yourself below.</p>

<p>Striking Distance Studios was set up by Dead Space alum Glen Schofield. In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-review-a-dead-space-alike-built-on-simpler-pleasures">Eurogamer's Callisto Protocol review</a>, our Vikki acknowledged that while "Dead Space comparisons are impossible to avoid", she felt it made up for some of the missing tension "with production value and bloody-minded fun".</p><p>Despite this, however, The Callisto Protocol reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kraftons-share-price-falls-as-the-callistol-protocol-fails-to-hit-its-sales-target">failed to hit sales targets</a>, which caused publisher Krafton's share prices to fall. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-developer-striking-distance-studios-lays-off-32-employees">Striking Distance subsequently laid off 32 employees</a> in August last year - a month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-departs-callisto-protocol-studio-after-flop">Schofield left the studio</a> "to pursue new opportunities". More recently, Schofield said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-publisher-krafton-insisted-on-releasing-it-too-soon-says-director-glen-schofield">Krafton forced Striking Distance to release the game early</a>.</p>

<p>The statement follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware">yesterday's report Sony is looking to acquire Kadokawa</a>, which would include Dark Souls and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> studio FromSoftware.</p>
<p>Sony already owns the rights to Bloodborne and Demon's Souls, both of which were PlayStation exclusives.</p>
<p>The news has certainly interested Bloodborne fans hoping for some form of re-release, should Sony be in complete control.</p>
<p>It's not just Souls games, though. Kadokawa also owns <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> developer Acquire, Pokémon Mystery Dungeon and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</a> developer Spike Chunsoft, and RPG Maker developer Gotcha Gotcha Games.</p>
<p>Further, Kadokawa is a big name in anime, which would support Sony's growth in the area after acquiring Crunchyroll.</p>
<p>Earlier this year FromSoftware boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-discusses-bloodborne-remake-benefits-of-waiting-for-new-hardware">Hidetaka Miyazaki discussed the interest in a Bloodborne remake</a> with Eurogamer.</p>
<p>"Put simply, it makes me very happy to see it's a title with a lot of specific memories, both for me and the staff who worked on it," he said. "And when we see those passionate voices in the community, of course it makes us feel thrilled, it makes us feel very fortunate to have that and to have those memories."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
