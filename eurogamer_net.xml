            <p>Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> has shared his thoughts on the use of AI in video games, calling it a "tool" but one that can't replace human intention.</p>
<p>Howard sat down with Eurogamer's social producer Mat Jones at an event for the second season of Fallout earlier this week. While much of the discussion focused on the Amazon series, Mat took the chance to ask Howard about AI, which remains a hotly debated topic within the industry.</p>

<p>"I view it as a tool," Howard told Mat. "Creative intention comes from human artists, number one.</p>
<p>"But, I think we look at it as a tool for, is there a way we can use it to help us go through some iterations that we do ourselves faster. Not in generating things, but we are always working on our toolset for how we build our worlds or check things. </p>
<p>"I think if you go back 10 years ago, that version of Photoshop, you wouldn't want to go back to that version of Photoshop."</p>
<p>"That's our view on it," the Bethesda head closed. "But we want to protect the artistry. The human intention of it is what makes our stuff special."</p>
<p>Howard's words come as more and more developers are dipping their toes - or at times their whole foot - into the technology. AI has been used across all levels of game development, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/where-winds-meets-side-quests-can-be-skipped-by-tricking-the-ai-npcs-with-infamous-solid-snake-method">NPCs like those in the recently-released Where Winds Meet</a>.</p>

<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">a report by Unity claimed 62 percent of studios using its tools used AI</a> at some point during game development. In this report, Unity noted animation was the top use case. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-third-of-developers-impacted-by-layoffs-in-last-12-months-according-to-gdc-survey">GDC survey from that same year</a>, meanwhile, reported that around a third of industry workers reported using AI tools already. In 2025, that number is likely to be higher, and a recent Tokyo Games Show survey reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI</a> in development.</p><p>Reports of AI use are continuing to make headlines as we march confidently towards the end of the year. Just this afternoon, publisher Running with Scissors cancelled upcoming game Postal: Bullet Paradise - a co-op "bullet-heaven" first-person shooter from developer Goonswarm Games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/has-caused-extreme-damage-to-our-brand-and-our-company-reputation-running-with-scissors-cancels-postal-bullet-paradise-over-ai-generated-assets-two-days-after-reveal">after feedback to the reveal two days ago said much of the game appeared to have been made using generative AI</a>.</p>
<p>Last month meanwhile, Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney said "AI will be involved in nearly all future production", so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">having Steam games disclose whether they were built with AI makes about as much sense as telling us what kind of shampoo the developers use</a>.</p>

            <p>It's been an unexpectedly rough year for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>. The game, which many assumed would be a massive success after the juggernaut sales of Monster Hunter World, has floundered a little post-launch. Capcom has been eager to point the finger on various factors, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-scuppered-by-high-cost-of-ps5-says-capcom-president">the price of a PS5 being a high barrier to entry</a>, but the fact remains that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-scuppered-by-high-cost-of-ps5-says-capcom-president">the game's sales are lagging behind the ageing Street Fighter 6 and Monster Hunter Rise's DLC</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/of-course-were-not-going-to-stop-here-monster-hunter-developers-talk-about-the-future-of-the-series-at-playstation-awards">IGN</a>, Monster Hunter Wilds director Yuya Tokuda has appealed to players to consider jumping back into the game again, promising various tweaks the devs have made - and are planning to make - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-revised-roadmap">have righted the wrongs</a> the game suffered at launch.</p>

<p>"We analyzed what kind of places beginners were stuck in, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a>," Tokuda explained. “We have worked on these points in turn to make it easier for new users to clear hurdles such as being able to reach certain monsters or to craft certain types of armour.</p><p>"In addition, we have tried to adopt as many new elements as possible that are beneficial for both beginners and existing users, such as Focus Mode. This time, as a result of making the game easy to beat even for new players and players who could not clear it before, I think the difficulty curve was a little lacking for existing users."</p>
<p>This point is notable: many (assumedly now lapsed) players found the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">far too easy</a>, especially by Monster Hunter standards. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-details-next-monster-hunter-wilds-update-as-steam-reviews-continue-overwhelmingly-negative-plunge">The resultant 'overwhelmingly negative' plunge</a> on Steam is partially to blame for the game's lack of stickiness with players, which must have come as something of a shock to Capcom given how loyal MonHun fans typically tend to be.</p>
<p>On the upside, though, various free updates have added more difficult gameplay to the title over the course of the year, and recently we saw a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> crossover go live with an absolute nightmare of an encounter in the form of Omega Planetes - something even end-game veterans struggled to put down.</p>
<p>"If you beat the game immediately after its release and stopped playing, I would appreciate it if you could pick it up again."</p>
<p>Need more motivation? You're in luck: Capcom today announced the next Monster Hunter Showcase will air on Monday, 8th December 8. The showcase will cover Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 4 and provide us with another look at Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection.</p><p>It'll be broadcast on YouTube and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> at 2 PM PT / 10 PM GMT. So far, we know Monster Hunter Wilds TU4 will re-introduce us Gogmazios (an oil-slicked Elder Dragon we've not seen since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-4-ultimate">Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate</a>), expand end-game content, bring in new weapon buffs, start a new seasonal event, apply performance improvements, and more besides.</p>
<p>It launches on December 16 for all platforms. Just in time for the holidays, then.</p>

            <p>After receiving pushback for its flagrant use of generative AI, Postal: Bullet Paradise has been cancelled… just two days after being revealed.</p>
<p>In a statement from publisher Running With Scissors, the company said the reception to Postal: Bullet Paradise - a co-op "bullet-heaven" first-person shooter from developer Goonswarm Games - had "caused extreme damage" to its brand and reputation.</p>

<p>"We've been overwhelmed with negative responses from our concerned Postal Community," Running with Scissors founder Vince Desi stated today.</p>
<p>The "strong" feedback the publisher recieved said much of the game appeared to have been made using generative AI. "We've always been, and will always be, transparent with our community," Desi continued, adding the publisher's trust in the development team had been "broken".</p>
<p>As such, Running with Scissors has "killed the project", which would have seen players taking on the mantle of one of the Dudes from across the Postal multiverse.</p>
<p>"Since forming Running With Scissors in 1996, we've always said that our fans are part of the team. Our priority is to always do right by the millions who support the Postal franchise. We are grateful for the opportunity to make the games we want to play, and will continue to focus on our new projects and updates coming in 2026 and beyond," the founder closed.</p>
<p>"We can't wait to share more!"</p>
<p>Postal: Bullet Paradise was announced on 3rd December, with a PC release planned for 2026, before an arrival on PlayStation and Switch consoles.</p>

<p>Running with Scissors' decision to cancel Postal: Bullet Paradise comes as more and more companies are using AI technology. Recent examples include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/where-winds-meets-side-quests-can-be-skipped-by-tricking-the-ai-npcs-with-infamous-solid-snake-method">NPC conversations like those in the newly-released Where Winds Meet</a>. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, just yesterday, Supertrick Games - the developer of Let it Die sequel Inferno - released a statement, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-it-die-inferno-developer-responds-to-generative-ai-controversy">after its own use of AI caused a bit of a stir earlier in the week</a>.</p>
