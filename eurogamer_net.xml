            <p>
Civilization 7 players say they can hear coughing and grunting while browsing the game's Age Transition screen - and now publisher 2K has acknowledged the issue. 
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1ij1clt/you_can_hear_a_person_coughing_and_typing_on_a/">lengthy reddit thread discussing the problem</a> includes examples of strange audio clips that players have recorded - and yes, you can clearly hear something going on in the background, behind the Age Transition menu's soaring orchestral music. 
</p>
<p>
"I thought maybe I'd left a stream on or was somehow in a Discord call," one player reported, "but I double-checked and no. You can really hear a person clearing their throat and coughing throughout the music. I'm not sure how this is even possible but it's kind of hilarious if you ask me."
</p>
<p>
Other examples uploaded to YouTube include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/clip/Ugkxa4lknNnwAGn-x5jMADoovq8ix8SxiSbn">snippets of characters grunting</a>, or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeYvr1q4Ev8&amp;ab_channel=HansAnonymous">sounds of swordfighting</a>.

<p>But rather than the game's actual music track being taped over by someone with a sore throat, 2K has said a more benign reason is likely to blame.</p>
<p>
"During an Age Transition, players might hear strange noises," a 2K spokesperson confirmed, in a <a href="https://support.civilization.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/38315115956371-Audio-from-the-Main-Menu-plays-during-Age-Transition">post on the official Civilization support site</a>. "This is likely due to the audio from the Main Menu being played over Age Transition screens.
</p>
<p>
"This means you may hear short voice lines, shuffling around, and general idle noises while on the Age Transition menu."
</p>
<p>
Other players report hearing audio from the leader they're playing as looping in the background, including mumbling and clothes rustling.
</p>
<p>
Earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firaxis-acknowledges-civilization-7-issues-fixes-incoming">Firaxis issued a blog post acknowledging Civilization 7's mixed response from players so far</a>, and pledging a raft of updates designed to address key community-requested changes and features. 
</p>
<p>
These will include improvements to UI interactions and map readability, as well as adding Teams to multiplayer games and adding in hotseat multiplayer.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review">Eurogamer's Civilization 7 review</a> described it as "a competent entry with some poorly executed ideas and a striking lack of personality".

<p>It seems few areas of the company are unscathed, with job losses reported across esports, community, design, QA, marketing, and UI/UX.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately the UI/UX team was impacted by the Hi-Rez layoffs today - myself included," said UI/UX designer, Amanda.</p>
<p>"It has been an amazing journey to go from fan of a game to creating content for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/smite">Smite</a> and Paladins. I have had the honour of working with some immensely talented humans!"</p>
<p>These cuts come on top of a similar round of cuts back in October, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/smite-2-studio-hi-rez-lays-off-undisclosed-number-of-employees">Hi-Rez announced it was laying off an undisclosed number of employees</a> in order to "ensure [the company's] long-term success".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Trading card and video game behemoth Magic: The Gathering is set to get the cinematic universe treatment, courtesy of owner Hasbro and production company Legendary Entertainment. 
</p>
<p>
Plans for a Magic: The Gathering movie and TV series are already afoot, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/magic-the-gathering-legendary-hasbro-film-tv-universe-1236280886/">Deadline</a> reported, though details for now remain thin on the ground. 
</p>
<p>
"This is an exciting and complementary partnership, uniting one of the world's most iconic brands with a powerful and proven steward," said Hasbro film boss Zev Foreman. 
</p>
<p>
"Magic: The Gathering has inspired decades of epic world-building and creative storytelling. It is a perfect match for Legendary's diversified approach to marquee IP, and we are excited to work together to build a whole new Magic: The Gathering universe."
</p>
<p>
Legendary is no stranger to video game adaptations, having previously been involved in the Warcraft movie and Pokémon: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detective-pikachu">Detective Pikachu</a>, as well as the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/movies/minecraft">A Minecraft Movie</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We pride ourselves on being thoughtful caretakers of singular, beloved IP, and no property better fits that description than Magic: The Gathering," Legendary chairman of worldwide production Mary Parent added. 
</p>
<p>
"Alongside the fantastic Hasbro team, we look forward to creating a multimedia universe that thrills longstanding fans and creates a broad wave of new ones."
</p>
<p>
When exactly we'll see anything from the Magic Cinematic Universe release is another question, however. And what about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/magic-the-gathering-designer-opens-up-about-crossover-criticism">Magic's own big crossovers, which have seen everything from Fortnite to Fallout and Doctor Who turn up as collectible trading cards</a>? Could some of those turn up also?

            <p>
Wario Land 4 will arrive next week as part of the Nintendo Switch Online catalogue, if you're an Expansion Pack subscriber. 
</p>
<p>
It's been some time since Nintendo last added a GBA game to its Switch Online service - all the way back to October 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-f-zero-games-headed-to-switch-online-including-previously-japan-only-release">when a couple of F-Zero titles turned up</a>.
</p>
<p>
Next week, on 14th February, you'll be able to play Wario Land 4. Originally launched in 2001, this is the final handheld Wario Land game starring Nintendo's antihero, before he got a new job fronting the fast-paced microgame WarioWare series.
</p>
<p>
If you've played Wario Land 3, much of the gameplay here will seem familiar - though Wario now has a health bar, and running out of HP will mean losing all your collectibles in a level and starting afresh.

<p>
There are also hints here to Wario's microgame future - some of Wario Land 4's assets and music were re-used or re-mixed in WarioWare, which debuted 18 months later, while the game also features a handful of familiar-looking minigames.

Take-Two has said it "fully expects" to support <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>, and indicated that no game was off the table for Nintendo's next console.
</p>
<p>
Speaking last night during Take-Two's latest financial results call, as heard by Eurogamer, company boss Strauss Zelnick was questioned about the extent to which Switch 2 would see games from the Borderlands, Mafia and GTA publisher.
</p>
<p>
And while Zelnick stopped short of confirming any particular title for Switch 2, he did take time to note that Take-Two's thinking around Nintendo's audience had changed.

<p>
"We've had obviously a long-standing relationship with Nintendo," Zelnick began, "and we've supported the platform when it made sense for the individual release. 
</p>
<p>
"There was a time when Nintendo platforms are really geared at younger audiences and that was reflected in our release schedule. And now today with Switch and potentially with Switch 2, the Switch device can support any audience. 
</p>
<p>
"As you may have noted, Civilization 7 is now on Switch. So while we have nothing specific to report, we actually would fully expect to support Switch [2]."
</p>
<p>
Does Switch 2 have the technical prowess to run <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>? That's another matter. Alternatively, you could see Take-Two eyeing up the Switch audience as yet another avenue from which to boost the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-has-now-sold-a-staggering-210m-copies">already enormous sales of GTA 5 and GTA Online</a>.
</p>
<p>As for Rockstar's next game in the series, last night we heard confirmation that the hugely-anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">GTA 6 is still on track - for now - to launch in the autumn of 2025</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As Civilization 7 has launched into early access ahead of its full release next week, developer Firaxis has acknowledged issues with the game highlighted by the "passionate community".</p>
<p>On <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/#app_reviews_hash">Steam</a>, the game has received plenty of negative reviews complaining about its poor UI and lack of features, and currently sits with a Mixed rating. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review">Eurogamer's Civilization 7  review</a> described it as "a competent entry with some poorly executed ideas and a striking lack of personality".</p>
<p>Now, Firaxis has identified three areas it's looking to improve in a <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/message-from-firaxis-games/">new update post</a>, with a full roadmap due soon.</p>

<p>The biggest priority is improving the UI, Firaxis said. "We need some time to digest all of your feedback, but some areas that we're already looking into include making UI interactions more intuitive, improving map readability, fixing areas of polish like formatting, and more," it explained.</p>
<p>Next up are community-requested features, which will be added in free updates. These will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding Teams to multiplayer games so you can play cooperatively</li>
<li>Allowing full player counts in multiplayer in all three Ages through refinements to our Distant Lands system.</li>
<li>Allowing you to pick your starting and ending Age to allow for single or double Age games</li>
<li>Providing a wider variety of map types</li>
<li>Enabling city and religion names to be customized</li>
<li>Adding in hotseat multiplayer</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, Patch 1.1.0 is already due for March, which will include quality of life changes to UI, AI balance, adjustments to diplomacy, and bug fixes.</p>
<p>"We will support Civilization 7 for years to come, and your feedback remains critical in helping us grow and build the future of Civ," the post concludes.</p>
<p>Civilization 7 is the latest in the long-running strategy series, which entered early access earlier this week for those who bought its Deluxe or Founders editions. Its full release will be next week, 11th February.</p>
