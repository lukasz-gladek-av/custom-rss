            <p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has launched an investigation into Roblox.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/sec-confirms-game-service-roblox-part-of-active-investigation">Bloomberg</a>, while the investigation is ongoing, the exact focus of the SEC's probing remains unclear. The commission did however acknowledge the investigation was active, and said it could not currently share full details to ensure there was "no harm to the ongoing enforcement proceeding".</p>
<p>The SEC was established after the 1929 Wall Street crash in a bid to protect American citizens from market manipulation. It requires public companies to submit quarterly and annual reports, as well as investigate possible violations of the securities laws.</p>

<p>"We have confirmed with Division of Enforcement staff that there are responsive emails between Enforcement staff referencing Roblox and that these emails are a part of an active and ongoing investigation," an SEC spokesperson told Bloomberg, via a Freedom of Information request: </p>
<p>Bloomberg suggests - though it is not confirmed - that the investigation may pertain to November's report that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/damning-roblox-report-claims-company-inflates-player-numbers-to-investors-by-as-much-as-42">Roblox misled investors by falsely reporting player numbers, and has highlighted yet more examples of inappropriate - and allegedly, illegal - content being shared via the platform</a>.</p>
<p>In response to November's report, Roblox said at the time that it "rejects" its findings and pointed to previously-released details of its efforts to try and combat inappropriate content. It also stressed that it had previously acknowledged that "fraud and unauthorised access to [its] platform may contribute, from time to time, to an overstatement of DAUs".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-shares-drop-by-20-as-platform-misses-target-active-users">Roblox shares dropped by 20 percent last week</a> after the platform's reported daily active users fell short of analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>For the fourth quarter (ending 31st December), the number of daily active users fell by four percent to 85.3 million compared to the previous quarter. Wall Street analysts had forecasted 88.4 million. Overall player engagement also declined by 9.7 percent in the same period to 18.7bn hours.</p>

            <p>Sega and Like a Dragon developer Ryu ga Gotoku are asking fans to select from 100 merchandise ideas from the series to be made a reality, including a karaoke microphone, themed underwear, and a traffic cone.</p>
<p>It's all in celebration of Like a Dragon's 20th anniversary on 8th December 2025, with fans able to vote once per day on a <a href="https://20th-fangoods.ryu-ga-gotoku.com/">special celebration website</a> for the virtual item they want to see actually produced .</p>
<p>There are 100 items to choose from, taken from across the game series, ranging from the obvious, to the iconic, to the downright bizarre.</p>

<p>Themed cosmetics, pens, stamps, incense, and various items of apparel would be easy to reproduce, but I'd argue are fairly boring choices for a series known for its outlandish characters and side quests.</p>
<p>Better yet are karaoke instruments (from the memorable minigame), a Sujimon card set (from that other minigame), Ichiban Confectionery's rice crackers (yes, from a minigame), or a Michio Ono figure (you guessed it...).</p>
<p>No doubt the Majima body pillow will be a popular choice, as will character lingerie, and various themed underpants.</p>
<p>A Like a Dragon board game is intriguing, presuming it's fully playable, as would a Ryu ga Gotoku recipe book considering all the delicious in-game food throughout the series.</p>
<p>No doubt the Big Pylon will win, though - it's literally a traffic cone that's formed a running gag since the first game.</p>
<p>The first Yakuza game was released on PS2 in 2005 in Japan, followed by an international release the following year. The series has more recently taken on its Japanese name Like a Dragon.</p>
<p>After last year's celebrated Infinite Wealth, which had the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-is-series-biggest-steam-launch-to-date"> series' most successful launch on Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-hits-1m-sales-in-first-week">hit 1m sales in its first week</a>, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is set to launch later this month on 21st February.

            <p>Diablo creator David Brevik has shared his distaste for some aspects in current ARPGs, and said that when the journey to levelling up is shortened "you've cheapened the entire experience".</p>
<p>Brevik, now head of indie publisher Skystone Games, spoke to <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/diablo-creator-david-brevik-doesnt-vibe-with-todays-rapid-arpgs/">VideoGamer</a> about his career and his thoughts on the ARPG genre. Brevik was co-founder and president of Blizzard North and served as lead programmer and senior designer on Diablo, and project and design lead on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-ii">Diablo 2</a>.</p>
<p>In the interview, Brevik criticised the speed at which games today offer player progression, which he believes spoils the pacing.</p>

<p>"I think that RPGs in general have started to lean into this: kill swathes of enemies all over the place extremely quickly," said Brevik. "Your build is killing all sorts of stuff so you could get more drops, you can level up, and the screen is littered with stuff you don't care about."</p>
<p>Enemy counts in the original Diablo games were notably high for the time, but Brevik believes modern games have learned the wrong lesson.</p>
<p>"I don't find that as kind of personal and realistic as like Diablo 2. The pacing on Diablo 2, I think is great," he said. "That's one of the reasons it's endured. I just don't find killing screen-fulls of things instantly and mowing stuff down and walking around the level and killing everything, very enticing. I just don't feel like that is a cool experience. I find it kind of silly.</p>
<p>"When you're shortening that journey and making it kind of ridiculous. You've cheapened the entire experience, in my opinion."</p>
<p>While Brevik's comments apply to the recent Diablo games, it also arguably applies to the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lost-ark">Lost Ark</a>. And MMOs also suffer from similar faults.</p>
<p>"I think that MMOs have definitely pushed in that direction," said Brevik. "How fast can you level? How fast can you kill everything? It's all about speed and things like that, but, in reality, I just think that makes a kind of a worse experience. And I tend to shy away from that direction."</p>
<p>Blizzard has followed the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> with a number of seasons and major expansion Vessel of Hatred to extend its longevity, while also battling with endgame imbalances. The expansion's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-dlc-boosts-steam-players-to-record-high-despite-rocky-launch">launch in October last year was rocky</a> but still led to a boost in Steam players.</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-first-major-patch-brings-big-changes-to-endgame-content">received a major patch last month</a> after its early access release in December, which made big changes to its endgame.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
PlayStation owners impacted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-psn-is-still-down-after-12-hours">this weekend's major PSN outage</a> have criticised Sony's apology offer, as well as the lack of explanation on what went wrong. 
</p>
<p>
The latest period of PSN downtime lasted nearly 24 hours, beginning early Friday evening here in the UK. When the service did return, Sony apologised and blamed a vague "operational issue" as the cause.
</p>
<p>
Compensation for the outage amounts to five additional days for anyone with a PS Plus subscription, but nothing for others who were also locked out of playing digital games. 
</p>

<p>
Not all online games require PS Plus, of course - including free-to-play behemoths like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and Roblox - and access to these was also unavailable.
</p>
<p>
"Everything was down," <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-playstation-plus-members-will-automatically-receive-an-additional-5-days-of-service-for-the-psn-outage.1104324/page-3#post-135525930">one impacted user wrote on ResetEra</a>. "People that game share (like me) were locked out of their entire digital library, including offline games. You didn't need PS Plus to be affected."
</p>
<p>
"I don't have PS Plus but still couldn't play the games I wanted to," opined another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1il7ibh/sony_is_giving_some_compensation/">impacted user on reddit</a>. "Guess I'm a f***ing second class citizen."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Sony to ask if the company plans any other form of compensation, and to ask again about the cause of this weekend's outage. 
</p>
<p>
PlayStation fans have been left in the dark about the root cause of the downtime - and what steps Sony is now taking to ensure it is not repeated again anytime soon.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Valve has implemented new rules around advertising, explicitly prohibiting games that force players to watch in-game ads.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/advertising">new rules from Valve</a> - available online and first reported by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/valve-ban-advertising-based-business-models-on-steam-no-forced-adverts-like-in-mobile-games/">Gaming on Linux</a> - confirm that whilst cross-promotion and product placement are permitted, games that force players to watch or engage with advertising in order to play are not.</p>
<p>Nor should developers use advertising as a "way to provide value to players, such as giving players a reward for watching or engaging with advertising in their game".</p>

<p>"Developers should not utilise paid advertising as a business model in their game, such as requiring players to watch or otherwise engage with advertising in order to play, or gating gameplay behind advertising," the rules explain.</p>
<p>"If your game's business model relies on advertising on other platforms, you will need to remove those elements before shipping on Steam. Some options you could consider include switching to a single purchase 'paid app', or making your game free to play with optional upgrades sold via Microtransactions or Downloadable Content (DLC)."</p>
<p>Whilst I suspect most of us would associate this kind of behaviour with mobile games more than those available on Steam, Valve clearly thought it necessary to clarify, in clear English, "what is and is not supported on Steam".</p>
<p>Developers are also not allowed to charge other developers for access to Steam features, such as sale pages, bundles, store fronts, or franchise pages.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-now-includes-a-warning-flagging-potentially-abandoned-early-access-games">Valve quietly implmented a useful new Steam feature</a> warning users - and potential purchasers - how long it's been since an early access game last received an update.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Dragon Quest 12 is still in development, series creator Yuji Horii has confirmed.</p>
<p>The latest in the long-running RPG series was first announced back in 2021 but little has been seen since beyond the initial teaser trailer.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, though, Horii held a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfikAAlgNsw">livestream</a> with this radio show group KosoKoso Hōsō Kyoku (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/dragon-quest-12-is-still-fully-in-development-new-information-to-be-revealed-little-by-little-says-series-creator/">Automaton</a>) where he confirmed the development team is "working hard on Dragon Quest 12".</p>

<p>Further details are expected to be released little by little, though nothing more was revealed at this time.</p>
<p>Back in May last year, <a href="https://x.com/YujiHorii/status/1794984625107832939">Horii also acknowledged Dragon Quest 12</a> on social media, stating the development team wanted to make a game "worthy of the final contributions of the two people who passed away".</p>
<p>Those two people are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tributes-shared-as-dragon-ball-creator-akira-toriyama-passes-away">Dragon Quest character designer Akira Toriyama</a> and composer Koichi Sugiyama, who had worked on every game in the series before their deaths.</p>
<p>Horii's comments came shortly after Dragon Quest series producer <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-yu-miyake-stepping-down-as-producer-on-dragon-quest">Yu Miyake stepped down from his role</a> to oversee <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s mobile game division, putting Dragon Quest 12's development into question.</p>
<p>Now, in his livestream, Horii apologised for confusion around the game's development and denied it had been cancelled.</p>
