            <p>Troy Baker has had many video game roles over the years. He is Indiana Jones in The Great Circle, he is Sam Drake in the Uncharted series, he is Booker Dewitt in Bioshock, he is Higgs in Death Stranding… The list goes on (and on and on and on).</p>
<p>One of his most famous roles, though, is Joel in The Last of Us. Baker portrayed the cynical smuggler turned surrogate father in 2013's original release, before reprising his role in 2020's sequel. But, while Joel may have elevated Baker's career, the actor has admitted he was "woefully unprepared" for the part.</p>

<p>During a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe0xVuIcxMw">Q&amp;A at GalaxyCon New Orleans 2025</a>, Baker was asked if playing Joel had affected him personally, to which Baker jokingly quipped "you're trying to make me cry". He then elaborated on his role further, saying it had affected him "deeply" in many different ways.</p>
<p>"There's nothing worse, and I hope that no one ever feels this… [but] do you ever show up to something and go 'I am so woefully unprepared for this'? And, it's not imposter syndrome, it's a fact. You are not equipped to do the thing that you are about to do," Baker said. "You could be like, 'let's go bungie jumping!', and then you get on the platform and you go, 'I can't do this'. That was The Last of Us for me. You get the gig, and then you go, 'oh no, I have to deliver this'."</p>
<p>Baker recalled going through the script and pitch in the early days of The Last of Us with the development team and his co-star Ashley Johnson, who plays Ellie in the games. During a break, Baker turned to Johnson and said: "'Do you realise that if this thing sucks, it's our fault?'"</p>
<p>He noted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> already had had great success with its Uncharted games, and the studio now knew the story it wanted to tell next. "We knew that what they were going to make was going to be good," Baker recalled, so now the pressure was on him and Johnson to deliver a worthy performance.</p>
<p>The Last of Us "taught me how to be a better actor", Baker continued. "It taught me how to stop trying to convince people that I could act, and just realise that Joel has no idea that he's in a game, and he's just in a moment in his life. And, I took that lesson, and I apply it all the way across."</p>

<p>Baker more recently starred in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, where he reprised his role of Higgs. Earlier this month, he was also announced as the voice of Jack Pepper, <a href="https://x.com/mousethegame/status/1944561535625605444">the lead protagonist of Mouse: P.I. for Hire</a>.</p>
<p>As for Naughty Dog and The Last of Us, the studio recently announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-want-yet-another-way-to-experience-the-last-of-us-games-theres-a-new-script-book-on-the-way">book containing the video game scripts for both of Naughty Dog's games</a>, including the first game's Left Behind DLC, is being released. Away from its post-apocalyptical series, it also working on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-online-backlash-prompted-naughty-dogs-next-star-to-get-bootcamp-ing-from-neil-druckmann">which stars Tati Gabrielle as bounty hunter Jordan A Mun</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/troy-baker-wasnt-ready-for-the-last-of-us-admits-he-was-woefully-unprepared-for-playing-joel]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> has passed 5m copies sold, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a> has soared past 10m downloads, FromSoftware has announced.
</p>
<p>This duo of big milestones was announced on the official <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1948382858109698175">Elden Ring X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, alongside a lovely piece of custom art featuring the two games. The post reads: "The flame of thy passion burns ever bright in these shadowed lands. To all who wander the Lands Between, we offer our deepest thanks."</p>
<p>It was only in early June that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">FromSoftware celebrated Nightreign passing 3.5 million players</a> for its Soulslike PvE twist on the battle royale genre. Since its release, Nightreign has seen a consistant stream of updates and fixes. This includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-round-of-everdark-sovereigns-will-arrive-at-the-end-of-the-month-but-still-no-sign-of-duo-mode">the addition of Everdark Sovereigns</a>, even harder variations of the game's end-of-run bosses.

<p>Smaller patches have made notable improvements to the game's rough edges too. A tweak to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-maintenance-makes-matchmaking-less-of-a-headache">how remembrances work removed the barriers they presented</a> with matchmaking online. In addition, soon after Nightreign's release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-is-now-easier-for-solo-players">solo runs were made easier in response to player feedback</a>.</p>
<p>The stage is now set for FromSoftware's future projects. Namely, the developer revealed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> exclusive: The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-duskbloods">Duskbloods</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-is-bloodborne-meets-sekiro-meets-dark-souls-with-jetpacks-and-dinos-thrown-in">Revealed during the April Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a>, it's a multiplayer PvPvE game that's another drastic shift away from the company's usual formula. There's also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-reportedly-in-advanced-development-on-an-unannounced-project-alongside-the-duskbloods">another unnanounced project we don't know too much about, but is reportedly deep in development</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-has-sold-over-5-million-copies-while-shadow-the-the-erdtree-makes-it-past-10-million-at-last]]></content:encoded>

            <p>"Microsoft is thriving," said CEO and chairman Satya Nadella in a new statement following a round of layoffs earlier this month that cost 9000 employees their jobs.</p>
<p>The statement, <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/24/recommitting-to-our-why-what-and-how/">shared publicly and with Microsoft employees</a>, reiterates the company mission, with Nadella doubling down on the importance of AI.</p>
<p>First, he acknowledged the layoffs. "I want to express my sincere gratitude to those who have left," he said. "Their contributions have shaped who we are as a company, helping build the foundation we stand on today. And for that, I am deeply grateful."</p>
<p>He continued: "I also want to acknowledge the uncertainty and seeming incongruence of the times we're in. By every objective measure, Microsoft is thriving - our market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right. We're investing more in CapEx than ever before. Our overall headcount is relatively unchanged, and some of the talent and expertise in our industry and at Microsoft is being recognised and rewarded at levels never seen before. And yet, at the same time, we've undergone layoffs.</p>
<p>"This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value. Progress isn't linear. It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding. But it's also a new opportunity for us to shape, lead through, and have greater impact than ever before."</p>
<p>It's clear that AI is now at the heart of Microsoft, as Nadella stated its three business priorities are security, quality, and AI transformation. "We are doubling down on the fundamentals while continuing to define new frontiers in AI," he said.</p>
<p>"What does empowerment look like in the era of AI? It's not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It's about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools. That's the shift we are driving - from a software factory to an intelligence engine empowering every person and organisation to build whatever they need to achieve."</p>
<p>Discussing company culture, Nadella stated: "Growth mindset has served us well over the last decade - the everyday practice of being a learn-it-all, not a know-it-all. It has reshaped our culture and helped us lead with greater humility and empathy. We need to keep that."</p>
<p>He continued: "It might feel messy at times, but transformation always is. Teams are reorganising. Scopes are expanding. New opportunities are everywhere. It reminds me of the early '90s, when PCs and productivity software became standard in every home and every desk! That’s exactly where we are now with AI.</p>
<p>"Years from now, when you look back at your time here, I hope you'll say: 'That's when I learned the most. That's when I made my biggest impact. That's when I was part of something transformational'.</p>
<p>"What we've learned over the past five decades is that success is not about longevity. It's about relevance. Our future won't be defined by what we've built before, but by what we empower others to build now."</p>
<p>Nadella's statement comes three weeks after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">over 9000 employees were laid off from the company</a>, which Microsoft told Eurogamer was "necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace".</p>
<p>While the total number of laid off employees in gaming positions is unknown, the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">The Initiative's Perfect Dark reboot, and a new ZeniMaz MMORPG</a> were cancelled.</p>
<p>Roughly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/candy-crush-developer-king-reportedly-replacing-laid-off-staff-with-ai-tools-they-helped-to-build">200 staff from Candy Crush developer King were laid off</a> and have reportedly been replaced by the AI tools they helped to build. The team at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-motorsport-is-no-more-claims-former-turn-10-employee-following-microsoft-cuts">Turn 10 Studios behind Forza Motorsport is also reportedly "no more"</a>.</p>
<p>The knock-on effect has also resulted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-next-shooter-project-loses-funding-following-microsoft-cuts">funding being cut for Romero Games' next project</a>, though contrary to reports the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-studio-not-closed-as-publishers-express-interest-in-saving-cancelled-game">studio has not closed</a>.</p>
<p>"And, as even AI's biggest proponents will usually admit, it is fundamentally incapable of actually learning anything," wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-absent-landord-execs-are-only-part-of-a-much-bigger-problem">Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell in response to the recent layoffs at Microsoft</a>. "Creative industries such as video games are human ones, existing because of deeply human urges, irrepressible natures and drives. Drives which run in direct opposition to the horrifying inhumanity of the people who run them."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-is-thriving-claims-ceo-doubling-down-on-ai-after-9000-employees-lost-jobs-in-latest-layoffs]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Controversy has rocked a recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> art contest, following accusations that one of the winning entries was made using AI. Capcom has since disqualified the piece in question, pointing to a rule that explicitly bans AI contributions.
</p>
<p>The art piece in question was created by user Lilithascends on X (formerly known as Twitter), who has since deleted their social media accounts following public accusations for other users. In response to these events, Capcom released the following statement on social media and the art contest website:
</p>
<p>"We want to extend a big thanks to everyone who participated in the latest Street Fighter Art Contest New Challenger Edition. Unfortunately, we have determined that one of the winning entries violated contest rules, specifically Section 5 pertaining to: Entry Submission and Design Requirements.

<p>It's worth noting that the section mentioned above - Entry Submission and Design Requirements - outright prohibits the use of AI, and states: "The design must be the Entrant's original creative work which has not been previously published or entered into other competitions."
</p>
<p>The statement from Capcom continues: "After careful review and discussion, we have decided to disqualify the entry in question.
</p>
<p>"Please note that the entry in question will remain available for voting in the Battle Hub until the end of the voting period. We want to thank those who participated in voting for the entry in question. While the entry in question has been disqualified, we will provide a replacement illustration for the featured character at a later date."
</p>
<p>Their art piece was of Kimberly, depicted colourfully in a street-art style. This piece, as well as a number of other community submissions, were eligible for a community vote on which of the chosen pieces would make it into Street Fighter 6's third season. These art contests have been an ongoing community event that has taken place since the launch of Street Fighter 6.
</p>
<p>Social media users who took a look back at the accused artist's prior works, including <a href="https://x.com/chupabaraa/status/1947783583957192894">fellow artist chupabaraa</a>, found prior art pieces that raised red flags for those levying accusations at Lilithascends, including stark similarities to the work of other artists.
</p>
<p>Is there a silver lining to these shenanigans? Well, one lucky person will have their work taking up the now-empty spot in the community art contest, which is nice. We've also seen <a href="https://x.com/click_burgundy/status/1948324713090195850">beloved FGC artist Hungry Clicker</a> put out their own Kimberly portrait in response, which is stunning. Also, for the artists battling to win this and future Street Fighter 6 art contests, it's surely a warm feeling to know Capcom is willing to stand firm against AI use.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-6-art-contest-rocked-by-ai-controversy-disqualification-issued]]></content:encoded>
