            <p>A new report alleges that Marathon developer Bungie is in "chaos" after the studio was forced to admit that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">an external artist's work has been used within upcoming game Marathon without consent</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/05/17/new-marathon-info-bungie-morale-launch-worries-and-changing-plans/">Forbes</a> claims morale at the studio is in "free fall" right across the organisation, with one source telling the outlet "the vibes have never been worse".</p>
<p>The issue came to light earlier this week following recent playable alpha tests of Marathon, from which <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923067988871147605">artist Fern Hook recognised their designs</a> had been used. Responding via its less-visible <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217324384903262">Marathon Dev Team social media account</a>, Bungie wrote that it had "immediately investigated" Hook's claim and found that, yes, a former artist at the company had swiped the designs.</p>

<p>Then, in an ill-timed and palpably awkward livestream last night, the developer revealed it would not be sharing any Marathon gameplay due to the ongoing investigation.</p>
<p>"Our show is a little bit different today," explained game director, Joe Ziegler, at the beginning of the stream. "We had planned to show a lot more stuff, but for a lot of reasons we're about to get into, we decided not to show a bunch of this stuff. But we are going to be discussing a lot about what we learned through Alpha, some of the plans that we're going forward with."</p>
<p>Ziegler later said part of the reason Bungie wasn't showing any gameplay was because the team was "still scrubbing all of our assets to make sure that we are being respectful of the situation".</p>
<p>"It came to our attention that an artist who worked on Marathon in the early stages of pre-production took a number of graphic elements from a graphic designer, without permission or acknowledgement, and placed them on a decal sheet that was then checked in, in 2020," added art director Joe Cross, reading from a statement.</p>
<p>"The decal sheet included icons and text elements. These elements ended up in our alpha build and there is absolutely no excuse for this oversight, and we are working on, and 100% committed to, our review process to ensure instances like this don't happen again on Marathon or at Bungie."</p>
<p>Forbes now reports sources at Bungie say the explanation given publicly about the incident - which is that a former employee is responsible - is the same reason given internally, but "morale was in free fall" as the team scrambled to recover from the latest in a line of plagiarism accusations. With changes to its marketing plan - which pre-dates this week's incident - and possible amendments to its playtesting plans, as well as now an audit into what should be every single graphic element used on Marathon, some fear the shooter will struggle to hit its 23rd September release date.</p>
<p>Forbes also intimates staff have been uneasy with the direction of development, saying, "as far back as five years ago, devs were telling [management] what would and wouldn't work and were often ignored. Many have said previously that it needed to have some sort of PvE component".</p>
<p>"Sony and Bungie legal" are reportedly looking into what happened with the stolen assets, but Bungie's decision not to share <em>any</em> footage in yesterday's livestream is perhaps telling enough.</p>
<p>Marathon is set to launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 23rd September.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>But company is confident player account information remains secure.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Guilty Gear Strive developer Arc System Works has suffered a "data leakage due to unauthorised access".</p>
<p>In a brief <a href="https://www.arcsystemworks.com/notice-regarding-data-leakage-due-to-unauthorized-access/">statement</a>, the company said that while its systems had been illegally accessed by a third-party and data was leaked, it didn't believe the leak included any "personal information or player account information".</p>

<p>"We regret to announce that we have discovered that our systems were illegally accessed by a third party and that data held by us was leaked to outside parties," the statement read.</p>
<p>"As of May 12, we have not confirmed the leak of any user personal information or player account information due to the unauthorised access. We are working diligently to determine the cause of the unauthorised access and the extent of the impact with the help of outside experts, and we will inform you if any new facts are discovered as a result of the investigation.</p>
<p>"We sincerely apologise to all for any inconvenience and concern this may cause. We are truly sorry."</p>
<p>The statement closed on imploring people not to try and access the data that was allegedly leaked, "as there is a possibility that it may cause malware infection".</p>
<p>What information, exactly, the leakers <em>did</em> manage to access remains to be seen. Arc System Works hasn't said if it was employee data or information pertaining to unreleased or unannounced game projects, but <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/guilty-gear-strive-source-code-leak-explained-season-5-characters-discovered-3193826/">Dexerto</a> reported earlier this month, before Arc's statement, that Guilty Gear Strive's source code was leaked, including "new data" about the game's story and characters.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't the first time a studio's plans been hacked and prematurely leaked. In December 2023, PlayStation-owned Spider-Man developer Insomniac had detailed plans of future projects published online, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-investigating-insomniac-hack-which-reportedly-leaked-wolverine-files-and-employees-personal-data">stolen from the company by hackers</a>, and then ransomed for $2m. The files include a project roadmap for the next decade and beyond including an array of unannounced projects, plus production details, art assets, and personal information on Insomniac employees.</p>
<p>Perhaps more famously still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/90-gta-6-videos-and-screenshots-have-allegedly-leaked-online">90+ videos and screenshots from Rockstar's then-unannounced GTA 6 also leaked online early in September 2022</a> after a hacker managed to access its internal systems.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Mods are fully supported without any restrictions. PSN connecting entirely optional and NEVER required. Both the PC and PS5 versions offer the same content. We will make sure that early buyers are never at a disadvantage through future updates," the studio stressed.</p> <div>

            <p>Just a year after release, Activision is "streamlining" and ending support for Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, ceasing all seasonal content.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/WarzoneMobile/status/1923470814357385447">statement</a>, the developer said while it understood "this news may be disappointing", the mobile shooter had "not met [its] expectations with mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences."</p>

<p>"We deeply appreciate your dedication and passion for Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile. Going forward, we will be streamlining the scope of the game. This decision was made after careful consideration of various factors and while we're proud of the accomplishment in bringing Call of Duty: Warzone to mobile in an authentic way, it unfortunately has not met our expectations with mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences," the statement began.</p>
<p>"As a result, we will no longer be delivering new seasonal content and gameplay updates to the mobile version. Effective immediately, players will no longer be able to purchase Call of Duty Points or Black Cell using real currency in Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile. Sunday, May 18, 2025 will be the last day the game can be downloaded from the Google Play and Apple’s App Store and social features across both mobile platforms will be retired."</p>
<p>Players who install the game before next Monday, 19th May, will still be able to play, complete with cross-progression and shared inventories. They'll also be able to use unspent COD Points. After Monday, however, the game will no longer be downloadable from mobile stores, nor will players be able to spend any further real currency on COD Points or Battle Passes.</p>
<p>It's not clear how long the game will stay online, but Activision <a href="https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-service-changes">stressed</a>, "refunds are not available for previously purchased in-game content on unused COD Points".</p>
<p>"We know that this news may be disappointing, and we truly appreciate the support, passion, feedback, and dedication from our community," the statement added. "We have special incentives for Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile players in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-mobile">Call of Duty: Mobile</a> and encourage our players to try it for free."</p>
<p>Activision's sibling Call of Duty mobile game, which is different from Warzone, is seemingly faring much better. In May 2022, the publisher revealed<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-mobile-reaches-650m-downloads"> the mobile title had reached an impressive 650 million downloads</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/PlayCODMobile/status/1853527640516293059">a billion by November 2024</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
