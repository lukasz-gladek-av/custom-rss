            <p>While new viral hit Peak can often feel as challenging as it is fun to play, rumour has it that in the next day or so, the procedurally-generated map won't be tricky as much as it'll be unbeatable. Whoops.</p>
<p>Addressing players on social media yesterday, developer Aggro Crab confessed that a modder on Discord had discovered an upcoming map will position a campfire â€“ which players need to light in order to proceed to the next biome â€“ on top of an "unreachable" tree.</p>

<p>"A modder in Discord has informed me that in two days there will be a map where the campfire spawns in an unreachable tree," the developer confessed. "Chat, do I go to the office on Saturday to fix this." The message was appended with a slew of crying emojis.</p> <div>

<p>Though Aggro Crab didn't specify what mod gave the player an early head's up, it's likely they're talking about the seed mod that lets people select a seed in config (in this case, it's <a href="https://x.com/digi_the_robot/status/1951899207390126389">reportedly</a> level_8).</p>
<p>The message spawned hundreds of replies, ranging from "<a href="https://x.com/Ringer_53/status/1951527964778074393">Nah, we'll live. Ruining your weekend over it is not worth it</a>", to "<a href="https://x.com/ZeroNyxia/status/1951585271243292743">new difficulty unlocked</a>", to "<a href="https://x.com/blockxs/status/1951531975489073554">skip the office, embrace chaos</a>", which I think I may adopt as my new mantra for life.</p>
<p>"Just add a sign that says good luck lol," <a href="https://x.com/LucarnAnderson/status/1951633892513083696">wrote</a> someone else.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the decision was made to leave it be.</p>
<p>"I think with those you can make it [with a chain launcher or anti rope], so maybe fk it we ball," the developer eventually <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1951533385375162582">declared</a>.</p>
<p>Peak â€“ which follows a string of other multi-million sellers for publisher Landfall, including Content Warning and Totally Accurate Battlegrounds â€“ is available now on Steam. Eurogamer contributing editor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession">Christian Donlan called Peak his "new gaming obsession" earlier this year</a>, writing: "Great climbing, great fun, a very pure take on design. And maybe stay away from the mushrooms. Some of them, anyway."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/brace-yourself-peak-fans-aggro-crab-reckons-you-can-get-to-an-unreachable-campfire-thats-coming-up-soon]]></content:encoded>

        <p>A BioShock 1 remake has also reportedly been cancelled.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Cloud Chamber, the studio tasked with reviving the decade-dormant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> series, has reportedly failed an internal review with 2K Games execs, resulting in a leadership shakeup.</p>
<p>Anonymous sources speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil">Bloomberg</a> said it was the game's narrative, in particular, that apparently failed to impress, and was "identified as an area in need of improvement [that] will be revamped in the coming months".</p>

<p>Following the review, studio head Kelley Gilmore was ousted, and creative director Hogarth de la Plante moved into "a publishing role". The rest of the Cloud Chamber team was told in an all-hands meeting that the company needed "to become more agile and efficient". Colleagues are now worried that cuts may follow.</p>
<p>In response to the report, a 2K spokesperson acknowledged the change at the top of the studio to Bloomberg, saying it remained "fully committed to ensuring we deliver a BioShock game that exceeds the lofty expectations of our fans".</p>
<p>"We are working hard to set BioShock up for the best possible future," 2K Games said in a statement. "Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path."</p>
<p>Sadly, there's even more bad news for BioShock fans. Right at the end of the report, Bloomberg confirmed both the existence - and the cancellation - of a remake of the first BioShock game. It's unclear why the project was cancelled, but sources say it was shelved earlier in the year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-bioshock-adaptation-will-be-a-more-personal-film-as-opposed-to-a-grander-big-project">Netflix's BioShock adaptation was similarly "reconfigured" last year</a> to be a "more personal" film with a tighter budget. Producer Roy Lee told fans at a panel at last year's San Diego Comic-Con that changes at the top of Netflix's movie department have seen the budget streamlined, so "we're doing a much smaller version... It's going to be a more personal point of view, as opposed to a grander, big project".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-4-fails-to-impress-at-internal-2k-review-resulting-in-leadership-shake-up-and-revamped-narrartive]]></content:encoded>

            <p>GOG has launched an all-new project to raise awareness of censorship in gaming: <a href="https://items.gog.com/freedomtobuy/index.html">FreedomToBuy.Games</a>.</p>
<p>The digital games platform, which has long been campaigning for the better preservation of DRM-free games, said it believes that "if a game is legal and responsibly made, players should be able to enjoy it today â€“ and decades from now".</p>
<p>Consequently, for the next 28-ish hours or so at the time of writing, it is offering up 13 games for free â€“ including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/postal-2">Postal 2</a>, Agony, and House Party â€“ "because if a game is legal, you should be free to buy it".</p> <div>

<p>"Thanks to the dedication of developers and publishers, we are launching FreedomToBuy.games," the company said in a statement. "To raise awareness on censorship in gaming, 13 games are now available for free for 48h as a part of stand for creative freedom and preservation.</p>
<p>"We believe that if a game is legal and responsibly made, players should be able to enjoy it today â€“ and decades from now. Itâ€™s our statement: when games are delisted today because of discomfort, reviving them tomorrow becomes exponentially harder."</p>
<p>The campaign comes after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/itchio-deindexes-all-nsfw-games-blames-same-anti-porn-group-that-campaigned-against-steam">itch.io creators began reporting their NSFW games were no longer being displayed in search results on the platform</a> in June. Shortly thereafter, we learned itch.io had "deindexed" all NSFW content following discussions with payment processors contacted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-approached-payment-processors-because-steam-did-not-respond-australian-pressure-group-collective-shout-claims-responsibility-for-steam-and-itchio-nsfw-game-removal">the same Australian pressure group that recently targeted Steam</a>, which similarly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-introduces-vague-new-rules-banning-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-to-appease-credit-card-companies">"retired" unspecified NSFW titles and introduced vague new rules banning "certain kinds of adult content" from its own PC storefront</a>.</p>
<p>GOG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-announces-preservation-program-aims-to-maintain-game-compatibility-with-modern-and-future-systems">announced its Preservation Program last November</a>, when 100 games were part of the line-up. That list has continued to expand since then with a regular influx of new additions - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fear-platinum-joins-gog-preservation-program-to-properly-recognise-monoliths-contributions-to-gaming">Monolith Production's much-loved horror shooter FEAR</a>, which was added to "honour [the studio's] legacy" in February, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">Monolith's shock closure</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-offers-13-free-nsfw-games-as-it-launches-anti-censorship-campaign-freedomtobuygames]]></content:encoded>
