            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-5">Virtua Fighter 5</a> REVO, the latest edition of Sega's nearly 19-year-old fighting sequel, is heading to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/virtua-fighter-is-making-its-3d-pc-debut-this-winter-including-rollback-netcode">PC debut earlier this year</a>.
</p>
<p>
For those who haven't been following Virtua Fighter 5's convoluted journey over the last two decades, REVO is a remaster of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown">Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown</a>, which initially launched for PS4 in 2021. That, in turn, was a remaster of the game's supposedly final revision, Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown, which arrived on PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2012.
</p>
<p>
As to how Virtua Fighter 5 REVO differentiates itself from the series' most recent revision, the PC version introduced 4K graphics, high-res textures, rollback netcode support to optimise online play, and new online modes enabling competition with up to 16 other players.

<p>
Presumably, Sega's newly announced console editions will be similarly enhanced, but the publisher is yet to provide specific details beyond the fact cross-play will be supported, and there's no word of a release window either. "We're going to include even more content to make this much more than a simple port," it adds, "which we'll tell you about in future updates."
</p>
<p>
News of Virtua Fighter 5 REVO's console release comes after last year's confirmation a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-unveils-new-virtua-fighter-sonic-racing-and-like-a-dragon">brand-new entry in the much-loved fighting series is on the way</a>. That reveal was followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-in-engine-look-at-next-virtua-fighter-game-revealed">first in-engine footage</a> back in January, and Sega has now released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnyE4tsQ3w8">similarly styled teaser</a> showcasing returning character Wolf Hawkfield. Sega's new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter">Virtua Fighter</a> project is part of the initiative announced in 2023, which will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-announces-flurry-of-projects-including-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi">see it revisiting a number of its previously dormant classic properties</a>, including  <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a>, Jet Set Radio, Streets of Rage, and Shinobi.

            <p>The star of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s next game has said she's received preparation for the role - and specifically the online reaction to it - from studio boss Neil Druckmann, following the online abuse previously kicked up around The Last of Us Part 2.</p>
<p>Actress Tati Gabrielle will star as bounty hunter Jordan A Mun in Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, Naughty Dog's upcoming sci-fi project for PlayStation 5. While Gabrielle has worked close to video games before - on PlayStation's Uncharted film adaptation and as Nora in The Last of Us' TV series - this will be her first video game role.</p>
<p>In preparation, Gabrielle said she had been given mental "bootcamp-ing" by Druckmann, as she becomes the face of the game.</p>

<p>"Neil's been bootcamp-ing me. I know Troy [Baker]'s experience, I know Ashley [Johnson]'s experience..." Gabrielle told <a href="https://ew.com/tati-gabrielle-of-the-last-of-us-about-to-go-intergalactic-exclusive-11732492">EW</a>.</p>
<p>"I know Laura Bailey's experience," Gabrielle continued, referring to the backlash Bailey received for her turn as The Last of Us Part 2's Abby.</p>
<p>Prior to The Last of Us Part 2's release, Abby's role as the character that kills Joel was leaked, sparking a wave of online abuse and death threats aimed at Bailey and her son. "Every time I went online, that's all I saw," Bailey revealed previously as part of the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2s-abby-actor-reveals-online-abuse-didnt-just-threaten-her-life-but-her-baby-son-too">behind-the-scenes documentary, Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2</a>, which was released in February last year. "Death threats and threats of violence."</p>
<p>Gabrielle revealed that, like Bailey, she too has been the subject of backlash since it was announced she would star in Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. Already, she has had misogynistic and racist comments sent her way.</p>
<p>"I got a lot of love, but there was a lot of hate over me being a woman, me being a woman of colour, me having my head shaved, all these things that I didn't even actually initially see," Gabrielle said. "I'm out of the social media zeitgeist for that reason - but once I did, Neil [Druckmann] was like, 'Ignore it. No matter what, me and you, we're going to make something beautiful. We're going to make something that we're proud of'."</p>

<p>The actress also spoke more about the upcoming game's theme of faith. Back in March of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-hate-directed-at-the-last-of-us-part-2-naughty-dog-boss-says-next-game-about-the-entirely-uncontroversial-topics-of-faith-and-religion">Druckmann explained how Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet features a fictitious religion</a> which "becomes pretty prominent" in the game's alternate history.</p>
<p>"The question of faith is not black and white," Gabrielle elaborated. "When you initially think of faith, you think of religion, which is a part of it, but there's also faith in oneself. There's faith in your environment or your community. All that faith means is, What are your beliefs?</p>
<p>"What are the things that you hope for? Faith sounds flowery, but we all experience it day in and day out. What is your reason for waking up?"</p>
<p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is in development for PS5. Last year, Druckmann confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-neil-druckmann-says">Naughty Dog had a number of games in the works</a>, including "multiple single-player projects", this being one of them.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in studio news, Naughty Dog and HBO have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-something-in-the-air-as-ellie-sees-red-in-the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-five">just aired the fifth episode of The Last of Us season two</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-underground-remaster-hopes-increase-as-iconic-skater-says-hell-campaign-all-i-can<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a>, the skating icon has said he has "aspirations" for further remakes, including one for the popular <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-underground">Tony Hawk's Underground</a>.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://screenrant.com/tony-hawks-underground-remake-campaign/">Screen Rant</a>, Hawk said the decision to continue remaking older games ultimately rested with the company he worked with - that'd be publisher Activision, and ultimately its owner Microsoft - but that he would "campaign all I can".
</p>
<p>
Still, Hawk's wishes appear to hold at least some sway - such as with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bam-margera-officially-returning-to-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">seemingly last-minute restoration of skater Bam Margera to the roster of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a>.
</p>
<p>
"I always have aspirations," Hawk said on the possibility of Underground being remastered next. "It's not up to me generally. I'll campaign all I can, but I'm working with a much bigger company that's a lot smarter than me."
</p>
<p>
Asked if a decision on Underground was too early, before the launch of Pro Skater 3+4, Hawk added: "Yeah, we haven't even released this game."
</p>
<p>
Activision had looked ready not to continue the Tony Hawk's series at all, despite a positive reception to Pro Skater 1+2 when it arrived back in 2020. Its developer, Vicarious Visions, was later shuffled over to become part of Blizzard, and the future of Hawk's skating series put on ice. 
</p>
<p>
But teases from Hawk himself last year of talks between himself and Activision ultimately resulted in a reversal of fortunes. Earlier this year, Activision began teasing a Pro Skater 3+4 remake within Call of Duty, before making the project official on 4th March.
</p>
<p>
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 will launch on 11th July for Nintendo Switch and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S including through Game Pass Ultimate.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s mouse controls will be usable in the console's Home menu.</p>
<p>As shared in the Nintendo Today app, mouse controls won't just be for in-game but for navigating menus - there's a video of it in action too.</p>
<p>What's more, just like in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>, users simply place the Joy-Con 2 sideways on any surface to switch to mouse mode, then pick it up again to revert to the control sticks.</p>

<p>Mouse controls are one of the Switch 2's new innovative features, allowing both Joy-Con 2 to be flipped and moved along any surface - be that your coffee table, your desk, or your thighs.</p>
<p>Nintendo is even releasing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-first-dual-mouse-mode-game-is-wheelchair-basketball-drag-x-drive">dual-mouse mode game in Drag x Drive</a> - it's 3 v 3 wheelchair basketball, though with its awkward controls it feels like more of a tech demo.</p>

<p>Instead, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-is-the-best-example-of-switch-2s-varied-control-capabilities-but-you-might-want-to-work-on-your-thighs">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond feels like the best example of the varied control schemes of the Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>The first-person adventure will allow players to either use traditional stick controls, motion controls, or mouse controls. I tested this out at the Switch 2 reveal event and found the mouse controls surprisingly responsive, though I'm not convinced it will be the best way to play - it depends on the surface area of your thighs.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-edition-upgrade-prices-for-kirby-and-mario-party-cost-more-than-zelda">expanded Mario Party Jamboree on Switch 2</a> will also include new minigames to show off the mouse functionality.</p>
<p>Nintendo's Switch 2 will launch on 5th June, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">Mario Kart World as its big launch game</a>. Nintendo recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-suggestion-that-ai-generated-images-used-in-mario-kart-world">confirmed it does not include AI art</a>.</p>
