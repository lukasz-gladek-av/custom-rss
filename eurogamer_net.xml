            <p>
Streaming giant Netflix has laid off staff at Oxenfree developer Night School Studio.
</p>
<p>
According to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-has-laid-off-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">Game Developer</a>, an unspecified number of workers were told their services were no longer required last month, which came as a shock to the indie games company.
</p>
<p>
Netflix declined to comment on the report.
</p>
<p>
Best known for its Oxenfree games, Night School Studio was bought by Netflix in 2021 as part of the streaming giant's ongoing plans to expand into interactive entertainment. 
</p>
<p>
Night School Studio's first game Oxenfree was acclaimed upon its initial launch in 2016. The side-scrolling narrative adventure story featured a group of teens caught up in some creepy sci-fi shenanigans, and received praise for its dialogue and atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
The studio's 2019 follow-up Afterparty, about a character who tried to best Satan in a drinking game, did not seem to hit the same level of recognition. In 2023, Night School Studio returned to Oxenfree with a direct sequel - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-one-restless-night-of-mysteries">Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals, which was well received</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's currently unclear what Night School Studio is working on next, though today's report states that the company's layoffs will not change its product pipeline.
</p>
<p>
In October 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-closes-aaa-internal-studio-led-by-halo-creative-head-joseph-staten">Netflix closed a major internal game studio led by Halo creative head Joseph Staten</a>, and seemingly scrapped its big budget game before it was ever announced.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-celebrates-its-biggest-quarter-yet-by-putting-uk-prices-up-again">Netflix celebrated its biggest quarterly subscriber increase in history by increasing UK prices yet again</a>.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> maker Valve has handed over the game's full client and server code to fans, encouraging them to "change, extend or rewrite" TF2 in any non-commercial way possible.
</p>
<p>
The code is now available via a "massive" update to the Source SDK [Software Development Kit], <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=238809">Valve announced last night</a>, making "anything from small tweaks to complete conversions possible".
</p>
<p>
For content creators, modders and fans, this means completely new TF2 games can be put together - as long as they're released for free.

<p>"TF2 mods may be published on the Steam Store, and after publication will appear as new games in the Steam game list," Valve wrote.</p>
<p>
Other updates to the Source SDK include 64-bit binary support, a scalable HUD/UI and other fixes for all other multiplayer Source engine games, including Counter-Strike: Source, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/day-defeat-source">Day of Defeat: Source</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a>: Deathmatch, and Half-Life Deathmatch: Source.
</p>
<p>
"Players have a lot of investment in their TF2 inventories, and Steam Workshop contributors have created of a lot of that content," Valve added. "The majority of items in the game now are thanks to the hard work of the TF2 community. 
</p>
<p>
"To respect that, we're asking TF2 mod makers continue to respect that connection, and to not make mods that have the purpose of trying to profit off Workshop contributors' efforts."
</p>
<p>Valve largely handed the reigns to TF2 over to fans some time ago, as it focuses on Steam and its Steam Deck hardware. The company is still developing games, however - and there have been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer">multiple reports over the past year</a> that a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-may-have-been-announced-by-a-voice-actor-who-probably-has-never-heard-of-steam">fresh Half-Life entry looks to be on the way</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-2-and-dishonored-art-lead-viktor-antonov-dies-aged-just-52">tributes poured in for Half-Life 2 art director and Dishonored designer Viktor Antonov</a>, who sadly died aged 52.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Wizards of the Coast has unveiled more of its Magic: The Gathering and Final Fantasy crossover, including the cards set to shake up gameplay and the first ever summonable Saga Creatures.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/magic-the-gatherings-final-fantasy-crossover-first-cards-revealed">reported on the four Commander decks based on Final Fantasies 6, 7, 10, and 14</a>, with lead characters Terra, Cloud, Tidus, and Y'shtola headlining each deck.</p>
<p>Now more cards have been revealed to show mechanics of the game and beautiful artwork.</p>

<p>For instance, the Final Fantasy crossover includes double-faced cards to represent iconic characters, minigames, and story moments. That might reflect, for instance, the journey of Cecil in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-iv">Final Fantasy 4</a> from Dark Knight to Paladin.</p>
<p>That also includes <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xv">Final Fantasy 15</a>'s fishing minigame - yes, you can now go fishing in Magic: The Gathering - which can be flipped to form a cooking campsite, used to add a food token to your deck.</p>

<p>Summons will also be included, combining elements of a Saga and Creature card for the first time, and can be called upon to aid in battle for a few turns - as you'd expect. So far, only Shiva has been revealed.</p>
<p>More new mechanics will be revealed in future.</p>

<p>Other revealed cards include boss monsters and cute creatures, like Jumbo Cactuar, Sin, Tonberry, and Moogle cards. Some cards will also be borderless to truly show off the artwork.</p>

<p>Then there are the Final Fantasy Through The Ages cards, featuring classic artwork from across the series, including from legendary artist Yoshitaka Amano and character designer Tetsuya Nomura. As a whole, the crossover is the largest collection of Final Fantasy artwork ever in a single game.</p>
