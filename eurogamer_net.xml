            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair has revealed details of Nintendo and The Pokémon Company's lawsuit which alleges that the game infringes on multiple patents. 
</p>
<p>
The monster battling and catching game had frequently been compared with Pokémon since its launch for PC and Xbox Series X/S in January. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company's lawsuit was filed</a> just weeks before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-is-officially-out-today-on-playstation">Palworld's PlayStation 5 version launched at the end of September</a>.
</p>
<p>
Today, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108">revealed</a> that the lawsuit relates to three patents filed between February and July this year - after Palworld's launch. 
</p>

<p>
The developer also stated that Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are seeking "an injunction against Palworld", presumably to block its future sale within the Japanese jurisdiction of the patent lawsuit, as well as a fine of 10m yen (around £50k) split between the two firms, plus "late payment damages".
</p>
<p>
So, what are the patents Palworld is accused of infringing on?
</p>
<p>
As expected and sniffed out by fans and industry watchers previously, Nintendo's patents numbered 7545191, 7493117 and 7528390 lie at the heart of this legal action. These all cover gameplay mechanics such as the capture of digital creatures and the ability to ride on them. 
</p>
<p>
We previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-looks-to-hinge-on-pokeball-patent">highlighted the first of these patents in particular as likely behind the Palworld lawsuit</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The patent in question describes how a character catches a Pokémon by aiming and throwing a capture item, like a Pokéball, at a creature. Upon successful capture, the creature then becomes "owned by the player".
</p>
<p>
In Palworld, players catch Pals by aiming and throwing a capture item, named a Pal Sphere, at a creature. Upon successful capture, the creature then becomes owned by the player.
</p>
<p>
Japanese patent attorney Kiyoshi Kurihara previously dubbed the document a "killer patent" that would be "easy to infringe". 
</p>
<p>
Writing today, Palworld said once again <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-vows-to-fight-nintendo-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-fans-and-indie-developers">it would continue to fight the case</a>. "We will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings," it said.

<p>Jon Felthemier blamed "reshoots and rising interest rates" for Borderlands' weak performance, but admitted that "the success of [Lionsgate's] financial models doesn’t take the place of also getting the creative right".</p>

<p>"On Borderlands, nearly everything that could go wrong did go wrong: it sat on the shelf for too long during the pandemic, and reshoots and rising interest rates took it outside the safety zone of our usual strict financial models," the Lionsgate boss said during Thursday's earnings call.</p><p>"Coupled with softer-than-anticipated results for other releases in the quarter", Felthemier said there was "less margin for error than ever before", with "several of [its] other releases in the quarter, though cushioned by financial models that worked as intended, [also not] living up to either our standards or our projections".</p>
<p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said in Take-Two's own earnings call earlier this week that though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-film-benefited-game-sales-despite-being-disappointing-flop-take-two-boss-says">"disappointing", the movie hasn't hurt the Borderlands video game series</a>. In fact, it gave it a boost.</p>
<p>This year's Cate Blanchett-fronted film was branded a "disaster" and "huge misfire" by viewers. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-borderlands-movie-impressions-brand-it-a-disaster-and-a-huge-misfire">one review called it a "lifeless, unfunny, and visually repulsive dud"</a>.</p>
<p>The adaptation generated just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-earned-4m-on-its-opening-day">$4m across 3125 locations on its opening day</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youll-be-able-to-watch-the-borderlands-film-at-home-very-soon-it-seems">quickly getting shifted onto streaming services</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nvidia has announced its GeForce Now cloud gaming service will soon introduce a playtime cap of 100 hours a month for paying Performance (previously Priority) and Ultimate subscribers, although additional hours can be purchased for a fee.
</p>
<p>
Nividia shared the news <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GeForceNOW/comments/1glr3yc/gfn_thursday_updates_november_7_2024/">on Reddit</a>, saying the limit would help it "continue providing exceptional quality and speed - as well as shorter queue times". It also insisted the switch from an unlimited allowance would "comfortably accommodate 94 percent of members".
</p>
<p>
Paying subscribers wanting to use GeForce Now for more than the allotted 100 hours per month - equating to approximately three hours per day - will now need to pay extra, with 15 additional hours costing $2.99 USD for Performance members and $5.99 for anyone subscribed to its Ultimate tier. Up to 15 unused hours will automatically roll over into the next month.

<p>
Nvidia's new restrictions come into affect at the start of 2025, but all existing subscribers - as well as anyone signing up before 31st December this year - will continue to get unlimited playtime until January 2026. The company also notes anyone currently subscribed to GeForce Now's Founders tier will retain their unlimited playtime hours for life, provided there's no lapse in their membership. Changing to an Ultimate subscription, however, will immediately apply the new terms, imposing the 100-hour monthly play limit from January 2026.
</p><p>
In addition to its playtime limitations, Nvidia has announced a number of new GeForce Now benefits. Subscribers to the newly renamed Performance tier will soon be able to stream in 1440p instead of the previous 1080p, and ultrawide resolutions will also be supported. Furthermore, all Performance and Ultimate subscribers will be able to save their in-game graphics settings across streaming sessions.

InZoi, the upcoming Sims-like from developer Krafton, is absolutely <em>gorgeous</em> - to the point a lot of life sim fans are very excited indeed. So the good news is it now has a release date; the bad news is it's been delayed into next year to give it a "stronger foundation".
</p>
<p>
InZoi, which promises a "complete community simulation" where "every character [acts] on their free will", was initially announced last year, when it was expected to launch for PC sometime in "Q4" this year. Now, however, Krafton has revised that release, confirming Inzoi will be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/">launching into Steam early access</a> on 28th March next year.
</p>
<p>
In a message announcing the news, InZoi director Hyungjun "Kjun" Kim explained the decision to delay the game had been made after reviewing feedback and "analyzing a wealth of data from our various play tests". He added the revised release will give the studio time to "improve areas that need attention" and "create a game that truly captures the essence of life simulation".

"It is said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings," Kim continued. "The extra love and care that is required to properly nurture a child is how I see our journey with inZoi — a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth. This change in our release date represents our dedication to giving inZoi a stronger foundation, so we can embark on this journey together in the best way possible."

Players did, of course, get a bit of a look at InZoi back in August, when Krafton briefly released its impressively flexible character creator on Steam. During its five days of availability, the demo saw a peak of over 18K players, one of them being Eurogamer's own Jessica Orr, who shared a little of her character creating adventures right here.

<p>
"Visually, [the demo is] stunning," she <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-old-brands-revitalised-ageing-classics-and-cursed-character-creators">wrote</a>. "It's a little unbelievable how good it looks, actually, even on lower graphical settings. The customisation goes deep too. It's got all the usual bells and whistles, and even a few chimes to boot, as we're treated to entire categories for things like fake nails... Personality customisation doesn't go as deep, from what I can tell in the demo, but it's nice to see inclusive gender and sexuality options there already."

InZoi is just one of several Sims-like that have surfaced in recent years. Paradox Interactive's Life by You has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sims-like-rival-life-by-you-has-been-cancelled-after-indefinite-delay">now been cancelled</a>, but that still leaves the highly anticipated Paralives, also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-sims-like-paralives-gets-seven-minute-gameplay-video-hitting-early-access-next-year">scheduled to launch into early access sometime next year</a>, and if you fancy something a little more lo-fi, you can also play the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1651490/Tiny_Life/">adorably retro - but still surprisingly robust - Tiny Life</a> on Steam.
