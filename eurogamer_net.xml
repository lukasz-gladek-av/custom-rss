            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hytale">Hytale</a> has had a remarkably strong early access start, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-boss-calls-early-release-the-most-challenging-but-rewarding-experience">despite a number of development hiccups</a> and it broadly not being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytales-early-access-launch-isnt-quite-ready-to-step-out-of-minecrafts-shadow-but-im-still-having-a-blast">that different to genre-leader Minecraft</a>, so it comes as no surprise modders are already hard at work on all sorts of additions and tweaks.</p>
<p>Last week, we were blown away by one modder who managed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-modder-puts-minecraft-and-doom-inside-the-world-map">get Minecraft running inside Hytale's world map</a>. Now, we've come across another young developer who might have cracked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>-style storms inside the new blocky sensation. User <a href="https://x.com/dattadeveloper">dattadeveloper</a> shared his creation via X/Twitter on 26th January:</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>Alongside the announcement, he also shared a link to <a href="https://builtbybit.com/resources/worldborder-api-included.91496/">download</a> his WorldBorder mod with an API. It's standalone and can be easily thrown into other projects. Border colours are fully customisable and it includes "multiple border shapes" as well as plenty of options to adjust it to each modder or player's needs. For something that's just come out, it's a very notable effort already.</p>
<p>The modder later shared <a href="https://x.com/dattadeveloper/status/2016014515716989014?s=20">other video examples</a> of WorldBorder in action and its possibilities. It's all impressive, and dattadeveloper appears to be ready to open the floodgates and start collaborating with other modders and event organisers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> veterans may remember how battle royale modes inspired by The Hunger Games popped off more than a decade ago, so we're getting a strong sensation of déjà vu here as Hytale positions itself as the minimal refresh the subgenre needed. Still, it'll take much more to dethrone Xbox and Mojang's behemoth, so we're curious to see how everything unfolds over the course of 2026.</p><p>For now, dattadeveloper <a href="https://x.com/dattadeveloper/status/2016014522025132531?s=20">is already experimenting</a> with his own take on Hunger Games-like modes, so it's just a matter of time before large community efforts around such competitive game modes begin to take shape thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/best-hytale-mods">Hytale mods</a> like this one.</p>

            <p>
French unions representing workers at Ubisoft have reportedly voted unanimously in favour of strike action following the company's recent dramatic "reset" and in response to a voluntary redundancy proposal that could see as many as 200 Paris HQ employees lose their jobs.
</p>
<p>
Last week, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">announced</a> a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset", resulting in the cancellation of six games - including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">troubled Price of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a> - as well as delays for seven other titles, the closure of its Halifax mobile studio and Stockholm studio, and a mandate for all remaining staff to return to in-office work five days a week.
</p>
<p>
Amid all this, Ubisoft is proposing a voluntary round of redundancies as it seeks to further reduce operating costs. The move - which is being organised under the voluntary Rupture Conventionnelle Collective (RCC) process, wherein employees can collectively negotiate the mutually agreed termination of a permanent contract - could result in as many as 200 jobs cut at Ubisoft's Paris headquarters. That's reportedly around 18 percent of the company's Paris HQ workforce, said to number approximately 1100 employees in total.
</p>
<p>
"In line with last week's announcements on its new operating model and the acceleration of cost-reduction initiatives," a Ubisoft spokesperson <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-follows-last-weeks-game-cancelations-and-studio-closures-with-a-proposed-reduction-of-200-more-jobs-at-its-paris-headquarters">confirmed in a statement provided to IGN</a>, "Ubisoft International has initiated discussions regarding a potential Rupture Conventionnelle Collective, a collective, voluntary mutual termination agreement that could involve up to 200 positions at its headquarters in France."
</p><p>
"At this stage, this remains a proposal, and no decision will be final until a collective agreement is reached with employee representatives and validated by French authorities," the spokesperson continued. "The proposal applies exclusively to Ubisoft International employees under French contracts and has no impact on other French entities or Ubisoft teams worldwide."
</p>
<p>
In response to the companys's voluntary redundancy proposal, as per French financial publication <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/ubisoft-les-syndicats-francais-appellent-a-une-greve-massive-du-10-au-12-fevrier-2212033">Les Echos</a>, unions representing Ubisoft workers - specifically, Syndicat des travailleurs et travailleuses du jeu vidéo (STJV), Solidaires Informatique, la CFE-CGC, CGT, and Printemps écologique - have unanimously agreed to strike. The strike is due to run from 10th-12th February, and will reportedly see unions coordinating with their international counterparts in a bid to expand the scope of the action.
</p>
<p>
Following word of Ubisoft's latest "reset", the company's share price <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-reset-wipes-34-off-its-share-price-the-lowest-in-15-years">plummeted 34 percent</a>, resulting in its lowest share price in 15 years.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>In a year full of awesome new game releases (many of which were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> exclusives), many agreed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kirby-air-riders-review">Kirby Air Riders</a> was one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-50-best-games-of-2025-ranked">2025's top bangers</a>. Now, a new surprise patch has made it even better.</p>
<p>Players were hoping for meatier post-launch support than what Kirby creator Masahiro Sakurai teased <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/kirby-air-riders-dev-team-disbanding-soon-game-updates-also-ending">with his no DLC comments</a> back in October. Moreover, he said post-launch development on Kirby Air Riders would end soon as the development team planned to disband.</p>
<p>This is why <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68635">the 1.3.0 patch</a> is such a pleasant surprise. It dropped on 26th January and added several big new features to the game, with GameShare, a Grand Prix mode, and online matchmaking for two local players being the biggest additions.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch 2's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/features/gameshare/">GameShare feature</a> has been a strange one so far, with the game giant and some third-party developers adding it to some multiplayer-oriented games and skipping others. It essentially allows Switch 2 owners to "share" their game with other Switch systems close by or via GameChat (though there are restrictions for Switch 1 players who are limited to local GameShare). Casual racers are typically go-to games for local play, so Kirby Air Riders getting this extra is a welcome addition.</p><p>The Grand Prix mode is exactly what you think it is, but a bit of a bigger deal for Kirby Air Riders, since the game's regular racers are characterized by how blazing fast they are. A longer "match" that chains a bunch of them together is a great way to allow players to go sweatier and develop rivalries with random racers. Similarly, online play is also gaining a boost by allowing two local players to queue up for quick matches; hopefully, other online modes will be supported at a later date.</p>
<p>The full <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68635">patch notes</a> are rather substantial and include many balance adjustments and fixes, with the market, customisation, and the central-show City Trial mode receiving the most love after the aforementioned additions.</p>
