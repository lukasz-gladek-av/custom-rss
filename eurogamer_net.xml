            <p>
In less than a week, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> turns 25, and EA is reportedly poised to re-release The Sims 1 &amp; 2 this week as part of the series' quarter-century celebrations. 
</p>
<p>
The Sims 1 &amp; 2 have, of course, long been unavailable in an official capacity, with the 25-year-old original never getting a digital release and its sequel's short-lived Ultimate Collection being yanked from Origin in 2018. That could be about to change, however; Kotaku, citing a "source familiar" with EA's plans, <a href="https://kotaku.com/sims-1-2-remaster-pc-buy-ea-maxis-steam-1851748658">reports</a> re-releases of The Sims 1 &amp; 2 will launch on PC later this week, with all their original expansions included. It's "unclear" if a console release is also coming.
</p>
<p>
Lending further credence to Kotaku's report are the handful of conspicuous teases EA has been sharing to coincide with the start of The Sims' Nostalgia Now week, which runs from 27th-31st January. The series' official website, for instance, now <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/the-sims">features</a> a character from the original The Sims surrounded by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-2">The Sims 2</a>'s radial menu.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, the publisher has <a href="https://x.com/TheSims/status/1879218365430182064">posted</a> a short animation - accompanied by the phrase "BRB" - on social media. It features The Sims' iconic spinning Plumbob, first surrounded by The Sims 2's radial menu then superimposed on coloured squares reminiscent of The Sims 1's box art. 
</p><p>
Interestingly, the video then transitions to a scene resembling <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-3">The Sims 3</a>'s loading screen. Kotaku's report doesn't mention the series' third outing, but fans were slightly stunned earlier this month when, with zero explanation or fanfare, it received its first (still mysterious) update in 15 years. If this means EA's has been quietly tinkering under the hood to implement some much-needed stability and compatibility fixes, there'll be a lot of happy Sims players.
</p>
<p>
All of which is to say it could be an  exciting few days for The Sims fans, and that's before EA's big birthday blowout next week. Things kick off with a 25-hour livestream celebration of the series next Tuesday, 4th April, coinciding with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-marking-series-25th-anniversary-with-huge-free-update-adding-70-new-items">release a "huge" free 25th anniversary update for The Sims 4</a>, adding 70+ new items, a new limited-time event, and more.

<strong>UPDATE 8pm:</strong> Following the unintentional release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s upcoming Patch 8 on PS5, Larian has provided additional details and a recommended fix for affected players.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/unintentional-ps5-update-and-how-to-return-to-patch-7_133">post on the Baldur's Gate 3 website</a>, Larian offered more context for today's error, explaining, "Our partners have confirmed that some regions mistakenly received the Patch 8 build as an update to their live game version, in preparation for the Patch 8 stress test." The update, it said, was "only accessible for a few hours" and is no longer available.
</p>
<p>
For those that <em>did</em> receive today's download, Larian warns this version is unsupported and won't be updated until after the stress test, when Patch 8 is ready for its full release. It also notes affected players will likely experience compatibility issues with mods, and won't be able to access multiplayer when attempting to join users on Patch 7. As such, it recommends reverting to Patch 7 by uninstalling and reinstalling Baldurâ€™s Gate 3.

<p>
Unfortunately, the studio also confirms saves made with Patch 8 installed won't be compatible with Patch 7, and it "cannot guarantee saves made in this version will remain compatible when Patch 8 is released." As such, players will need to return to an earlier save if reverting to Patch 7.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the studio notes players that received today's unintentional update aren't necessarily guaranteed access to the stress test. The test itself is due to begin this week, with invites going out to successful applicants in waves.

<strong>ORIGINAL STORY 6.45pm:</strong> Baldur's Gate 3's eagerly awaited Patch 8 is now live on PlayStation 5 - which has seemingly left developer Larian Studios a little perplexed, seeing as it definitely shouldn't be.
</p>
<p>
Patch 8, officially Baldur's Gate 3's final content update, isn't due to arrive until Larian has held its upcoming closed stress test. As such, Baldur's Gate 3 players on PlayStation 5 were more than a little surprised to see the game update to version 1.800.00 earlier today - and it turns out the studio was equally caught offguard by this turn of events.
</p><p>"No, the Patch 8 stress test hasn't yet begun," it confirmed in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/larianstudios.com/post/3lgqbpk3knc26">quietly exasperated post on Bluesky</a>. "Yes, PS5 players do currently have access to Patch 8. While we work with our partners to understand what's going on, please note that any new saves made while on Patch 8 will not be compatible with Patch 7... How's your Monday going?".
</p>
<p>
Patch 8 might be Baldur's Gate 3's final major content update, but it's still a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-is-getting-new-subclasses-cross-play-and-more-next-year">big one</a>, introducing 12 new sub-classes, cross-play, new camera features, and more. Given its scope, Larian previously explained it would be holding a pre-launch stress test in order to "help us catch things before they can become an issue once a patch has been released."
</p>
<p>
As such, Patch 8's premature launch on PlayStation 5 clearly isn't an ideal situation, saddling players with a version of the game that isn't yet ready for release, while putting the studio in a potentially tricky situation - seeing as reverting Baldur's Gate 3 to an earlier version could leave PS5 players with non-functional saves. We've asked Larian for comment.
</p>
<p>
Despite today's Patch 8 snafu, Baldur's Gate 3's stress test - which doesn't yet have a start date - is still on the horizon, and registrations <a href="https://larian.com/stress-test-register">remain open</a>. And for those players on other platforms who don't yet have access, there's always <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-gives-baldurs-gate-3s-withers-a-pair-of-big-naturals-to-celebrate-100m-mod-downloads">Withers "big naturals"</a> to keep them amused.
