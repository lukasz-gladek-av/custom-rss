            <p>
With March now at the mid-way point, Sony has revealed the latest titles joining its PlayStation Plus game catalogue for Premium and Extra subscribers - with the highlight undoubtedly being Ubisoft's superb Price of Persia: The Lost Crown.
</p>
<p>
The Lost Crown might be the most eye-catching of the lot, depending on your taste, but there's more besides. From next Tuesday, 18th March, Premium and Extra members also get the likes of arcade football silliness in Captain Tsubasa: Rise of New Champions, laundrette (and coin-op) management in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arcade-paradise">Arcade Paradise</a>, and MMA fisticuffs in EA Sports UFC 5.
</p>
<p>
As for those Premium-exclusive additions, March is a good 'un for fans of FromSoftware's long-running mech series, Armored Core. Armored Core, Armored Core: Project Phantasma, and Armored Core: Master of Arena all arrive in March, alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arcade-paradise-vr">Arcade Paradise VR</a>. You'll find the full list of this month's titles below:

Sony recently announced plans to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-shifting-focus-to-ps5-games-next-year-will-only-occasionally-include-ps4-titles">shift the focus of its PlayStation Plus monthly games and Game Catalog updates toward PS5</a> titles starting early next year, after which PlayStation 4 games will only "occasionally" feature thereafter. "Many of our players are currently playing on PS5 and have shifted toward redeeming and accessing PS5 titles," it said at the time.
