<p>Per <a href="https://streamscharts.com/news/summer-game-fest-2025">StreamCharts</a> (via <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-viewership-record-50-million-livestreams-1236431017/">Variety</a>), YouTube saw the most views on The Game Awards' YouTube channel (which is, of course, Keighley's other seasonal show), with views up 43 percent compared to 2025. According to StreamCharts' analysis, the average audience also increased by 30 percent, while peak viewership for SGF on Twitch was also up by 38 percent.</p>
<p>More than 1300 community co-streamers, "ranging from variety broadcasters to Japanese VTubers", shared the feed live.</p>
<p>"In total, the peak concurrent audience for SGF reached more than 3 million live simultaneous viewers across Twitch and YouTube, with significant year-over-year growth on both platforms in terms of average viewership, watch time, and co-streams," a press release stated.</p>
<p>It's now the second-biggest gaming/tech show of 2025, second only to Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> showcase. March's Nintendo Direct is third, while Xbox Games Showcase and June's State of Play come in fourth and fifth place, respectively.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this month's PlayStation State of Play is similarly breaking records for Sony, as its <a href="https://streamscharts.com/news/sony-playstations-state-play-record">June showcase smashed prior peak concurrent viewership records</a>, making it the most popular State of Play hosted to date.</p>
