            <p>That <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-prime-videos-sixth-biggest-season-of-all-time">Fallout Season 2</a> finale was quite good even if some subplots barely moved during the second set of eight episodes, I'd say. It also made many of us eager to see what comes next (especially the teased new setting). Diehard Fallout fans, however, maybe were paying more attention to the mystery countdown <a href="https://fallout-s2.amazonstudios.com/#main">on the show's interactive map site</a>.</p>
<p>Alas, we got no news on those <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-3-and-new-vegas-crossover-mod-not-getting-remastered">long-rumoured Fallout 3 and New Vegas remasters</a>, which are reportedly a ways off at the time of writing, but Amazon and Bethesda's parting gift is cool nonetheless. It may even be a cheeky unofficial tease of things to come if you're very high on copium, like me.</p>
<p>The final icon on the top right part of the map was revealed to be <a href="https://fallout-s2.amazonstudios.com/#/penthouse">Mr. House's penthouse</a> at the top of New Vegas' iconic tower. Unless we're missing something, no Easter eggs related to the potential remasters are to be found, though we're sure the most dedicated fans are on the case as I type this.</p>
<p>Instead, it's more of a cool interactive extra for fans of both the show and the 2010 RPG; a 3D model of the well-known location as seen in the show (it's packing some upgrades and new secrets). Those who are familiar with the game will instantly notice this 3D render feels shinier and more detailed (and not live-action at all). I wouldn't go as far as to say this is an in-progress chunk from the rumoured remaster (remake?) for obvious reasons, but it could give us a solid idea of how a touched-up New Vegas may feel like.</p>

<p>In any case, it's fun to see a big show's marketing returning to the early Internet days, where new movies and TV series were constantly promoted with neat interactive sites (and even flash games) on top of the more traditional promotional materials. If you find something else in this room, ping us, but we're just enjoying the vistas as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-future-of-the-games">we think about the show and game series' future</a>.</p>
<p>For now, it's been confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">Season 3 starts shooting soon-ish</a>, plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> owners can look forward to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-announces-fallout-4-anniversary-edition-confirms-nintendo-switch-2-version-for-2026">port of Fallout 4</a> that should arrive in the near future.</p>

            <p>Rockstar's highly-anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> will not feature any Generative AI.</p>
<p>That's coming from Take-Two head Strauss Zelnick, who assured the GTA community that the controversial tech has "zero part in what Rockstar is building".</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Zelnick was talking with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/strauss-zelnick-generative-ai-has-zero-part-in-what-rockstar-games-is-building-with-gta-6">Eurogamer's sister site gamesindustry.biz</a> ahead of Take-Two's Q3 financial results, when the topic of AI came up. The company head said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/artificial-intelligence-is-an-oxymoron-theres-no-such-thing-says-take-two-boss">he has "been enthusiastic" about AI from the beginning</a>, and Take-Two's "products have always been built with machine learning and artificial intelligence".</p>
<p>Zelnick called Take-Two a "leader in the space", with the company currently having "hundreds of pilots and implementations" across the board, and that includes "within our studios". He added the company has seen instances where generative AI tools are "driving costs and time efficiencies", though he does not believe these tools in isolation can "create great entertainment properties". </p>
<p>This is when the conversation turned to Rockstar and GTA 6, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-fans-in-disarray-as-release-date-clock-reset-following-gta6-release-day-delay">which is expected to debut on 19th November</a> (a date Zelnick remains confident about).</p>
<p>"Specifically with regards to GTA 6, Generative AI has zero part in what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> is building," Zelnick said, adding the studio's "worlds are handcrafted" and that is what sets it apart from other studios.</p>
<p>"They're built from the ground up, building by building, street by street, neighbourhood by neighbourhood. They're not procedurally generated, they shouldn't be," Zelnick stated. "That's what makes great entertainment."</p>

<p>Zelnick's words come soon after Take-Two saw its stock price plunge to an 11-month-low after Google rolled out Project Genie 3, an AI tool which allows users to generate virtual worlds in 60-second bursts from text prompts.</p>
<p>As Vikki reported at the weekend, several companies in addition to Take-Two - including CD Projekt, Unity and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a> - saw between 8-20 percent wiped off the value of their companies as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-companies-see-share-prices-plummet-following-the-launch-of-googles-very-limited-virtual-world-generator-project-genie">spooked investors seemingly went into the weekend thinking tech like this could replace the game development process</a>.</p>

            <p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has refuted rumours that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> will launch without physical copies.</p>
<p><a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/">In a recent interview with Variety</a>, Zelnick was asked to comment on previous reporting from <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/397290/gta-6-a-wersja-pudelkowa-sprzedawcy-zwiastuja-smutna-wiadomosc-dla-fanow-fizycznych-wydan.html">PPE</a> which stated that, according to a source, the highly-anticipated release would come out without physical copies in an attempt to curb spoilers from folks obtaining these copies early.</p>
<p>Zelnick responded to Variety: "That's not the plan" - a brief but sharp rebuttal of the prior reporting. So if you're keen on getting your actual hands on a copy of GTA6 day one, you should be in luck.</p>

<p>It's been an interesting period for GTA6. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/police-have-cordoned-off-rockstar-north-after-explosion-reportedly-caused-by-malfunctioning-boiler">Not only did Rockstar North suffer from a boiler explosion earlier this year</a>, but there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fired-employees-at-gta-6-studio-rockstar-denied-interim-pay-by-uk-tribunal-union-highlights-firms-flimsy-grounds-for-defence">an ongoing battle between the developer and fired employees</a>. These employees claim the company is union-busting, whereas Rockstar has claimed unauthorised sharing of confidential material was the reason they were let go. Recently, these impacted employees were denied interim pay pending further investigation by UK tribunal.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">Grand Theft Auto 6 is now set to release in November</a>, following a delay announced by Rockstar and Take Two last year. Don't feel too bad for Rockstar and Take Two though, as last year it also came out that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta5-more-sales-than-brazil-population-220-million">GTA5 had sold more than the population of Brazil</a>.</p>
