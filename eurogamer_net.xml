            <p>Players have blasted NetEase for a perceived lack of moderation across Marvel Rival lobbies.</p>
<p>"Forget about loser queue, I want to get out of racist queue," wrote redditor Murkwan on the official Marvel Rivals subreddit. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/forget_about_loser_queue_i_want_to_get_out_of//">post</a> has since been locked and deleted, but not before securing 1400 likes and almost 500 comments, the majority of which agreed with the OP.</p>

<figcaption>Marvel Rivals launched last December - here's its launch trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b0veB7q9P4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Whilst many players seem to get grief merely for playing certain characters (primarily Jeff the Landshark), others <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgk7gf9/">say</a> they regularly hear racist and sexist slurs, but "haven't gotten a ban notification for weeks" even when they report offending players (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-racism-no-username-moderation-called-out/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>"The problem is that this takes a toll on you," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgj7stz/">explained one player</a>, responding to a suggestion that players should "mute, report, block" and move on.</p>
<p>"As a woman, I don't use mic unless with my friends. If I speak with random teammates I'll always get some insult or disgusting comment. I just ignore, report and block, but it's not nice at all. It's not like 'haha what a loser'. First time maybe. The third game you hear something like that you just want to stop playing even if you love the game.</p>
<p>"So in cases of racism, it's the same," they added. "Yeah, ignore those losers, but reading or hearing insults over and over again makes you really want to not play anymore."</p>
<p>"I'm sick of people telling women what they need to do to counter the harassment they're experiencing like that's their job," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgk4gxa/">added</a> another respondent. "That's just the digital version of telling women not to dress some specific way or they're 'asking for it'."</p>
<p>Black players also contributed to the thread, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgjh1br/">many</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgjornc/">admitting</a> "comms stay off with randoms" completely, even in ranked play.</p>
<p>Other players have taken to X/Twitter, with this commenter writing: "Seriously?? MarvelRivals, wheres the moderation??" asked one player, including a <a href="https://x.com/comicyehu/status/1878646544142086654">screenshot</a> of a grossly antisemetic username. "Big fan of the game but seeing this mid game is gross."</p>
<p>"Its even worse [because] I can't leave the match without being penalised and having my own gameplay experience suffer, so I just have to play with this person," they <a href="https://x.com/comicyehu/status/1878647306997952674">added</a>.</p>
<p>"When you think about it, it's even weirder when it's in a Marvel game," said u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgkeiwq/">fistfightcrash</a>.</p>
<p>"Stan Lee was pretty clear that what the X-men was originally about was the civil rights movement. This is a Stan Lee quote from the 60s:</p>
<p>'Let's lay it right on the line. Bigotry and racism are among the deadliest social ills plaguing the world today. It's totally irrational, patently insane to condemn an entire race.'</p>
<p>"If you're racist, how could you possibly think this is your space?" they concluded. "Unless you're real old, Marvel was probably vocally anti-racist before you were born."</p>
<p>We've reached out to NetEase for comment.</p>
<p>Last month, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">cut jobs at its US-based Marvel Rivals creative team</a>, despite the game's significant success, claiming the decision was made to "optimise development efficiency". It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">insisted it "has not wavered in its global expansion plans"</a> amid reports it's unloading "as much as all" of its overseas game companies due to rising costs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Update 3 - expected to go live on 20th March - includes a new tutorial and Act 1 Career levels coming in Sandbox Mode, random rotation and scaling for scenery items, the return of the Vector Inverting Suspended coaster from the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-coaster">Planet Coaster</a> game, improved staff and guest behaviour, and "a bucket-load of flume improvements".</p>

<p>That's not all, either - Update 3 also brings the "highly-requested" return of the Western theme.</p>
<p>As for Update 4? Frontier's still being coy, but so far it's revealed players will able to build their own restaurants in which you'll have to "satisfy multiple guest needs and tolerances", Frontier Workshop extra features such as a Featured Creators list, alerts, and a What's Hot list, plus career maps in Sandbox mode in Act 2.</p> <div>

<p>We can also expect stock coasters (part 3), an as-yet-unannounced additional ride, plus "franchise mode improvements" and "ongoing stability and performance enhancements". Expect more details as we get closer to April.</p>
<p>The theme park sim sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2s-first-paid-dlc-releases-today-alongside-major-update">received its first major free update back in December</a>, alongside its first paid DLC, whilst <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2-roadmap-outlined-bringing-more-rides-and-continued-performance-improvements">February introduced new features like custom video billboards, custom speakers, synchronised coasters, and interchangeable coaster cars</a>.</p>
<p>"Planet Coaster 2's flexible creation tools are as compulsive as ever, but the fun butts up against an exhausting UI, uninspired management gameplay, and conspicuous content gaps that feel like cynical spaces for DLC," Matt wrote in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2-review">Eurogamer Planet Coaster 2 review</a>, awarding it 2 out of 5 stars.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Buckle up, ghost-hunting fans - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>'s Bleasdale House has had a terrifyingly good makeover.</p>
<p>The farmhouse - one of the first maps to launch with the hit horror in 2020 - gets a whole new look with 10th March's update. With 21 rooms spread across two floors and an attic space, developer Kinetic games said, "Bleasdale is an ideal location for budding ghost hunters to settle in for a potentially horrifying evening".</p>

<p>Following "major alterations", the house now boasts an all-new layout, brand new areas - including a new tea room and trophy room - and a new visual design, although the fan-favourite touches, such as the fireplace, piano, and loop-friendly dining table remain.</p>
<p>"The new dining room will be larger than before, and plays host to a large dining table in the centre, with lots of fragile new items for ghosts to play with," Kinetic teased. "The living room will feature a large fireplace, a grand piano, and some plush red leather sofas, perfect to hide the bloodstains for a cozy night in.</p>
<p>"Players will also be able to explore the new tea room and trophy room, each filled with a variety of intriguing collectors items - that is, if you find pet plate collections and ominous relics intriguing."</p>
<p>Perhaps most intriguingly of all, however, is Bleasdale's all-new garden, which now counts as a ghost room… which is bad news for babies like me, who play the entire game cowering in that doorway.</p>

            <p>Parents have filed a proposed class-action lawsuit against <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> maker Epic Games for allegedly creating "the illusion of scarcity" and "FOMO" with its store items.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/836523849/Epic-Games-Fortnite-Item-Shop-proposed-class-action">Polygon</a>, two parents have filed <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/836523849/Epic-Games-Fortnite-Item-Shop-proposed-class-action">a claim with a San Francisco court</a> on behalf of their children, citing "deceptive practices employed on a massive scale in one of the world’s most popular video games [Fortnite]".</p>

<p>"Some items, such as the ultra-rare Renegade Raider outfit, were offered briefly and have not been offered in more than six years," lawyers wrote. "Others disappear only to reappear weeks later. These offerings and their schedules are subjects of intense interest to Fortnite players."</p>
<p>Taking issue with how the Fortnite Store rotates items on its digital storefront, the complaint reads:</p>
<p>"But, when their countdown timers expired, Fortnite’s Item Shop products did not disappear or return to full price. They remained available for purchase, often at the same purportedly discounted rate, for many days or even weeks at a time. This was an unlawful scheme.</p>
<p>"Fake sales with made-up expiration times are deceptive and illegal under state statutes proscribing unfair and deceptive trade practices, which prohibit misleading advertisements concerning the reasons for or existence of price reductions and representing that items have characteristics or qualities they do not have. Numerous courts have found that fake countdown timers like Epic’s run afoul of these and similar prohibitions."</p>
<p>This is likely referring to a similar lawsuit in the Netherlands. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-to-appeal-11m-fine-over-unfair-commercial-practices-aimed-at-children">Epic Games is currently appealing a €1.1m (£968k) fine levied by the Dutch consumer regulator</a>, which similarly accused the company of "unfair commercial practices aimed at children". At the time of writing, that decision is still pending.</p>
<p>In a statement to press, Epic Games said: "This complaint contains factual errors and does not reflect how Fortnite operates. <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/new-and-upcoming-fortnite-shop-and-locker-changes">Last year we removed the countdown timer in the Item Shop</a> and we offer protections against unwanted purchases. This includes a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/updates-to-fortnite-purchase-cancellation-and-social-settings">hold-to-purchase mechanic</a>, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category_Fortnite/c-Fortnite_Billingandpayment/how-to-refund-or-return-item-shop-purchases-in-fortnite-a000084707">instant purchase cancellations</a>, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category_Fortnite/c-Fortnite_Billingandpayment/how-to-refund-or-return-item-shop-purchases-in-fortnite-a000084707">self service returns for shop purchases</a> and an explicit yes/no choice to save payment information.</p>
<p>"When a player creates an Epic account and indicates they are under 13, they are unable to make real money purchases until a parent provides consent. Once they do, we offer industry leading parental controls including PIN protecting purchases. We will fight these claims."</p>
<p>Earlier this week we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-maker-suing-prolific-thief-who-stole-and-sold-player-accounts-on-an-industrial-scale">Epic Games is suing a player accused of stealing and selling countless user accounts</a>, and profiting further by flogging details of his tactics to other wannabe thieves.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
