            <p>
Following last year's slam-dunk <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake, the beloved survival horror sequel is being reinterpreted yet again, this time in the form of new movie adaptation Return to Silent Hill. And now, three years after its announcement, it's been given a release date of 23rd June 2026.
</p>
<p>
Return to Silent Hill was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-konamis-silent-hill-october-2022-showcase">originally unveiled in 2022</a>, alongside a variety of gaming projects including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-ascension-fails-to-impress-with-greedy-monetisation-and-cluttered-ui">unloved Silent Hill: Ascension</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">masterful Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, the upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, and No Code's still-mysterious Silent Hill Townfall.
</p>
<p>
Amid that flurry of gaming news, Return to Silent Hill was perhaps a little lost in the throng, but the key bit of information was that it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-film-detailed">see Christophe Gans take on directing duties once more</a>. Gans, of course, previously helmed 2006's Sean-Bean-starring original Silent Hill movie, which certainly captured the game series' atmosphere - even if it did all start to fall apart in the last stretch, when it suddenly decided it needed to explain itself in a ham-fisted exposition dump that even some high-velocity barbed wire couldn't save.

<p>
Since Return to Silent Hill's initial unveiling, it's been confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-casts-war-horses-jeremy-irvine-as-james">War Horse's Jeremy Irvine will star as Silent Hill 2 protagonist James</a>, with Hannah Emily Anderson in the role of his "one true love" Mary (an early leak suggested the two won't be married in this version). More recently, Gans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-film-will-be-faithful-adaptation-of-silent-hill-2-distributor-promises">insisted his adaptation would be a "faithful" one</a>, although a careful reading of the movie's synopsis does imply some potentially notable changes:
</p>
<p>
"James, a man broken after his relationship with the love of his life, Mary, ends," reads the official synopsis. "When a mysterious letter from her calls him back to Silent Hill, he finds a once-recognisable town transformed by an unknown evil. While James desperately searches for Mary he encounters terrifying creatures and begins to unravel the mystery of what happened to the town. But as he descends deeper into the darkness the secrets he uncovers lead to a horrifying truth, and James finds himself struggling to hold on long enough to save his one true love."
</p>
<p>
We'll know if Return to Silent Hill does its source material justice when it <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/silent-night-deadly-night-return-silent-hill-release-dates-1236436030/">hits the big screen</a> on 23rd June next year. However it ends up, Bloober's remake - which has now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-passes-another-sales-milestone">sold over 2m copies</a> - is a fine way to experience a bonafide gaming classic. And the studio is about to do it all over again, as it embarks on its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-silent-hill-remake-has-been-revealed-during-konami-press-start-showcase">recently announced remake of Silent Hill 1</a>.

            <p>
Everybody loves palpating their turnips; just look at the success of Stardew Valley and its ilk for proof of that. But it turns out people <em>really</em> love some vegetable action, if the staggering success of Roblox game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grow-a-garden">Grow a Garden</a> is any indication, given it's seemingly smashed through <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s previous gargantuan record for most players at the same time.
</p>
<p>
Let's break out some numbers. According to <a href="https://romonitorstats.com/experience/126884695634066/">third-party monitoring tools</a>, Grow a Garden - the specifics of which we'll get to shortly - soared past 16m concurrent players this weekend on Roblox (16,411,769 to be exact). By way of comparison, Fortnite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-showstopping-marvel-finale-drops-a-huge-cliffhanger">announced record-breaking concurrents of 15.3m players</a> during its Marvel season finale event back in Covid-era 2020.
</p>
<p>
So what, you may be wondering, has garnered all this attention? Grow a Garden is, according to its <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/126884695634066/Grow-a-Garden">official description</a> from developer The Garden Game, very much what it sounds like. It's a game of buying seeds, shoving them in the ground, then waiting for your blueberries, coconuts, daffodils etc. to grow - which they'll happily do whether you're in-game or offline.
</p>
<p>
After that, you can sell your massive produce for profit, purchasing more seeds or temporary boosts you'll need to slowly craft in real-time, then start the whole cycle over again. Frankly, absolutely nothing about it sounds like the sort of thing that might capture the imagination of 16m players all at once, but then I'm not a 13-year-old looking to do something mindless online with my friends after school. Also, there're <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-grow-a-garden-pets-eggs-how-to-get">Grow a Garden pets</a>, so maybe that's the appeal.
</p>
<p>
As to how Grow a Garden's impressive 16m concurrent users stacks up with other games, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> currently holds the Steam record for most concurrent players, coming in at a comparatively paltry 3.3m, while it's nearest rival, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, barely squeaks over the 2.4m player threshold. In fact, Steam itself recently saw a concurrent high of 40m players, so Grow a Garden's 16m looks positively gargantuan given we're talking about a single game.
</p>
<p>
Whether all those players <em>should</em> be playing Roblox is another matter entirely, of course, given the game continues to be embroiled in controversy amid ongoing accusations of child safety failures. Developer Roblox Corporation last year announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-announces-policy-changes-for-pre-teen-users-amid-ongoing-accusations-of-child-safety-failures">sweep of policy changes</a> - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-adding-further-parental-controls-as-its-belated-push-to-improve-child-safety-continues">updated parental controls</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-banning-social-hangouts-for-kids-under-13-due-to-user-behaviour-that-can-potentially-pose-a-risk">banning of social hangouts</a> for children under 13 - in a belated effort to improve things. Currently, Roblox Corporation is being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-under-investigation-by-the-us-securities-and-exchange-commission">investigated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission</a>, possibly due to reports it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/damning-roblox-report-claims-company-inflates-player-numbers-to-investors-by-as-much-as-42">previously misled investors by inflating player numbers</a>, although the reason hasn't been made public.
