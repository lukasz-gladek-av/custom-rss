            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has received another update, which along with some general fixes also makes changes to courses selected in Random during an online VS Race.</p>
<p>While the update notes for Ver. 1.1.2, as it is known, simply state the Mario Kart World team has "adjusted courses selected in 'Random' when selecting next course in a wireless 'VS Race'", there is more to it than it may first appear.</p>

<p>Prior to this update going live, if a player selected Randon during course selection while racing online, it would always result in a more traditional three lap race, rather than Mario Kart World's community dubbed "intermission tracks". These are the tracks that essentially run in one long and almost linear layout, and connect Mario Kart World's, well, world.</p>
<p>Now, however, these intermission tracks have been added to the online Random fray, which means playing Mario Kart World in a more 'traditional' way with consistent three-lapped courses is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Some online are rather unhappy with this development. "Nintendo has basically stepped in and said 'no, you're supposed to play this way'," <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-updates-mario-kart-worlds-online-removes-the-only-guaranteed-way-to-play-normal-3-lap-races-with-randoms.1228638/">reads one comment on ResetEra</a>. "They saw players clamoring for a more traditional online mode and did... the exact opposite of what they wanted."</p> <div>
