            <p>Contrary to previous reports, Romero Games has not closed, and the team is now in contact with a number of publishers which may be able to save its cancelled game.</p>
<p>Last week following layoffs at Microsoft, Romero Games - the studio set up by Doom creator John Romero and his wife Brenda - announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-next-shooter-project-loses-funding-following-microsoft-cuts">its publisher had pulled funding for its game along with "other unannounced projects at other studios"</a>. While Microsoft was not mentioned as being involved, this much was inferred.</p>
<p>Since that initial statement from Romero Games, there have been rumblings the studio had been closed down. Thankfully though, this is not the case. In a new statement on social media, Romero Games again confirmed its funding had been pulled and its game cancelled, but the studio itself remains open.</p>

<p>"We want to address recent reports regarding the status of Romero Games. These reports have contained inaccuracies, and we feel it's important to set the record straight," the statement reads.</p>
<p>"Romero Games is not closed, and we are doing everything in our power to ensure that it does not come to that. Any suggestion otherwise is factually incorrect. Indeed, we were in the studio today to discuss next steps with the team."</p>
<p>While the studio remains open, recent events have meant Romero Games has had to "reassess the entire staffing" at the company. It also noted that due to previous confidentiality agreements, it is unable to share who its original publisher was.</p>
<p>There is still hope though, and Romero Games has already been contacted by "several" other publishers which are "interested in helping us bring the game across the finish line". This is now something Romero Games is evaluating.</p><p>

"We appreciate the outpouring of support and will share further updates as we are able," the studio closed.

</p><p>Resharing this statement, a defiant John Romero said this was a team and a game "worth fighting for".</p> <div>

<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">Microsoft sent shockwaves through the industry when it laid off in excess of 9000 employees across the company</a>.</p>
<p>As part of these layoffs, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">games such as Rare's Everwild were cancelled</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">Perfect Dark studio The Initiative was shut down</a>. In the time since, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/joanna-dark-actor-asks-fans-to-call-for-perfect-dark-to-be-saved-as-adam-jensens-actor-details-financial-loss-due-to-cancellation">Joanna Dark actor Alix Wilton Regan has implored fans to use their voices to save Perfect Dark</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-studio-not-closed-as-publishers-express-interest-in-saving-cancelled-game]]></content:encoded>
