<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> is getting a "cutting-edge ray tracing" overhaul courtesy of Nvidia's RTX Remix modding tools, and there's a playable demo coming on 18th March ahead of a full release.
</p>
<p>
As Nvidia explains it, RTX Remix is a way to "modernise classic games, enhancing their visuals while preserving the core gameplay that makes them special." And Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2022-portal-with-rtx-and-the-new-retro-ray-tracing-revolution">impressed by the tech's potential</a> when he took a look at Portal RTX back in 2022.
</p>
<p>
Now though, after a year in beta, Nvidia's RTX Remix tools have been officially launched into the wild, gaining the likes of DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation and RTX Neural Rendering along the way. More pertinent to this story, however, is the news Nvidia's marking the occasion by releasing a Half-Life 2 RTX demo, showcasing the technology's capabilities, on March 18th.

<p>
Half-Life 2 RTX is being released in conjunction with Orbifold Studios, and its impending Steam demo - which is only available to owners of Valve's full Half-Life 2 - will specifically feature Ravenholm and Nova Prospekt, both given an RTX Remix makeover. A full version of Half-Life 2 RTX by Orbifold is planned to release "at a later date". And if you don't already have Half-Life 2 in your Steam library, you might like to know <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/">there's currently 80 percent off</a>.
</p>
<p>
"RTX Remix requires a GeForce RTX GPU to create RTX Remix Mods," Nvidia notes, "while mods and games built using Remix are compatible with any hardware that can run Vulkan ray-traced games." Full details of today's release can be found in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/rtx-remix-half-life-2-rtx-demo-launching-march-18/">Nvidia's announcement</a>. All of which should stand you in good stead for Half-Life 3, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-fans-desperate-for-half-life-3-news-say-they-have-evidence-its-hidden-in-steams-back-end">might just happen after all</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/konamis-japan-set-silent-hill-f-resurfaces-with-eerie-new-trailer-and-fresh-details<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's been a good long while since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> was unveiled as part of Konami's four-game series revival back in 2022. But now that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Bloober Team's superb Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> is behind us, the publisher is turning its attention to its curious Japan-set follow-up. And thanks to its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pPKJevpvZI">latest Silent Hill Transmissions stream</a>, we've got an eerie new trailer and a few more hints at what's in store.
</p>
<p>
Back during its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-announced-from-resident-evil-reverse-developer">initial 2022 announcement</a>, Konami revealed Silent Hill f is being developed by Neobards Entertainment (which has previously served as a support studio for Capcom's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>), with creature and character design by Kera, and a script by When They Cry writer Ryukishi07. And courtesy of its latest update, we now know a little more.
</p>
<p>Silent Hill f is, for instance, set in the 1960s, its events unfolding in the rural town of Ebisugaoka - based on Kanayama, Gero, in the Gifu Prefecture. Here, we meet our protagonist Shimizu Hinako, an "ordinary teenager" who suddenly finds her home shrouded in fog and changed in "horrific" ways. As Silent Hill f play out, she'll explore a town she no longer recognises, solving puzzles, fighting strange enemies, and eventually having to make a "beautiful yet terrifying" decision that lies at the heart of the game.

<p>
That idea of "beauty in terror" is a theme Konami repeatedly returned throughout its latest Transmissions episode, explaining that while Silent Hill f retains the elements of psychological horror long-time fans will associate with the series, its setting allows it to deal with some more classically Japanese ideas, such as the notion that "when something becomes too beautiful and perfect, it instead becomes deeply unsettling".
</p>
<p>
It also spent a bit of time addressing Silent Hill f's notable shift away from the titular town that's been the focus of the series since its debut in 1999. Sharing his own perspective, Ryukishi07 explained that while Silent Hill can be considered a physical place with a dark history, it's equally a series "about portraying characters' struggles with the evil within themselves - sin, discontent, and conflict - in a visually striking way". And this, he noted, is a concept Silent Hill f retains, adding, "It's a gateway into the psychological battles of the human mind."
</p>
<p>
Konami also confirmed the return of long-time Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka, although this time he'll only be creating music for Ebisugaoka's Fog World. Music for its Otherworld (known as the Dark Shrine in Silent Hill f) will be composed by Kensuke Inage, whose musical credits include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>, Samurai Showdown, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-fox-guard">Star Fox Guard</a>. In a message shared during the stream, Inage explained his compositions will use "imagery from shrines, blending ancient Japanese court music with ambient echoes", all interwoven with techniques intended to connect the player to the protagonist's "agonies, internal conflict, fear, and other emotions."
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, Konami teased "creatures that really infiltrate players' psyches", alongside easter eggs for long-time fans to uncover, despite Silent Hill f's new setting. And that's pretty much all we're getting for now. Silent Hill f doesn't have a release date yet, but it's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC - and Konami says it'll have "plenty more to share in the future". Until then, there's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag157nqMV0Q">new trailer</a>, which you can watch above.
</p>
<p>
Silent Hill f was one of four new Silent Hill games to be revealed back in 2022. PlayStation 5 freebie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-the-short-message-review">Silent Hill: The Short Message</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s Silent Hill 2 Remake launched last year, and its fourth project, Silent Hill: Townfall, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-townfall-is-a-new-entry-to-the-series-from-stories-untold-developer-no-code">being developed by Stories Untold and Observation developer No Code</a>. Annapurna Interactive is still set to serve as the latter game's publisher, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">a "mass exodus" of staff</a> at the end of last year.

            <p>
Point-and-click fans rejoice! After a long (and, if you're me, impatient) wait, Wadjet Eye Games - the dependably brilliant studio behind the likes of Unavowed and the Blackwell series - is finally ready to share a release date for its intriguing time-travelling adventure, Old Skies. And it's close, launching for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Switch on 23th April.
</p>
<p>
Old Skies, which was originally announced all the way back in June 2022, cast players as Fia Quinn - a time agent for the ChronoZen agency who's been tasked with keeping a close eye on seven travellers as they take their own trips to the past. "Some are simply curious," explains Wadjet Eye. "Others have unfinished business to resolve. And they've all put down a lot of money for the trip, so it's vital that you keep them happy while ensuring they follow the rules. But what could go wrong? It's only time travel, after all."
</p>
<p>
Seven travellers means seven distinct time periods spanning over 200 years of history to explore, with Old Skies taking players from speakeasies of Prohibition to the gangs of the Gilded Age, and even the morning of September 11th where a murder is waiting to be solved. It's got paradoxes to escape, puzzles to overcome - some requiring a spot of temporal thinking - and even the possibility of your adventure coming to a fatal halt. Although, as Wadjet Eye notes, the whole time travel thing means death is not the end.

<p>
Away from the story stuff, Old Skies features some (by Wadjet Eye's standards) positively futuristic 1920x1080 artwork - it marks the first time the developer has eschewed the chunky, distinctly old-school pixels of its past adventures - as well as music by Unavowed composer Thomas Regin, and full voice acting from the studio's "largest cast yet". You can get a general idea of how all that comes together in the trailer above, and Wadjet Eye's also released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAQ9UMzqZUQ">new trailer focusing on one of Old Skies seven cases</a>.
</p>
<p>
So there you go! Old Skies launches on 23rd April via Switch's eShop and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1346360/Old_Skies/">Steam</a>. And speaking as big fan of Wadjet Eye's consistently excellent back catalogue (which, incidentally, is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/WadjetEyeGames">currently cheap as chips thanks to the Steam Spring Sale</a>), I can't blimmin' wait.
