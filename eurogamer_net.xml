            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> is pretty sure plenty of people will hate his upcoming release OD, but he is ok with that in the short term.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">Xbox horror game OD was first announced back in 2023</a>, though Kojima stopped short of actually telling us all that much about it. Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer and Udo Kier are all tied to the project, and there is also some involvement with director Jordan Peele, who is known for his films Get Out and Nope.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Kojima said it's "a game and at the same time a movie and at the same time a new form of media", so make of that what you will.</p>

<p>The game creator has now shared a little bit more about OD, though I really do mean a little. In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-interview">Ssense</a>, Kojima said OD was "something totally different", and people are going to either "love it or hate it".</p>
<p>The publication added Kojima will of course digest all the various reactions to OD when it comes out, citing platforms like YouTube and X, but as for the actual reception to the game when it releases? Well, apparently that won't matter to Kojima, at least for another decade or so.</p>
<p>"The real evaluations come after - 10 or 20 years from now," Kojima told the publication. This attitude isn't new for Kojima. Earlier this year, following positive playtests for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-isnt-interested-in-appealing-to-the-mass-market-but-death-stranding-2-playtests-proving-popular">Kojima said he wasn't "interested in appealing to the mass market"</a>.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting, the critical reception to the first Death Stranding has warmed since its release, so perhaps we'll see the same with OD in future.</p>

<p>As well as OD on Xbox, Kojima also has an action-espionage game in the works with PlayStation known as Physint. This game came about when the designer - who is among many things known for his part in bringing the Metal Gear games to life - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-says-he-decided-to-make-physint-for-fans-after-sickness-made-him-reconsider-his-priorities">experienced a period of sickness and surgery which when combined with thoughts of his own mortality convinced him to reassess what his priorities are</a>, and instead do something fans had been asking him to do for years.</p>
<p>"Every day on social media, from users all around the world, people have been asking me to create another Metal Gear and stuff like that," Kojima said last year.</p>
<p>More recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">Kojima released Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, to wide acclaim. As for Konami's upcoming remake of the third Metal Gear Solid game, no, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-hideo-kojima-wont-be-playing-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Kojima will not be playing it</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/like-marmite-hideo-kojima-says-you-will-either-love-or-hate-od]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo sold 5.82m <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> consoles worldwide in its first month of release and 5.63m copies of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, meaning the launch title has an attachment rate of around 97 percent.</p>
<p>The figures come from <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">Nintendo's latest earnings release</a> as of 30th June, where the company added software sales for Switch 2 reached 8.67m units in that same period. That means Mario Kart World accounts for 65 percent of all software sales on the new console.</p>
<p>Nintendo added, in the seven weeks since launch, the Switch 2 has sold over 6m units worldwide. Even so, Nintendo has noted demand is exceeding supply in many countries.</p>

<p>Clearly the console and racing game bundle has proven a popular option for customers. Mario Kart World was the primary launch game for the new console, and was also available to buy separately.</p>
<p>Shortly after the console's launch, Nintendo announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-nintendos-fastest-selling-hardware-ever">Switch 2 was the company's fastest-selling hardware ever</a>, moving 3.5m units worldwide in its first four days on sale. Last week, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-video-game-hardware-device-in-us-history-usurping-the-ps4">Switch 2 is the fastest-selling video game hardware device in the US</a>, beating the PS4.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, sales of the original Switch console have now reached 153.10m units.</p>
<p>This year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-expects-switch-1-to-become-its-best-selling-hardware-ever-this-year-but-fall-just-short-of-ps2-record">Nintendo expects to sell 4.5m Switch consoles</a>, which would see the console usurping the Nintendo DS as the company's highest-selling piece of hardware - it's now less than 1m sales behind. That's still quite a way from the PS2, though, which is estimated to have sold 160m units as the best selling console of all time.</p>
<p>Overall, Nintendo's net sales grew by 132.1 percent year-on-year thanks to the Switch 2's launch, while gross profit increased by 21.4 percent to 185.1bn yen. The gross profit margin declined due to a lower profit margin of the Switch 2 compared with the previous console.</p>
<p>Digital sales decreased by 13.5 percent, but still account for 59.3 percent of all software sales. Nintendo attributes this to a "decrease in sales of downloadable versions of packaged software".</p>
<p>Nintendo has not changed its financial forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year, where it expects to sell 15m Switch 2 consoles worldwide. This has not been impacted by US tariff measures, echoing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-sales-forecast-not-affected-by-production-or-tariffs-nintendo-reiterates">statement from Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa in May</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mega-dragonite-debuts-in-fresh-look-at-pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> will be released on Switch consoles on 16th October, as one of Nintendo's key first-party games. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-pops-up-on-the-korean-ratings-board-sparking-hope-well-get-a-firm-release-date-soon">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> remains a 2025 release without a specific launch date.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Nintendo revealed more third-party games due for release this year - here's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">everything shown at the Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/almost-all-switch-2-users-have-bought-mario-kart-world-as-sales-of-new-console-pass-6m-worldwide]]></content:encoded>
