            <p>
In The Valley of the Gods, the promising but now permanently "on hold" adventure from the team behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/firewatch">Firewatch</a>, had some eye-popping water technology. 
</p>
<p>
Matthew Wilde, who worked on Firewatch at Campo Santo before the team was absorbed into Valve six years ago, has now <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skilful.bsky.social/post/3lakopz32k22x">shared</a> a fresh look at In The Valley of the Gods on social media, showing what could have been. 
</p>
<p>
"I do often tend to work on liquidy things," Wilde wrote. "This was the water test we did at Campo Santo pre Valve move." 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Matthew Wilde, the Valve developer behind the water shader for Counter-Strike 2, has shared a rare gameplay footage. It shows the water technology that was tested for In The Valley of Gods before Valve acquired the company Campo Santo. Team shelved the game not so long after… <a href="https://t.co/wIs6Im8KYx">pic.twitter.com/wIs6Im8KYx</a></p>— ‎Gabe Follower (@gabefollower) <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1855941378301141312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 11, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>
There is, sadly, absolutely no suggestion we'll see In the Valley of the Gods anytime soon. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firewatch-review">Firewatch was excellent</a>, and Campo Santo's follow-up - which would have followed a budding filmmaker as she explored 1920s Egypt in search of archeological secrets - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firewatch-developer-reveals-next-game-in-the-valley-of-the-gods">looked hugely promising</a>. 
</p>
<p>
But, in 2019, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-acquires-firewatch-developer-campo-santo">Valve and the potential to work on Half-Life: Alyx came calling</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firewatch-devs-egyptian-adventure-in-the-valley-of-gods-officially-on-hold-at-valve">In The Valley of the Gods was later confirmed to have been shelved indefinitely</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Wilde's reference to working on "liquidy things" is a reference to some of his other work since, such as the impressive water shader technology in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a> that lets you slosh around bottles of beer, as well as the water technology in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>. 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Spent a good chunk of lock-down doing this important work. Boozy liquid shader, now available in the latest update for Half-Life: Alyx <a href="https://t.co/Iw9h98pmEg">pic.twitter.com/Iw9h98pmEg</a></p>— Matthew Wilde (@skilful) <a href="https://twitter.com/skilful/status/1265875309980643329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2020</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
What's next for Wilde and his former Campo Santo colleagues? Well, there's rumblings that there's more from Valve's most famous series on the horizon. Is it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer">finally time for Half-Life 3</a>?

We probably won't flag up when every single game's soundtrack comes to Nintendo Music, but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wii-sports">Wii Sports</a> is a bit of a favourite round these parts. 
</p>
<p>
So yes, 30 music tracks from Nintendo's seminal Wii launch title are now part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-music-app-sees-mario-maker-take-on-spotify-and-youtube-playlists">Nintendo Music</a>, the company's new soundtrack app which launched last month, as a fresh perk for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. 
</p>
<p>
More than 82 million people owned a copy of Wii Sports and millions more - friends, siblings, grandparents - played its simple but brilliant motion-controlled takes on tennis, golf and bowling. Also baseball and boxing, but they weren't as good.

These tunes are ingrained in my memory from countless evening sessions playing nine holes of Wii Golf at uni or short matches of Wii Tennis on breaks in the staff room at my student job. There's something about Wii Sports which still stands unmatched - I still dig out the original Wii Sports to play in multiplayer sessions today.

Here's the full list of Wii Sports tracks now included in Nintendo Music. Altogether, these only amount to 18 minutes of music, but many of these classics can be extended to versions lasting up to 60 minutes each for your continued audio pleasure.

            <p>
Ubisoft's shutdown of The Crew has sparked a legal challenge from two fans who have this month filed to begin a class action lawsuit.
</p>
<p>
Online racer The Crew became unplayable and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown">removed from owner's accounts</a> after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">Ubisoft pulled the plug on its servers</a> back in March. The game was 10 years old and had been replaced by a successor, but Ubisoft's decision still sparked wider concern among video game fans increasingly concerned about preservation and consumer rights.
</p>
<p>
"Imagine you buy a pinball machine, and years later, you enter your den to go play it, only to discover that all the paddles are missing, the pinball and bumpers are gone, and the monitor that proudly displayed your unassailable high score is removed," the plaintiff's lawyers wrote in the new lawsuit, as first reported by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/476979/ubisoft-the-crew-shut-down-lawsuit-class-action">Polygon</a>.

<p>
"Turns out the pinball manufacturer decided to come into your home, gut the insides of the pinball machine, and remove your ability to play the game that you bought and thought you owned."
</p>
<p>
The lawsuit alleges that its plaintiffs - and likely many others - were unaware that legally they owned only a license to the software, even if they owned a physical copy, and would not have purchased the game if they had been aware of its eventual complete shutdown.
</p>
<p>
Its plaintiffs are now seeking approval for a wider class action lawsuit which could pay out for owners of the game.
</p>
<p>
"We announced on December 14, 2023 that after almost a decade of support, we would be decommissioning The Crew 1 on 31st March 2024," a Ubisoft spokesperson told Eurogamer earlier this year. (The company has declined to comment on this new legal action.) 
</p>
<p>
"While we understand this may be disappointing for players, it was necessary due to server infrastructure and licensing constraints."
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's decision helped spark the Stop Killing Games campaign, which aims to end the practice of publishers "destroying" video games after their sale to customers. 
</p>
<p>
379,280 people have since signed a petition to the EU that calls for measures to ensure games remain playable get legal backing - specifically, that games remain in a working state with an offline mode when publisher support does wind down.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-killing-the-crew-ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes">Ubisoft subsequently committed to providing offline modes for The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest</a>, which will be playable if (more likely, when) those games also get their servers switched off. 
</p>
<p>
While there's no suggestion game publishers will be required to keep online servers active forever, there does seem to be a greater acknowledgement that consumers lack awareness of what they are acquiring when buying a game. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-now-warns-customers-theyre-only-buying-a-license-when-paying-for-a-game">Steam now warns customers they're only buying a license when paying for a game</a>, for example, as fresh California legislation requires storefronts to make it clear customers are only buying a license for digital content rather than outright owning it.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-ubisoft-shut-down-the-crews-servers-this-group-of-modders-began-work-to-bring-them-back">Eurogamer spoke to a group of The Crew fans taking matters into their own hands</a> by attempting to use mods to bring the game back online using private servers.
