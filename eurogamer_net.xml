            <p>Bioshock creator Ken Levine has stepped out from the shadows to remind the world about his next project Judas, the first-person action adventure game from Ghost Story Games, through a new dev blog.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.judasthegame.com/news/dev-log-1">This post</a> revealed a new feature called Villainy - a player-choice driven system that modifies who'll become an antagonist throughout the game. Basically, you start off with "the big three" being on good terms, but if you ignore one of them for too long they get cross and try to kill you.</p>
<p>The post continues with Levine laying praise on Shadow of Mordor's Nemesis system, and how it allowed the player to develop relationships with various orcs. This it seems is a substantial source of inspiration for the Villainy system in Judas, with one of the Big Three turning nasty feeling like "losing a friend".</p>

<p>There's still no release date for Judas. <a href="http://eurogamer.net/games/judas">First revealed back in 2022</a>, it's been largely silent on the Judas front ever since. Though, with an indication that more dev blogs are on the way, maybe we're steering a little closer to a world with Judas in it. That'll at the very least mark one of those mystery gameshow titles off the "what ever happened toâ€¦" list.</p>

            <p>Bethesda has teased an upcoming update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> meant to improve space travel, following a recent bit of data mining from the community that discovered hints of an overhauled "cruise mode".</p>
<p>Now, a hasty patch was uploaded to remove hints of the cruise mode from the files, but since then Bethesda have come forward with its hands up and admitted that yes, cruise mode is real and is on the way somewhat soon.</p>
<p>This came out via a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zknfAghd-s">developer spotlight on Tim Lamb</a>, a senior producer at Bethesda. In this video Lamb states: "We have some exciting things in development, including free updates and player-requested features, as well as a new DLC story."</p>

<p>Lamb continued: "I can't share all the details yet, but part of the team is focusing on space gameplay to make the journeys more rewarding. We're also adding new game systems and some smaller surprises. Plus, there's some exciting content coming from our Verified Creators."</p><p>This little tease also comes in the wake of a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1716740/view/529852742889375536">Steam post</a> promising exciting updates coming to Starfield later this year. With the game's absence from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> this year this has led to some confusion, but it looks like something big is on the horizon for Bethesda's Sci-Fi RPG.</p>

            <p>Crystal Dynamics has announced the "difficult decision" to lay off more staff, citing "evolving business conditions". It added the decision was not made lightly, but was necessary to "ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/">post shared on LinkedIn</a>, the studio thanked those impacted by these layoffs for their "hard work, talent and passion", stating Crystal Dynamics is "committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition".</p>
