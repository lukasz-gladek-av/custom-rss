            <p>Publisher Take-Two fully supports <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> following its decision to delay <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> into next year.</p>
<p>GTA 6 was initially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-highly-confident-of-autumn-2025-release-window">slated for an unspecified release this Autumn</a>. However, just this afternoon, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">developer announced it was delaying the release until 26th May, 2026</a>. "With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto 6 is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve," Rockstar said today.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250502895390/en/Take-Two-Interactive-Software-Inc.-Reiterates-Expectations-to-Achieve-Sequential-Increases-in-and-Record-Levels-of-Net-Bookings-in-Fiscal-2026-and-2027">Take-Two's head Strauss Zelnick has responded to the delay</a>, stating the company supports "fully Rockstar Games taking additional time to realise their creative vision", adding on its release GTA 6 will be "a groundbreaking, blockbuster entertainment experience that exceeds audience expectations".</p>

<p>Said Zelnick: "While we take the movement of our titles seriously and appreciate the vast and deep global anticipation for Grand Theft Auto 6, we remain steadfast in our commitment to excellence. As we continue to release our phenomenal pipeline, we expect to deliver a multi-year period of growth in our business and enhanced value for our shareholders."</p>
<p>The Take-Two head added he still expects the company to have a prosperous 12 months, even with GTA 6 being a little further off on the horizon, now releasing during the company's 2027 fiscal year.</p>
<p>In a press release, Take-Two said the expectation is that "the company will achieve sequential increases in, and record levels of, net bookings in fiscal 2026 and 2027".</p>
<p>Take-Two is slated to release its next financial results on 15th May.</p>
