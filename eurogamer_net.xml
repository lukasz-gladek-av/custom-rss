April's a busy month in the world of The Last of Us. Not only is Part 2 coming to PC, the long-awaited second season of HBO's live-action TV adaptation begins too - and Sony is squeezing into the middle of that mushroom-scented sandwich with a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/06/first-look-at-the-dualsense-wireless-controller-the-last-of-us-limited-edition/">limited edition DualSense controller</a> themed around developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s acclaimed games.
</p>
<p>
The DualSense wireless controller – The Last of Us Limited Edition, as it's officially known, arrives on 10th April (Part 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-finally-gets-itself-a-pc-release-date">comes to PC on the 3rd</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">show starts on the 13th</a>), featuring "glossy trophy icons" representing key moments, characters, and events from both games.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, you've been lumbered with me instead of Eurogamer's resident The Last of Us expert Victoria Kennedy for this one - so instead of an insightful breakdown explaining how all the little pictures relate to the game, my only passing thought is the black and white design and subtle embossing looks surprisingly tasteful. Not sure about those big white icons though.

<p>
Anyway, here's what Naughty Dog has to say about the whole thing: "We wanted to ensure that both instalments of The Last of Us are represented, via trophy icons printed in black gloss across the controller body. Among the trophies, three particular images will immediately stand out for TLOU fans: The firefly, moth, and wolf. Players will recognise the Fireflies’ iconic spray-painted logo that originated in Part 1, while the moth and wolf represent the intertwining lives and duality between Ellie and Abby in Part 2."

<p>
Sony's The Last of Us DualSense controller launches on 10th April and costs £74.99 / €84.99 / $84.99. However, anyone looking to jump in line early - given the "limited quantities" it's being released in - can <a href="http://direct.playstation.com/">pre-order on the PlayStation website</a> starting at 10am, 14th March, local time.
</p>
<p>
All this The Last of Us activity comes as Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann this week warned fans, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-boss-says-dont-bet-on-there-being-a-the-last-of-us-part-3">"don't bet" on there being a The Last of Us Part 3</a>.

            <p>
A year after developer Ironmace managed to get its free-to-play medieval extraction looter Dark and Darker back on digital storefronts amid a lengthy legal tussle with South Korean game company Nexon, it's been delisted again, this time from the Epic Games Store.
</p>
<p>
Dark and Darker's legal troubles began in 2023 (shortly after its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/medieval-battle-royale-alike-dark-and-darker-is-having-a-moment-in-steam-next-fest">demo had a bit of a moment on Steam</a>) when Nexon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-developer-denies-stolen-code-allegations-following-police-raid">accused Ironmace of copyright infringement</a>, claiming members of the development team had used "materials and assets they worked on during their time" at Nexon to create Dark and Darker - an accusation Ironmace repeatedly denied.
</p>
<p>
As the legal accusations continued to fly, Nexon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-has-been-removed-from-steam-following-a-cease-and-desist-demand">issued a cease and desist order forcing the game off Steam</a>, but things appeared to be looking up for Ironmance after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-dev-says-nexons-trade-secret-and-copyright-lawsuit-against-it-has-been-dismissed">court dismissed Nexon's request for an injunction</a> last January. By March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-has-been-removed-from-steam-following-a-cease-and-desist-demand">Dark and Darker had released on the Epic Games Store</a> and it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-is-back-on-steam-and-now-its-free-to-play">finally returned to Steam in June</a> - but it looks like the dance is beginning again, with Dark and Darker having now been removed from the Epic Games Store.

<p>
Addressing the situation in a message shared on the official Dark and Darker Discord (as <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/dark-and-darker/delisted-epic-games-store">spotted by PCGamesN</a>), developer Ironmace wrote, "The decision appears to be based on claims made by opposing parties in an ongoing legal dispute. We are currently working to understand the exact reasoning behind this removal."
</p>
<p>
"It seems that the removal process is not yet fully complete," the studio added, "as Dark and Darker is no longer listed, but Dark and Darker: Legendary Status is still available for purchase. Please be aware of this potential confusion."
</p>
<p>
Ironmace didn't explicitly name the opposing parties in its "ongoing legal dispute", but these latest developments are almost certainly connected to the studio's battle with Nexon, which reached another milestone earlier this year. In February, a South Korean court ruled Ironmace hadn't committed copyright infringement with Dark and Darker, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-developer-sued-by-nexon-for-copyright-infringement">Nexon had argued</a> - but the studio wasn't entirely off the hook. The court also decided Ironmace <em>had</em> infringed on Nexon's trade secrets, ordering the studio to cough up around $6m USD in damages.
</p>
<p>
At the time, Nexon said it "planned to seek further legal judgment through a higher court", so there's a good chance Dark and Darker's removal from Epic is related to Nexon's escalation. We've reached out to Epic and Ironmace for comment on the situation.
