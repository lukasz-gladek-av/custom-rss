            <p>Nintendo's Legend of Zelda film adaptation will be released at some point in the next five years and two months.</p>
<p>Nintendo hasn't shared a specific year for Link and Zelda's hop to the big screen as yet, however the company has at least narrowed it down to 2020-something.</p>

<p>In this week's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106e.pdf">Corporate Management Policy Briefing</a>, Nintendo shared an update on its 'visual content', which means its movie projects.</p>
<p>"In the field of visual content, we are making direct investments and are deeply involved in the planning and development of multiple productions," it wrote, with an accompanying infographic showing that rather vague Zelda release window: 202X.</p>
<p>Here, it also noted the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">upcoming Super Mario Bros. sequel will make its debut in April 2026</a>. Last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-is-the-biggest-video-game-adaptation-ever">Super Mario Bros. animated movie was a huge success for the company</a>, with Nintendo stating it was viewed in theaters by approximately 170 million people.</p>

<p>Nintendo's own <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> first confirmed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-working-on-a-live-action-the-legend-of-zelda-movie">live-action The Legend of Zelda movie this time last year</a>, with a rather casual post on social media. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-is-being-made-in-close-collaboration-with-the-true-genius-of-miyamoto">Miyamoto will produce the movie</a>, which is being co-financed by Nintendo and Sony Pictures Entertainment (Sony will also handle worldwide theatrical distribution).</p>
<p>Film producer Avi Arad is also on board. Arad's previous video game to film projects include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-film-benefited-game-sales-despite-being-disappointing-flop-take-two-boss-says">this year's Borderlands adaptation</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharted-film-sequel-in-development-sony-pictures-confirms">Tom Holland-fronted Uncharted</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Nintendo news, yesterday the company gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-not-ruling-out-future-acquisitions-but-still-favours-organic-expansion-to-maintain-creative-culture">further insight on its approach to mergers and acquisitions</a>, while also confirming the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">Switch successor will be backward compatible with Switch games</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It barely seems like yesterday I was writing it barely seems like yesterday since we last had a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> update, but here I am doing it again as Hello Games' exploratory space sim ushers in cross-save support, PS5 Pro enhancements, and even the return of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>'s Normandy.
</p>
<p>
All this comes via No Man's Sky's latest update (the sixth this year, if you're counting, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-the-cursed-is-a-spooky-expedition-for-halloween-set-in-a-collapsing-reality">October's The Cursed update</a>), which begins with a feature "years" in the making: cross-save. Starting today, cross-save is available alongside cross-play for all platforms - including PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, Steam Deck, PSVR VR 1 &amp; 2, and PC VR - meaning players can pick up from where they left off regardless of which machines they're hopping between.
</p>
<p>
Hello Games says introducing the feature has been "especially difficult" given the range of platforms its catering for and the age of saves some players are still using. "It’s very common for players to rack up thousands of hours of... incredibly detailed saves," it explains. "Adding cross-save for us is a little bit like moving house, the longer people have lived there, the more complicated it is to move them! We also have players who played once at launch, eight years ago, suddenly loading up that save on a platform that didn’t even exist back then!"
</p>
<p>
As such, Hello Games is taking a cautious approach to cross-save and rolling out the feature gradually. Starting today, all players can <a href="https://cloud.nomanssky.com/cross-save">link their various platform accounts together via the No Man's Sky website</a>, and a "subset of players" will be able to access cross-saves initially. "In the coming weeks," the studio adds, "all players will be invited to do so."
</p><p>
But there's more; to coincide with today's PlayStation Pro launch, Hello Games is releasing an enhanced version of No Man's Sky for the platform, introducing "crisp 4K resolution at 60fps" and 8K at 30fps. That's alongside improved lighting, plus ultra quality reflections and higher quality ambient occlusion across all modes. These enhancements are also available on PSVR2.
</p>
<p>
And finally for today's No Man's Sky update, Hello Games is joining in with BioWare's annual Mass Effect N7 celebrations by running an "overhauled" version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-can-unlock-mass-effects-normandy-sr1-as-a-frigate-in-no-mans-sky-for-a-limited-time">2021's limited-time Beachhead expedition</a>. Completing this quest unlocks Mass Effect's SSV Normandy SR1 as a useable frigate in-game, with players having two weeks to acquire it starting today.
</p>
<p>
As to what's next for No Man's Sky, we've yet to hear more about the Worlds Part 2 release Hello Games teased alongside the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-borrows-some-of-light-no-fires-fancy-tech-for-a-planetary-overhaul-in-latest-update">massive Worlds Part 1 update</a> back in July, but that one seems to have slipped so it's unclear if we'll see more of it this year. And, of course, we're coming up to 12 months <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-studio-unveils-procedural-fantasy-planet-adventure-light-no-fire">since the reveal of the studio's next game</a>, Light No Fire, so perhaps we'll learn more about that come December's Game Awards.
