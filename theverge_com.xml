Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo will offer an early look at <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> during a livestream on Wednesday, June 18th at 9AM ET / 6AM PT. The company announced the upcoming Direct event through its Nintendo Today app <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1934596827900178721">and on X</a>, saying the livestream will feature 15 minutes of information about the Switch 2 game.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641537/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> was announced</a> on April 2nd and launches for the Switch 2 on July 17th. It’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642699/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-preview-switch-2">an action-adventure game</a> that has a newly designed Donkey Kong smashing his way through levels to retrieve stolen banana-shaped diamonds from an evil group known as VoidCo. The game’s destructible environment allows Donkey Kong to break through walls, dig tunnels, and even dig underground to find more areas to explore.</p><p>If this Direct is anything <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/649138/mario-kart-world-direct-nintendo-switch-2-gameplay">like the one for <em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, Nintendo will likely go beyond the gameplay we’ve already seen, giving us a more in-depth look at <em>Donkey Kong Bananza’s </em>key features and mechanics. Maybe we’ll learn more about the game’s new character, Odd Rock, too.</p><p>Nintendo will air the Direct <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/YVUidGTR8xg">on YouTube</a>. <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> will cost $69.99 when it launches next month, and it’s available for <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fdonkey-kong-bananza-switch-2%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOorBhuZ8Qg8JweNiUo86Q_ovolF4OKSJdpZ6QNEL-P8ocGeEfkSa" rel="sponsored">preorder now</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
