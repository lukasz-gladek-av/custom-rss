Eventually, the Puzzmo team came up with an answer in the form of <a href="http://puzzmo.com/+/weather"><em>Weather Memoku</em></a>, an extremely chill game that combines elements of memory, sudoku, and, well, the weather.</p><p>“A very important idea was: can we change checking the weather from being a thing you check off your to-do list, to being a chance to take a moment for yourself?” explains Gage.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24283527/puzzmo-weather-memoku">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Good morning sports fans.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Daily sudoku is coming to Apple News Plus.</p><p>The sudoku puzzles are part of iOS 18.2 in the US, as reported <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/25/ios-18-2-adds-sudoku-to-apple-news-plus/">by <em>MacRumors</em></a>.
