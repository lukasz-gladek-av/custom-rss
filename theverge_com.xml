Much like a modern laptop, these new monitors have a built-in light sensor that measures the brightness and color temperature of an environment to enable a screen to automatically adapt to different times of day.</p><p>“In bright daylight conditions it increases brightness and shifts to a color that’s cooler in temperature,” says Michael McSorley, product marketing manager at Nvidia, in a briefing with <em>The Verge</em>. “At night, or in darker rooms, it reduces brightness and uses warmer tones to minimize glare and eyestrain.”</p><p>While the process is automatic, much like a laptop display, you’ll still be able to fully control how this feature works so you can fine-tune it or disable it altogether directly through the monitor’s onscreen display.</p><p>The first displays that include G-Sync Ambient Adaptive Technology will be available on January 7th, starting at $599. Acer, AOC, Asus, and MSI all have new G-Sync Pulsar monitors with this automatic brightness feature, and they’re all designed more for professional esports players. Each model is a 27-inch IPS display running at 1440p and up to 360Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Nvidia first introduced its G-Sync Pulsar monitors last year, as part of a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224270/nvidia-g-sync-module-mediatek-partnership">partnership with MediaTek</a> to integrate its current and future G-Sync features into MediaTek scalers and eliminate the need for dedicated G-Sync modules. G-Sync originally required a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/introducing-nvidia-g-sync-revolutionary-ultra-smooth-stutter-free-gaming/">dedicated module in 2013</a> to allow it to synchronize display refresh rates to a GPU, eliminate screen tearing, and reduce display stutter and input lag.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/854662/nvidia-g-sync-pulsar-monitors-abmient-adaptive-technology-auto-brightness]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia is announcing its next major update to its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) feature at CES today. DLSS 4.5 includes Nvidia’s second-generation Super Resolution transformer model and a new 6x Multi Frame Generation mode for RTX 50-series GPUs that uses AI to generate up to five additional frames for every single rendered one.</p><p>DLSS 4.5 will be available for all RTX GPUs today, but will run the fastest on Nvidia’s latest RTX 40- and 50-series cards. The latest transformer model is designed to improve image quality overall and reduce some of the artifacting that we saw with DLSS 4.</p><p>“This second-generation model is our most sophisticated yet,” says Henry Lin, director of product management at Nvidia, in a briefing with <em>The Verge</em>. “It utilizes 5x the compute power over the original transformer model, it’s trained on a significantly expanded high-fidelity dataset, and it also takes full advantage of our GeForce RTX 40- and 50-series GPUs, which benefit from faster and more advanced Tensor Cores.”</p><p>Nvidia has updated its DLSS model to better understand scenes in games so it can use game engine data to improve lighting, finer edges, and motion clarity. In a briefing, Nvidia demonstrated improvements to DLSS 4.5 in a variety of games. Ghosting is reduced in <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em>, anti-aliasing is improved in <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, and there is less shimmering in certain scenes in <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>.</p><p>While the AI model improvements to DLSS 4.5 will benefit all RTX owners today, Nvidia is also launching a new 6x Multi Frame Generation mode for RTX 50-series owners in spring. Targeted at 240Hz 4K gaming, the 6x mode will generate five additional fake frames for every single rendered one, instead of the maximum of three additional in DLSS 4.</p><p>Nvidia is also launching a Dynamic Multi Frame Generation mode that automatically switches between different Multi Frame Generation levels depending on when you need more or less fake frames. “When things are really graphically intense, it upshifts and increases the Frame Generation required to bridge the performance dips, ensuring that your high refresh rate monitor remains buttery smooth,” explains Lin. “When the workload lightens, it seamlessly shifts the multiplier down to compute only what’s needed.”</p><p>DLSS 4.5 will be available for more than 400 games and apps through Nvidia’s app today, allowing RTX owners to force 4.5 on in games that haven’t been updated yet. Nvidia is only committing to a vague “spring 2026” timeframe for its 6x Multi Frame Generation and Dynamic Frame Generation modes for RTX 50-series owners.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/854610/nvidia-dlss-4-5-announcement-multi-frame-generation-6x-specs]]></content:encoded>
