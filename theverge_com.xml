            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318790/playstation-5-ps5-disc-drive-restock-gamestop-pro-members<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony’s detachable disc drive for the PlayStation 5 has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/11/24242334/the-people-want-disc-drives">hard to come by</a> as of late, and it’s disappointing that the $700 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">PS5 Pro</a> doesn’t include one. However, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fsony-disc-drive-for-playstation-5-digital-edition-consoles-slim%2F402415.html">GameStop</a> is now offering a rare window for GameStop Pro members to pick one up for its original MSRP of $79.99. </p><p>GameStop’s loyalty program <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fpro%2F">costs $25 a year</a>, so you can consider that an added premium if you’re not interested in its other benefits. Those include a $5 welcome reward, two percent cash back rewards, free shipping, exclusive deals and discounts, and an extra $5 monthly reward.</p><p>Whether you already own or anticipate purchasing a digital-only PS5, such as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/10/23955005/sony-playstation-5-ps5-slim-size-comparison-photo-gallery-hands-on-impressions">newest Digital Edition</a> or recently released PS5 Pro, it’s a good idea to pick one up while you have the chance. Neither console requires the disc drive, but with no future guarantee that your favorite games will be available for download after the console generation runs its course, it offers nice peace of mind. The add-on also ensures that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/24054458/physical-media-preservation-discs-cartridges-digital">physical media preservationists</a> can continue using physical game copies, although you may still have to download extra data to play many of them. It also allows you to play your entire Blu-Ray and DVD collection.</p><p>What’s neat about the PS5’s Disc Drive is that it hides away under a cover that makes it look like a seamless piece of the overall hardware. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23723205">Setup is easy</a>, too, and only requires connecting a cable before pairing it to your console. You’ll need an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/25/23931637/ps5-slim-removable-disc-drive-internet-required">internet connection for the initial setup</a>, but that’s a small inconvenience to gain the long-term benefit.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
