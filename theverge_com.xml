            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284073/nintendo-music-streaming-app-switch-online-subscribers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While we all <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276650/nintendo-switch-2-predictions-playtest-alarmo">wait for the reveal of Nintendo’s next console</a>, the company has once again announced something very different. This time, it’s a mobile app called Nintendo Music, which lets users listen to classic gaming tunes from Nintendo games spanning the last few decades, including <em>Splatoon</em>, <em>Animal Crossing,</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. It’s only available to Switch Online subscribers, and it’s launching today on both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nintendo-music/id6466376604">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.znba&amp;hl=en_CA">Android</a>.</p><p>The app features curated playlists themed around games, moments, moods, or characters, though you can also build your own. It also supports streaming as well as downloading tracks for offline listening. Curiously, it includes a spoiler feature that lets you filter out tracks that, somehow, might spoil a game you haven’t played or finished yet. And if you just want some Hyrule white noise, the app also lets you “loop songs or extend select tracks to 15, 30, or 60 minutes for uninterrupted listening.”</p><div><p>Here’s <a href="https://support.m.nintendo.com/hc/en-us/articles/10463992555535-In-which-regions-will-Nintendo-Music-be-available">a list of all the regions</a> the app will be available in.</p></div><div><p>The announcement of Nintendo Music comes not long after a handful of other surprise, non-<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">Switch 2 reveals from Nintendo</a>, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">the launch of an alarm clock</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275596/nintendo-switch-online-beta-playtest-program-leak-mmo">a mysterious MMO that’s currently in testing</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
