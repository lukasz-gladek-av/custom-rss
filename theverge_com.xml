            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I remember being blown away by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd32M4-muA">the 2024 reveal trailer</a> for <em>Possessor(s)</em>, the new game from <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> developer Heart Machine. The trailer features a striking art design, where an animated 2D character explores and fights in side-scrolling environments with gorgeous 3D backgrounds, and it’s all set to moody, powerful music. The final game, which came out this month, wasn’t quite as awe-inspiring as that initial trailer made it seem, and I almost quit it — but I’m really glad I saw it to the end.</p><p>In <em>Possessor(s)</em>, you play as Luca, a girl who is possessed by Rehm, a demon from another realm. After a catastrophe strikes, Rehm saves Luca’s life by creating legs for her — but from then on, Luca serves as a host for Rhem, meaning they can talk to each other all the time and occasionally see into each other’s memories. The two have a contentious relationship. They bicker <em>constantly</em>, which sometimes made them difficult for me to care about. But over the course of the game, their relationship evolves as they come to understand more about each other and the worlds they came from.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Luca (left) and Rhem (right).</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Heart Machine describes <em>Possessor(s)</em> as a “fast-paced action side scroller,” but this is a <em>Metroid</em>- or <em>Castlevania</em>-style game through and through. You’ll explore an interconnected world with distinct zones, spend a lot of time looking at the map to try and find the next path to explore, and collect helpful traversal upgrades like a wall run to help you access new areas. Very early on, you’ll pick up a whip, and it serves double duty as an exploration tool to cross large gaps and a key weapon in battle.</p><p>Fights are <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/smash-bros-meets-metroidvania-in-possessor-s-heart-machines-new-side-scrolling-opus/">inspired by</a> platform fighters like <em>Super Smash Bros.</em>, meaning they’re fast-paced and crunchy, and you’ll take on enemies with weapons inspired by regular things you might have around your house. My usual strategy consisted of whaling on enemies up close with a large baseball bat, shocking them with an electric blast from a cellphone to create space, and flinging demonic silverware across rooms to hit faraway targets. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/667900/doom-the-dark-ages-clair-obscur-expedition-33-parry-season">Parrying</a> is a key part of fights, too.</p><p>Early on, though, <em>Possessor(s)</em> was <em>very</em> tough. Regular enemies hit hard, and if you lose focus for just a second or get caught in an unlucky combo, you can die without any time to react. Dying sends you back to the <em>Possessor(s)</em> equivalent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonfire_(Dark_Souls)"><em>Dark Souls</em> bonfires</a>, but the return trips to where you died can be long, arduous, and filled with danger. (The game also uses a <em>Souls</em>-like flask system, swapping flasks for painkillers to let you recover health.)</p><p>Usually, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150718/demons-souls-remake-ps5-playstation-5-sony-game-of-the-year-2020">I like that kind of challenge</a>, but something about <em>Possessor(s)</em>’s level and enemy design often made the early game feel more frustrating than fun for me. I also got <em>very</em> lost after the first few hours, exploring way more of the map than I needed to because I couldn’t figure out how to get past some mysterious walls with glowy cracks on them. I contemplated putting down the game for good.</p><p>However, after finally learning how to open those walls (use the whip!), getting a few health and painkiller upgrades, and seeing more nuance to Luca and Rhem’s relationship, I started to enjoy the game much more. I finally settled into the satisfying <em>Metroid</em> loop of exploring a new area, finding a new upgrade, using that to get to the next boss, getting the next MacGuffin, and then doing it all over again in the next zone.</p><p><em>Possessor(s)</em> didn’t possess me in the way that I expected it might. Based on my initial impressions, the game seemed cooked in a lab to appeal to my exact tastes. I just needed to have some patience. The game culminated in a final level that really put my skills to the test and a striking battlefield for the final boss. As I watched the credits roll, I realized it had all finally evoked some of those feelings I had watching the game’s first trailer.</p><p><sup>Possessor(s)</sup><em><sup> is out now on PC and PS5.</sup></em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/821117/possessors-review-pc-ps5]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[The Steam Machine feels like the TV gaming PC I’ve always wanted]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/818606/valve-steam-machine-tv-gaming-pc-wanted</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-steam-machine-feels-like-the-tv-gaming-pc-i%E2%80%99ve-always-wanted.1354600/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The morning of Monday, October 27th, I started my workweek by asking my colleagues at <em>The Verge </em>for advice on buying a gaming PC. I wanted a small, portable, and semi-powerful machine that could easily sit beneath my living room TV and occasionally move over to my desk to play games or even use for work. My dream was to find something as easy to use as the Steam Deck, which has become my primary gaming device due to its simplicity and massive catalog of PC games.</p><p>Just two days later, I walked into Valve’s headquarters and was introduced to the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">Steam Machine</a>, a gaming PC and console hybrid. It checked basically every box I was looking for.</p><p>The Steam Machine is a 6-inch cube that will comfortably fit into my small entertainment center in the corner of my living room and on my small office desk I’ve squeezed into the bedroom. Valve says its AMD GPU is more than six times as powerful than the Steam Deck, which should be great for me since most of my gaming time is spent playing less graphically intensive indies. It runs SteamOS, which I already love on a big screen when docking my Steam Deck.</p><p>There are some fun perks for the gadget nerd in me, too. The Steam Machine has a customizable LED bar that Valve says will be able to show you things like the status of downloads, which sounds perfect if I want to keep an eye on when I can play my next game while watching a show on a different TV input. It supports Valve’s customizable new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">Steam Controller</a> and has a dedicated antenna that offers a low-latency connection for up to four of the gamepads. And because the Steam Machine is a Linux PC, I can also do whatever the heck I want with it — I’m even thinking about installing Windows so I can dual-boot and play games that aren’t on Linux <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284644/apex-legends-loses-linux-steam-deck-support-anti-cheat">due to anti-cheat</a>, like <em>Fortnite</em>.</p><p>Best of all, the Steam Machine should just work with my quickly growing collection of Steam games. The Steam Deck has totally converted me to the benefits of the Steam ecosystem, like a huge catalog of games to play, a library that follows me across devices and platforms, and cloud saves and multiplayer that aren’t gated behind a monthly fee. And because, like the Steam Deck, the Steam Machine has a microSD card slot, I’ll be able to save games to a microSD card and swap them between the two devices, almost like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818602/valve-steam-deck-machine-frame-microsd-card-game-cartridges">a souped-up game cartridge</a>.</p><p>Prior to seeing the Steam Machine, I was weighing choices like using the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/761025/framework-desktop-bazzite-linux-steam-machine-pc-game-console-impressions">Framework Desktop</a> (promising, and a handle is an option!), getting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop#csm3NI">a good gaming laptop</a> (the most portable, but potentially very expensive), or just sourcing parts and building the PC myself (intimidating for <s>a </s><em><s>Verge</s></em><s> reporter</s> me, a DIY newb). But these options aren’t as compelling as a first-party Steam Machine: I want something that is great for TV gaming, as reliable as my Steam Deck, and requires minimal fuss on my end — with an active toddler running around the house, time is a major commodity!</p><p>With the Steam Deck, Valve made PC gaming much more palatable to console crowds by (mostly) being something that just works. Verified games don’t need much fiddling to play great, many less-optimized games can be playable with graphics tweaks or by customizing your controls, and table stakes like a functional UI and reliable sleep and wake are all there. And it’s all wrapped up in a comfortable, ergonomic handheld. If Valve can bring that same console-like experience to a living room device, it would open up the best of PC gaming to even more people.</p><p>Valve is set to launch the Steam Machine sometime next year. It hasn’t said how much it will cost, but instead of shopping for Black Friday deals on some kind of other gaming PC, I think I’m going to save that money for the Steam Machine instead.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/818606/valve-steam-machine-tv-gaming-pc-wanted]]></content:encoded>
