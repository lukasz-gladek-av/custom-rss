            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>If you’re looking for a webcam that works with the Nintendo Switch 2’s new GameChat mode that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/video/685229/nintendo-switch-2-gamechat-c-button-mario-kart">lets you video chat with friends and see their faces within games</a>, it looks like the biggest brand in PC accessories is still your best bet.</p></div><p>Logitech is the first webcam maker to confirm to <em>The Verge</em> that the vast majority of its cameras work — all of them, in fact, save for the high-end Logitech Brio 4K.</p><p>“All of our webcams except Brio 4K work out of the box with Switch 2,” Logitech spokesperson Leila Lewis definitively tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>When the Nintendo Switch 2 launched three weeks ago, webcam manufacturers had no idea which cameras would be compatible with the new Switch, and some of the best-reviewed cameras simply didn’t work. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682008/which-webcams-work-with-nintendo-switch-2">It was a weird mystery, a wild west</a>, and webcam makers had to figure it out on their own.</p><p>Many didn’t even have a Switch 2 to test with, my sources tell me, and had to compete with consumers to buy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">the fastest-selling game console of all time</a>. Nor did Nintendo provide compatibility guidelines, it seems, as manufacturers like Elgato and Ugreen had to reverse-engineer why their seemingly compatible cameras weren’t showing up when they plugged them in.</p><p>But that mystery now seems to be solved — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/693182/nintendo-switch-2-webcam-mystery-1080p-480p-uvc-iso-bulk-ugreen-elgato">the answers are not what we expected</a>! — and manufacturers are now seemingly free to update any of their firmware-updatable webcams and make them compatible with the new Switch.</p><p>Logitech doesn’t seem to be promising an update for the Brio 4K. “Brio 4K is built with the security features of Windows Hello that are not supported on the Switch 2 anyway,” Lewis tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>But again, all its other webcams reportedly work — which won’t be all that surprising to anyone who’s been following the webcam saga. When Nintendo and webcam makers weren’t originally able to provide lists of working webcams, Redditors <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l5mgn0/tested_usb_cameras_with_switch_2_master_list/">crowdsourced their own list,</a> which includes far more working webcams from Logitech than any other manufacturer.</p><p>A few Redditors say you can even get the Brio 4K working if you want, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1lflhz6/logitech_brio_4k_webcam_working_on_switch_2/">with a firmware downgrade</a>. Do that at your own risk, though.</p><p>So far, Elgato and Ugreen have committed to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/693182/nintendo-switch-2-webcam-mystery-1080p-480p-uvc-iso-bulk-ugreen-elgato#:~:text=USB%20transfer%20mode-,Ugreen%20says,-its%20CM826%20/%2055512">upgrading specific cameras</a> to work with the Nintendo Switch 2. Obsbot has generically confirmed it will do some sort of firmware updates, and Insta360 is still looking into it. Anker is non-committal.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/694565/logitech-webcams-work-with-nintendo-switch-2]]></content:encoded>
