Two of the models announced at CES today are launching immediately: the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.keychron.com%2Fproducts%2Flemokey-p1-he-wireless-magnetic-switch-custom-gaming-keyboard">$169 Lemokey P1 HE QMK</a>, and the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.keychron.com%2Fproducts%2Fkeychron-q6-he-qmk-wireless-custom-keyboard%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOorZKTLdh4434IkhO_9d6dmaNVrvn_6FdcAQkfdGyZkvS1bU4V4n">$229 Keychron Q6 HE QMK</a>, with three additional keyboards set to be released later this year.</p><p>Hall effect switches are notable for providing more customization features and a faster press than traditional mechanical switches, making them a popular choice for gamers. They use magnetic induction sensing on the PCB that detects how far down a key has been pushed — allowing you to decide the exact actuation point or even set different functions that activate depending on how hard you press.&nbsp;</p><p>The Lemokey P1 HE QMK is a 75 percent layout keyboard with 2.4GHz Bluetooth and a 1,000Hz polling rate. It can be used wired or wirelessly and is compatible exclusively with <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.keychron.com%2Fproducts%2Fgateron-double-rail-magnetic-switch">Gateron Double-Rail magnetic switches</a>. The Keychron Q6 HE also launching today is a full-sized mechanical keyboard with similar features and switch restrictions. Both models are available in either black or white and feature PBT double-shot keycaps.</p><div><figcaption><em>Here’s a look at the updated Lemokey P1 HE QMK.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Keychron</cite></p></div><p>Keychron released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/5/23989237/keychron-q1-he-hall-effect-analog-switches-price-release-date-specs-features-mechanical-keyboard">its first Hall effect keyboard</a> last year, and rival keyboard makers like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/10/23823001/corsair-k70-max-keyboard-price-release-date-specs-features-switches">Corsair</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24252951/steelseries-apex-pro-gen-3-keyboards-hall-effect">SteelSeries</a> have also adopted the feature after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/14/24100819/wooting-80he-keyboard-rappy-snappy-feature">Wooting popularized the use</a> of Hall effect switches. Meanwhile, other brands like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336947/move-over-hall-effect-inductive-switches-are-arriving-for-mechanical-keyboards">Epomaker</a> and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-keyboards/duckys-worlds-first-inductive-keyboard-offers-cherry-analog-switches-and-wirelessbut-is-it-better-than-hall-effect/">Ducky</a> are trending toward induction-based switches that provide similar analog features and use less power. Other Keychron models like the K4, K8, and Lomokey L5 will also be available with Hall effect switches sometime in Q1 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338092/hyperkin-guitar-hero-hyper-strummer-controller-nintendo-wii<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Hyperkin opened <a href="https://x.com/Hyperkin/status/1874486686622556240">preorders for a new guitar-shaped controller</a> on New Year’s Day, but it isn’t compatible with Harmonix’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23992574/fortnite-festival-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band"><em>Fortnite Festival</em> music game</a> that debuted on the Switch in late 2023. In fact, the Hyper Strummer isn’t compatible with the Switch at all. It only works with the 18-year-old Nintendo Wii, and the older <em>Guitar Hero</em> and <em>Rock Band</em> rhythm game titles released for that console.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRT4DRVR/?tag=theverge02-20">$76.99 Hyper Strummer</a> could have potentially been a cheaper alternative to <em>Fortnite Festival</em>-compatible guitar controllers like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24155728/pdp-riffmaster-wireless-guitar-controller-fortnite-festival-rock-band-stock-availability">PDP’s $129.99 Riffmaster</a>. But it only works with a Wiimote slotted into the back, and is not compatible with modern gaming hardware like the Xbox Series X / S or the PlayStation 5.</p><p>Its design also appears identical to the <em>Guitar Hero</em> controller Hyperkin released in 2009 during the Wii era, which <a href="https://twitter.com/kua1sude/status/1874508660455702574?s=61&amp;t=ka62_HRMDRk57zsnnVROzQ">led to accusations on X</a> that the company was repackaging and selling old stock as a new product.</p><p>Hyperkin responded to the accusations <a href="https://x.com/Hyperkin/status/1874923878964703418">with a statement shared on X</a> explaining why the Hyper Strummer looks so similar to older hardware. “While it is correct that this is the same shell mold of a previous Hyperkin release from 2009, that is all it is. We used the mold to make brand new shells, fitted with new 2024 internal components. This is not old stock, nor is it old guitars that have been sitting in a warehouse.”</p><p>The company says the modernized Hyper Strummer was “developed to meet the demand for an accessible and budget-friendly solution, perfect for retro gamers who want to enter the guitar scene in 2025 at an affordable price.”  Instead of risking buying used hardware online that potentially turns out to be non-functional, devoted <em>Guitar Hero</em> fans who have refused to upgrade their Nintendo Wiis now have another option.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s priced at $79.99 and will be available on January 30th, with preorders starting on January 7th.</p><p>The Handheld Dock Chroma is a similar concept to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/18/23409757/valve-steam-deck-dock-docking-station-tv-gaming-nintendo-switch">official docking stations provided by Valve</a> or Nintendo, allowing users to hook handheld devices up to external displays with expanded connections to complement big-screen gaming setups. The Handheld Dock Chroma uses a USB-C cable to connect supported devices, including Android phones and tablets, iPads and iPhones with USB-C ports, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review">Nintendo Switch</a>, and Razer’s own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/15/23392481/razer-edge-android-cloud-gaming-tablet-qualcomm-price-release-date-specs">Edge Android gaming handheld</a>. </p><div><div><figcaption><em>Here are the port options in the rear, plus the USB-C cable to connect to your device.

Given the cable placement, certain handhelds like the Switch that have their ports on the underside will need to be positioned upside down in the dock.</p><p>The dock itself is constructed from aluminum and folds down into a box shape to make it easier to transport without damaging it. And given this is a Razer product, there’s naturally a Chroma-enabled RGB bar located at the front, which users can customize with various lighting effects.</p><div><figcaption><em>There’s plenty of ports to hook up things like mice, keyboards, and controllers — providing they use a USB-A connection.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G.

The feature also makes use of the Kishi Ultra’s Sensa HD support, which converts audio output into haptic feedback on supported Android devices (but sadly isn’t available for iOS). PC Remote Play allows games to be streamed at full resolution without compromising “visual quality or game speed,” according to Razer, and can be accessed via the Razer Nexus app on iOS or Android.</p><div><figcaption><em>Razer’s new PC Remote Play feature provides PC-to-Phone streaming capabilities similar to the Steam Link mobile app.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G.

            <title><![CDATA[Razer’s prototype gaming chair blasts you with hot or cold air]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24336722/razer-project-arielle-gaming-chair-heating-cooling-prototype-ces</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/razer%E2%80%99s-prototype-gaming-chair-blasts-you-with-hot-or-cold-air.1075980/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24336722/razer-project-arielle-gaming-chair-heating-cooling-prototype-ces<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s becoming a tradition for Razer to show off some pretty wild prototypes at CES, but the concept gaming chair with integrated heating and cooling it just unveiled actually sounds downright practical. Project Arielle is a mesh gaming chair that features a bladeless fan system that’s designed to keep you at a comfortable temperature regardless of what environment you’re in. </p><p>We briefly tried it here at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/4/24307731/ces-2025-tvs-gaming-smart-home-wearables-news/archives/2">CES 2025</a> and it’s cool! Or warm, depending on the mode you set it to. When my colleague Sean Hollister tried it, he found it didn’t just warm or cool his butt, but gently and quietly blew a substantial amount of climate-controlled air onto his upper back from small holes along the chair’s top edge.</p><div><figcaption><em>A more comfortable way to freeze your butt off.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Building on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23883174/razer-fujin-pro-gaming-chair-herman-miller-aeron">$1,049 Razer Fujin Pro mesh gaming chair</a> that you <em>can</em> currently buy, Project Arielle has three adjustable fan speeds that can reduce the perceived temperature by 2 to 5 degrees Celsius (around 3.6 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit) in “dry environments,” according to Razer. That sounds pretty useful if you live in a hot climate or if your gaming PC kicks out enough heat to turn your room into a sweatbox. </p><div><figcaption><em>Here’s a rendering that shows how the hot or cool air is dispersed from the chair.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Razer</cite></p></div><p>For chillier environments, the chair has a built-in PTC heating system (the same kind found in most vehicles and heated car seats) that can spit out warm air at 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit). The fans and that temperatures are adjusted using touch panel controls located next to the seat pad. And given this is a Razer product, there’s obviously RGB lighting throughout the chair. By default, it’s set to Razer’s trademark green when it’s off, and we saw the edge glow red when warm, blue when cool, and purple or orange when cooling or warming. </p><div><figcaption><em>Icons on the touch-controlled panel and the built-in RGB lighting indicate whether the chair is set to blast warm or cold air.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>One downside: you can’t spin 360 degrees in this chair without wrapping a cord around yourself, as it does need to be plugged in. But even the prototype already has a cable that’ll safely disconnect if you accidentally give it a yank.</p><div><figcaption><em>The breakaway cable will disconnect if it’s pulled, kinda like the early Xbox controllers.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Given Project Arielle is only a concept chair, this unfortunately isn’t something you can actually buy just yet. Razer has showcased a lot of quirky gaming gadget concepts at CES over the years, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031161/razers-project-esther-kicked-my-butt">chair cushions that shake your ass</a> with haptic feedback. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
