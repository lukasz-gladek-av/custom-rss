The company’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fforums%2Fgeforce-graphics-cards%2F5%2F557712%2Fverified-priority-access-geforce-rtx-5090-and-rtx-%2F" rel="sponsored">just announced a way</a> for Nvidia fans to sign up for “Verified Priority Access” to buy the elusive two-slot <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349976/nvidia-rtx-5090-fe-small-form-factor-sff-hands-on">SFF-friendly</a> RTX 5090 and 5080 Founders Edition graphics cards.</p></div><p>Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/13/23402674/nvidia-rtx-4090-priority-access-founders-edition-test">a similar Verified Priority Access program for the RTX 4090</a>, the new program is invite-only, but this time you’ll apply for access by filling out <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Faccount%2Frtx-50-series-verified-priority-access%2F" rel="sponsored">this form</a> rather than being pre-selected. The site will check that you’ve already had an Nvidia account (accounts created after January 30th need not apply) and ask you whether you’d prefer a 5090 or a 5080. Then, it’ll apparently use an algorithm to figure out if you’re a real gamer (analyzing your Nvidia app / GeForce Experience use) before offering a card. Limit one per person.</p><p>“Invites will begin rolling out next week,” writes Nvidia. The company doesn’t say how many cards have been allocated to this program, so it’s difficult to tell if this is a meaningful way to get cards to gamers rather than scalpers.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
