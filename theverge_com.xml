Over the course of this sale, the store will have 16 free games, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-holiday-sale-2024-buyers-guide">according to a blog post</a>.</p><p>Epic isn’t spilling the beans about <em>which</em> games will be on offer, teasing only that you’ll be able to claim “some absolutely amazing titles.” But in pervious years, Epic has given away big games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/13/23999921/epic-games-store-holiday-sale-2023-free-games"><em>Destiny 2: Legacy Collection</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/26/22854581/control-free-epic-games-store"><em>Control</em></a>, so fingers crossed that Epic has some good holiday surprises up its sleeve.</p><p>For paid deals, there are some good games to sift through, like 35 percent off <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/dragon-age-the-veilguard"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a><em> </em>and <em>Star Wars: Outlaws</em>. During the holiday sale, Epic is also giving users 10 percent back on their purchases as part of the Epic Rewards program, which is a boost from the usual 5 percent.</p><p><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/">The sale</a> ends at 11AM ET on January 9th, 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
