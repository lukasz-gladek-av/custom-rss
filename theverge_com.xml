            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/673114/valves-huge-steam-deck-update-is-now-ready-for-everyone-including-rival-amd-handhelds<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve has been building up to this for months, first in preview, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/662705/the-steam-deck-just-got-some-awesome-features-in-beta">then in beta</a>, and now finally in a full stable release: a new version of SteamOS that brings brand-new features to the Steam Deck <em>and</em> supports third-party handhelds like Lenovo’s Legion Go and Asus’ ROG Ally series.</p><p>SteamOS 3.7.8 is the first stable release to add official support for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">Lenovo Legion Go S</a>, and the first to offer an official “recovery” image that lets you install SteamOS on other AMD handhelds like the ROG Ally and original Legion Go, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck">as Valve promised us in January of this year</a>.</p><p>Until now, those who wanted to try SteamOS on those Windows handhelds could shoehorn the Steam Deck’s original recovery image onto their device, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">opt for a similar experience like Bazzite</a>. But now, Valve <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1B71-EDF2-EB6D-2BB3">explicitly provides instructions</a> for getting that image working on a Legion Go or ROG Ally, even as it warns that “support for all devices that is not officially ‘Powered by SteamOS’ is not final.”</p><p>But even if you don’t care about rival handhelds, SteamOS 3.7.8 has a <em>lot</em> of improvements for the Steam Deck. I’ve been asking Valve to let me use my Bluetooth earbuds’ microphone since <em>launch</em>, and it’s finally happening in desktop mode (sadly not gaming mode yet) thanks to HFP/HSP profiles. You can turn on your Steam Deck LCD from across the room with a Bluetooth controller, a feature previously exclusive to the OLED model, which comes in handy when you’re docked to a TV.</p><p>Speaking of leaving it docked, you can now set a Battery Charge Limit to 80 percent for longevity’s sake if your handheld is always plugged in, frame-limit variable refresh rate displays, and control the P-state frequency of certain AMD CPUs.</p><p>It’s all underpinned by new versions of Arch Linux, new Mesa graphics drivers, a much newer version of the Plasma desktop mode, and more. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1675200%2Fview%2F820329049655084700" rel="sponsored">Here’s the full SteamOS 3.7.8 changelog</a>.</p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamos%2F" rel="sponsored">An updated SteamOS FAQ</a> seems to suggest that Valve is ready to expand SteamOS beyond Lenovo and the Steam Deck. “We’re currently working with select partners on officially licensed Powered by SteamOS devices. Please reach out to us at <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=mailto%3Apoweredbysteamos%40valvesoftware.com">poweredbysteamos@valvesoftware.com</a> for more information about licensing SteamOS for your device,” one answer reads.</p><p>But the industry is still waiting for Valve’s other shoe(s) to drop. Rumors are still heating up that we’re close to the launch of Valve’s wireless VR headset “Deckard,” and that it might be pointing the way toward a SteamOS-powered living room console too. Valve has been moving slow and steady, but it seems like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr">a master plan for Steam Machines could finally be coming into focus</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/673123/ftc-drops-case-microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has officially dropped its case against Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The FTC filed an order to dismiss its complaint on Thursday, just days after it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/662883/ftc-appeal-microsoft-activision-deal-acquisition">lost an appeal</a> for a preliminary injunction to prevent Microsoft from finalizing its acquisition.</p><p>“The Commission has determined that the public interest is best served by dismissing the administrative litigation in this case,“ says the FTC <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/d9412_2025.05.22_commission_order_dismissing_complaint_.pdf">in its filing</a>. The filing brings an end to the FTC’s fight to try and block Microsoft’s $68.7 billion deal, nearly two years after it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/12/23758194/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard-complaint-block-acquisition-call-of-duty">originally sought</a> a temporary restraining order and injunction from a US federal district court.</p><p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/11/23779039/microsoft-activision-blizzard-ftc-trial-win">won its FTC fight</a> to buy Activision Blizzard in July 2023, and the deal was completed several months later, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized">in October</a>, nearly two years after the acquisition was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch">first announced</a>. The FTC had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/12/23791274/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard-appeal">appealed the ruling</a> nearly two years ago, but an appeals court panel affirmed the denial of an injunction <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/662883/ftc-appeal-microsoft-activision-deal-acquisition">earlier this month</a>.</p><p>“Today’s decision is a victory for players across the country and for common sense in Washington, DC,” says Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith. “We are grateful to the FTC for today’s announcement.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/673047/warhammer-40000-boltgun-words-of-vengeance-free-typing-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/antonio-g-di-benedetto">Antonio G. Di Benedetto</a> <span>is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget. He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun – Words of Vengeance</em> is a new typing game based on <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>, and it’s available now for free on PC <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3533730%2FWarhammer_40000_Boltgun__Words_of_Vengeance%2F" rel="sponsored">via Steam</a>. The dark sci-fi spin on a typing teacher was shadow-dropped during a series of announcements made during the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4A1s4DH78w">Warhammer Skulls Showcase</a>. Also shown was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG19wrCGR5g">trailer for <em>Boltgun 2</em></a>, a sequel to Auroch Digital’s first-person shooter the new typing game is based on.</p><p><em>Words of Vengeance </em>follows in the footsteps of games like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/30/5046068/play-this-typing-of-the-dead-overkill-sequel-released">Typing of the Dead</a></em> where you type on-screen prompts as quickly and as accurately as you can to defeat enemies and progress in on-rails levels. It’s set in the world of <em>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</em> and uses the same pixelated 3D aesthetic with plenty of blood and violence, except the blood is spilled by typing.</p><p>As a fan of mechanical keyboards, I personally love occasionally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23623723/touch-typing-keyboard-home-row-qwerty-dvorak-colemak-how-to">firing up typing tests</a> to hear what the latest keyboard I’m obsessing over sounds and feels like. But as much as I love <a href="http://monkeytype.com/">Monkeytype</a> or <a href="https://www.keybr.com/">Keybr</a>, an actual typing game offers a different kind of fun. The thought of going full boomer-shooter with my proper grammar and punctuation exercises just has me more stoked than ever. Plus, it’s free. </p><p>Brother! It’s time to get those fingers moving. More blood for the blood god!</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
