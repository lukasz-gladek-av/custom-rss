The long-awaited successor to the Switch will be available on June 5th for $449.99. It will be available for preorder in the US from select retailers starting on April 9th, as both a standalone console or bundled with <em><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer">Mario Kart World</a></em></em> for $499.99.</p><p>As predicted, the Switch 2 features a larger 7.9-inch LCD display, with support for 1080p resolution and HDR, 256GB of built-in storage, and up to 6.5 hours of battery life. The Joy-Cons are bigger, too, and now magnetically attach to the console instead of relying on a pair of sliding rails to snap into place. They also offer mouse-like functionality with select games, and the right Joy-Con sports a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/24107678">“C” button</a>, which can be used for in-game chat features, screensharing, and other actions.</p><div><p>As for games, the Switch 2 will launch with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer">Mario Kart World</a>,</em> along with third-party games like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/623660/split-fiction-review-hazelight-studios-it-takes-two">Split Fiction</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23881536/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-2-0">Cyberpunk 2077</a></em>. The console <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will also be backward-compatible</a> with original Switch games and support enhanced versions of select titles, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641365/nintendo-zelda-botw-totk-switch-2-edition-announced"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the</em> <em>Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>.</p></div><p>Below, we’ve rounded up all the preorder information you need if you want to be one of the first to get your hands on it. We’ll be updating this post regularly as more information becomes available, so bookmark this page if you’re keen on learning more ahead of the launch.</p><div><p id="qNz1cS"><h2>How to preorder via Nintendo</h2></p></div><p>The only confirmed retailer as of now is the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Fhow-to-buy%2F" rel="sponsored">My Nintendo Store</a>, which comes with a string of eligibility requirements — one of which requires you to register your interest in advance of April 9th. To do so, you’ll need to sign in with your Nintendo account and choose which console configuration you prefer (and which accessories). Then, you’ll receive an invitation email when it’s time to buy it, assuming you’ve satisfied several other conditions.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->450</span></p><div><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 offers a 7.9-inch display with 1080p resolution and HDR support. It also features improved processing power and larger Joy-Con controllers, which magnetically attach to the sides of the console.</p></div></div><p>As of right now, the reservation process is limited to Nintendo account holders in the US and Canada who are at least 18 years old. Invitations will be valid for 72 hours and will be “prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis,” according to Nintendo; you’ll also need to have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership for a minimum of 12 months and have logged 50 hours of gameplay on the original Switch as of April 2nd, 2025, to be eligible. What’s more, you must have opted in to <em>share</em> gameplay data with Nintendo (you can see if you’ve done so <a href="https://accounts.nintendo.com/privacy">in the privacy section</a> when logged into your account).</p><p>Once invitations have been sent to account holders who have met these criteria, Nintendo says it will send invitations to “remaining eligible registrants” on a first-come, first-served basis. Unsurprisingly, the invitations will be nontransferable and sent to the email address you used while registering your interest with Nintendo. Console and accessory purchases will be limited to one per eligible account, at least during the initial invitation period, with the first batch of invitations going out on May 8th.</p><p>Additional invitations will follow periodically, though Nintendo hasn’t specified details beyond that.</p><div><p id="how-to-preorder-elsewhere"><h2>How to preorder elsewhere</h2></p></div><p>As mentioned above, Nintendo is the only retailer thus far that has provided any insight into how preorders will work when they open on April 9th. That said, you can already sign up at <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/jjuweufjmbxay">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2F20019700.html" rel="sponsored">GameStop</a> to receive notifications about the upcoming console and games. Presumingly, this will also include preorder details once they’re available.</p><p>Like with previous launches, we anticipate that Amazon, <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fnintendo-switch-games-video%2F-%2FN-p86ax%3Ftype%3Dproducts" rel="sponsored">Target</a>, and Walmart will all have limited stock of the console, as well. But despite Nintendo “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606817/nintendo-switch-2-production-demand-q-a">taking risks</a>” to ensure it can meet demands, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/638668/you-might-have-a-hard-time-getting-a-switch-2">reports indicate</a> that US retailers might not have enough Switch 2 consoles to meet preorder demands. With any luck, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641559/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gameplay-requirements">Nintendo’s stringent reservation requirements</a> will thwart any potential scalpers.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

His coverage areas include audio (Sonos, Apple, Bose, Sony, etc.), home theater, smartphones, photography, and more.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>At numerous points during today’s Nintendo Switch 2 event stream, fine print at the bottom of the screen directed viewers to Nintendo’s website for the full details on which original Switch titles will be supported by the new console.</p><p>As it turns out, the company has put together a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ftransfer-guide%2Fcompatible-games%2F" rel="sponsored">surprisingly detailed resource page</a> that goes over all the titles it has tested thus far — both from Nintendo itself and third-party developers. And the chart below really tells the story: more often than not, last-gen games should run without any problems when the Switch 2 hits shelves on June 5th.</p><p>Even titles that we assumed might be fully incompatible — <em>Ring Fit Adventure, 1-2-Switch</em>, and the various <em>Labo</em> kit assembly games — are supported to some extent on the Switch 2 if you stick to original Joy-Cons or use other workaround methods that Nintendo spells out. At least for the time being, there’s only one game that just plain won’t work, and that’s the VR <em>Labo</em> kit. I don’t think anyone can really fault Nintendo for that.</p><p>The company also divides “games with startup issues” — <em>Doom Eternal, Rocket League, NBA 2K25,</em> and <em>Warframe</em> are among these — and “games that are playable, but have some in-game compatibility issues” into separate lists. “Nintendo is continuing to improve compatibility, including by working with publishing and developing partners,” the company notes on its site. That work will no doubt continue right up until the console’s release in early June.</p><p>Separately, Nintendo <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ftransfer-guide%2Fgames-with-free-updates%2F" rel="sponsored">has also revealed</a> which original Switch titles will be getting upgrades via future patches. These include <em>Arms, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, Super Mario Odyssey,</em> and more.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/641335/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-announcement<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/antonio-g-di-benedetto">Antonio G. Di Benedetto</a> <span>is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget. He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>The Duskbloods</em>, a new game by FromSoftware, is coming exclusively to the Nintendo Switch 2. The teaser trailer debuted during Nintendo’s Switch 2 Direct video presentation, where it was revealed that it’s set to launch in 2026 with famed <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Dark Souls </em>director Hidetaka Miyazaki at the helm. No other details were provided.</p><p>The trailer and name are very evocative of <em>Bloodborne</em>, the cult classic title that’s remained exclusive to Sony’s PlayStation consoles. But according to <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1907432474759569770">a post by Nintendo of America on X</a> and <a href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/duskbloods/article/250402_1.html"><em>The Duskbloods</em> website</a>, the new title differs in that it’s a player vs player vs enemies (PvPvE) format multiplayer game. FromSoftware may be known for single-player focused epics (with limited co-op) like the <em>Dark Souls</em> series and <em>Elden Ring</em>, but well before <em>Duskbloods </em>launches we’ll be getting its first multiplayer-only game in the form of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts">Elden Ring Nightreign</a></em>.</p><p>Nintendo teased that more will be revealed about <em>The Duskbloods</em> in a Creator’s Voice article with Miyazaki, set to publish on the official Nintendo website on April 4th. That should be helpful, considering the trailer goes heavier on style and flair than it does on details. There’s definitely a <em>Bloodborne</em>-y vibe with its gothic setting, and there seem to be vampiric Twilight Blood Clan characters. And it’s FromSoftware, so there’s of course some excellent looking enemies, monster designs, and fashion for days.</p><p>The moment that hangs on the vast expanse of The Duskbloods’ world may even indicate an open-world of some kind, but I’ll leave it up to the FromSoftware lore experts to go hard on their deep-dives and dissections of the three-and-a-half minute trailer.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
