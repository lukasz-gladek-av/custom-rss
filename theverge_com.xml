The game will also be delisted and no longer available for purchase starting today, January 15th.</p><p>Last year, Amazon announced that it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/808332/amazon-gaming-layoffs-mmo-aaa-first-party-games">would be</a> pivoting away from MMOs to put more of a focus on party games, and the company said at the time that it wouldn’t be releasing new content for <em>New World: Aeternum</em> and that the game’s servers would be active through 2026. But the longer-term future of the game was unclear, and now we know the official day everything will be shut down.</p><p>If you have already purchased <em>New World: Aeternum</em>, you can play it until it’s permanently taken offline. The Marks of Fortune in-game currency will be unavailable to purchase starting July 20th, 2026, and Amazon won’t offer refunds for it. And while there’s no new content coming to the game, “we will continue to monitor bugs and performance to ensure the game runs smoothly as things wind down,” Amazon says.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/862892/amazon-new-world-aeternum-mmo-servers-shut-down-delisted]]></content:encoded>
