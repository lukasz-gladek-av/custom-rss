            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/652597/bethesda-oblivion-remaster-livestream-tomorrow<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Xbox has confirmed the <em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> remaster. After years worth of rumors, Bethesda has finally acknowledged that the<em> Oblivion</em> remaster is real. <a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1914341006188712023">In a post on social media</a>, Bethesda revealed a simple image featuring the roman number IV — alluding to the fact that <em>Oblivion</em> is the fourth in the<em> Elder Scrolls</em> series — and the date and time of April 22nd at 8AM PT. Of course this all means that tomorrow morning, Bethesda will reveal more about the remaster including, hopefully, a release date.</p><p>Rumors have been circulating about an <em>Oblivion</em> remaster since 2023. The first hints were revealed in documents related to the Federal Trade Commissions case against Microsoft where an <em>Oblivion</em> remaster was mentioned alongside several other planned games including what became <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>. Then, last week, images from the alleged remaster <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/648877/oblivion-remaster-images-leaked-microsoft">leaked on a developer’s website</a> before being swiftly taken down which all but confirmed the game’s existence.</p><p>Unless you count<em> Elder Scrolls Online</em> which released its eighth expansion just last year, there hasn’t been a new mainline entry in the <em>Elder Scrolls</em> series since <em>Skyri</em>m in 2011. (Unless you also count <em>Skyrim</em>’s many, <em>many</em> ports for each new console generation since its launch.) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17447808/elder-scrolls-6-announcement-reveal-bethesda-e3-2018"><em>Elder Scrolls VI</em> was announced in 2018</a> but since then, no word on its development. An <em>Oblivion</em> remaster then is perfectly timed to tide fans over while they wait for Todd Howard and the development gang to give them something, <em>anything</em>, on the new game.</p><p>You can watch the <em>Oblivion</em> remaster livestream tomorrow April 22nd at 8AM PT/ 11 AM ET on Bethesda’s <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Ed_E2crglcw?si=F_1LNlvlUwyBF_XS">YouTube</a> channel.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Roblox is rolling out a new feature that will let creators on the platform choose to offer in-game items at region-specific prices. This means that an item’s specific price will vary to reflect a user’s local region so that it’s equivalent around the world.</p><p>Right now, in-experience prices are the same globally (the platform is currently available in 180 countries). But if a developer turns on regional pricing for an in-game item like a <a href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/production/monetization/game-passes">pass</a> (typically things with a one-time fee like access to a special area in a game or a permanent power-up), Roblox will automatically adjust the price in Robux, Roblox’s in-game currency, as needed.</p><p>Regional pricing will also become an option for avatar items “later this year,” according to <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/04/roblox-launches-regional-pricing-for-in-experience-items">a Roblox blog post</a>.</p><p>In an interview with <em>The Verge</em>, Enrico D’Angelo, Roblox’s VP of economy, says that the main reason the company waited this long to implement regional pricing was because there was a “real risk” about arbitrage.</p><p>“The moment you have the same item being sold for different prices, and, in some cases, dramatically different prices, you can imagine how crafty some people can get,” he says. Roblox wanted to be “very confident” in the systems that it put in place “to avoid these misuses of the system.” D’Angelo says that in Roblox’s early testing of regional pricing, it’s seen “zero cases” of abuse.</p><p>Paired with Roblox’s <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/opening-up-price-optimization-to-more-experiences/3471832">price optimization tool for developers</a>, which runs tests to recommend the best price for an item in a game, D’Angelo says that the company will be able to help suggest optimized prices for in-game goods <em>and</em> regionally appropriate prices for those goods. In its blog post, Roblox says the company has seen “a median earnings increase of 4 percent for eligible creators who have run a pricing test.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In fact, it seems <a href="https://valm.qq.com/act/a20250312preregister/?e_code=547223">pre-registration for a playtest of <em>Valorant Mobile</em></a> is already open to Chinese players, <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2025/04/valorant-mobile-pre-registration-is-now-open-in-china">spotted <em>Esports Insider</em></a>. </p></div><p>Riot Games first said it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22458279/valorant-mobile-spinoff-riot-games">creating a mobile version of <em>Valorant</em> in 2021</a>, and the previously PC-only game launched on Xbox Series X / S and PS5 consoles <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24211812/valorant-console-launch-xbox-series-s-x-ps5-download">last August</a>. Chinese studio LightSpeed is handling development, but there’s no indication of when <em>Valorant Mobile </em>will get a release in other countries as the post only says it’s “starting in China and taking it from there.” According to <em>Esports Insider</em>, the company has already done some playtesting in the country, and those who register for the new test can earn exclusive player cards via in-game missions. The outlet links to two unlisted videos, including a trailer for the game.</p><p>The announcement follows a trend of big-name shooters like <em>Call of Duty</em> getting mobile releases that stretches back a few years. LightSpeed also developed mobile versions of <em>PUBG </em>and <em>Apex Legends</em>, the latter of which shut down in 2023.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
