As of the end of 2024, the Nintendo Switch has <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">sold over 150 million units</a> in the eight years since its release. That’s an impressive number, and yet…that’s <em>still </em>not enough to make it the company’s best selling piece of hardware – a distinction that belongs to the humble Nintendo DS – but it’s getting close.</p><p>The company released its earnings report earlier this week and the numbers don’t look great. Though hardware sales are down a whopping 30 percentage points compared to 2023, Nintendo has, predictably, taken an optimistic stance. After all, this console is eight years old <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">with the Switch 2</a> tantalizingly close to launch. And in light of all that, it still sold almost 10 million units. But that impressive 150 million unit total is still a bit short of the massive 154 million units the Nintendo DS sold in its 12-year lifetime. Bolstered by recent games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> and with new games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> on the horizon, it’s likely that the Switch will finally overtake the DS this year, making it Nintendo’s best selling console ever.</p><p>After that, there’s one more boss for the console to beat before it can be called the best-selling console of all time – the 160 million units of the PlayStation 2. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
