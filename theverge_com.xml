Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Yesterday Nintendo released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/794244/what-is-nintendo-up-to">a mysterious video called “Close to You”</a> that set internet sleuths into action. The video depicted a cute baby seemingly moving objects around a nursery. Some thought that it might be a subtle teaser for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777071/super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-nintendo-direct-september-2025">the upcoming <em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em></a>, possibly showing the origin of Rosalina and her powers. Others noticed Pikmin musical cues and the tiny little creatures hiding in the background. Now we know for sure: it was Pikmin.</p><p>Unfortunately, the newly-uploaded video is currently only available in the Nintendo Today app. (I’ll update this post if and when it appears on YouTube.) In the video — which still has the same title — things play out the same, but this time around it shows that those adorable sentient plants are responsible for all of the moving objects. They’re <em>everywhere</em>; flying off rattles, carrying toy blocks, and fighting over a pacifier.</p><p>It’s a cute alternate view of the original video, even if it does raise some big existential questions for the Pikmin universe. Namely: can only children see the creatures? Nintendo has <a href="https://pikminbloom.com/#whats-pikmin-bloom">previously said</a> that Pikmin “cannot be seen with the naked eye,” but maybe the lore has changed. My house could be infested and I wouldn’t even know it.</p><p>Here’s the original video for reference:</p><p>The bigger question, of course, is whether Nintendo is teasing something with this video. A Pikmin movie? An Switch 2 update for <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23799072/pikmin-4-review-nintendo-switch">Pikmin 4</a></em>? A major expansion for <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22746461/pikmin-bloom-hands-on-niantic-iphone-android">Pikmin Bloom</a></em>? A new line of Pikmin-themed pacifiers? Or it could just be a cute, standalone short. Maybe more will be revealed tomorrow.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/796094/nintendo-close-to-you-video-pikmin]]></content:encoded>
