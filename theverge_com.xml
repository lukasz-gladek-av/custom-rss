It’s called <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-today-mobile%2F" rel="sponsored">Nintendo Today</a>, and it’ll be available on both iOS and Android. According to Shigeru Miyamoto, the app was designed to compliment its event-like livestreams, which have become incredibly popular in the Switch era. After <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606504/nintendo-switch-2-direct-new-time">the Switch 2 Direct on April 2nd</a>, the app will feature regular updates on the company’s next console.</p><p>Here’s how Nintendo explains it: “this smart-device app is like a daily calendar which delivers a variety of content including latest news, videos, and comics of your favorite Nintendo games and characters from select franchises.”</p><div><p>The announcement comes at a time when Nintendo has an awful lot going on, so keeping news together in one space makes a certain amount of sense.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/630255/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> is still alive — and it’s looking good. Nintendo unveiled a new trailer for the game that serves as an introduction of sorts, showcasing the alien world you’ll be exploring along with Samus’ various abilities, including new psychic powers that work both in combat and in puzzle solving. While no specific release date was announced, the game is due out in 2025 for the Switch.</p><p><em>Beyond</em> has been in development for a quite a while. It was originally announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15782806/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-announced-e3-2017">in 2017</a> shortly after the launch of the original Nintendo Switch, but in early 2019, Nintendo announced that it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197164/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-delay-release-date">rebooting the game’s development</a> and bringing on Retro Studios to make it.</p><p>Last year, Nintendo finally debuted a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer">gameplay trailer for it</a> and announced the <em>Beyond</em> subtitle. That trailer had some clear <em>Metroid Prime</em> DNA — intense firefights and scanning things! But at the time, the company only provided a vague 2025 release date for the upcoming game.</p><p>The first Switch was actually a great platform for <em>Metroid</em> games, with the thrilling <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22710468/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch">2D <em>Metroid Dread</em></a> and a very-good <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/9/23592822/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-best-way-classic">remastered version of the original <em>Metroid Prime</em></a>. You can also play the original <em>Metroid</em>, <em>Metroid II: Return of Samus</em>, <em>Super Metroid</em>, <em>Metroid Fusion</em>, and <em>Metroid: Zero Mission</em> via Nintendo Switch Online.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Best Buy hasn’t said what time the preorders will open; however, it’s on the same day as the Nintendo Direct presentation <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606504/nintendo-switch-2-direct-new-time">that’s all about the new Switch 2</a>, which starts at 9 AM ET / 6 AM PT.</p><p>Nintendo opened the first Nintendo Switch preorders immediately following a presentation in January 2017, and you had to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/13/14261878/nintendo-switch-console-preorder-best-buy-walmart">physically go to a Best Buy or Target</a> to secure a preorder before its launch on March 3rd, 2017. US retailers, including Best Buy, have yet to confirm they will have preorders ready for the Switch 2 after the presentation.</p><p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">revealed the looks and minimal details</a> about the Nintendo Switch 2 console in January. Some of the most significant information we know about the Switch 2 is that it has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345191/nintendo-switch-2-bigger-screen">a larger screen</a>, is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343666/nintendo-switch-2-cartridge-backwards-compatibility">backwards compatible</a> with Switch 1 games, and has magnetically attached Joy-Cons (that will probably have mouse-like control abilities). Nintendo has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24345944/nintendo-switch-2-preview-event-how-to-register">set up nationwide events</a> running from April through May for customers to try the system. However, all tickets have been given out so you must join a waitlist at this point. The Nintendo Switch 2 is expected to launch this June.</p><p><em><strong>Update March 27th</strong>: Best Buy Canada has removed the blog post mentioned in this article.</em></p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
