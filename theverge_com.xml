As the name implies, <em>The Dark Ages</em> is set in a medieval fantasy realm and takes place long before the events of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186572/doom-eternal-review-xbox-ps4-pc-stadia-date-battlegrounds"><em>Doom Eternal</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/27/11795652/doom-review">the franchise’s 2016 reboot</a>. The developers say that the new game features a much bigger world with a larger emphasis on story — including plenty of cutscenes — but the most important changes appear to be with how <em>The Dark Ages</em> will play.</p><p>A big focus this time around is on melee combat. Since this is a <em>Doom</em> set in medieval times, that means players will get access to brutal new melee weapons like a spiked mace and iron flail. The scale of battles also seems to have ramped up. We already knew that players would get a mount in the form of a cybernetic dragon, but today’s reveal also showed off a skyscraper-sized mech suit so that the Doomslayer can fight enemies the size of kaiju.</p><p>Another big change is a greater emphasis on accessibility through a series of gameplay sliders. These let you adjust things like the game speed or parry timing, either ramping them up or down. Essentially, these options should give players the ability to really customize the experience, either making it more approachable or a whole lot harder. There are standard difficulty options as well.</p><p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is coming to the PS5, Xbox, and PC when it launches in May.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350352/ninja-gaiden-4-xbox<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft promised a new game announcement at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/13/15259958/ninja-gaiden-remastered-soundtrack-retro-game-music">its Xbox Developer Direct event</a>, and that game turned out to be <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>. The new entry in the long-running franchise is being co-developed by Team Ninja along with Platinum Games, the team behind action games like <em>Bayonetta </em>and <em>Nier: Automata</em>. The game is launching in Fall 2025, and will be coming to Xbox, PC, and PS5 (it will also be available via Game Pass).</p><p>While the <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> franchise has been around <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/13/15259958/ninja-gaiden-remastered-soundtrack-retro-game-music">since the late ‘80s</a>, it entered into a new era on the Xbox with the bloody, and tough-as-nails <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> on Xbox in 2004. That version, developed by Team Ninja, was ported to a handful of other consoles and also received a number of sequels. Based on the debut trailer, the new game looks to continue the dark action started with the 2004 release, but with even faster gameplay.</p><p>In addition to the brand-new release, a remake of Ninja Gaiden II was also announced called Ninja Gaiden II Black. In a nice surprise: the game is available now on console, PC, and Game Pass.</p><div><p>These aren’t the only returns to <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> in the works, however. Retro experts Dotemu are also developing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320061/ninja-gaiden-is-back-and-very-pixelated">a new throwback release called <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em></a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
