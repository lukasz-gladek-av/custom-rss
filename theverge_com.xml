            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/662128/minecraft-vr-mixed-reality-support-bedrock-update-1-21-80<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Minecraft’s</em> official support for virtual reality and mixed reality devices is over. Mojang announced last year that Minecraft would stop supporting VR headsets after March 2025, and per today’s <em>Minecraft: Bedrock Edition</em> 1.21.80 Update <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-bedrock-edition-1-21-80">patch notes</a>, that support has been removed, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2773555/minecraft-officially-kills-support-for-vr.html">as reported by <em>PCWorld</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>When Mojang announced the end of support for VR <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278397/minecraft-virtual-reality-support-end-2025">in October</a>, it said that you’ll still get updates on your PC, you’ll still be able to play without a VR / MR device, and that you’ll be able to continue building worlds or use any Marketplace purchases. At the time, Mojang’s reasoning for removing support <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-21-40-bedrock-changelog">was that</a> “our ability to support VR / MR devices has come to an end.”</p><p>However, there are still ways to play <em>Minecraft</em> on a VR headset, if you’d like. If you have the Java version of the game for PC, you can use a mod like <a href="https://www.vivecraft.org/">Vivecraft</a>, which works on many VR platforms, or <a href="https://questcraft.org/">QuestCraft</a>, a port specific to Meta Quest headsets.</p><p>Still, I’m a little sad to see official VR support ending for <em>Minecraft</em>, especially if you, like me, can remember the incredibly impressive <em>Minecraft</em> demo for HoloLens from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/21/7868363/minecraft-hololens-microsoft-freecell">way back in the day</a>. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
