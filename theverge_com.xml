As part of the latest Windows 11 Insider Preview Build, Microsoft is rolling out support for the Xbox FSE in preview to “MSI Claw models” today, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/10/31/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26220-7051-dev-beta-channels/">the company announced</a>.</p><p>FSE debuted on the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X earlier this month, and my colleague Sean Hollister ran into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/799698/xbox-ally-x-review-asus-microsoft-full-screen-experience">quite a few issues with it</a> (and the new handhelds). If you’re interested in installing the Xbox FSE on your MSI Claw, you might want to wait until some of the problems are ironed out and until it’s available outside of the Windows Insider program.</p><p>To turn on the Xbox FSE, “on supported devices, go to Settings &gt; Gaming &gt; Full screen experience, then select Xbox as your home app,” Microsoft says. “Once enabled, you can access FSE from Task View and Game Bar or configure your handheld to enter full screen experience on startup.”</p><p>In today’s post, Microsoft says that “additional OEMs” will be enabling their handhelds to use the Xbox FSE “in the coming months,” and we already know that Lenovo’s Legion Go 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/772853/the-lenovo-legion-go-2-will-get-xbox-flavored-windows-in-spring-2026">is set to get it next year</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/811826/microsoft-xbox-full-screen-experience-fse-msi-claw-windows-11-insider]]></content:encoded>
