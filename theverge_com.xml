            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Forty years ago today, the Nintendo Entertainment System launched in North America, and to help celebrate the anniversary, <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/nes-40th-anniversary/">8BitDo has announced a new NES40 collection</a>. It features updated versions of three of 8BitDo’s existing products, including its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619229/8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-tmr-anti-drift-joysticks">Ultimate 2 wireless controller</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/31/23813761/8bitdo-retro-mechanical-keyboard-nintendo-famicom">Retro 87 Keyboard N Edition</a>, and <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/cube-speaker/">Retro Cube Speaker</a>.</p></div><p>The updates made to the <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-2-bluetooth-nes-40th/">N40 version of 8BitDo’s Ultimate 2 controller</a> are mostly cosmetic, but it now features a black-and-gray design with bright red buttons and a charging dock that matches the aesthetics of the NES console. The controller will also include four swappable joystick caps while its grips are printed with dates that correlate to launches of notable Nintendo and 8BitDo products.</p><p>Functionality is the same as the original version of the Ultimate 2, including the TMR joysticks, Hall effect triggers, a ring of color-changing LEDs around the base of each joystick, reprogrammable bumper buttons, an extra pair of buttons on the back, and compatibility with the Switch, Switch 2, and Windows devices. The 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller - N40 is available for preorder starting today for $79.99 and comes with 8BitDo’s Retro Receiver for wirelessly connecting it to an original NES, and a 2.4GHz adapter providing a faster wireless connection for gaming. It will be released on November 15th, 2025, but will be limited to only 1,985 units.</p><p>For the new <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-68-keyboard-nes-40th/">8BitDo Retro 68 Keyboard N40</a>, the updates are the opposite. Despite being a little more compact than 8BitDo’s first mechanical keyboard because it features a 68-key layout instead of 87, the new N40 version looks very similar to the original but includes some significant hardware upgrades. The entire keyboard, including the shell, keycaps, and buttons, is made from aluminum alloy, and 8BitDo has switched from Kailh’s clicky Box White V2 switches to its linear Box Ice Cream Pro Max switches. The Retro 68 also includes a much larger 6,500mAh battery boosting usage to up to 300 hours between charges, and it comes with the original’s oversized programmable Super Buttons accessories that now wirelessly connect to the keyboard instead of being tethered by a 3.5mm cable.</p><p>The Retro 68 N40 keyboard is more than twice as heavy as the original, weighing in at a beefy 2,200 grams, and considerably more expensive. The Retro 87 debuted at $99.99 in 2023, but the new Retro 68 will be available for preorder starting today for $499.99 and is expected to ship sometime in January 2026.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-cube-2-speaker/">8BitDo Retro Cube 2 Speaker N Edition</a> also looks nearly identical to 8BitDo’s Retro Cube Speaker that has been NES-themed since it first launched in 2016. But the new version introduces dual stereo speakers with music and gaming modes, a built-in microphone, a larger 2,000mAh battery offering up to 30 hours of playtime on a full charge, and the option to switch to a 2.4GHz connection instead of Bluetooth using a bundled dongle. Its USB port has been upgraded from Micro USB to USB-C, but the speaker can be charged by simply placing it on a new wireless dock that’s included.</p><p>The original version launched nearly a decade ago for $35, while the new Retro Cube 2 speaker is available for preorder starting today for $49.99 and is expected to be released on December 8th, 2025.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/801832/8bitdo-nintendo-nes-ultimate-2-controller-retro-keyboard-bluetooth-cube-speaker]]></content:encoded>
