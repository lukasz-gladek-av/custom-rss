The AIR SNES are a heavily customized version of the Nike Air Max 90 inspired by other <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/15/24221246/can-you-guess-which-consoles-inspired-these-custom-shoeboys-sneakers">gaming-themed sneakers like Bull Airs’ ShoeBoys</a>, but Bonzanini’s creation doubles as a functional retro console.</p><p>Given the size of the Super Nintendo, and the chunky cartridges it used, Bonzanini decided against trying to trim down and shrink the console’s electronics to fit inside a shoe that was still wearable. They instead opted to go the emulation route and used a compact <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/28/14762228/raspberry-pi-zero-w-wireless-adds-wifi-and-bluetooth">Raspberry Pi Zero W</a>. It has more than enough processing power to play 16-bit SNES games using the RetroPie emulator that Bonzanini customized to match the look and feel of the sneaker.</p><p>But you won’t find the microcomputer hidden away in the sole of the Air Max 90. All of the electronics, including a battery with enough capacity for up to 30 minutes of gameplay, can be found inside the sneaker’s tongue. The Raspberry Pi Zero W includes an integrated Mini HDMI port, but to “make the design feel like it could exist in 1990,” Bonzanini added a small analog converter so the AIR SNES connects to a TV using retro RCA cables.</p><p>The sneakers even work with an original SNES gamepad, but to keep the cable wrangling to a minimum Bonzanini upgraded the controller using an <a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-mod-kit-for-original-snes-sfc-controller-old-edition">8BitDo Mod Kit</a> so it connects to the Raspberry Pi wirelessly over Bluetooth. Given the ever-growing popularity of retro gaming nostalgia and sneaker culture there’s little doubt Bonzanini could sell as many pairs of AIR SNES as they could make. But unfortunately they’re just a one-off creation with no plans to commercialize the design.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/829880/gustavo-bonzanini-nike-air-max-90-sneaker-super-nintendo]]></content:encoded>
