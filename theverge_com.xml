            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24289138/steam-game-recording-now-available-all-users<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steam Game Recording <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4472730495692571025">is officially out of beta</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fgamerecording">available to all users</a>, giving PC, Mac, and Steam Deck players a built-in way to record and share audio and video from their gaming sessions. It joins many other ways PC gamers have been able to record their highlights, including as a feature of tools like the<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21222533/record-screen-pc-windows-laptop-xbox-game-bar-how-to"> Xbox Game Bar</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/23/4358300/nvidia-shadowplay-and-geforce-gtx-780">Nvidia GeForce</a>, and AMD’s Adrenalin.</p><p>This version of the Steam client is also the first to drop support for Windows 7 and 8 machines, as well as Macs running macOS 10.13 and 10.14 after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/1/24021950/steam-has-now-officially-stopped-supporting-windows-7-windows-8-and-windows-8-1">Valve announced the move</a> at the beginning of this year. </p><p>After an automatic update, players can start recordings manually using a hotkey (Ctrl + F11 is the default) or set it to trigger automatically, with options to restrict the length, quality, and storage space that Steam can use. Valve says it works with any game, including non-Steam games that allow Steam Overlay to run. Recording is off by default — you’ll find its settings in a new Game Recording tab in Steam’s settings. </p><p>Valve has updated Steam Game Recording with a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4530150757095178611?utm_source=SteamDB">handful of new features</a> that weren’t there when the beta period <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186716/valve-steam-native-game-recording-tool-deck">began in June</a>, including adding “advanced” export options and the ability to configure game-specific settings. The company also added Session View, which includes a “Recordings &amp; Screenshots manager with game-specific tags and data.” </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24288836/elon-musk-top-20-diablo-4-players-the-pit<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Elon Musk is a busy man right now. He’s supposedly running X, SpaceX, Tesla, and Neuralink, all while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271770/elon-musk-trump-pennsylvania-talks">actively campaigning for Trump</a>. But despite those myriad concerns, Musk still finds the time to play <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23747068/diablo-iv-review-blizzard-class-customization"><em>Diablo 4</em></a>. He’s even said he’s pretty good at it, claiming in a recent interview with Joe Rogan that he’s in the top 20 of <em>Diablo 4</em> players <em>— </em>a feat that apparently only two Americans can claim. If this sounds like the unearned boasting from the same guy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/29/23979850/tesla-cybertruck-delivery-design-production-problems-delay">who claimed his Cybertrucks are bulletproof</a>... it is.</p><p>The Pit is a timed dungeon in <em>Diablo 4</em>. Players are given 15 minutes to clear out monsters and the final boss, with each death shaving an increasing amount of time off the overall timer. Players who can complete The Pit earn endgame materials used to improve their gear, and since this is an endgame dungeon, the fights are pretty difficult. Clearing the dungeon as fast as possible is, therefore, a decent indication that you can <em>Diablo </em>pretty good. </p><p>In fact, there’s a leaderboard ranking players by their Pit completion times which is the basis for Musk’s claim. If you check out the <a href="https://helltides.com/pit">Pit leaderboard</a> at <a href="http://helltides.com/">helltides.com</a>, sure enough, at the time of publication, Elon Musk is sitting smack dab at number 20.</p><p>But here’s the catch. </p><p>There are no official leaderboards for The Pit. <a href="http://helltides.com/">Helltides.com</a> is not affiliated with Activision Blizzard. These rankings are based on screen-recorded runs submitted by the players themselves. And the number of submissions used to create this list? 881. </p><p>To be fair to Musk, clearing The Pit in 2 minutes and 45 seconds is no mean feat. It shows that he knows what he’s doing (or that he at least knows how to look up optimal builds for his class on sites like <a href="http://icyveins.com/">IcyVeins.com</a>.) But it strains the hell out of credulity to claim he’s in the top 20<em> Diablo 4</em> players <em>in the world</em> based on a list made up of only 881 people. Steam’s concurrent player count alone shows the game sitting at 11,000 players.</p><p>In an interview with <em>The Verge</em>, Fayz, co-owner of <a href="http://helltides.com/">helltides.com</a>, agrees with Musk calling himself a “top 20” <em>Diablo 4 </em>player. “It’s the best global list we have,” Fayz said over Discord. “Elon’s claim is valid.” But Fayz recognizes the leaderboard’s limitations. </p><p>“It’s as comprehensive as it gets in terms of recorded Pit runs with video proof, since our community always alerts us when new top runs are recorded and posted on social media,” Fayz wrote. “But, there’s no way for us to know about Pit runs that aren’t recorded and shared.”</p><p>Musk is one of many billionaires who’ve made lofty but unverifiable claims about their gaming prowess. In a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pubity/video/7422388239169785120">TikTok video for Pubity</a>, Mark Zuckerberg recently boasted that he’s “close to grandmaster status” in <em>Civilization</em> and that it’d surprise him if anyone in the world could beat him. In 2017, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/23/technology/travis-kalanick-pushes-uber-and-himself-to-the-precipice.html?_r=0"><em>New York Times</em> reported</a> that Travis Kalanick, the former CEO of Uber, “once held the world’s second-highest score for the Nintendo <em>Wii Tennis</em> video game.” (This led to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/04/was-ubers-ceo-really-the-second-best-wii-sports-tennis-player/">an interesting deep-dive from <em>Ars Technica</em></a>, which concluded Kalanick was wrong.) Musk could have legitimately claimed exceptional ability in <em>Diablo 4</em> and left it at that. But, as is usually the case with billionaires, his ego got in the way, leading him to make statements that just aren’t supported in fact. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
