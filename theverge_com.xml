According to a statement sent to <em>The Verge</em> by Eddie Garcia on behalf of Nintendo, it says preorders will no longer begin on April 9th:</p><div><p><em>Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.</em></p><p>There’s still no word on when preorders will begin, as Nintendo says it will “update timing at a later date.” Nintendo still plans to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">launch the Switch 2 on June 5th</a>.</p></div><p>It was going to send out invitations letting customers who met certain requirements <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641559/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gameplay-requirements">preorder the Switch 2 directly</a> from its website starting May 8th, but now it’s unclear when they will happen.</p><div><p>The Switch 2 costs $449.99 and comes with several upgrades, including a larger 7.9-inch 1080p display, 256GB of storage, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">a C-button for in-game chats</a>. We don’t know yet whether the Switch 2 or its accessories will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642459/switch-2-price-donald-trump-tariffs-china-vietnam-cambodia">go up in price in response to the tariffs</a>. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642868/nintendo-switch-2-price-console-games-accessories">Switch 2 is already significantly</a> more expensive than its $299 predecessor, while its games have a steeper $69.99 to $79.99 price.</p></div><p>Nintendo revealed the Switch 2 on Wednesday — the same day President Donald Trump announced far-reaching tariffs affecting a number of US trade partners. We’re already starting to see the impact of this latest round of tariffs, with board game maker <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643173/trump-tariffs-steve-jackson-board-game-industry">Steve Jackson Games saying</a> it will be a “seismic shift” for the industry, predictions that it will be a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641559/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gameplay-requirements">“debacle of epic proportions for the auto industry,”</a> and the card grading service <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643117/psa-pausing-submissions-outside-us-tariffs">PSA pausing submissions</a> from outside the US.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
