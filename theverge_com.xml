But the legal battle is already over; the two companies have reached a “confidential settlement” and the case has been dismissed with prejudice, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26381827-sony-v-tencent-stipulation-for-dismissal-pursuant-to-rule-41a1aii/">according to a court document filed on Wednesday</a>.</p><p><em>Light of Motiram</em> is also no longer listed on <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3319630%3Futm_source%3Dofweb%26utm_campaign%3Drel%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_content%3Dre%26utm_term%3D1129wi" rel="sponsored">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/light-of-motiram-094dff">Epic Games Store</a> despite the <a href="https://lightofmotiram.com/EN/index.html#index">game’s website</a> showing links to listings on both stores as of this writing. A user on the game’s official subreddit also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LIGHTOFMOTlRAM/comments/1pp4mao/light_of_motiram_is_removed_on_steam/">noticed the removal</a>, pointing to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3319630/">a SteamDB link</a> that says “this app has been retired and is no longer available on the Steam store.”</p><p><em>Light of Motiram</em> was announced last year, and the aesthetics of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0Of5Xjdwbc">its reveal trailer</a> show a striking resemblance to <em>Horizon</em> the series, featuring lush landscapes, futuristic technology, and monstrous animal-like robots. In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26381828-sony-v-tencent-complaint/">its lawsuit</a>, Sony also alleged that Tencent used its “rip-off” of Horizon protagonist Aloy as the “centerpiece” of its marketing and promotional strategy.</p><p>“Tencent’s unlawful copying of the protected audiovisual elements of the Horizon games, as well as its deliberate adoption of a confusingly similar character mark, constitutes both copyright and trademark infringement that should be enjoined immediately to prevent irreparable harm to [Sony Interactive Entertainment] and the consuming public,” Sony said at the time.</p><p>“SIE and Tencent are pleased to have reached a confidential resolution and will have no further public comment on this matter,” Sean Durkin, head of communications for Tencent Americas, tells <em>The Verge</em>. “SIE and Tencent look forward to working together in the future.” Sony didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/847080/sony-tencent-lawsuit-horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-settlement]]></content:encoded>
