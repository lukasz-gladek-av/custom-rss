            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Riot Games is closing the studio behind <em>Hytale</em>, its <em>Minecraft</em>-like game that has been in development for nearly a decade. Hypixel Studios, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21223667/riot-games-league-of-legends-hypixel-studios-minecraft-hytale">Riot acquired in 2020</a> for an undisclosed sum, is shutting down “over the next few months,” according to Hypixel CEO Aaron “Noxy” Donaghey.</p><p>“After years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path, it became clear we couldn’t bring <em>Hytale </em>to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise,“ says Donaghey in a <a href="https://x.com/noxywoxy/status/1937180229031940439?s=46">post on X</a>. ”This is a painful decision. We still believe in <em>Hytale</em>. We believe in the team, and are forever grateful to every member, past or present, who poured their love into the game.“</p><p><em>Hytale</em> has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/14o3p7n/the_slow_development_of_hytale_a_timeline/">been in development</a> since 2015, when Hypixel was founded as a small indie studio by members of a popular <em>Minecraft </em>server network. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o77MzDQT1cg">trailer was released</a> in late 2018, and Hypixel was supposed to deliver a beta of <em>Hytale</em> in 2021 following the Riot acquisition a year prior. That beta never arrived, and in 2021 there was a major change to the game engine powering <em>Hytale</em> that set development back.</p><p>“Our technical ambitions grew more complex, and even after a major reboot of the game engine, the team found that <em>Hytale</em> still wasn’t as far along as it needed to be,“ says Donaghey. ”It became clear we’d need a lot more time to get it to a place where it could support the ambitious vision for the game.“</p><p>The Hypixel closure won’t affect the Hypixel server on Minecraft, which is run separately from Hypixel Studios. Despite the studio closure, Donaghey says he’s “deeply grateful to Riot” and that the team is being “supported with generous severance and resources to help them find what’s next.”</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/691791/riot-games-hypixel-studios-hytale-closure]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/brandon-russell">Brandon Russell</a> <span>Brandon Russell is a commerce writer covering deals and buying guides. Previously, he was a freelance writer for Popular Mechanics, Men’s Health, and Esquire.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you missed the chance to pick up <strong>Nintendo’s new GameCube Controller</strong> for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Switch 2</a>, your time has come. It’s back in stock for $64.99 at the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-2-nintendo-gamecube-controller-120833%2F" rel="sponsored">My Nintendo Store</a>. To add one to your collection, you’ll need to have a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fonline%2F" rel="sponsored">Nintendo Switch Online subscription</a>, which starts at $19.99 a year for individuals. Once signed up, you can place an order by signing into your Nintendo Account and adding the gamepad to your cart, though you’re still limited to one controller per account.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->65</span></p><div><p>Nintendo’s new Switch 2 gamepad updates the classic GameCube Controller with a wireless design, a GameChat button, and USB-C. However, it only works with GameCube titles available through the Switch Online Expansion Pack.</p></div></div><p>As fun as it’s been playing <em>Mario Kart World</em> and the updated versions of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/681361/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-edition"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></a> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> on the Switch 2, I’ve been enjoying catching up on GameCube titles available through the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack. The controller provides a genuine experience when playing classic titles like <em>Wind Waker</em> and <em>Soulcalibur II</em>, with some notable upgrades. </p><p>The biggest change is the addition of wireless connectivity, so you’re not tethered by a short cable. It also has Nintendo’s “C” button for opening up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/video/685229/nintendo-switch-2-gamechat-c-button-mario-kart">GameChat</a>, a new Discord-like voice chat feature that’s free until March 31st, 2026. And if you like taking screenshots, the controller has a dedicated capture button, allowing you to document your first-place finishes in <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p><p>Although it works best with GameCube titles, you can also use the controller to play Switch 2 games, complete with gyro controls. However, Nintendo warns that the GameCube Controller “doesn’t have all the buttons and features found in other controllers that can be used with the Nintendo Switch 2 system,” which means you may run into some issues when playing games on the new system.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/691562/nintendo-wireless-gamecube-controller-switch-2-restock]]></content:encoded>
