We likely won’t know more details about the follow-up to <em>Mario Kart 8</em> until Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24236766/nintendo-switch-2-games-direct-date-time">Switch 2 Direct event in April</a>, but Nacon has already announced some of the first accessories for the new handheld designed to improve the ergonomics of its Joy-Con controllers for racing games, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/nacon-reveals-new-switch-2-accessory-range-including-mario-kart-wheels">spotted by Nintendo Life</a>.</p></div><p>Several companies were prepping peripherals for the Switch 2 well before Nintendo officially revealed its new design, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">Dbrand</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">Genki</a>, and <a href="https://www.theshortcut.com/p/new-nintendo-switch-2-leak-all-but-confirms-how-the-console-will-look">smaller accessory makers</a> whose cases and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">screen protectors</a> gave us our first peeks at the console’s redesign.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.nacongaming.com/en-GB/accessories/accessories/nintendo-switch-2">Nacon’s Switch 2 lineup</a> features several accessories similar to what’s been available for the original Switch for the past seven years. These include <a href="https://www.nacongaming.com/en-GB/black-hard-transport-case-nintendo-switch-2">carrying cases</a>, <a href="https://www.nacongaming.com/en-GB/tempered-glass-protection-nintendo-switch-2">screen protectors</a>, <a href="https://www.nacongaming.com/en-GB/black-silicone-case-nintendo-switch-2">silicone wraps</a>, <a href="https://www.nacongaming.com/en-GB/ac-charger-65-watts-nintendo-switch-2">USB-C chargers</a>, and even tiny steering wheels for individual Joy-Cons for using motion controls in <em>Mario Kart</em>.</p></div><div><figcaption><em>Nacon’s Switch 2 steering wheel looks like a step-up to similar accessories released for the original Switch.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nacon</cite></p></div><p>Most interesting is a <a href="https://www.nacongaming.com/en-GB/folding-steering-wheel-joy-con-controllers-nintendo-switch-2">more elaborate steering wheel accessory</a> for the Switch 2 that looks similar to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24202067/sim-lab-formula-one-racing-gaming-mercedes-amg-petronas">racing wheels available for PC simulators</a>, but without features like force feedback. For €29.90 (about $30) it features suction cups on the base so it can be secured to a desk or table and a folding design allowing the wheel, which houses both the Switch 2’s left and right Joy-Cons, to be used at different angles.</p><p>Unfortunately, while all the new accessories are listed on Nacon’s UK site, none of them are available for preorder or include shipping dates that could give a hint of when Nintendo plans to release the Switch 2.</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer"><h2>Here’s the Nintendo Switch 2</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343782/chargepoint-cut-resistant-cables-protect-ev-charging-station"><h2>ChargePoint is doing something about all the EV charger cable-cutting crooks</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24344511/nintendo-switch-2-features-specs-handheld-dock-upgrade-comparison"><h2>The Switch 2 is boring — and that’s exactly what Nintendo needs</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24344429/spotify-streaming-book-mood-machine"><h2>What Spotify took from us by giving us everything</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24344718/nintendo-switch-2-specs-date-price-launch-games-mario-kart"><h2>All our unanswered questions about the Nintendo Switch 2</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
