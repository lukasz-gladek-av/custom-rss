            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/642025/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-zelda-wind-waker-f-zero-gx<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Before this morning, I knew I was going to buy the Nintendo Switch 2 but I didn’t know when. After watching <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream">Nintendo’s Switch 2 Direct today</a>, in which a purple block traced the GameCube’s stylized “G” logo, followed by high-res footage from <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker </em>and <em>F-Zero GX </em>and an announcement that they’ll be playable at launch, I realized I’ll be doing my damndest to get it on day one. It was the cherry on top of a stellar presentation that made the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">console’s $449.99 price tag</a> way easier to swallow.</p><p>GameCube games are coming to the Nintendo Switch Online (NSO) subscription’s Classic Game Library feature, which the company is now shortening to “Nintendo Classics.” It lets you play games from the NES, SNES, and Sega Genesis. Like the Game Boy and Nintendo 64 game collections, you’ll need the NSO Expansion Pack for GameCube games. The existing catalog of playable Classic Game Library games is far from complete, but together (and combined with DLC for contemporary Switch games), they make the Expansion Pack well worth it.</p><p>The subscription gets even more enticing on the Switch 2, starting before the console even comes out — Nintendo is prioritizing long-time subscribers (with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641559/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gameplay-requirements">certain caveats</a>) when it sends out Switch 2 preorder invites. The Expansion Pack will also let you play the Switch 2 editions of <em>Zelda </em>games <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and<em> Tears of the Kingdom </em>(provided you own their respective Switch 1 versions). </p><p>But the GameCube games are what I’m most excited about. I’d love for the Wii U’s <em>Wind Waker HD</em> to get a Switch re-release, but the GameCube version is still one of the most beautiful games I’ve ever played and looks great in Nintendo’s trailer for it. So does <em>F-Zero GX</em>, a game with such well-executed style and tight control that I would pit it against any futuristic racer today. The Switch 2 is also launching with <em>Soul Calibur II</em>, a game that featured adult Link as a playable character in his <a href="https://youtu.be/Q-25c8Rsobw?t=508">post-<em>Ocarina of Time</em> fighting-people-for-sport era</a>.</p><p>The company flashed a few other re-releases coming down the line, like <em>Super Mario Strikers </em>and <em>Chibi-Robo!, </em>in the latter of which you play a tiny, toothbrush-armed robot tasked with cleaning up a very messy house. It’s way more fun than it sounds, and gives me hope for what Nintendo <em>could</em> announce. There are some excellent, but more obscure gems that never really leapt beyond the GameCube, like the creepy, Lovecraft-inspired <em>Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem </em>and <em>Cubivore, </em>in which you play a small, wild cube trying to bring color back to the world by eating other boxy creatures, winning the chance to mate, die, and be reborn over and over again until you’ve become the fittest survivor of them all. </p><p>And all of these will be playable with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641482/nintendo-is-releasing-a-gamecube-controller">forthcoming wireless recreation of the GameCube controller</a>, as they should be. The GameCube wasn’t an abject failure, but it sold nowhere near as well as the Wii or the Switch. There’s no guarantee that the Switch 2 will keep up the sales pace set by its predecessor, but even if it manages half that console’s sales, it could give some games a well-deserved second look. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/642290/nintendo-switch-2-online-figuring-out-gamechat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s perhaps no surprise that Nintendo opened its Switch 2 Direct with <em>Mario Kart World</em>, a Switch 2-exclusive launch title that’s a sequel to the original Switch’s most popular game. But it was more of a surprise that the Direct’s second segment, instead of focusing on the console’s specs, was all about Nintendo’s Discord-like GameChat system – a system that seems to show that Nintendo is finally catching up with its online services.</p><p>For playing with your pals, GameChat looks like it could be a lot of fun. You can join a shared call with your buddies and play games together or hang out and share screens of the games you’re playing separately. The Switch 2’s onboard microphone picks up your voice for voice chat, and you can use the Switch 2 Camera accessory, which is designed to sit next to your TV while you play on the couch, to host video chats. Nintendo says other “compatible” USB-C cameras will work, too.</p><p>Even in Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVjRBTy5irI">demo video</a>, you can see that the shared screens have lower framerates than your main screen, and the sound quality from the mics seems iffy. But it appears to be a pretty low-fuss way to hang out and play games with your friends that could be a major selling point for the Switch 2 and a Nintendo Switch Online membership. (Though GameChat will be available in an “Open-Access Period” that doesn’t require Nintendo Switch Online through March 31st, 2026.)</p><p>GameChat is just one of a few smart new things Nintendo is doing with its online services. GameShare, which lets you share a Switch game you have with friends who don’t have it so you can play multiplayer together, works online. (This was <em>another</em> feature Nintendo showed before digging into the Switch 2’s specs.) </p><p>The Nintendo Switch Online app is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642093/nintendo-switch-smartphone-app-zelda-notes">getting some upgrades, too</a>. There’s a new name: just Nintendo Switch App. Nintendo Switch 2 players will also be able to access their most recent 100 screenshots or video captures. And the app will contain a new section called “Zelda Notes” that you can use for help while playing <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears for the Kingdom</em>.</p><p>Nintendo Switch Online is becoming a better deal, too – at least the premium Expansion Pack tier. That more expensive option will let you play Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24339906/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-nso">available collection of GameCube games</a>, which will include <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, and will let you access upgraded Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of certain games at no extra cost.</p><p>Nintendo has so far only said that this benefit applies to <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>. But an image on a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fwhats-new-with-nintendo-switch-online-on-nintendo-switch-2%2F" rel="sponsored">Nintendo website discussing the perk</a> includes an image of <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, and <em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em>, so it seems like those Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrades, when they’re available, will be eventually included in the Expansion Pack, too.</p><p>All of these new changes are in addition to the recent launch of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24288201/nintendo-music-streaming-hands-on-impressions">dedicated Nintendo Music app</a>, to which Nintendo is drip-feeding some of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/623759/nintendo-music-app-legend-of-zelda-link-to-the-past-snes">best</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/636581/nintendo-music-app-tetris-dr-mario-kirby-edit-share-playlists-update">soundtracks</a>, and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637319/nintendo-today-news-app">Nintendo Today news app</a>, which it’s already used <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/638133/legend-of-zelda-movie-premiere-date-2027">to break news</a>. It seems like Nintendo is taking its online services more seriously than ever to make its games better and broaden its overall footprint in your life, and all in a very Nintendo way.</p><p>Let’s just hope that GameChat is actually good.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
