            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/671409/microsoft-xbox-mobile-store-delay-apple-epic-court-case<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A year ago Xbox president Sarah Bond revealed that Microsoft was planning to launch a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/9/24153245/microsoft-xbox-mobile-gaming-store-july-launch">new Xbox mobile web store</a> in July 2024. That never happened. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24211805/where-is-the-xbox-mobile-store">I’ve been wondering</a> what the hold up has been over the past year, and it seems we might have an answer: Apple.</p><p>Microsoft filed an amicus brief late on Tuesday, in support of Epic Games’ ongoing fight with Apple’s control over the App Store. The brief takes issue with Apple’s attempt to overturn the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">injunction that allows</a> Epic and other developers to freely advertise alternative payment methods in their apps, and not have to pay Apple additional fees for purchases made outside of apps.</p><p>It’s a key ruling that has already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661290/fortnite-ios-iphone-epic-games-back-apple-app-store">allowed <em>Fortnite </em>to return to the App Store in the US</a>, complete with the ability for Epic Games to link out to its own payment system inside the game. Microsoft has wanted to offer a similar experience for its Xbox mobile store, but it says its solution “has been stymied by Apple.” Here’s how Microsoft explains it:</p><div><blockquote><p>The district court’s injunction allows Apple to maintain its in-app exclusivity but at least should have enabled Microsoft to offer consumers a workable solution by launching its own online store — accessible via link-out — for in-app items to be purchased off-app and used in games or other apps. And that is what Microsoft wants to do. But even this solution has been stymied by Apple. Prior to the district court’s most recent order, Microsoft had been unable to implement linked-out payments (or even inform customers that alternative purchase methods exist) because of Apple’s new anti-steering policies that restrict Microsoft’s communication to users and impose an even higher economic cost to Microsoft than before the injunction.</p></blockquote></div><p>The court ruling makes it possible for Microsoft to now launch its Xbox mobile store, but it’s clear that the software giant also wants to ensure Apple’s appeal against the ruling isn’t successful. If Microsoft did launch its Xbox mobile store and then Apple won a temporary stay, it may have to pull that store pending the appeal process.</p><p>Microsoft even notes in its filing that “Apple makes no argument that the technical or policy changes cannot be undone,” so it’s urging the ruling to be enforced pending Apple’s appeal. “Microsoft’s own experience managing app stores confirms that Apple’s policies could be restored if Apple ultimately prevails on appeal.”</p><p>The court ruling also impacts Microsoft’s main Xbox mobile app. “Similarly, Microsoft has long sought to enable Xbox app users on iOS to both buy and stream games in the app from the cloud or their other devices,” says Microsoft in its filing. “Apple’s policies have restricted Microsoft’s ability to offer these functionalities together; the injunction allows Microsoft to explore this possibility.”</p><p>Microsoft started rolling out the ability to purchase games and DLC <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/649958/xbox-purchase-games-mobile-app-launch">inside the Xbox mobile app last month</a>, but it had to remove the remote play option to adhere to Apple’s App Store policies. You can’t currently buy an Xbox game in the Xbox mobile app on iOS and then stream it inside that same app. You have to manually navigate to the Xbox Cloud Gaming mobile website on a browser to get access to cloud gaming.</p><p>Sarah Bond <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24267339/microsoft-xbox-android-purchase-games-us-court-ruling">also announced plans</a> to let players purchase and play games within the Xbox app on Android in October, just days after a court ruled that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores">Google must crack open</a> Android to third-party app stores. The feature was supposed to arrive in November, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24307867/microsoft-google-xbox-game-store-android-purchase-games">but Bond then blamed</a> a “temporary administrative stay” for holding it back.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/670285/amd-radeon-rx-9060-xt-announcement-computex<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>AMD is officially announcing its Radeon RX 9060 XT GPU at Computex today. Like the number implies, this graphics card will challenge Nvidia’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661807/nvidia-rtx-5060-cards-laptops-release-date-price">recently released RTX 5060</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/648705/nvidias-rtx-5060-ti-gpu-pricing-release-date">RTX 5060 Ti</a>, with AMD offering models with 8GB or 16GB of VRAM. AMD is launching both models on June 5th, with the 8GB variant priced at $299, with the 16GB version priced at $349.</p><p>AMD is following Nvidia’s controversial choice to ship a modern GPU with just 8GB of VRAM in the year 2025. The 8GB of VRAM debate has been raging for months now, particularly because of the latest games that can be very demanding on the memory side. AMD is following in Nvidia’s footsteps, though, so it’ll be interesting to see what reviewers make of both cards in this important part of the market.</p><p>The RX 9060 XT will ship with 32 RDNA 4 compute units, a boost clock of 3.13GHz, and support for DisplayPort 2.1a and HDMI 2.1b. The total board power is between 150 watts and 182 watts, depending on the model. AMD claims its 16GB version of the RX 9060 XT will be around 6 percent faster than Nvidia’s RTX 5060 Ti at 1440p resolution, based on 40 games that AMD has tested itself.</p><p>We’re still waiting to hear how the RTX 5060 stacks up, because oddly, Nvidia launched its latest 50-series GPU yesterday without any reviews available. The GPU maker had reportedly prevented reviewers from obtaining the necessary driver to test the RTX 5060 ahead of the release date, presumably because it’s worried about the paltry 8GB of VRAM spec.</p><p>While the 8GB of VRAM choice for both Nvidia and AMD is controversial, Nvidia has managed to spark a further wave of outrage from PC gaming YouTubers over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/669538/we-will-not-play-those-games">comments it has made to Gamers Nexus</a>. In a 22-minute video, Gamers Nexus <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiekGcwaIho">discusses the pressure from Nvidia</a> to include Multi Frame Generation (MFG) in benchmarks against competitor cards that don’t have a similar feature. Gamers Nexus (GN) alleges that Nvidia has even implied that it would revoke access to interview Nvidia engineers unless the channel discussed MFG more.</p><p><em><strong>Update, May 21st</strong>: Article updated with pricing and release date information that AMD didn’t share with The Verge ahead of its press conference.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
