The game’s title was revealed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/648151/star-wars-zero-company-strategy-game-celebration">earlier this week</a>.</p><p>Alongside the release year, the two companies also shared a bit more information about what you can expect from the game. “In <em>Star Wars Zero Company</em>, players will step into the shoes of Hawks, a former Republic officer, to command an elite squad of cunning operatives through a gritty and authentic story set in the twilight of the Clone Wars,” according to a press release.</p><p>You’ll be able to customize Hawks’ appearance and class, and team members you recruit can “be personalized from a range of original <em>Star Wars</em> character classes and species.” Your team members can also “forge bonds” to “unlock powerful combat synergies that can turn the tide of battle.”</p><p><em>Zero Company</em> will launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X / S.</p><p>Bit Reactor is leading development on <em>Zero Company</em> alongside Respawn Entertainment and Lucasfilm Games. The game was initially announced without a title in January 2022 as part of a three-game set of <em>Star Wars</em> titles that Respawn would be working on. The other two games are <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23697355/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-ps5-xbox-pc">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a></em> and a new FPS game.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/651921/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d-bundle-microcenter-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Building (or rebuilding) a gaming PC can be difficult. It’s complex stuff, making sure everything’s compatible and whatnot. The next toughest part is finding a deal — and having the patience to wait for price drops without getting so antsy you buy everything at full price (shamefully raises hand). If you’re considering an AMD build, Micro Center has a great deal on a hardware bundle that includes the Ryzen 7 7800X3D (last-gen, but still among <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/5/23668320/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d-review-cpu-processor-benchmark-test">the mightiest CPUs around for gaming</a>, according to our review), a motherboard, and RAM. Normally around $579.99, you can snag the bundle in-store only for <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/5006986/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d,-asus-b650-e-tuf-gaming,-gskill-flare-x5-series-32gb-ddr5-6000-kit,-computer-build-bundle">$499.99</a> if you have a Micro Center nearby.</p><p>In addition to the 7800X3D processor ($389.99 by itself), which was only recently supplanted by the higher-end <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24288948/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-review-cpu-processor-benchmark-test">9800X3D processor</a>, you’ll get an Asus TUF B650-E motherboard (valued at $194.99), plus 32GB of G.Skill Flare X5 DDR5-6,000MHz RAM (valued at $89.99). You’ll save $175 instead of paying $675 for all three components, giving you more pocket change for a GPU.</p><p>The 7800X3D utilizes the AM5 motherboard socket, used on the newer 9000-series processors. It seems likely that AMD will stick with AM5 in the near future, so you’ll have at least a couple of CPU generations to pick from should you ever need to upgrade. As for the motherboard, it has three M.2 slots (one of which is PCIe 5.0, while the others are PCIe 4.0), support for USB-C ports on the front and back of your case, and Wi-Fi 6E built-in, among other niceties. If you’d prefer to have Corsair Vengeance RAM instead of what’s included with this bundle, you can elect to pay a $15 price increase when you pick up the bundle in-store.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
