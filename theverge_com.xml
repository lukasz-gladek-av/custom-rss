            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Nex Playground is apparently <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m7du6uaaec2p">one of the hottest</a> consoles this holiday season thanks to its kid-friendly games and fun, motion-controlled gameplay. And now through December 14th, the cube-shaped console is on sale for its Black Friday low of around $199 ($50 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Playground-AI-Powered-Transforms-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0D2JGYX3F?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. There are some other great deals still available you might have missed this week, too, including a sizable discount on the new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Buds-Cancellation-Transparency/dp/B0FGKTDTRB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Google Pixel Buds 2A</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GENKI-Moonbase-Desktop-Charger-Moonlight/dp/B0FL1RBYJR/ref=sr_1_2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Genki’s Moonbase Charging Station</a>, which looks straight out of <em>Star Wars</em>.</p><div><div><h2>Featured Products</h2></div><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div><p>The <strong>Nex Playground</strong> easily connects to your TV and provides a clever interactive solution that encourages you and your family to move around. A built-in camera and AI software track your movements with precision, so <em>you</em> are the controller. The cube-shaped console comes with five games (<em>Fruit Ninja</em>, <em>Starri</em>, <em>Party Fowl</em>, <em>Go Keeper</em>, and <em>Whack-a-Mole Deluxe</em>), but there are a ton of others you can download; however, a three-month subscription ($49) or an annual Play Pass ($89) is required to enjoy the full catalog and seasonal drops.</p><p><strong>Genki’s Moonbase</strong> features a sleek retro-futuristic design, and it’s currently down to an all-time low of $89.99 ($50 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GENKI-Moonbase-Desktop-Charger-Moonlight/dp/B0FL1RBYJR/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. The power strip features three AC plugs (1,250W max power) and four USB-C ports that can deliver up to 240W of total power; a single USB-C port, meanwhile, can go up to 140W with the right cable, though one isn’t included with your purchase. The strip also features a non-removable, 1.5-meter braided cable, making it easy to reach the nearest outlet.</p><p>Each AC plug is spaced far enough apart to accommodate larger power adapters, but the main selling point here is a touch-sensitive button that lets you cycle through colors and toggle the charging station’s lights on and off. All in all, the Moonbase is a powerful power strip that looks cool and lets you charge up to seven devices simultaneously.</p><p>Google recently <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://store.google.com/us/collection/offers?" rel="sponsored">launched a holiday sale</a> that runs through December 24th, with many items matching the pricing we saw during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. One of the standout deals is the <strong>Pixel Buds 2A</strong>, which have returned to their all-time low of $99 ($30 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Buds-Cancellation-Transparency/dp/B0FGKTDTRB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fgoogle-pixel-buds-2a-wireless-earbuds-with-active-noise-cancellation-bluetooth-headphones-hazel%2FJ39TC8J6Z8%2Fsku%2F6642707" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, and the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://store.google.com/product/pixel_buds_2a" rel="sponsored">Google Store</a>.</p><p>The Pixel Buds 2A are Google’s latest, most affordable pair of wireless earbuds, but they don’t skimp on features. They offer active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode, along with excellent sound for the price. They also provide hands-free Gemini support, allowing you to quickly get directions, brainstorm ideas, and summarize messages. The earbuds offer up to 10 hours of listening time with ANC disabled and carry an IP54 rating, too, which isn’t great but should provide at least some protection against rain and sweat.</p><div><p id="a-few-more-deals-to-check-out"><h2>A few more deals to check out</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Apple’s <strong>M4-powered MacBook Air 13</strong> is on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2025-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop/dp/B0DZDC3WW5/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fapple-macbook-air-13-inch-laptop-apple-m4-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-16gb-memory-256gb-ssd-midnight%2FJJGCQ8RH7G" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> starting at $749 ($250 off), which is just a few dollars shy of its Black Friday low. However, if you purchase it at Best Buy, you’ll also get a free $25 gift card. The slim laptop offers an impressive combination of performance and battery life, with double the base RAM of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24114684/apple-macbook-air-m3-13-15-inch-2024-review">predecessor</a> (16GB versus 8GB) and two Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C ports. It’s still relatively limited with 256GB of base storage, but it remains one of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops">best laptops available</a>, especially with the current discount. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/627186/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-15-inch-2025-laptop-review">Read our review</a>.</span></li><li><span>Hoto’s new <strong>PixelDrive electric screwdriver</strong> is on sale for the first time at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FKBJL68H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, where you can snag it for $59.99 ($20 off). The cordless PixelDrive is great for small- to medium-sized projects, whether you’re assembling electronics or putting together furniture. It features up to 6Nm of torque, along with a single multi-function button that allows you to change the screwdriver’s direction, switch to an 80RPM precision mode for delicate tasks, or boost up to 200RPM with one finger. It also has a built-in pixelated display, so you can quickly check the battery life and see which of the six torque levels you’re using.</span></li><li><span>The <strong>Lego Super Mario Goombas’ Playground</strong> set is as adorable as it sounds, and it’s currently down to $8.99 ($6 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CV25P9MF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Flego-super-mario-goombas-playground-super-mario-toys-and-playset-71433%2FJXPLL2HJ4Z%2Fsku%2F6582434" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>. The set comes in at a relatively light 171 pieces, which you can use to build three Goomba figurines, a tree trunk, and a seesaw. Each Goomba has its own evil (but cute) expression, and they can stack on top of each other to make a small Goomba tower. There’s even a lever on the back of the tree trunk that can make a Goomba pop out, so you can play a round of peekaboo before placing the set on a desk or bookshelf.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzE5"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandon Russell</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/844093/nex-playground-google-pixel-buds-2a-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/840324/sektori-review-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Sektori</em> is an old-school twin-stick shooter. Created by a former developer at <em>Returnal</em> studio Housemarque, it puts you in the role of a little ship that blasts through swarms of enemies, and you have to weave through them to get upgrades to help you survive. Often, my runs end after less than a couple minutes, like a retro arcade game. But creator Kimmo Lahtinen brilliantly weaves modern ideas from roguelikes with pulsing visuals and music that make <em>Sektori</em> a mesmerizing experience.</p><p>A key part of what makes <em>Sektori</em> good is how it puts you into a flow state. “<em>Sektori</em> is a place, a form of being, a method of transformation,” reads the description of the game’s campaign mode. “<em>Sektori</em> is seeking, processing, shaping. <em>Sektori</em> is a specter of your zero state.” It may be fancy, high-concept language, but bear with me as I detail how the game actually works. It took me a while to understand it, and how everything connects is what makes the game actually reach those lofty heights.</p><p>When you start a campaign mode run, your tiny ship is dropped into a small playing field. You initially have two ways to attack: a gun that fires infinite laser bullets in the direction you point your right stick and a “strike” that surges your ship forward but has a short cooldown. Enemies are mostly polygonal shapes that briefly appear as red outlines, giving you a moment to get out of the way before they solidify and become threats. If you take a hit, you lose one of the three shields that you start with. When you destroy enemies, they leave little triangles called “glimmer,” and if you collect enough, you can pick up upgrades.</p><p>The upgrade system is the game’s secret sauce. On the left side of the screen, you’ll see a list of upgrades covering speed, score, strike, shield, missile, and blaster. When you pick up a selector token, it moves the potential upgrade up one notch on the list, but when you actually pick an upgrade, it starts the selector from the beginning again. So, for example, if you pick up enough selector tokens to get a missile upgrade, the next selector token you get afterward will make you eligible for a speed upgrade.</p><p>The system means you’re constantly having to make decisions, often while surrounded by enemies, about whether you want to take a more easily attainable speed or strike upgrade or hold out for the more valuable improvements higher up the stack. Complicating things further is that you can only use selector tokens to get five extra shields total during a run, so you’ll often have to weigh if you want to pick up a shield or gamble on staying alive to grab a missile or blaster upgrade that could help more offensively.</p><p>Occasionally, you’ll come across “evolver tokens” that give you other, more substantial upgrades you can pick from a deck, like drones that fly around your ship or a gun that fires behind you. Every once in a while, you’ll also see a token with a rotating set of letters, and if you pick up all of the letters to spell a word (the harder the difficulty, the longer the word), you’ll enter a brief, rainbow-filled superpowered state that’s kind of like getting a star in <em>Mario Kart</em>.</p><p>Complicating things even further is the fact that the arena is constantly shifting and changing around you. Every few seconds, the map grows, shrinks, and sometimes even briefly blocks you off from previously accessible areas. If you’re in an area that gets cut off the map when it’s removed, which is marked by flashing red spots ahead of its disappearance, it’s an instant game over. Survive for long enough, and the arena shifts into a boss battle, such as a giant, <a href="https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Moldorm_(Boss)">Moldorm-like</a> snake, and if you beat the boss, you’ll move on to the next, harder level. Survive for five levels and you’ll win the run.</p><p>It can be a lot to manage. Most of my runs never get off the ground because I can’t get upgrades fast enough to survive the onslaught of enemies. Even with a strong build, success feels like it hangs on a knife’s edge. But that’s what makes the game gripping; when a run gets going, <em>Sektori</em> turns into something special as you zip across levels, blast away enemies, keep chasing upgrades, and, against the onslaught, keep surviving — all while colorful graphics and the driving techno soundtrack overload your senses.</p><p>I’ve only beaten the game a single time. But during that one magical run, I finally understood what <em>Sektori</em> is all about.</p><p><sup>Sektori<em> is out now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X / S.</em></sup></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/840324/sektori-review-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s]]></content:encoded>
