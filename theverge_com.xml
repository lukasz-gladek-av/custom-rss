Crystal Dynamics and Amazon Game Studios are releasing two <em>Tomb Raider</em> games back-to-back in 2026 and 2027. First up, coming in 2026 is <em>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</em>. Don’t let the fancy name fool you though, <em>Legacy of Atlantis</em> is the Unreal Engine 5 version of the first <em>Tomb Raider</em> game, a remake similar to <em>Tomb Raider Anniversary</em> which updated the 1997 original PlayStation game for the PS2.</p><p>But that’s not all. In 2027, the<em> Tomb Raider</em> team will release another game, <em>Tomb Raider Catalyst </em>which is an all new adventure that looks like it features an all new Lara. Real <em>Tomb Raider</em> heads know that Lara Croft was originally envisioned as Laura Cruz, a South American woman, before she was British-ed her up to what we know today. The woman in <em>Catalyst </em>looks like a Lara paying homage to her origins as a woman of color. We don’t know much about either game, but hey, I’ll never be mad that I’m getting <em>two</em> new <em>Tomb Raiders </em>to play.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/843260/tomb-raider-catalyst-trailer-tomb-raider-atlantis]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1381075</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Shortly after appeals court judges ruled against Apple’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/842991/apple-epic-appeal-loses-contempt">contempt appeal</a> in a years-long antitrust dispute against the makers of <em>Fortnite,</em> I got to talk to Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney in an interview. According to Sweeney, today’s ruling “completely shuts down” Apple’s App Store rules that allow it to collect “junk fees.”</p><p>The three-judge Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel largely affirmed an April ruling that Apple failed to comply with Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown">2021 order</a> allowing app developers to link to external payment options, which Sweeney said “... is really awesome for all developers.”</p><p>Perhaps the most notable part of the appeals court ruling is that the panel is asking Gonzalez Rogers to look at ways Apple could charge developers reasonable fees for purchases made in apps using outside payment links. In her <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">April ruling</a>, Gonzalez Rogers blocked Apple from taking <em>any</em> fees from external payments because of decisions like slapping external payments with a 27 percent fee and forcing developers to make their payments links in plain text.</p><p>But the appeals court says Apple “should” be able to charge a fee based on “the costs that are genuinely and reasonably necessary for its coordination of external links for linked-out purchases, but no more” and that Apple is “entitled to some compensation for the use of its intellectual property that is directly used in permitting Epic and others to consummate linked-out purchases.”</p><p>“If you want to have an app go through review with custom linkouts, maybe there’s several hundred dollars of fees associated with that every time you submit an app, which is perfectly reasonable because there are real people at Apple doing those things and Apple pays them, and we should be contributing to that,” Sweeney says. But he says that the ruling, “completely shuts down, I think, for all time, Apple’s theory that they should be able to charge arbitrary junk fees for access.”</p><p>With these two areas that Apple would be allowed to charge for, Sweeney says that “I can’t imagine any justification for a percentage of developer revenue being assessed here.”</p><p>Weeks after the April ruling, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661290/fortnite-ios-iphone-epic-games-back-apple-app-store"><em>Fortnite</em> returned to the US App Store</a> — nearly five years after Apple originally kicked it off when Epic introduced its own in-app purchase system to <em>Fortnite.</em> And there are efforts globally to require Apple to allow third-party app stores on iOS, like the Digital Markets Act in Europe, which is the reason you can get <em>Fortnite</em> from the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store">mobile Epic Games Store</a> in that region.</p><p>“So far, Apple has taken the strategy of collecting junk fees and every territory until they’re forced by law enforcers or regulators to stop,” Sweeney says. “I’m not sure if they’re going to continue that until they’ve lost every single battle around the entire world, or if they are at some point going to harmonize their global policies. I certainly hope that Apple would, at some point, just try to come to a soft landing and have a single worldwide policy that works for everybody.”</p><p>Sweeney expects that the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26372151-epic-v-apple-appeals-court-opinion/">Ninth Circuit’s opinion</a> will unblock “a lot” of regulatory efforts around the world. “Why on earth would any self-respecting country in the world allow Apple to charge fees that the United States court has found to be illegal in the United States?” he says.</p><p>The ruling wasn’t the only big news for Epic and <em>Fortnite</em> on mobile today: the game also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/842855/fortnite-android-google-play">returned to Google Play in the US</a> after similarly being <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368079/fortnite-epic-android-banned-google-play-app-store-rule-violation">booted by Google</a> when Epic added the in-app payments system to <em>Fortnite</em>. Epic and Google announced last month that they have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/813991/epic-google-proposed-settlement">agreed to settle their lawsuit</a>, and while the two sides are still seeking court approval for their settlement, it resolves their disputes worldwide.</p><p>“I’ve been very impressed with the new generation of the Android leadership,” Sweeney says. “They turned over a new leaf here.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/843265/apple-epic-games-tim-sweeney-interview]]></content:encoded>
