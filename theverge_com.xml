The original <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23050951/razer-co-founder-robert-krakoff-death-razerguy">Kärna Razer Boomslang</a> was best known for its encoding wheel that could more accurately track a mouse’s movements at 2,000 DPI. The new <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fproduct-news%2Frazer-boomslang-20th%2F" rel="sponsored">Razer Boomslang 20th Anniversary Edition</a> carries forward the original’s symmetrical ambidextrous design but upgrades its rolling ball with a 45,000 DPI optical sensor and other modern conveniences.</p><p>The <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Frazer-boomslang-20th-anniversary-edition" rel="sponsored">new Boomslang</a> is being released to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Razer being founded as a company — not just a brand — and while pricing and availability haven’t been announced yet, the mouse will be limited to just 1,337 units. This time around the Boomslang is completely wireless with an 8,000Hz polling rate for “near-instant responsiveness,” says Razer. It’s also rechargeable using an included dock featuring a matching translucent plastic shell.</p><p>The primary mouse buttons are now wrapped in synthetic leather for improved grip and use Razer’s Gen-4Crisp switches underneath that have a lifespan of 100 million clicks. The new Boomslang has eight buttons in total that can be reprogrammed using the Razer Synapse software, and as with most of the company’s products, the mouse also features 9-zone RGB lighting on the underside that can be customized or synced to over 300 different games.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/841494/razer-boomslang-20th-anniversary-edition-gaming-mouse-rechargeable-optical]]></content:encoded>
