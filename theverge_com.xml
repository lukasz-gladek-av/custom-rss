He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>GameStop’s online Nintendo Switch 2 preorders went live at 11AM ET, and like the preorders from other retailers overnight, things immediately got off to a rocky start. However, shortly after 11:30AM ET, it appears people started to be able to complete orders, including one <em>Verge</em> staffer.</p><p>Right as the clock rolled over to 11AM, many of us at <em>The Verge</em> experienced issues with the website. At first, GameStop’s website showed me a mostly-blank page – the only text on it was “Oops…Something went wrong” [sic] and a refresh button. Soon after, myself and other <em>Verge</em> staffers often saw Cloudflare notices on GameStop’s website instead, including error notices that said the “web server is down” or that the site is experiencing a “bad gateway.”</p><p>Occasionally, the online listing for the Switch 2 and <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle has loaded for me, but the preorder button would be grayed out. One colleague also got the console-only option listing to load, but with a “not available” button in place of a preorder one.</p><p>GameStop’s mobile app has also been showing error messages for me, including one that vaguely says “activity paused,” when I try to open it.</p><p>At 11:34AM ET, deals-hunter Wario64 posted that GameStop’s Switch 2 preorders <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1915429174073774270">were actually live</a>. A few <em>Verge</em> staffers were able to get a console in their cart, and one was actually able to make a purchase. Another, however, thought they had the console in their cart, but when their cart actually loaded, GameStop said it was out of stock.</p><p><em>Developing…</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Di Benedetto</a> <span>is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget. He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Razer is announcing two new mice, the Pro Click V2 and Pro Click V2 Vertical Edition — the latter being Razer’s first vertical mouse design. Both mice are more ergonomic and productivity-focused than the usual gaming-first designs Razer is known for, but the $99.99 Pro Click V2 and $119.99 Vertical Edition feature the brand’s typical all-black designs and bright RGB illumination.</p><p>Both Pro Click V2 mice feature programmable buttons, Razer Chroma compatibility, and Razer’s “AI Prompt Master” for quick access to prompting ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot. The standard model has a 30 degree tiled angle with contoured design for a natural resting position, rubberized side grips, an extended thumb rest, and a free-spinning tiltable scroll wheel for horizontal scrolling. The Vertical Edition goes for a more handshake-like grip with a 71.7 degree angle, big cutout to grip with your thumb, and an extended base that slightly elevates the wrist to reduce strain.</p><p>The new V2 versions replace the original <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fmena-en%2Fproductivity%2Frazer-pro-click" rel="sponsored">Pro Click</a> that Razer designed with ergonomic office furniture company Humanscale. That model definitely looked the part of an office productivity tool with its white and gray design. The V2s go harder on the typical Razer gamer aesthetic while still trying to compete with popular ergonomic mice like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23142689/logitech-mx-master-3s-mouse-review">Logitech MX Master</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/favorites/623848/my-favorite-things-logitechs-mx-vertical-wireless-mouse">MX Vertical</a>.</p><p>Razer begins selling both Pro Click V2 mice <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fproductivity" rel="sponsored">directly from its online</a> and brick-and-mortar stores today, and the Vertical Edition will also be carried by authorized resellers.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The streaming platform has shared some of its viewership stats from last year with <em>GTA V</em> capturing over 1 billion hours watched.</p><p>Here’s an infographic breaking some of the stats down:</p><p>Twitch also revealed insights into viewer habits and tastes including who people like to watch in addition to what. In 2024, the most watched streamer list was dominated by the usual suspects: xQc, Kai Cenat, Pokimane, and HasanAbi to name a few. But V-Tubers, streamers who use an animated persona as their avatar instead of their real face, saw a 10 percent increase in viewership over last year with viewers watching over a billion hours of V-Tuber streams. </p><p>Rockstar’s foundational action game wasn’t last year’s only big winner as <em>League of Legends</em> also racked up over 1 billion hours watched. Competitive shooters rounded out the top of the most popular games watched list. The top three games in that category were <em>Call of Duty</em> with 451 million hours watched, <em>Fortnite</em> with over 500 million hours watched, and <em>Valorant</em> topping the competition with 804 million hours watched.</p><p>But those numbers, while impressive, fall short of <em>GTA V</em>’s staggering 1.4 billion hours watched — a solid indication that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23987993/gta-6-news-trailers-rockstar-games">the inevitable launch of <em>GTA VI</em> later this year</a> will be, simply put, friggin’ huge.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
