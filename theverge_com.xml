That includes the interactive Hello, Mario! app featuring an interactive 3D version of Mario’s head that reacts to being poked, tugged, and flung around the screen. The app will be available as a free download for the Switch, Switch 2, and iOS and Android devices starting on February 19th, 2026.</p><p>The My Mario physical products coming to the US include apparel for infants and toddlers; a board book that, like the mobile app, lets kids interact with Mario’s face; plush versions of Mario and items from the games; and a collection of bath and water toys. There’s not a lot that will appeal to adults that aren’t devoted Nintendo collectors, although there are two block sets featuring colorful wooden versions of Super Mario characters that include Amiibo functionality that could be hard to resist.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>Nintendo’s wooden block sets may appeal both to kids and grownup Super Mario fans.</em></figcaption> <cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></span></p></section><p>The My Mario collection will be available through Nintendo’s New York and San Francisco stores on February 19th, but the company says the products “will also begin arriving at select retail stores nationwide this spring and will continue to expand throughout the year.” Ideally that will also include Nintendo’s online store for those who can’t find a retail location carrying them.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/858587/nintendo-my-mario-apparal-toys-book-mobile-app]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[The most popular games are getting harder and harder to usurp]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s harder than ever for a new video game to crack the top of the most-played list. According to the Circana Player Engagement Tracker and video game market analyst Mat Piscatella, in 2025, the top five most-played games on PS5 and Xbox… <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mbraw2dcfc2s">were the same in 2024</a>. And they likely won’t be changing anytime soon.</p><p>Any gaming enthusiast could probably easily name the top five: <em>Fortnite, Roblox, Call of Duty, Minecraft, and Grand Theft Auto V</em>. These aren’t just the most-played games of ’24 and ’25, but have hovered at or around the top of the most-played list for several years now. Though they vary wildly in genre and gameplay, they have a handful of shared characteristics that inform some of their success. All of them are established games, around for eight years or more. They all are multiplatform and have multiplayer capabilities, numerous gameplay modes, and are constantly updated with new content. With the exception of<em> Call of Duty</em>, all the games extensively feature user-generated content while <em>Fortnite </em>and<em> Roblox </em>are free to play.</p><p>Eager to replicate the financial success of the top five and using those shared characteristics as a guideline, studios and publishers have spent years trying to build their own live-service hits. <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, <em>Valorant,</em> and the <em>Destiny 2</em> expansions enjoyed decent success, inspiring even more studios to make yet more live-service games. Square Enix, a developer not known for premium multiplayer experiences (<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-critically-acclaimed-mmorpg">with one well-memed exception</a>), released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23736525/this-sure-looks-like-splatoon"><em>Foamstars</em></a>. Rocksteady and BioWare, studios celebrated for their single-player narrative games, announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826586/suicide-squad-video-game-gameplay-trailer-the-game-awards"><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/5/17536926/bioware-anthem-gameplay-trailer-ps4-xbox-pc"><em>Anthem</em></a>. In 2022, Sony announced that it was working to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22914016/sony-playstation-live-service-games-launch-march-2026">launch 10 live-service games before March 2026</a>. But a year later, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23953640/sony-pushes-back-its-live-service-game-ambitions">Sony scaled back those plans</a> — nearly every studio did.</p><div><p>Numerous games launched then failed for lack of quality or players. Square Enix announced that it would <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/foamstars-final-seasonal-update-party-goes-on-confirms-the-party-is-very-much-over">cease updates for <em>Foamstars</em></a> less than a year post-launch<em>. </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317407/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-final-season-offline-mode"><em>Kill the Justice League</em> also didn’t make it to a year</a> when Rocksteady released its final content update. <em>Anthem</em> will be a few weeks shy of its seventh anniversary <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/698360/the-end-of-an-anthem">when it shuts down on January 12th</a>, and after spending eight years in development, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234909/sony-concord-ps5-shutdown-poor-sales-launch-pc"><em>Concord</em> was taken down in weeks</a>. Developers learned too late that the characteristics that make the power five so successful are stopping other games from reaching the top.</p></div><p>The newest game of the bunch, <em>Fortnite</em>, has been around since 2017. It’s hard to ask a player that’s racked up eight years worth of Victory Royales, currency, battle pass progression, and skins to start over somewhere new. People also want to play games with their friends. If everyone you know is playing <em>Call of Duty</em>, guess what you’re gonna play? Meanwhile, as prices increase both <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/782532/game-console-price-hikes-xbox-ps5-switch">in gaming</a> and globally, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-physical-software-and-hardware-sales-just-had-the-worst-november-in-the-us-since-1995">players are buying fewer new titles or consoles</a>. Why spend money on a premium title like <em>Concord </em>and the fancy, expensive PS5 needed to play it, when <em>Fortnite </em>and<em> Roblox </em>are free and work on hardware you already have. It’s similar on PC. While the top of the Steam charts fluctuate more often than PlayStation or Xbox, new live-service games there are always competing against the usual PC suspects — <em>PUBG</em>, <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, and <em>Dota 2</em>.</p><p>But for all the carnage of games released to little fanfare or killed before they could even launch, it’s not impossible for new live-service games to find success — just not at the same scale as a <em>Fortnite</em> or <em>GTA</em>. Games like <em>Helldivers 2, Marvel Rivals,</em> and (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-review">for better</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/827650/indie-developers-gen-ai-nexon-arc-raiders">or worse</a><em>) Arc Raiders </em>have been able to punch through the seeming inexhaustible noise of the top five, topping player-count charts not only on Xbox and PS5 but PC as well. Gaming in 2025 was also defined by games like <em>Ghost of Yotei, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hades II,</em> and <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, possibly signaling that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24325371/2024s-best-games-classic-genres-astro-bot-balatro-metaphor">developing single-player narrative experiences might be a safer bet</a>. These five games aren’t going anywhere and will likely top the charts again, but in 2026, they’ll definitely have to make room for at least one new addition: <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> — that is if it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660057/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026">isn’t</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/816005/grand-theft-auto-vi-gta-g-delayed-november-2026">delayed</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/858127/top-five-most-played-games-xbox-ps5-2025]]></content:encoded>
