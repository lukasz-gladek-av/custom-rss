            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24312434/best-roguelikes-2024-balatro-hades-2-prince-of-persia<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The roguelike genre has turned from a relative niche into something much bigger. Roguelike games can be famously tough to crack into; generally, they have a high difficulty that means you’ll bang your head against a wall as you learn how to play the game, puzzle out what strategies work best in the procedurally generated levels, and figure out how to overcome tough enemies or challenges. 2024 showed that the genre wasn’t only a commercial force through hits like <em>Hades II</em> and <em>Balatro</em>, and also that a roguelike could be almost anything: from a poker variant to a flashy multiplayer action game.</p><p>Speaking of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame"><em>Balatro</em></a>, it was undoubtedly one of, if not <em>the</em>, best games of the year. The game is supremely easy to pick up because of its roots in building traditional poker hands, but each round feels wildly different because of the clever and sometimes superpowered joker cards that can give you massive bonuses. The game is a perfect mix of skill, risk, and a little bit of luck, and it feels so good when you find a strategy that completely stacks the chips in your favor. I think I’ll be playing <em>Balatro</em> for years to come, especially with whatever’s cooking for the game’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215342/balatro-free-major-gameplay-update-2025">upcoming major update</a>. And now that the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24256010/how-to-play-balatro-mobile-localthunk-playstack">is out on mobile</a>, I can play wherever I want.</p><p>That is, when I’m not dipping my toes back into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152085/hades-2-steam-deck-performance"><em>Hades II</em></a>. The game, which is still in early access, is shaping up to be a worthy successor to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159911/hades-best-game-2020-nintendo-switch-supergiant-pc"><em>Hades</em></a>, and it’s arguably more fully fleshed out than many finished titles. I’ve already put more than 30 hours into <em>Hades II, </em>and I feel like I still have so much to unlock and master, but I’ve intentionally held myself back from playing more so that I don’t burn out on the game before it reaches v1.0. I only beat the new boss in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271897/hades-ii-2-major-update-olympic">most recent major update</a> a single time before deciding that was enough.</p><p>There are a couple other roguelikes that I have loved and want to put more time into but haven’t because of the sheer volume of other games in the genre to check out. <em>Shogun Showdown</em>, which is all about tactics and positioning, makes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/15/24243908/shogun-showdown-review">you feel like a genius by showing you the future</a>. I really enjoyed getting a handle on the game’s weapons and items so that I could pull off well-planned combos against waves of enemies.</p><p><em>Windblown</em>, the new roguelike from <em>Dead Cells</em> creators Motion Twin, takes a lot of what makes <em>Dead Cells</em> great and translates it to 3D. Weapons are varied, satisfying, and can combo well with each other. The game’s biomes are creative and fun to explore, with lots of nooks and crannies. But where <em>Windblown</em> really shines is its multiplayer — until playing the game, I had no idea <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/2/24284956/windblown-roguelikes-friends-multiplayer">how good roguelikes could be with friends</a>. Like <em>Hades</em>, <em>Windblown</em> is also in early access, so I’m expecting to play it a lot more next year as Motion Twin makes major updates.</p><p>And those are just the new roguelikes I’ve actually been able to put time into this year. There are still a bunch more that I want to play or have barely touched that seem extremely promising. <em>Vampire Survivors</em> got <em>two</em> major crossover DLCs that I want to dig into: one with <em>Contra</em> and one with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275710/vampire-survivors-ode-to-castlevania-dlc-konami-collaboration-expansion"><em>Castlevania</em></a>. (I’ve only played a couple rounds of the <em>Castlevania</em> expansion, and I was tickled at just how large the map was.) And while I’m talking about <em>Vampire Survivors</em>: <em>Halls of Torment</em>, which is kind of like <em>Vampire Survivors</em> mixed with an old-school <em>Diablo</em> aesthetic, left early access, and I want to check out what’s changed since I first dabbled in it last year.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172102/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-steam-early-access-impression"><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em></a>, a roguelike take on classic <em>Prince of Persia</em> action and platforming, is an example of how big publishers like Ubisoft are jumping into the genre — and it seems like something that’s right up my alley. <em>Rogue</em> is another early access roguelike on this list, but it’s gotten a bunch of big updates since its May launch, including a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296619/the-prince-wont-be-purple">significant update in November</a> that revamped the art style and added new biomes, bosses, and more. I should also mention that <em>Rogue</em> <em>also</em> has a <em>Dead Cells</em> connection: it’s made by Evil Empire, the studio that worked on many <em>Dead Cells</em> updates and DLCs, which gives me a lot of faith that they’ll do a great job shepherding the game to its eventual full launch.&nbsp;</p><p>Heck, 2024 has been such a banner year for roguelikes that even the 2014 classic <em>The</em> <em>Binding of Isaac: Rebirth</em> got a significant new DLC update that <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F250900%2Fview%2F7119722540407193807">added online multiplayer</a>.</p><p>The sheer amount of great roguelikes <em>just this year</em> shows that the framework of the genre offers a lot of ways to make interesting games. I particularly appreciate how they’re generally more digestible than blockbuster epics. Next year has some promising roguelikes like <em>Slay the Spire 2</em> and <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>, but I know I’ll be returning to a lot of 2024’s excellent roguelikes over and over again — well, after just one more round of <em>Balatro</em>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/24/24328374/metaphor-refantanzio-battle-music-shoji-meguro-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona"><em>Metaphor: ReFantanzio</em></a> is one of 2024’s best games racking up a stack of Game Awards including best RPG, best art direction, and best narrative. But one category in which Metaphor particularly stood out was its music. The soundtrack, produced by Shoji Meguro – the long-time music director of the <em>Persona</em> series, is one of the outstanding achievements in video game music this year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/18/24299700/flute-guy-japanese-monk-chant-guy-musical-nirvana">particularly its battle theme</a> which became a viral hit. In an interview with <em>The Verge</em>, Meguro talked about his work on the <em>Metaphor</em> soundtrack including what went into what is perhaps the coolest piece of video game battle music ever made.&nbsp;</p><p>Meguro, known for his work <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/23/15387602/persona-5-soundtrack-music">producing the pop-y, jazzy vibes of the <em>Persona</em> soundtracks</a>, acknowledged that <em>Metaphor</em>’s heavy orchestral / choral sound is not something <em>Persona</em> fans would expect from him and definitely outside his own wheelhouse. He said in order to effectively change gears from <em>Persona</em> to <em>Metaphor</em>, he had to relearn classical music theory.</p><p>“But that’s what makes creating this score so exciting,” he said. “When I was first told about <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, I was told it would be an epic, high-fantasy RPG. And immediately I heard the sound of great orchestras playing and thought this might be an opportunity to write songs I’ve never really written before, which excited me greatly.”</p><p>In developing the music for <em>Metaphor</em>, Meguro said that he wanted to evoke a classical, fantasy experience but feature a unique twist that he said fans have come to expect from Atlus games. That twist became what Meguro called a “spiritual musical style” that defines the soundtrack, particularly the battle music.</p><p><small>As it was nominated for Game of the Year, <em>Metaphor</em>’s music made an appearance during this year’s Game Awards.</small></p><p>If you’ve spent any amount of time on gaming social media this year, you’ve probably seen tons of posts talking about <em>Metaphor</em>’s battle music. For a battle theme it goes extremely <em>hard, </em>with one version starting off with an orchestra-backed choir singing with the kind of gusto you’d expect for a meeting with Sephiroth, not something that plays during every minor encounter in the game. Then, somehow, the song goes even harder with the addition of a Japanese monk chanting in a rapid-fire cadence that could go toe-to-toe with Eminem. To further elevate the songs, the chants were written in an original language inspired by Esperanto, a language that was invented in 1887 and designed to be used as an internationally universal secondary language.&nbsp;</p><p>But finding the right voice for the job wasn’t easy. “I was looking for a specific type of voice that could sustain a fast rhythm while reading Esperanto-inspired scripture,” Meguro said.&nbsp;</p><p>His search led him to YouTube, where scrolling through performances was how he found a monk named Keisuke Honryo performing in Nam Jazz Experiment, a musical group that combines jazz with the recitation of traditional Buddhist sutras. “It was so great, I immediately made [Honryo] an offer and luckily he accepted and was happy to be a part of this game.”</p><div><figcaption>Your fairy sidekick in Metaphor is also your DJ throughout the game.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Atlus</cite></p></div><p>But there’s a reason why <em>Metaphor</em>’s battle music is so arresting and it’s not just because of the musical stylings of a Japanese monk chanting in an invented language inspired by another invented language. Meguro had to reframe his thinking in developing the soundtrack, leading to the creation of something truly unique that changes how players perceive the game.</p><p>“I’ve always considered game scores to be similar to UI elements, constructs that exist solely to service the player,” Meguro said. “Although the score has to capture the atmosphere of the story for the user, it’s worth reminding ourselves that this music is not actually playing directly within the world the characters are in.”</p><p>Meguro explained that in conversations with the game’s director Katsura Hashino, the two discussed ways to connect what players are hearing to what the characters are hearing as well.</p><p>He said the thought experiment allowed them to “approach the music composition through a different lens.” The idea wound up implemented in the game itself. In <em>Metaphor’</em>s opening hours, the player’s sidekick casts a spell that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/opinion/465517/metaphor-refantazio-music-gallica-spell-in-your-head">allows them to hear music</a> as they roam about the world and, inevitably, get into fights.</p><p>That moment dramatically changes the context of all of <em>Metaphor’</em>s music, especially its battle themes. Taking those songs from fun bits of ambience for solely players and turning them into something the characters experience too, explains why the songs go hard as they do. Every fight for us is one more event on the way to the credits, for the characters it’s <em>life or death</em> and it makes sense that the music they hear as they fight for their lives, reflects that gravity.&nbsp;</p><p>Meguro used <em>Metaphor</em>’s music to bring the players further into the game and he’s delighted by how well his work has been received. The two battle songs, called “<a href="https://youtu.be/v9foF43GJkk?si=jHsnbSSVCH2L8pt0">Warriors in Arms</a>” and “<a href="https://youtu.be/SjIJfwaFSAE?si=-64NgypXU_jMa_ZP">Warriors in Valor</a>” instantly resonated with players, <a href="https://x.com/TheBlackViking3/status/1842293436268916867">inspiring memes</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/kkGi_1ogQsQ?si=pYxaDS3qinSun-DW">even animated shorts</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>“That brings me so much joy that fans are responding enthusiastically to the music of <em>Metaphor</em>,” Meguro said. “It’s an honor to get that kind of reaction.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
