But it’s also the technology that AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta are using to power the servers in their massive data centers. Now, the world’s biggest memory makers — Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron — are taking advantage of a surge in demand, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837594/crucial-ram-ssd-micron-ai">shifting their resources away</a> from consumer-focused products and toward more lucrative deals with AI companies.</p><p>The result is a severe shortage in RAM for consumer products, which is not only contributing to price hikes on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/828337/ram-memory-shortage-crunch-market-prices-central-micro-center">RAM kits used by PC builders</a> but also for the manufacturers of a range of devices, including laptops, smartphones, gaming consoles, and a whole lot more. Some companies, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/836221/raspberry-pi-price-increases-ram-costs">like Raspberry Pi</a>, have already raised the prices of their products as a result of the increase, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/831032/cyberpowerpc-maingear-ram-price-increases-pc-gaming">while others anticipate</a> price hikes coming soon.</p><p>Here’s all the latest news on the rising price of RAM.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODM5NTA2" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/839506/ram-shortage-price-increases-pc-gaming-smartphones">RAM is ruining everything</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty Images</cite></p></div><div><p>Memory suppliers just blew a hole in the PC gaming industry – and they’re about to do the same to everything else. For weeks, PC enthusiasts have borne the brunt of skyrocketing memory prices, but the shockwaves will soon impact a wider range of products as suppliers pour resources into a far bigger and more lucrative endeavor: AI.</p><p>The biggest names in the AI industry are buying up DRAM memory for their sprawling data centers, and memory makers are prioritizing their demands over everyone else’s. DRAM is embedded “in every part of our digital society today,” Jeff Janukowicz, research VP at IDC, tells <em>The Verge</em>. That’s everything from laptops to smartphones, gaming consoles, smart TVs, cars, and even small amounts in solid-state drives (SSDs). “There’s a lot at stake,” he says.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/839506/ram-shortage-price-increases-pc-gaming-smartphones">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Samsung memory is nearly as big as Samsung Galaxy.</p><p>I knew Samsung made lots of money making chips, not just electronics.

The updates are being applied immediately and affect Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry Pi 5, with prices increasing by $5 to $25 depending on the model and amount of RAM. The 16GB memory variants of the Compute Module 5 are also being raised by $20, now starting at $140.</p><p>“The current pressure on memory prices, driven by competition from the AI infrastructure roll-out, is painful but ultimately temporary,” Raspberry Pi CEO <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/1gb-raspberry-pi-5-now-available-at-45-and-memory-driven-price-rises/">Eben Upton said in the announcement</a>. “We remain committed to driving down the cost of computing and look forward to unwinding these price increases once it abates.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/836221/raspberry-pi-price-increases-ram-costs">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODMxMDMy" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/831032/cyberpowerpc-maingear-ram-price-increases-pc-gaming">These prebuilt PCs are about to cost more due to rising RAM prices</a></h2><div><p><cite>Photo by Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images</cite></p></div><div><p>The skyrocketing price of RAM is trickling down to custom PC makers, including CyberPowerPC and Maingear.
