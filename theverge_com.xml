He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>More than three years after revealing “pre-pre-pre-alpha” footage of its new <em>Skate</em> title, EA has finally announced that the free-to-play live service game will be launching for everyone in early access on September 16th.</p><p>The game takes place in the city of “San Vansterdam,” where you can cruise around to find places to pull off tricks, take on challenges, or just hang out with your friends. <em>Skate</em> uses a rebuilt version of the “Flick-It” control system from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyUcmzOr_mA">the original <em>Skate</em> games</a>, so if you’re familiar with the older titles, you should be able to jump right into the new version. And EA has built in a lot of social features into the new <em>Skate</em>, including the ability to drop things like ramps and rails right into the world that you and the other skaters nearby can use. Up to 150 skaters can be in a server at a time.</p><p>You’ll be able to buy in-game cosmetics for your custom skater from the in-game shop, though they’re optional and don’t provide any gameplay benefit. Like other free-to-play live service games, <em>Skate</em> will have seasonal content and its version of a battle pass with free and paid rewards.</p><p>The new <em>Skate</em> will be available on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, and PC, and it will support crossplay and cross-progression. A mobile version for iOS and Android is in development as well.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/761186/ea-skate-free-to-play-early-access-release-date#comments">4<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/761186/ea-skate-free-to-play-early-access-release-date]]></content:encoded>
