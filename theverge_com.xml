            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/688242/blue-prince-mac-support-steam-soundtrack<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Blue Prince</em>, the architectural mystery puzzle roguelite, is coming to a Mac near you. In a press release from the game’s publisher Raw Fury, it was announced that <em>Blue Prince</em> is getting an update that will add Mac support (via Steam) coming “later this year.” </p><div><p><em>Blue Prince</em> released earlier this year and quickly became an early GOTY candidate with folks (i.e. me) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/647451/blue-prince-review-architectural-roguelike-balatro">drawing comparisons to the runaway hit <em>Balatro</em></a>. The game is kinda like <em>Brewster’s Millions</em> with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/672746/blue-prince-more-major-update-1-10-patch">heaping helping of intricate puzzles to solve</a> and roguelite mechanics to keep you on your toes. </p></div><p>In it, your recently deceased uncle has given you the keys to his beloved Mt. Holly manor and has stipulated in his will that the house will be yours if you can find the secret 46th room. The manor is mysterious and its layout shifts and changes every night. Build rooms and solve puzzles to get closer to discovering that 46th room while solving other, deeper mysteries along the way. It’s a great game, and definitely well-suited to play sessions on a Macbook Air.</p><p>In addition to the new platform – which joins PC, PS5, and the Xbox Series X / S – starting today the game’s subtle but vibey soundtrack will be available for purchase on Steam. You can buy it either standalone for $10 or, if you don’t already own the game, it’s being bundled with the soundtrack for $36.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
