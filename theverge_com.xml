            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314133/pc-gaming-show-2024-best-trailers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Before we all settle in for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/18/24299681/and-the-nominees-are">The Game Awards next week</a>, this year’s PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted had its own assortment of interesting reveals and excellent trailers. It was an indie-focused showcase, which means that there was quite a bit of inventiveness on display; everything from a unique take on TMNT to a platformer where you jump around computer windows. If you missed the show live — which also included some news updates, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313965/pubg-brendan-playerunknown-greene-new-games-krafton">like PlayerUnknown’s ambitious plans for the future</a> — here’s a curated list of some of the best stuff that was on display.</p><p><h3><em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em></h3></p><p>The original <em>Moonlighter</em> mixed action RPG gameplay with the mundanity of running a shop, and the sequel looks like much of the same: only this time, players are transported to another dimension they need to escape. <em>The Endless Vault</em> launches in 2025 on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.</p><p><h3><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em></h3></p><p>One of the biggest surprises was<em> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em>, from indie studio Strange Scaffold. It’s billed as a turn-based take on the turtles, which is billed as an experience designed in part for “quick-play sessions that feel meaningful.” It takes place in a timeline without icons Shredder and Splinter. Given the studio’s history — see <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3011440%2FCLICKOLDING%2F"><em>Clickolding</em></a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1246250%2FAn_Airport_for_Aliens_Currently_Run_by_Dogs%2F%3Fcurator_clanid%3D41064705"><em>An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs</em></a> — it will hopefully also be weird in a good way. <em>Tactical Takedown </em>launches on PC in 2025.</p><p><h3><em>Cairn</em></h3></p><div><p>This rock-climbing adventure / survival game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24171651/day-of-the-devs-showcase-summer-game-fest-2024-best">has been looking good for a while now</a>, and you can finally check it out for yourself: <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1588550%2FCairn%2F"><em>Cairn</em> just got a free demo on Steam</a>.</p></div><p><h3><em>Sol Mates</em></h3></p><p>There can never be enough co-op games. This release from Daruma Games supports local and online co-op for up to four players, who are tasked with surviving in the great expanse of space by doing “odd jobs through the galaxy.” It’s also pretty darn cute. <em>Sol Mates</em> launches in early access next year.</p><p><h3><em>The Legend of Baboo</em></h3></p><p>Billed as a “heartfelt nod to Middle Eastern fables,” this game looks like a potentially great mix of adventure, action, and puzzle solving, with a great big fluffy dog to ride on. In fact, you play as both the boy and the dog, who form a bond over the course of the game. Let’s hope it has a happier ending than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/5/13837896/the-last-guardian-review-ps4"><em>The Last Guardian</em></a>. <em>The Legend of Baboo</em> is launching in 2025 on both PC and Xbox.</p><p><h3><em>Abyssus</em></h3></p><p>Thanks to this game, I’ve learned of a fictional genre called “brinepunk,” where tech is powered by sea brine. It sounds weird, but this co-op shooter does take place in the fascinating underwater ruins of a long-gone civilization. Developer DoubleMoose says <em>Abyssus</em> will go into alpha on December 6th, with a full release next year.</p><p><h3><em>MainFrames</em></h3></p><p>All you really need to know is that this is a platformer where you’re jumping across a desktop PC interface, rearranging icons to solve puzzles, and fighting bosses controlled by the OS. It launches on both PC and the Nintendo Switch on March 6th.</p><p><h3><em>Deepest Fear</em></h3></p><p>Developed by Variable State, the indie studio behind games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2016/9/22/13001942/virginia-game-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"><em>Virginia</em></a> and <em>Last Stop</em>, <em>Deepest Fear</em> is an immersive sci-fi horror title with distinct shades of <em>Alien</em> and <em>The Thing</em>. The developers say that it “combines Metroidvania level design in the context of a classic FPS immersive sim, where the game’s setting is a puzzle to unravel and where creativity and improvisation are your greatest assets.” There’s no release date yet, but <em>Deepest Fear</em> will (obviously) be launching on PC whenever it’s ready.</p><p><h3><em>Blue Prince</em></h3></p><p>It looks a bit like a more colorful take on <em>Myst</em>, and <em>Blue Prince</em> is described as a game that “combines compelling mystery, strategy, and puzzle elements to create an unpredictable journey through Mt. Holly, a peculiar manor with ever-changing rooms.” It doesn’t have a release date yet, but according to the new trailer, it’s due out next spring.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
