            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/651921/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d-bundle-microcenter-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Building (or rebuilding) a gaming PC can be difficult. It’s complex stuff, making sure everything’s compatible and whatnot. The next toughest part is finding a deal — and having the patience to wait for price drops without getting so antsy you buy everything at full price (shamefully raises hand). If you’re considering an AMD build, Micro Center has a great deal on a hardware bundle that includes the Ryzen 7 7800X3D (last-gen, but still among <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/5/23668320/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d-review-cpu-processor-benchmark-test">the mightiest CPUs around for gaming</a>, according to our review), a motherboard, and RAM. Normally around $579.99, you can snag the bundle in-store only for <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/5006986/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d,-asus-b650-e-tuf-gaming,-gskill-flare-x5-series-32gb-ddr5-6000-kit,-computer-build-bundle">$499.99</a> if you have a Micro Center nearby.</p><p>In addition to the 7800X3D processor ($389.99 by itself), which was only recently supplanted by the higher-end <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24288948/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-review-cpu-processor-benchmark-test">9800X3D processor</a>, you’ll get an Asus TUF B650-E motherboard (valued at $194.99), plus 32GB of G.Skill Flare X5 DDR5-6,000MHz RAM (valued at $89.99). You’ll save $175 instead of paying $675 for all three components, giving you more pocket change for a GPU.</p><p>The 7800X3D utilizes the AM5 motherboard socket, used on the newer 9000-series processors. It seems likely that AMD will stick with AM5 in the near future, so you’ll have at least a couple of CPU generations to pick from should you ever need to upgrade. As for the motherboard, it has three M.2 slots (one of which is PCIe 5.0, while the others are PCIe 4.0), support for USB-C ports on the front and back of your case, and Wi-Fi 6E built-in, among other niceties. If you’d prefer to have Corsair Vengeance RAM instead of what’s included with this bundle, you can elect to pay a $15 price increase when you pick up the bundle in-store.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The company originally planned to have them start on April 9th, but it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">delayed preorders</a> “in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.”</p><p>As part of this morning’s announcement, Nintendo said that the Switch 2’s starting price would remain $449.99, and the bundle that includes <em>Mario Kart World</em> would also stay at $499.99. But accessories got price bumps, including $5 increases for the Switch 2 Joy-Con and Pro Controller.</p><p>Prices could also change down the line; Nintendo said today that “other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future depending on market conditions.”</p><p>We’ve contacted Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop, and Walmart to ask when their Switch 2 preorders may start.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
