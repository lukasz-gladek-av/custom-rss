The studio announced “<a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-high-difficulty-expedition-mode-deep-of-night-has-appeared">Deep of Night</a>,” a new mode for <em>Nightreign</em> that is focused specifically on difficulty. Namely, it sounds like it’ll make things much harder.</p><p>From describes it as “a high-difficulty challenge mode designed for seasoned players who have navigated through the Night many times.” There aren’t a lot of firm details right now, but the mode will include stronger enemies, weapons with “detrimental effects,” and a difficulty level that “increases the deeper you descend.” It sounds like there are five layers to work your way through, and if you make it through the first three, you’ll be treated to “an endless battle for those seeking even greater thrills.”</p><p>Sounds like just the thing for <em>Nightreign</em> sickos (complimentary) and it’s also launching pretty soon: “Deep of Night” will be available on September 11th.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/767490/elden-ring-nightreign-expansion-deep-of-night#comments">0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/767490/elden-ring-nightreign-expansion-deep-of-night]]></content:encoded>

He joined in 2018, and after a stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you’re considering a gaming laptop, but you understandably don’t want to spend anywhere near $2,000, <strong>MSI’s Katana gaming laptop</strong> with the midrange RTX 5070 GPU is $1,099 (was $1,499.99) at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMSI-Katana-15-6-inch-QHD-165Hz-Gaming-Laptop-Intel-I7-14650HX-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-5070-16GB-DDR5-1TB-SSD-Black-2025%2F16625005777" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>. This machine has a lot to offer aside from a solid graphics chip for gaming. It includes a 15.6-inch QHD screen with a 165Hz refresh rate, an Intel Core i7-14650HX processor, 16GB of DDR5 RAM (upgradeable, in case you want to add more later on), and a 1TB SSD.</p><p>Most gaming laptops at this price include Nvidia’s less capable RTX 5060, along with an inferior processor. The RTX 5070 (with 8GB of video memory) should let you play most games at the screen’s native QHD resolution with ray tracing settings enabled. But, if games that you’re playing aren’t running as well as you’d like them to, many titles feature the option to turn on DLSS, Nvidia’s AI-powered feature that can greatly boost performance by upscaling lower-res graphics. That, or knock the game resolution down to 1080p instead of 1440p.</p><p>Lastly, as part of Intel’s Game Days, you’ll get a free copy of <em>Battlefield 6</em> with purchase of this laptop. Instructions for redeeming the game (which launches October 10th) are shown in the image gallery on Walmart’s product page. You’ll need to provide proof of purchase to Intel by September 30th, then redeem the code by Halloween.</p><div><p id="other-verge-approved-deals"><h2>Other Verge-approved deals</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>If you’re a fan of <em>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney</em>, or perhaps you’ve heard how great the games are but have yet to try them, here’s a chance to get some of them for cheap. <strong><a rel="sponsored" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/482924/2091208/25796?u=http%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fduo-justice-ace-attorney-and-mega-man">The latest Humble bundle</a></strong> features several tiers, each of which include a smattering of Ace Attorney and Mega Man games. They games are redeemable on Steam, and play well on the Steam Deck, among other Windows and SteamOS gaming handhelds. If you click “5 Item Bundle” that costs $5, you can get the original <em>Ace Attorney Trilogy</em>, full of games that originally launched in the US on the Nintendo DS. This bundle also includes <em>Mega Max X Legacy Collection</em> and <em>Mega Man Legacy Collection</em>.</span></li><li><span><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/http://costco.com/sony-wh1000xm5sa-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-headphones---black-with-soft-case.product.4000374020.html" rel="sponsored">Costco</a> members in the US can get a special discount on Sony’s last-gen (but still great) <strong>WH-1000XM5 over-ear, noise-canceling headphones</strong> in black. Through September 7th, you can snag them for $249.99 (originally $399.99), which beats Amazon’s current $298 price. This price is the lowest we’ve seen, beating the previous low of $278 last December. This model is an improvement in a number of ways over its predecessor, the XM4, with a refined design, better sound quality (call quality is better, too), and enhanced active noise cancellation. If you’re deciding between this and the newer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/667017/sony-wh-1000xm6-hands-on">$449 XM6</a>, perhaps you ought to give the XM5 a try and potentially put that extra $200 back in your pocket. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23067645/sony-wh-1000xm5-noise-canceling-headphones-review">Read our review</a>.</span></li><li><span>If an affordable 55-inch OLED TV is what you’re after, retailer <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buydig.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FPNTV55Z85AP%2FPanasonic-Z85-Series-55-inch-OLED-4K-Ultra-HD-Smart-Fire-TV-2024" rel="sponsored">BuyDig</a> has one. <strong>Panasonic’s 55-inch Z85 OLED</strong>, which we’ve previously featured in our coverage at $897, is down to just $699. This model includes Amazon’s Fire TV operating system, meaning that no extra device is necessary to begin streaming content from your favorite services. What also makes this a fantastic deal is that this purchase includes Panasonic’s wearable neck speaker (a $178 value) that can be connected to the TV for private listening. This TV likely isn’t as bright as pricier competitors, but it has some good specs, including a 120Hz refresh rate panel with four HDMI 2.1 ports, variable refresh rate, and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/767400/msi-gaming-laptop-rtx-5070-sony-xm5-oled-deal-sale#comments">0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/767400/msi-gaming-laptop-rtx-5070-sony-xm5-oled-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/my-gaming-buddy.1282947/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One of the most devastating parts of grief is how it can strike out of nowhere. There you are, doing a perfectly normal, everyday thing, and then that perfectly normal, everyday thing reminds you of something or someone who is no longer there. And when that presence you lost was intimately connected with your life, well, those moments happen frequently and unexpectedly.</p><p>I recently had to say goodbye to an old friend named Millie, an 18-year-old shih tzu who was a constant and steady companion for nearly my entire adult life. In an attempt to get my mind off the sadness, I decided to take a little dip into the familiar with <em>Animal Crossing</em>, a peaceful place full of simple chores that usually helps get my head right. But as I sat on the couch watching the shadows of fish dart around virtual waters, something was missing: the warm presence on my lap that I had taken for granted the last two decades.</p><p>My gaming habits are primarily solitary. When I get time to actually play something, I usually try to lose myself for a few hours in a big world, something like a <em>Zelda</em>, <em>Persona</em>, or <em>Death Stranding</em>. This typically happens in the quiet evenings when everyone else is asleep, and I’m far removed from the screams of a <em>Mario Kart</em> bout or the inane chatter of a <em>Fortnite</em> lobby. But as I realized during that <em>Animal Crossing</em> session, I was almost never <em>really</em> alone playing these games.</p><p>She may have had an adorable little face, but Millie didn’t like most people. She carried herself like a bulldog, chest puffed out to intimidate, and was a grouch even from a young age. The sound of children laughing would make her grumble, and she hated when any unknown person came into our house, which always made it fun when repairs had to be done. Few people got to see the dog I did, a fiercely protective little thing who knew who she loved, and cared about little else. No matter what I was doing she never seemed to be far away, which obviously included plenty of gaming.</p><p>The day we lost Millie, my wife and I spent much of our time digging through old photos and videos to reminisce. As I scrolled back to my very first Instagram posts, it really hit home that this dog had been there for basically every major moment in our lives; every move and heartbreak, Christmas mornings and the early childhoods of both our daughters. We always remembered her as being cold with the kids when they were little — she was no longer the center of attention, after all — but there we found videos and pics of her eating out of their hands, or sleeping on their beds when they were sick. She was always just there, a quiet source of comfort for our whole family.</p><p>There was a theme with most of the photos of Millie and myself: her just chilling in my lap while I was reading or playing a game. Scrolling through those photos I saw this same scene play out through multiple console generations: a young and scrawny Millie beside a silver PS2 controller, a slightly older and scruffier version of her face hidden behind an Xbox One gamepad. There were photos of her lying on my chest as I played <em>New Horizons</em> during the early days of the covid-19 pandemic. The one that hit me the hardest was my oldest daughter lying on our couch with a Nintendo DS, probably lost in <em>Pokémon</em>, while Millie dozed beside her.</p><p>Here was a creature I loved unconditionally, who was always quietly there when I needed her and, later, when my kids needed her, too. Console generations might seem like a silly way to measure time, but they can also be effective. Technology changes so quickly that it can become an easy visual shorthand for identifying a particular moment or era. Millie had sat alongside me through four of these generations — I even found a photo of her next to a PS5 review unit that I used to show how big the console was — and so became an indelible part of how I experienced these games.</p><p>At first I thought this connection would taint a hobby that had become important to me, turning something that had long been a source of joy and escape into one tinged with bitter memories. But as I tossed my line into the <em>Animal Crossing</em> waters, I realized I wasn’t being haunted by Millie’s presence, but reminded of it. Her warmth and presence may no longer be physical, but that doesn’t make it any less comforting.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/767156/gaming-grief#comments">0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/767156/gaming-grief]]></content:encoded>
