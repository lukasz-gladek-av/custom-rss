Walmart, Best Buy, and Target <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/654571/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-issues-problems]">sold out of their inventory</a> early Thursday morning, while <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1915463133499629651">GameStop says it sold out</a> of online preorders hours after they opened at 11AM ET.</p><p>It’s not clear when — or if — the four retailers will reopen preorders down the line. You can still sign up for preorders directly from Nintendo, but you’ll need to ensure you <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641559/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gameplay-requirements">have at least 50 hours of gameplay</a> on the original Switch as of April 2nd, 2025 and have purchased a 12-month Switch Online membership. GameStop also says it has some stock remaining in-store.</p><p>Nintendo will start sending out its first round of preorder invites on May 8th before gradually opening it up to more people. But even then, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/655159/my-nintendo-store-switch-2-invites">Nintendo says you may not receive</a> the Switch 2 on its June 5th release day due to “very high demand.” On Wednesday, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/654213/nintendo-switch-2-demand-japan-preorders-sales">Nintendo warned customers in Japan</a> that it “cannot fulfill” all of the preorders it received in the country.</p><div><p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">pushed Switch 2 preorders</a> in the US to April 24th due to concerns about tariffs. The Switch 2 still costs $449.99, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643616/nintendo-switch-2-us-preorders-date">Nintendo raised the price</a> of its accessories, including the Switch 2 Joy-Con, Pro Controller, Switch 2 camera, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/652885/nintendo-switch-2-amiibo-price-increase">and its new amiibo</a>.</p></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/655709/hori-usb-nintendo-switch-2-camera-gamechat-handheld<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After debuting a fun <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642514/nintendo-switch-2-usb-c-camera-hori-piranha-plant-privacy">Piranha Plant-inspired alternative</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641352/nintendo-switch-2-camera-launch">Nintendo’s own $50 Switch 2 camera</a>, Hori is back with another camera accessory for the console that’s less fun but more functional. Standing just shy of two inches tall and weighing 30 grams, the camera is small and light enough to be connected to the Switch 2’s top USB-C port without making the console feel top-heavy while playing in handheld mode.</p><p>Hori’s USB Camera for Nintendo Switch 2 is currently listed on the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/NSX-023/dp/B0F5WTSW21">Amazon Japan website</a> for 3,981 yen, or around $28, making it much cheaper than the company’s $60 Piranha Plant cam. It’s not known if the tiny camera will be exclusive to Japan, but since the Piranha Plant is already listed on <a href="https://stores.horiusa.com/nsx-001u/">Hori’s US website</a>, there’s a good chance this one will also see wider availability. For now, only Amazon Japan has the new camera listed with a June 5th, 2025 release date.</p><p>In addition to being small enough to perch atop the Switch 2, the GameChat-compatible camera can also be attached to an included weighted base allowing it to stand alone on an entertainment center like Nintendo’s own camera is designed to. The base also has a fold-down support on the underside so you can sit the camera on the top edge of a TV, assuming that edge is thin enough.</p><p>Hori’s latest camera seems like a better alternative to Nintendo’s in terms of portability, but like the Piranha Plant it’s limited to a resolution of only 640x480 – a significant step down from the 1080p capabilities of Nintendo’s. That’s potentially enough resolution to match the quality of Nintendo’s camera when Hori’s is perched atop the Switch 2 and right in front of your face. But when it’s zooming in on you from across the room while the camera is sitting next to your TV dock, there will likely be a significant reduction in video quality while using GameChat.</p><p>Nintendo says “any compatible USB-C camera you’d like” will work with the Switch 2 so you can probably use the external webcam you bought for work. But the company also warns that “<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Faccessories%2Fcamera%2F" rel="sponsored">not all cameras may work as intended</a>” and it has included a testing tool in the Switch 2’s settings to make sure. If you’d rather play it safe and know ahead of time, both of Hori’s cameras are officially licensed Nintendo accessories.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
