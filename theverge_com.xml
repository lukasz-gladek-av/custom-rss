Developer FromSoftware <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1981360180580217143">announced today</a> that its upcoming port of the open-world RPG <em>Elden Ring</em> — dubbed “Tarnished Edition” — won’t be launching in 2025 as originally planned. Instead, it will be out at some unspecified point in 2026. No specific reason was given for the delay other than “to allow time for performance adjustments.”</p><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Elden Ring</em> originally launched in 2022</a>, and the Switch 2 version was announced during <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641985/nintendo-switch-2-every-game-announced-direct">Nintendo’s big Direct presentation in April</a>, alongside <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641335/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-announcement">another From game called <em>Duskbloods</em></a>. It’s one of several blockbuster games being ported to Nintendo’s more powerful handheld console, and there are a number of big titles on the way soon.

She’s <a href="https://x.com/natalie_thenerd/status/1980151692625842526?s=61">currently developing a kit</a> so <a href="https://nataliethenerd.com/products/brick-boy-in-stock-notification">anyone can upgrade Lego’s Game Boy</a> to actually play games, but the creators of the BrickBoy have beaten her to the punch by taking a few shortcuts.</p></div><p>Natalie’s Lego Game Boy upgrades were all the more impressive because she had to create a custom circuit board, smaller than a Game Boy cartridge, to fit inside the replica using original chips so it could play actual cartridges. The BrickBoy is instead a custom self-contained module that slots into the Lego Game Boy’s cartridge slot and plays games through ROM files and emulation.</p><p>The BrickBoy’s creators claim it takes about five minutes to integrate the kit into Lego’s model, including installing a 2.4-inch LCD screen module, aligning magnetic sensors beneath the action buttons and D-pad, and reassembling it all. It looks easy enough, but those concerned with aesthetics may be disappointed to see that one version of the cartridge module does appear to stick out of the back of the Lego Game Boy because it houses a pair of AAA batteries.</p><p>The BrickBoy will be <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brickboy/brickboy-the-kit-that-makes-the-lego-game-boy-come-alive">available for preorder through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign</a> that’s set to launch on October 28th, 2025, in three versions. The Essential Kit can play Game Boy games in grayscale and includes a mono speaker, while the Gamer Kit adds support for Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance titles, Bluetooth headphone connectivity, and a rechargeable battery. There will also be a Collector’s Edition with a permanent power supply for those wanting to display their Lego Game Boy running demos, but pricing for the various kits hasn’t been announced yet.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/805376/lego-game-boy-brickboy-emulator-kickstarter]]></content:encoded>
