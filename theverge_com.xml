            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/663307/delta-emulator-ios-apple-app-store-patreon-signup<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Following companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661719/amazon-app-ios-apple-iphone-ipad-kindle-buy-books">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660084/spotify-app-iphone-apple-update-external-payment-links">Spotify</a>, the Delta emulator is the latest iOS app to take advantage of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">last month’s ruling</a> by Epic Games v. Apple judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. Although it has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661032/apple-epic-games-app-store-antitrust-ninth-circuit">appealed the decision</a>, Apple has complied with the ruling that it can no longer restrict developers from directing users to alternate payment options or collect a 27 percent commission on purchases made outside of apps. As a result, the Delta emulator — which can play games from retro consoles like the N64, NES, Game Boy, and Sega Genesis through emulation — has been updated to make it easier to join its Patreon. This lets users unlock additional features from right within the app without <a href="https://x.com/altstoreio/status/1920175446844715277">Apple’s intimidating scare screens</a> or inflated pricing.</p><p>“Delta’s latest update with our revised Patreon sign-up flow has been approved! We can now freely mention our Patreon without giving Apple 27% of donations,” Delta developer Riley Testut <a href="https://mastodon.social/@rileytestut/114467929471303098">announced on Mastodon</a> yesterday. When opening the app’s settings, users are now prompted to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/rileyshane">join the developers’ Patreon</a> to “Unlock exclusive app icons and receive early access to new features by donating.” Pressing a join button opens a web page within the app where users can select different membership tiers which include features like access to beta versions of the app, or the developers’ private Discord.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/17/24323220/delta-emulator-ios-apple-triple-price-patreon-membership">previous Delta update</a> released last December allowed users to sign up for Patreon-exclusive membership perks directly through its iOS app following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/16/24040881/apple-outside-payments-app-store-policies-iphone-ipad">updates to Apple’s App Store policies in early 2024</a>. But as a result of Apple’s decision to take a 27 percent cut from developers directing users to an outside payment platform, Delta’s $3, $5, and $10 Patreon memberships instead cost $10, $15, and $30, respectively, through its iOS app.</p><p>That purchase option – with the increased prices – is still available in Delta, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/deltas-game-emulator-becomes-a-patreon-supported-app-after-us-app-store-policy-changes/">according to <em>TechCrunch</em></a>, but is made less obvious through an Alternate Payment Methods menu in the app’s settings.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
