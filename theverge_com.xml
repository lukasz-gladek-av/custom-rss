            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/646977/bungie-marathon-release-date-september-alpha-test-details<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The creators of <em>Halo </em>and <em>Destiny </em>are finally ready to show off their next big project: <em>Marathon</em>. It’s a long-awaited title from Bungie and revives the classic <em>Marathon </em>IP in the form of a PvPvE extraction shooter. After a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23735830/bungie-marathon-sci-fi-pvp-extraction-shooter">teaser nearly two years ago</a>, the Sony-owned studio just spent an hour showing off <em>Marathon</em> gameplay and game mechanics and revealed the game will launch on September 23rd on PS5, Xbox Series S / X, and PC, with full cross-play and cross-save. There’s even an alpha test for fans to try out the game later this month, ahead of its full debut this year.</p><p><em>Marathon </em>is set in a sci-fi universe in 2850, in the remains of Tau Ceti IV, which Bungie describes as a lost colony whose inhabitants disappeared without a trace. Rival factions have hired Runners to scavenge for what’s left behind, and anyone who signs up to be a Runner has given up their human form for a biosynthetic shell with unique abilities and stats.</p><p>As a Runner, you fight in a crew of up to three players across a variety of zones and points of interest. You can face rival runners in maps of up to 18 players, so up to six teams, in a bid to grab as much loot as possible and get out. While <em>Marathon </em>is designed to be played in crews, with contextual pings and shared objectives, you can also play solo instead of having to form a dedicated three-person team.</p><p>In <em>Marathon</em> runs, there will be what Bungie calls security forces, PvE enemies that roam the world. There are also creatures on these planets that are a threat when you’re navigating toward points on a map. You’ll have to choose whether it’s worth engaging with these enemies and risk revealing your location to rival teams or use a strategy of avoiding these threats in this PvPvE environment.</p><p>The maps are filled with bold and vibrant artwork and weapons, materials, and equipment that can be scavenged. Before a run, you build a loadout and select the Runner that fits your play style. In the alpha test, which starts on April 23rd, there will be four runners to choose from, including the stealthy Void character that can go invisible much like a Hunter from <em>Destiny 2</em>.</p><p>There’s also a Glitch runner that has fast-paced abilities and, like its name implies, can glitch out enemies. If you’re more of a run-and-gun type of player, Locus has a shield ability and looks similar to the slide and shotgun play of a Titan from <em>Destiny 2</em>. The final runner in the alpha test is Blackbird, designed for recon and scanning the area around you. While there are four runners in the alpha test, there will be six to choose from when <em>Marathon </em>launches in September.</p><p>During its livestream, Bungie published a nearly 20-minute video of highlights from 40 creators it says it recently invited to try the game.</p><p>If you die, you’ll drop your gear. But if you survive, your loot moves with you to future runs so you get more powerful gear and level up. Teammates can also revive you if you fail a mission.</p><p>Bungie isn’t putting a limit on team compositions, so that means everyone on a three-person team can select the same runner. There will be end-game challenges, ranked play, seasonal storytelling, community events, and more.</p><p>Bungie has even produced an original short cinematic that’s set in the <em>Marathon </em>universe. Written and directed by Alberto Mielgo (<em>Love, Death, and Robots</em>), this nearly nine-minute short will have Bungie fans poring over it for days to discover every little detail about the <em>Marathon</em> universe.</p><p>While <em>Marathon </em>is very slick-looking, there’s a lot riding on this game. It’s entering a crowded market of shooters and live-service games that have tried and failed to break through in recent years. <em>Concord</em>, also from a PlayStation studio, was the biggest example of a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">shooter that failed to take off</a> recently, forcing Sony to take the game offline less than a month after launch and eventually shut down the studio behind it.</p><p><em>Spectre Divide</em>, a <em>Valorant</em>-like free-to-play shooter, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628698/spectre-divide-mountaintop-studios-shutting-down">also shut down</a> just months after its launch, with the developer behind the ambitious shooter shutting down, too. These high-profile failures add to the pressure that <em>Marathon</em> is already under on the back of Bungie’s success with <em>Halo</em> and <em>Destiny</em> and Sony’s ambitious live-service game effort that it has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345575/sony-god-of-war-bluepoint-games-bend-games-canceled">scaling back recently</a>.</p><p>The <em>Marathon</em> alpha test will be an opportunity for Bungie to show the world exactly how its latest game will stand out from the competition, and whether it does enough to tempt people away from hero shooters or <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Fortnite</em> into the extraction shooter genre that <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> has popularized.</p><p>The big question left for Bungie to answer is how much <em>Marathon</em> will cost. It’s not a free-to-play game, but the studio isn’t ready to talk about exact pricing just yet. <em>Destiny 2</em> is technically free-to-play with an optional season pass, but a lot of additional content requires payment for access to raids, dungeons, and even some of the story content. It’s been a confusing model for new players over the years, so I’m hoping Bungie lands on a clear pricing structure for <em>Marathon</em>.</p><p><em>Marathon </em>debuts on PS5, Xbox Series S / X, and PC on September 23rd. You can sign up for the <em>Marathon </em>closed alpha test <a href="https://www.marathonthegame.com/">on Bungie’s website</a> or <a href="http://discord.gg/marathonthegame">on Discord</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
