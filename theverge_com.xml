The Charging Case Pro for Nintendo Switch 2 carries forward the same 10,000mAh internal battery as the original, but it’s been redesigned so you don’t need to remove the battery to charge it, and you no longer need a short cable to connect it to the console.</p><p>On the outside of the Charging Case Pro you’ll now find a USB-C port that makes charging the internal battery a little more convenient, alongside a small display showing its remaining battery life. The interior of the original version of the case was designed to prop up the Switch 2 using the handheld’s own flip-out stand, but the new Pro version comes with an adjustable stand of its own, integrated into its redesigned battery. Similar to inserting the Switch 2 into its dock, the console connects to a USB-C port that delivers power when it’s placed on the stand.</p><p>The new case also has a flap for holding game cartridges, a mesh pocket for storing other accessories, and a hidden compartment for stashing trackers like an AirTag or one of Tile’s. It also comes with a $30 price bump. Belkin’s original Charge Case for Nintendo Switch 2 launched last June for $69.99, but the new Pro version is available now for $99.99.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><figcaption><em>The Charging Case Pro’s battery is still removable and now features an integrated adjustable stand for the Switch 2.</em></figcaption> <cite>Image: Belkin</cite></span></p></section><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/849332/belkin-charging-case-pro-nintendo-switch-2-battery]]></content:encoded>

If you ever played the game, even once, you surely remember how it worked, but here’s a summary just in case. You were a bird. Your job was to fly, left to right, for as long as possible without crashing into the green <em>Mario</em>-ish pipes coming from both the top and bottom of the screen. Tap the screen to go up, stop tapping to go down. That’s it. That’s the game.</p><p>Nobody, not even <em>Flappy Bird </em>creator Dong Nguyen, thought those were the ingredients for a smash hit. And yet for a few weeks in 2014, the game was at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/5/5383708/flappy-bird-revenue-50-k-per-day-dong-nguyen-interview">the top of app stores everywhere</a> — and became something of a cultural phenomenon. Almost as soon as it took off, though, players began to rebel, annoyed at both the punishing difficulty of the game and the sudden riches it was bringing its developer. Things got so bad, so quickly, that at the peak of its popularity Nguyen did the unthinkable: he simply <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/8/5393208/flappy-bird-creator-says-hes-pulling-the-game-offline-tomorrow">removed the game from stores</a>.</p><p>For <a href="https://pod.link/1840983742">this episode of <em>Version History</em></a>, we dust off our tapping fingers and dig into the story of <em>Flappy Bird. </em>David Pierce, Jake Kastrenakes, and <em><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">Game File</a></em>’s Stephen Totilo discuss the game’s extremely simple beginnings, its nearly unexplainable explosion in popularity, its clone-filled legacy, and the controversy that changed Nguyen’s life forever. Both Totilo and <em>The Verge </em>figure fairly prominently in the story, and we all have a lot to think about (and maybe answer for). The <em>Flappy Bird </em>story isn’t even technically over — there’s still a game by that name that you can play, at least in a few places — but it basically ended almost as soon as it began.</p><p>If you want to subscribe to <em>Version History, </em>there are two ways to get every episode as soon as it drops:</p><p>And if you want to relive the story of <em>Flappy Bird, </em>even though you can’t technically play the original anymore, here are a few links to get you started:</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Mjc0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>David Pierce</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/podcast/853824/flappy-bird-game-version-history]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/tech/846376/xreal-neo-specs-switch-2-battery-dock</link>
            <guid>1396747</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When the Nintendo Switch 2 launched in June, AR glasses brand Viture beat Xreal to the punch with its own multi-port battery pack that doubles as a portable video dock for the new console. After several months, Xreal answered with the Neo, a 10,000mAh (38.7Wh) battery pack with DisplayPort Alt video-out. It sure is one of the prettiest batteries I’ve ever seen, and it works with the company’s own glasses dating back to the Air series, as well as its new $449 Xreal 1S, which just launched. I’ve also gotten Viture’s Luma Pro glasses working with it.</p><p>The $99 Neo is available now and is being shown off at CES 2026. Whether it’s worth the price to you may come down to how much you use your Xreal glasses for gaming or entertainment on the go. Xreal glasses owners have already been able to connect directly to the likes of Valve’s Steam Deck or the Asus ROG Ally for video and audio over USB-C. Outside of Nintendo’s world, the Neo doesn’t change anything except for letting you give your device some juice while you game. You can play at up to 1200p (depending on the resolution of the glasses) at up to 120Hz. The Switch 2 can go up to 1080p at 120Hz through the Neo.</p><p>This isn’t the fastest-charging battery around, but it’s faster than Viture’s dock. The Neo outputs up to 20W, which is plenty fast for phones and tablets as well as the Switch 2, but it’s not enough to quickly charge some handhelds and laptops. However, if you use the Neo to entertain yourself while it’s being charged with a 65W or higher wall adapter, the output speed boosts to 45W.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>I can’t really think of a good reason why the Neo needed a kickstand, but it has one.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Xreal’s battery dock has a magnetized ring to let it conveniently snap onto MagSafe-equipped iPhones, and it has a kickstand in case you want to prop it up. The Neo has a short built-in USB-C cable that’s for the video source you want to view within the glasses. There’s a USB-C port next to that cable meant for your AR glasses. Then, on the other side, there’s a USB-C charging port.</p><p>It would have been nice to have an HDMI port on the Neo — Viture’s Pro Mobile Dock has one, enabling connection to many other kinds of gadgets, like game consoles and streaming devices. I also would have been fine with a <em>slightly</em> bigger size if it meant higher battery capacity. But the Neo is a fine choice if you primarily entertain yourself while you’re on the move.</p><p><em>Photography by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/846376/xreal-neo-specs-switch-2-battery-dock]]></content:encoded>
