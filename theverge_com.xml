Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>The Sims </em>is in a period of transition — and as part of that, the ongoing mobile version will be shutting down in a few months. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-mobile/news/final-update">EA announced</a> that today’s update for <em>The Sims Mobile</em> will be its last, and that on January 20th, 2026 the game “will no longer be accessible to play and will be sunset.”</p><p>The mobile iteration of the franchise first launched in 2018, and has seen more than 50 updates since then. EA says that starting today players will no longer be able to spend real money in the game, and that it will be delisted on both iOS and Android tomorrow before the servers shut down completely next year, making it entirely unplayable.</p><div><p>The news comes as the <em>Sims</em> franchise is in the process of moving on to what’s next. While <em>The Sims 4</em> is still chugging along, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870172/project-rene-next-gen-sims-free">and shows no signs of ending any time soon</a>, the mysterious “Project Rene” is lurking in the background as the next big iteration for the series. EA hasn’t spoken about the next <em>Sims</em> project in some time, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23579786/the-sims-project-rene-multiplayer-solo-cross-platform">it’s expected to be both a single and multiplayer experience that’s available across PC and mobile</a>. This, in theory, makes a game like <em>Sims Mobile</em> less necessary.</p></div><div><p>Of course, plans for Project Rene could shift as well. Not only is it still early in development, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/787112/electronic-arts-55-billion-privacte-acquisition-pif-silver-lake-affinity-partners">EA is in the midst of going private</a> in a $55 billion deal <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/795232/ea-battlefield-6-hit-launch-deal">that could impact that trajectory of its biggest franchises</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/802631/the-sims-mobile-shut-down-2026]]></content:encoded>

For comparison, the original Nintendo DS launched in North America over 20 years ago for $149.99.</p><p>The company hasn’t revealed details on when the RG DS will be available, specific pricing, or performance specs including what processor will be under the hood. The new video demonstrates that it will at least be capable of emulating both NDS and 3DS titles, but it doesn’t look like Anbernic will be recreating the 3DS’ glasses-free 3D experience.</p><p>Anbernic isn’t the first company to release a dual-screen handheld, but the RG DS may be worth considering if only for its relatively affordable price. Competitors like Ayaneo have previously crowdfunded a few dual-screen devices, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684190/ayaneo-flip-1s-ds-nintendo-windows-handheld-dual-screen">Flip 1S DS that starts at $999</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/761296/ayaneo-pocket-ds-dual-screen-handheld-android-13">Pocket DS that starts at $519</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/802610/anbernic-rg-nintendo-ds-dual-screen-handheld-emulator]]></content:encoded>

He joined in 2018, and after a two-year stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>As part of our Amazon Prime Big Deal Days coverage earlier this month, I was tasked with spotting notable discounts happening at Walmart. My favorite was the $600 off deal on <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLenovo-Legion-5-15-1-OLED-WQXGA-165HZ-Gaming-Notebook-AMD-Ryzen-7-260-16GB-RAM-512GB-SSD-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-5060-Eclipse-Black%2F17103273135" rel="sponsored"><strong>Lenovo’s Legion 5 gaming laptop</strong></a>, which has a 15.1-inch 2,560 x 1,600 (16:10 aspect ratio) OLED screen with a 165Hz refresh rate, Nvidia’s RTX 5060 GPU, and other solid specs. The sale price was $950, but if you missed out on the sale, it’s still a fantastic value at $1,050 ($500 off).</p><p>The Legion 5 is a better entry-level gaming laptop than $1,050 can usually get you. Getting an RTX 5060 inside of one at this price is rare, but not unheard of. But getting it in a machine under $1,500 that also touts a capable AMD Ryzen 7 260 processor, user-replaceable RAM and storage (it comes with 16GB DDR5 and 512GB, respectively), <em>and </em>an OLED screen is definitely a rarity.</p><p>The Ryzen 7 260 is capable and efficient, but if you’d rather opt for the version of the Legion 5 that has a slightly faster Intel Core i7 14700HX processor — plus double the internal storage (1TB versus 512GB) — it’s available at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLenovo-Legion-5i-15-1-WQXGA-Laptop-Core-i7-14700HX-16GB-1TB-NVIDIA-GN22-X4-83LY0000US%2F14618706354" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a> for $1,199 ($301 off).</p><div><p id="other-verge-approved-deals-for-you"><h2>Other <em>Verge</em>-approved deals for you</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Last week, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/800104/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-plus-new-name">Amazon renamed the Fire TV Stick 4K to the Fire TV Stick 4K Plus</a>. It was an effort to make its lineup less confusing, following the introduction of the Fire TV Stick 4K Select. Regardless of the name change’s effectiveness, you can <strong>grab the superior 4K Plus</strong> for $24.99 (50 percent off) through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7Z4QZTT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. Or better yet, save another $2 on the product by purchasing it through <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-2nd-gen-1" rel="sponsored">Woot</a>. You can get the 4K Plus there for $22.99, even though the site doesn’t reflect the recent name change. This streaming device offers many of the same perks as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, including support for Dolby Vision and other HDR formats, plus Dolby Atmos audio in Atmos-ready content.</span></li><li><span>The passing of Tomonobu Itagaki last week inspired me to dive back into some of the excellent <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> games that he directed. If you want to do the same, and you have either a gaming PC or a gaming handheld, grab the <em><strong>Ninja Gaiden Master Collection</strong></em> for just $15.95 at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/ninja-gaiden-master-collection-ninja-gaiden-2?add_voucher=OMENVIP" rel="sponsored">Fanatical</a> (it’s a Steam key) with promo code <strong>OMENVIP</strong>, which should automatically be applied when you click the link. The collection contains the <em>Sigma </em>versions of the first two reboot titles, plus <em>Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor’s Edge</em>, which is a low point for the series. Let’s hope that <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/684438/ninja-gaiden-4-hands-on-xbox-showcase-2025">Ninja Gaiden 4</a></em> turns things around when it launches later this year.</span></li><li><span>Jim Henson fans may want to pick up the 4K Blu-ray deluxe edition of <em><strong>The Dark Crystal</strong></em>, the surprisingly dark 1982 live-action film, while it’s 53 percent off at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCW9R9KY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. Its current sale price of $46.99 is pretty good considering you’re getting the film presented in 4K Dolby Vision HDR with Dolby Atmos sound, plus numerous special features and a 1:1 glass replica of the Crystal Shard from the movie.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/802576/lenovo-legion-5-gaming-laptop-nvidia-rtx-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
