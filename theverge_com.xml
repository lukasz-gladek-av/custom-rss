He previously worked at <em>Android Police</em> and <em>Tech Advisor</em>.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Electronic Arts (EA) is releasing the source code for four <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> titles under the open source GPL license. The original <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> (since subtitled <em>Tiberian Dawn</em>) is joined by <em>Red Alert</em>, <em>Renegade</em>, and <em>Generals</em>, the code for all of which can now be found on <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/">EA’s GitHub page</a>. Only the code has been open sourced, not the games’ assets and cinematics, but it will help modders and the game restoration community keep the games playable.</p><p>This isn’t actually a first for EA. Back in 2020 the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21265663/ea-command-conquer-tiberian-dawn-red-alert-open-source-remastered">released the source code</a> for its <em>Command &amp; Conquer Remastered Collection</em>, made up of <em>Tiberian Dawn </em>and <em>Red Alert</em>. That code had already been adapted for the remaster’s engine however, while the new releases are the “fully recovered source code” of the series’ first two games, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/command-and-conquer/command-and-conquer-remastered/news/steam-workshop-support">according to Luke “CCHyper” Feenan</a>, a <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> community member who proposed and orchestrated the release together with EA.</p><p><em>Renegade</em> and <em>Generals</em>, meanwhile, have been released under an open source license for the first time. <em>Renegade</em> is a 2002 first- and third-person shooter set in the franchise’s Tiberium universe, while <em>Generals </em>is a 2003 strategy game that eschewed the Tiberium and <em>Red Alert</em> worlds for a near-future setting depicting a war between the United States, China, and the fictional Global Liberation Army. Its expansion <em>Zero Hour</em> is also included in the open source release.</p><p>Alongside the open sourcing, EA has also opened Steam Workshop support, and released a <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Modding_Support">‘Modding Support’ pack</a> that includes the source XML, schema, script, shader and map files, for all the games that use the SAGE engine:</p><div><ul><li><span><em>C&amp;C Renegade</em></span></li><li><span><em>C&amp;C Generals &amp; Zero Hour</em></span></li><li><span><em>C&amp;C 3 Tiberium Wars and Kane’s Wrath</em></span></li><li><span><em>C&amp;C Red Alert 3 &amp; Uprising </em></span></li><li><span><em>C&amp;C 4 Tiberian Twilight</em></span></li></ul></div><p>That move should make it easier to create mods and maps for the games, and to share some of those creations through Steam. To cap off the announcement, EA released a 35-minute video of archival gameplay footage from the early development of <em>Renegade</em> and <em>Generals</em>: </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
