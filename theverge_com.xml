Your marketing for the <strong>Aero X16</strong> is giving Razer Blade, from the colors and font of the spec slides to the thin design of the space gray laptop itself. While we haven’t tested out this model to see how it stacks up to Razer’s gaming machine, its price is certainly a <em>lot </em>more attractive. At <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgigabyte-aero-x16-copilot-pc-16-25601600-wqxga-amd-ryzen-al-7-350-1tb-ssd-32gb-ddr5-ram-geforce-rtx-5070-space-gray%2F6632266.p" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, you can get a capable midrange model with AMD’s Ryzen AI 7 350 CPU, Nvidia’s RTX 5070 graphics chip, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD for $1,299.99 (normally $1,649.99).</p><p>Whether you’re in need of a laptop built mainly for gaming, creative work, or work tasks, there’s a lot to like with this Aero X16 configuration. It has a 16:10 aspect ratio QHD screen, which affords a bit more vertical space than your average laptop screen (letting you read more lines at once without scrolling, for example). It has a lot of other specs that I’m happy to see in a laptop that costs less than $1,500, like a 165Hz high refresh rate screen, a capable RTX 5070 GPU, plus the ability to easily add more RAM (two slots, with support for up to 64GB DDR5 5,600MHz) and storage (two PCIe 4.0 slots) after purchase.</p><p>Comparing this Gigabyte model to its closest Razer Blade 16 equivalent isn’t exactly apples to apples, of course — there’s some features you just won’t see in the Aero X16. The<a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2Frazer-blade-16%2FRZ09-05286EN3-R3U1" rel="sponsored"> RTX 5070-equipped Blade 16 </a>is $2,399.99, and likewise comes with 32GB RAM and a 1TB SSD, but you’ll also get a QHD OLED panel with a 240Hz refresh rate by default, not to mention a more polished design.</p><div><p id="other-deals-to-get-your-monday-going"><h2>Other deals to get your Monday going</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>The <strong><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>-inspired Xbox wireless controller</strong> that’s covered in Doom Slayer design flair is $54 at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwalmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Wireless-Controller-DOOM-The-Dark-Ages-Limited-Edition%2F15128257819" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, down from its original $79.99 price. If you’ve always wanted a controller with a blood splatter painted on, and its ABXY labels replaced with in-game glyphs, this is the gamepad for you. Looking past the unique design, it’s a standard Xbox wireless controller, with replaceable AA batteries, reliable connectivity, and Bluetooth support for seamless pairing with PCs, phones, tablets, and more.</span></li><li><span>A bunch of PS5 disc games are discounted at Best Buy for seemingly no apparent reason — not that a reason is ever required for good discounts.

Many of these prices match the lowest that we’ve seen to date.</span></li><li><span>Most high-speed power banks also include a bunch of capacity, so you can recharge large gadgets multiple times. However, if your need for speed trumps capacity (say, if you need something on the smaller side for your bag), head over to <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/anker-prime-12-000mah-2-port-130w-powerbank" rel="sponsored">Woot</a> where you can grab <strong>Anker’s screen-equipped Prime 12,000mAh battery</strong> for $59.99 (originally $99.99). It has a maximum speed of 65W if you’re charging with a single port. It supports two-way charging, simultaneously accepting up to a 65W charge from the other USB-C port. If you’d rather shop at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fanker-powercore-power-bank-12000mah-65w-black%2F6553402.p" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, that retailer has this model for a few bucks more, costing $62.99. This battery can recharge most phones multiple times, but only has enough to keep your laptop topped up (or charged halfway or so from a dead battery).</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/757349/gigabyte-aero-x16-doom-xbox-ps5-controller-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
