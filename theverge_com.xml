            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>As a retro gaming fan, I was thrilled when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24122341/apple-app-store-game-emulators-super-apps">Apple opened its App Store to emulators in 2024</a>, but I’ve yet to find a controller that makes me want to fully embrace retro gaming on my phone.</p></div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/661382/the-new-backbone-pro-could-be-the-one-controller-for-all-your-gaming">Clamp-on controllers like the Backbone Pro</a> are a bit too bulky, and I don’t want to prop my phone up somewhere to use a standalone gamepad. The Abxylute M4 seemed exactly what I was looking for when it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/809274/abxylute-m4-snap-on-mobile-wireless-smartphone-controller-magnetic-magsafe">debuted a few months ago</a>. It’s a compact wireless gamepad that uses a magnetic mount to attach to my iPhone. It’s a clever design, but one that’s let down by stiff thumbsticks and a magnetic mount that doesn’t always feel like it’s securely supporting my phone.</p><p>There are two components to the Abxylute M4: a retro-looking rectangular gamepad that connects to your smartphone over Bluetooth, and a Q-shaped mount that attaches the controller to your phone so it feels like you’re playing a handheld console. The mount is compatible with MagSafe iPhone models and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762426/google-qi2-wireless-charger-pixelsnap-pixel-10-series">Google Pixel 10 Series</a>. I primarily tested it with an iPhone 16 Pro, but Abxylute includes an adhesive metal ring you can stick to the back of any phone to make it compatible.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The M4’s magnetic mount can double as a smartphone stand using a ring-shaped kickstand.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The ring of magnets on the M4’s mount stuck to the back of my iPhone as securely as any MagSafe accessory or Qi2 charger I’ve ever used. It’s not going to come off until you want it to. It also features a smooth finish, allowing you to rotate the mount and attach the gamepad so that it completely hides behind your phone instead of hanging off the side. But the whole thing ends up being too bulky and thick to slip into a pocket, so I’ve been removing it entirely when not playing.</p><div id=":R1j2r6eqb96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The M4 controller doesn’t protrude far enough from the bottom of a phone to play games in a portrait orientation.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The M4 can be attached so it completely hides behind your phone. But you’ll need giant pockets to carry it around like this.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>One limitation of the M4’s design is that when attached, it can only be used to play games in a landscape orientation. In a vertical mode, the controller doesn’t protrude far enough for all its controls to be accessible. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but as a decades-old Game Boy fan, I tend to prefer playing games vertically. Recently announced mobile controllers like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/860093/pocket-taco-pocket-taco-pocket-taco">GameSir Pocket Taco</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/860160/8bitdo-flippad-hands-on">8BitDo FlipPad</a> support that.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The mount attaches to the M4 controller using one of two magnetic connectors.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>A far bigger issue with the M4’s design, and a potential deal-breaker, is the connection between the mount and the controller. It also relies on a strong magnet that makes the controller snap into place when attached to the mount. But the connection doesn’t feel strong enough to always keep the mount securely connected to the controller while your phone’s attached.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The mount’s connection to the M4 controller feels strong, but it doesn’t take a lot of force for it to accidentally disconnect.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The connection between the mount and controller feels secure enough when I’m holding the M4 and my phone up in front of me while playing a game. But at some angles, or when I accidentally bump my phone, the mount can separate from the gamepad. The two will also consistently disconnect if you absentmindedly turn the whole thing upside down, sending the phone and the attached mount falling. Thankfully, all my testing was done on a soft sofa.</p><p>I’m not the only one to experience this behavior. <a href="https://retrododo.com/abxylute-m4-controller-review/"><em>Retro Dodo</em>’s Brandon Saltalamacchia</a> did, too. The connection might fare better with a lighter phone, like the iPhone Air, but given smartphones are now a significant investment (my iPhone 16 Pro cost just shy of CA$1,500 here in Canada, or around $1,100 US), I’m not comfortable using the M4 as it’s designed.</p><p>The M4 isn’t entirely dependent on its magnetic mount. It can be used as a standalone controller with phones, consoles, or any device that supports Bluetooth gamepads. I was surprised at how comfortable it was to use with my gigantic hands. Its square-shaped design lets me reach the M4’s shoulder buttons without contorting my index fingers, and the build quality feels solid.</p><div id=":R1n2r6eqb96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The M4 controller’s action buttons are small, but the D-pad feels comfortably sized, even for my large thumbs.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>There’s two pairs of shoulder buttons atop the M4 controller, which I found easy to reach without having to overstretch my fingers.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>The controller’s four action buttons are small but have a satisfying amount of resistance. They’re paired with a large D-pad that’s a bit mushy and prone to registering inputs from multiple directions, but adequate for pick-up-and-play gaming sessions. Choose a different controller if you’re chasing high scores.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The M4’s analog joysticks feature a sliding disc design similar to what the Nintendo 3DS offered. But on the M4 they’re stiff and uncomfortable to use.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Abxylute includes two analog joysticks, a feature rarely found on controllers this size. They use a sliding disc design similar to what Nintendo used on the 3DS — but less effective. The sliding joysticks on the M4 are stiff and uncomfortable, making subtle movements nearly impossible. My thumb ached after just a handful of races in <em>Mario Kart World</em>, and I can’t see myself using either of the joysticks again.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>For $49 the Abxylute M4 is one of the more affordable ways to turn your smartphone into a handheld console, but the risks don’t feel worth it.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>As compact controllers go, the $49 Abxylute M4 is good, but far from great. But that’s not why people are going to buy it. Its promise of turning a smartphone into a handheld console helped the company raise over $300,000 from nearly 6,000 backers on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1932181238/m4-snap-on-magnetic-phone-controller-for-anytime-pocket-play">Kickstarter</a> — a lot of whom I think will be frustrated or disappointed if they’re not extra cautious while using it. Trusting your $1,000 mobile device to the M4 requires a leap of faith that’s a bit too far for me.</p><p><em>Photos by Andrew Liszewski / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/864821/abxylute-m4-snap-on-mobile-controller-magsafe-magnetic-bluetooth]]></content:encoded>
