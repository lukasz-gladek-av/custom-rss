            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/641578/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatibility-games-faq<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/chris-welch">Chris Welch</a> <span>is a senior reviewer who has worked at The Verge since its founding in 2011. His coverage areas include audio (Sonos, Apple, Bose, Sony, etc.), home theater, smartphones, photography, and more.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>At numerous points during today’s Nintendo Switch 2 event stream, fine print at the bottom of the screen directed viewers to Nintendo’s website for the full details on which original Switch titles will be supported by the new console.</p><p>As it turns out, the company has put together a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ftransfer-guide%2Fcompatible-games%2F" rel="sponsored">surprisingly detailed resource page</a> that goes over all the titles it has tested thus far — both from Nintendo itself and third-party developers. And the chart below really tells the story: more often than not, last-gen games should run without any problems when the Switch 2 hits shelves on June 5th.</p><p>Even titles that we assumed might be fully incompatible — <em>Ring Fit Adventure, 1-2-Switch</em>, and the various <em>Labo</em> kit assembly games — are supported to some extent on the Switch 2 if you stick to original Joy-Cons or use other workaround methods that Nintendo spells out. At least for the time being, there’s only one game that just plain won’t work, and that’s the VR <em>Labo</em> kit. I don’t think anyone can really fault Nintendo for that.</p><p>The company also divides “games with startup issues” — <em>Doom Eternal, Rocket League, NBA 2K25,</em> and <em>Warframe</em> are among these — and “games that are playable, but have some in-game compatibility issues” into separate lists. “Nintendo is continuing to improve compatibility, including by working with publishing and developing partners,” the company notes on its site. That work will no doubt continue right up until the console’s release in early June.</p><p>Separately, Nintendo <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ftransfer-guide%2Fgames-with-free-updates%2F" rel="sponsored">has also revealed</a> which original Switch titles will be getting upgrades via future patches. These include <em>Arms, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, Super Mario Odyssey,</em> and more.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/641335/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-announcement<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/antonio-g-di-benedetto">Antonio G. Di Benedetto</a> <span>is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget. He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>The Duskbloods</em>, a new game by FromSoftware, is coming exclusively to the Nintendo Switch 2. The teaser trailer debuted during Nintendo’s Switch 2 Direct video presentation, where it was revealed that it’s set to launch in 2026 with famed <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Dark Souls </em>director Hidetaka Miyazaki at the helm. No other details were provided.</p><p>The trailer and name are very evocative of <em>Bloodborne</em>, the cult classic title that’s remained exclusive to Sony’s PlayStation consoles. But according to <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1907432474759569770">a post by Nintendo of America on X</a> and <a href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/duskbloods/article/250402_1.html"><em>The Duskbloods</em> website</a>, the new title differs in that it’s a player vs player vs enemies (PvPvE) format multiplayer game. FromSoftware may be known for single-player focused epics (with limited co-op) like the <em>Dark Souls</em> series and <em>Elden Ring</em>, but well before <em>Duskbloods </em>launches we’ll be getting its first multiplayer-only game in the form of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts">Elden Ring Nightreign</a></em>.</p><p>Nintendo teased that more will be revealed about <em>The Duskbloods</em> in a Creator’s Voice article with Miyazaki, set to publish on the official Nintendo website on April 4th. That should be helpful, considering the trailer goes heavier on style and flair than it does on details. There’s definitely a <em>Bloodborne</em>-y vibe with its gothic setting, and there seem to be vampiric Twilight Blood Clan characters. And it’s FromSoftware, so there’s of course some excellent looking enemies, monster designs, and fashion for days.</p><p>The moment that hangs on the vast expanse of The Duskbloods’ world may even indicate an open-world of some kind, but I’ll leave it up to the FromSoftware lore experts to go hard on their deep-dives and dissections of the three-and-a-half minute trailer.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
