It is the first contract agreement at Microsoft since the concerted effort to unionize the video game industry began roughly four years ago.</p><p>“This is a monumental victory for all current video game workers and for those that come after,” said Page Branson, a senior QA tester at ZeniMax, <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-reach-historic-tentative-contract-agreement-microsoft">in the press release announcing the agreement</a>. A ratification vote for the contract will take place in late June.</p><p>The union, organized by the Communications Workers of America (CWA), was formed in 2023 and was voluntarily recognized by Microsoft as a part of the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/6/23543005/microsoft-washington-post-ad-cwa-unions">labor neutrality agreement with the CWA</a>. In the two years since, the union and Microsoft engaged in contract negotiations that precipitated <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295556/video-game-developer-strike-zenimax-microsoft">a one-day strike</a> to protest return to office and outsourcing policies and, in April, a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640423/zenimax-union-cwa-strike-authorization-vote">strike authorization vote</a>.</p><p>The contract details offer up a glimpse of what workers across the industry are fighting for and what they can win. According to CWA’s press release, the contract guarantees wage increases — a big deal considering QA workers are some of the lowest-paid workers in the industry. The contract will also include protections against arbitrary dismissal, as well as crediting guidelines — another big deal, as there are numerous ways a person who worked on a video game <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-game-companies-use-credits-to-reward-or-punish-de-1840905129">can get left off its credits</a>. </p><p>While the industry’s organization efforts are ongoing, there’s been a surge in activity over the last four years. Workers at Raven Software, which was then a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard before its acquisition by Microsoft, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/21/22894964/activision-blizzard-raven-software-employees-create-game-workers-alliance-union">organized the first video game union at a AAA publisher in 2022</a>. That win kicked off a series of other high-profile unionization efforts across the industry but concentrated primarily within Microsoft — ostensibly to take advantage of the labor neutrality agreement that states that Microsoft will voluntarily recognize union efforts within the company. With ZeniMax workers finally winning a contract agreement at Microsoft, the industry has another first — one that will set a precedent for future negotiations.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
