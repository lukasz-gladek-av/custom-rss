As of the end of 2024, the Nintendo Switch has <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">sold over 150 million units</a> in the eight years since its release. That’s an impressive number, and yet…that’s <em>still </em>not enough to make it the company’s best selling piece of hardware – a distinction that belongs to the humble Nintendo DS – but it’s getting close.</p><p>The company released its earnings report earlier this week and the numbers don’t look great. Though hardware sales are down a whopping 30 percentage points compared to 2023, Nintendo has, predictably, taken an optimistic stance. After all, this console is eight years old <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">with the Switch 2</a> tantalizingly close to launch. And in light of all that, it still sold almost 10 million units. But that impressive 150 million unit total is still a bit short of the massive 154 million units the Nintendo DS sold in its 12-year lifetime. Bolstered by recent games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> and with new games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> on the horizon, it’s likely that the Switch will finally overtake the DS this year, making it Nintendo’s best selling console ever.</p><p>After that, there’s one more boss for the console to beat before it can be called the best-selling console of all time – the 160 million units of the PlayStation 2. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/605811/infinity-nikki-gacha-mechanics<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’ve been having a great time with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/14/24320757/infinity-nikki-review-gacha-dress-up-game"><em>Infinity Nikki</em></a><em>. </em>I do my dailies, grind for materials, and desperately search for an outfit that works with the single ugliest piece of clothing in the game: a red vest. But as I’ve progressed, the game has given me — a gacha newbie — an unfortunate crash-course education on how these games really work and what not to do if you want to keep your sanity and your wallet intact.</p><p>The trouble began right before the current <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348535/infinity-nikki-firework-season-update-trailer-january-date">Lunar New Year event</a>, when I started obtaining every piece of a special outfit called Wings of Wishes. In <em>Infinity Nikki</em>, special outfits like Wings of Wishes are gated behind what’s called Resonance Events, which are essentially slot machines available for a limited time. When you spend currency in the game, you’re not buying outfits outright; you’re paying to “pull” the lever on that slot machine in hopes that it’ll spit out the pieces you want. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>This is the best I can do styling this hideous red vest. </em></figcaption></p></div><p>Throughout the month Wings of Wishes was available, I managed to earn eight of its nine pieces, even though I wasn’t really trying to get it. And as the event wound down, I was confident that even if I ran out of currency, I’d simply earn enough back for the final piece. But once I exhausted all the story and event quests, I learned that the game does not reward currency at a pace that can keep up with even casual, intermittent pulling. I went from earning enough to pull 10 or 20 times a week down to four or five times. It was like that <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/when-you-get-paid-biweekly">paycheck meme</a>, where, in the first week after you get paid, you’re eating steak and caviar for dinner, but by the second, you’re having ice soup. It got so dire that, by the end of the event, I started spending money hoping I’d pull the last piece, but I never did. </p><p>I was crushed, not only for obvious reasons but also because playing this game wasn’t supposed to change my spending habits. And I learned through consulting with my gacha veteran friends and the <em>Infinity Nikki </em>subreddit that I made the rookiest of mistakes in thinking I could outsmart a game engineered to part me from my money in ways I wouldn’t really notice or feel. </p><p>Gacha games have a poor reputation because of the way they can exploit players to extract their money. I got got because I thought I was above that, not realizing the game had already tapped into my FOMO and my wallet. Nothing, not even Wings of Wishes, was ever so desirable that it was worth focusing on. It only became a focus when I realized I needed <em>one more piece</em> right before the event ended. On top of that, I never noticed my spending. I wasn’t concerned because I wasn’t dropping $30–$50, but I was spending two dollars, three dollars, 99 cents, two and three times a day, because again, all I needed was <em>one more piece</em>. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>I spent so much money I didn’t intend trying to complete this Wings of Wishes outfit that I don’t even like!</em></figcaption></p></div><p>True blue gacha veterans will tell you that if there’s something you want, be prepared to either pay for it or plan for it. Players who don’t want to spend money for outfits skip two and three events in a row, hoarding their currency, waiting for the right outfit to spend their entire warchest on all for free. On the other hand, if a player wants to pay for an outfit, they know to be prepared to spend bill money for it. Pulling is the same as working a slot machine: you’re not guaranteed to hit. But <em>Infinity Nikki</em> guarantees a high-value piece every 10 pulls. With the currency used for pulls going for a dollar apiece, a nine-piece outfit like Wings of Wishes will run you at least $90. That amount goes up dramatically because the guarantee is for <em>any</em> high-value piece, and Resonance Events often contain <em>multiple</em> high-value outfits that have anywhere between eight and 10 pieces.</p><p>I understand that my problems likely don’t extend to the majority of other players. From perusing the game’s subreddit, I get the feeling most people either already understand the level of preparation required to obtain coveted clothing effectively, don’t mind spending eye-watering sums, or are content to either engage with the system casually or ignore it altogether. I planned on being the latter, someone who tossed the developers a few bucks here and there to obtain the occasional outfit I fancied.</p><div id=":R52rarr6:"><p><figcaption><em>Anyway, these are much better outfits.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>And in my naivete, I assumed that’s how gacha games worked. You could either grind out the resources you needed or spend money only when you chose to for items you wanted. Yes, I understood there were elements of random chance to compete against, but I genuinely thought that I could guarantee myself the desired outfits through a mix of casual play and light spending. I will not make that mistake again. Thankfully, the current Lunar New Year event doesn’t have any premium outfits I want. Plus, the ones being given away for free are more than cute enough to soothe my sartorial spirit. </p><p>The real tragedy of all this is that I don’t even like how Wings of Wishes looks. I only wanted it for its special ability to make Nikki’s floating animation look like she’s gliding on a magical paper crane. I have multiple substitutes for the white stockings I’m missing, so I can easily complete the look. But without that final piece, the outfit’s ability won’t trigger, and I don’t like it enough to wear it casually. So it’ll sit, incomplete and unworn, in my wardrobe, possibly forever.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
