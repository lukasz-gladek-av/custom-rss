            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Yesterday, <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> developers Team Cherry announced a September 4th release date for the long-awaited game, and indie developers are announcing delays to get out of the way of the launch. <em>Silksong</em> is a full sequel to the excellent <em>Hollow Knight</em> and is currently the most wishlisted game on Steam, so it’s likely going to be very popular when it’s finally available.</p><p>Panik Arcade, which was set to release its “hellish gambling roguelike” <em>CloverPit</em> on September 3rd, has pushed the game’s launch to September 26th. “We poured our hearts into our little game so of course we want to give it the best possible shot,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F3314790%2Fview%2F520848458437886253" rel="sponsored">Panik Arcade says</a>. “We hope you can understand — we’ll use the extra time of course to polish the game even further and we hope for your support at launch either way.”</p><p>Talegames, which was planning to launch the adventure RPG <em>Faeland</em> out of early access on September 9th, is postponing the release and plans to share a new date soon. “This wasn’t an easy decision,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1280080%2FFaeland%2F" rel="sponsored">Talegames says</a>. “We’ve poured years of work and love into <em>Faeland</em>, and we want to make sure it arrives at a time when it can receive the attention and care it deserves.”</p><p>Aeternum Game Studios, which is developing a 2D sidescrolling game focused on combat and exploration called <em>Aeterna Lucis</em>, <a href="https://x.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579">is postponing</a> a planned September release to sometime in 2026 because the game “wouldn’t have the visibility it deserves.” Aeternum also says that it still doesn’t have the development kits to “ensure a simultaneous release on all next-generation platforms,” so the delay means it can “bring you <em>Aeterna Lucis</em> at the right time.”</p><p>Frogteam Games, which is working on the 2D exploration game <em>Stomp and the Sword of Miracles</em>, is delaying a planned August 29th demo launch, as spotted <a href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays">by <em>Aftermath</em></a>. “Trying to market an indie game is already really, really hard,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2837590%2FStomp_and_the_Sword_of_Miracles%2F" rel="sponsored">Frogteam Games says</a>. It’s the task of trying to get attention in a deep sea of other amazing games. In the case of <em>Silksong</em>, however, I feel like a little krill trying to not get eaten by a blue whale. Tiny devs like me rely on word of mouth and streamers to bring in visibility, and everyone’s gonna be busy with <em>Silksong</em> for quite a while!</p><p>Even with these delays, early September is still packed with notable game releases, including Necrosoft Games’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1900250%2FDemonschool%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Demonschool</em></a> (September 3rd), Rogue Factor’s <a href="https://www.nacongaming.com/en-US/hell-is-us?srsltid=AfmBOopyqoJA7xkXuNy6kkA0Y7NrJpCZgYeUYqUce5c3lw90_m77bDYL"><em>Hell is Us</em></a> (September 4th), and Bloober Team’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/17/24272787/bloober-gets-bloody-in-its-next-game"><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em></a> (September 5th). We’ve reached out to the developers of those games to ask if they are changing their release plans because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/680636/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-trailer">of <em>Silksong</em></a>.</p><p><em><strong>Update, August 22nd</strong>: Added the delay for the demo of </em>Stomp and the Sword of Miracles<em>.</em></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/764346/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-game-delays-cloverpit-faeland-aeterna-lucis#comments">0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/764346/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-game-delays-cloverpit-faeland-aeterna-lucis]]></content:encoded>
