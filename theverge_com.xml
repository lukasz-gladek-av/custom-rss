In its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/index.html">latest earnings release</a>, covering April 1st to September 30th, Nintendo now predicts that it’ll sell 19 million Switch 2 units by March 2026, compared to its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717163/nintendo-earnings-q1-2025-switch-2-sales">previous forecast of 15 million</a>.</p><p>The Japanese gaming giant reports that 10.36 million Switch 2 consoles have been sold so far following its launch in June, with 4.54 million sales falling under its latest earnings period. 20.62 million Switch 2 games have also been sold since launch, though Nintendo has only raised its Switch 2 game forecast from 45 million to 48 million.</p><p>The combined hardware and software sales are driving a 110 percent surge in revenue, which increased to ¥1,099.5 billion (around $7.1 billion) between April and September, compared to ¥523.2 billion (around $3.4 billion) for the same period last year. Nintendo also increased its end-of-year sales forecast to ¥2,250 billion (around $14.6 billion), and said it’s taken US tariff measures into consideration for these revisions.</p><p>While the Switch 2 is the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">fastest-selling game console of all time</a>, the first Switch console is also still creeping up in sales. The Switch has now hit 154.01 million lifetime sales, <em>just shy</em> of the 154.02 million total units sold for the DS, which still reigns as Nintendo’s most successful console. After dethroning the DS, the Switch then just needs to surpass 160 million sales to become the best-selling console of all time — a record set by Sony’s PlayStation 2 last year.</p><p>By comparison, the Wii U sold just 13.7 million units over its entire lifetime, a figure that the Switch 2 is pretty much guaranteed to surpass before its first birthday.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/813025/nintendo-switch-2-sales-september-2025-earnings]]></content:encoded>
