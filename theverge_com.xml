The game was originally planned to be a VR-exclusive before the development crew at Innersloth and Schell Games pivoted to making this version of the game accessible to those without the expensive hardware too. <em>Among Us 3D </em>is compatible with Meta Quest, PSVR2, Steam VR headset, or PICO, and PC players on Steam will be able to join in on the fun too via cross-play. </p><p>Players can expect all the crewmate-killing action from the 2018 party game that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196330/among-us-half-billion-players-november">exploded in popularity during the pandemic</a> along with new game modes and extras. There will be lots of cosmetics including new skins and weird little hats, in-game proximity voice chat, and limited time events. Exclusive to <em>Among Us 3D </em>will be a new game mode called <a href="https://youtu.be/NYaSrHVXCmE?si=4q5PSmeWB4UDeXJu">Tag Mode</a> which is exactly what it sounds like. One player will be designated as the infected whose job it is to spread their affliction by chasing, capturing, and infecting unaffected teammates. </p><p><em>Among Us 3D</em> launches May 6th on Steam for $9.99.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
