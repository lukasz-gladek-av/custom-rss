            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft has started testing another handheld-friendly addition to its Xbox app, allowing PC gamers to quickly install and launch third-party apps like browsers, gaming utilities, and even rival storefronts. A new “My apps” feature is being tested in the Xbox app for Windows 11, and it looks like another way to avoid having to launch the main Microsoft Store or hunt for downloads online if you’re on a gaming PC.</p><p>“My apps is a new tab within the Xbox PC app’s library that allows players to locate, view, and download third-party applications and most commonly used storefronts,” <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/21/available-for-xbox-insiders-get-to-the-games-faster-with-my-apps/">explains Devin Dhaliwal</a>, a product manager for Xbox experiences. “By consolidating gaming apps in one location, this feature supports the new aggregated gaming library, making it more straightforward to find, download, and launch games from multiple locations.”</p><p>Microsoft has already been adding Steam, Battle.net, Ubisoft Connect, and other PC games into to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/690967/microsoft-xbox-app-windows-steam-games-aggregated-library-support-beta">unified library inside its Xbox app</a>, but this my apps view will be useful on a handheld PC where you want to avoid using the Windows desktop interface as much as possible. “My apps enables players on an ROG Xbox Ally or other Windows 11 handhelds to more easily navigate between applications from the Xbox full screen experience,” says Dhaliwal.</p><p>I’ve briefly tested the My apps view today and it lists Battle.net, Chrome, and GOG Galaxy. I have Chrome and Battle.net installed, so it simply launches these apps, but with GOG Galaxy it tries to download and install the app all within the Xbox UI. I say try because it failed to install during my testing, but this is a beta so there are bound to be bugs.</p><p>Microsoft is testing this with a “tailored selection of apps” right now, and plans to expand support for additional apps over time. It’s an interesting move, particularly given Microsoft’s work on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/763357/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-hands-on-notepad">merging the best bits of Windows and Xbox together</a> for the Xbox Ally handheld gaming PCs. Microsoft said last year that it wanted to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318799/microsoft-xbox-app-new-games-homescreen">make the Xbox app the home of PC gaming</a>, and it’s sure trying to make that a reality.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/763994/microsoft-xbox-app-windows-third-party-stores-apps-utilities#comments">3<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/763994/microsoft-xbox-app-windows-third-party-stores-apps-utilities]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/passing_the_torch">an update on</a> Thursday, Parsons wrote that he has “decided to pass the torch” to longtime Bungie developer Justin Truman.</p><p>Parsons has worked at Bungie for over 20 years and led the studio through the launch of <em>Destiny 2</em> in 2017, along with the release of its major expansion pack, <em>The Final Shape</em>.</p><div><p>In 2022, Sony Interactive Entertainment <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/15/23220335/bungie-sony-acquisition-complete-official-done">purchased Bungie for $3.6 billion</a>. The studio has since contended with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/30/23938990/bungie-sony-layoffs-delays-destiny-final-shape-marathon">the layoffs</a> of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/31/24210476/bungie-to-layoff-220-employees-new-project">hundreds of workers</a> and delayed its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688479/bungie-marathon-delay-sony">extraction shooter <em>Marathon</em></a> following lackluster alpha test feedback. In May, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/668449/bungie-marathon-art-plagiarism-ps5">an artist accused Bungie</a> of using their work in <em>Marathon</em> without permission.</p></div><p>“We’ve been through so much together: we launched a bold new chapter for Destiny, built an enviable, independent live ops organization capable of creating and publishing its own games, and joined the incredible family at Sony Interactive Entertainment,” Parsons writes.</p><p>Truman joined Bungie in 2010 and became chief development officer in 2022. He says the team is “currently heads down” on both <em>Marathon </em>and <em>Destiny</em>, adding that “we’ll have more to show you in both of these worlds later this year.”</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/763895/bungie-ceo-pete-parsons-steps-down-destiny#comments">4<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/763895/bungie-ceo-pete-parsons-steps-down-destiny]]></content:encoded>
