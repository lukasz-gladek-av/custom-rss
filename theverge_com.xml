            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/15/24344420/ubreakifix-repair-xbox-series-x-s<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft will soon let you get in-person repairs for Xbox Series X / S consoles at uBreakiFix stores, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/15/xbox-repair-reduce-waste-energy-saving/">the company announced today</a>.</p><p>Microsoft already offers in-person Xbox repairs at Microsoft retail stores, but uBreakiFix will be the “the first Xbox Authorized Service Provider,” according to the announcement. You’ll be able to get Xbox repairs at uBreakiFix’s “nearly 700 participating store locations across the US” starting January 20th, Microsoft says. (The company notes that you should check with your local uBreakiFix store to make sure they are participating in the Xbox repairability program.)</p><p>In the announcement, Microsoft says that it’s expanding its repairability program for the white Xbox Series S, the white Xbox Series X digital edition, and special edition Xbox Series X <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24247123/microsoft-xbox-series-x-2tb-galaxy-black-special-edition-preorder-buy-price-release-date">“Galaxy Black” model</a>. We’ve asked Microsoft if the black Xbox Series X with a disc drive and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/4/23858230/microsoft-xbox-series-s-black-1tb-storage-model-hands-on">black Xbox Series S</a> qualify for uBreakiFix repairs as well.</p><p>If you’re looking to repair your Xbox yourself, sourcing parts for that recently got a bit easier after iFixit started offering genuine Xbox parts and step-by-step repair guides <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314464/ifixit-now-sells-official-xbox-parts">in December</a>. iFixit offers parts and guides for repairing Surface devices, too.</p><p>In its announcement today, Microsoft also says that packaging for the white Xbox Series S, the white Xbox Series X digital edition, and Xbox Series X “Galaxy Black” model “are now fully paper and fiber-based, eliminating all single-use plastics.” </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
