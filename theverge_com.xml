The game was originally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682512/the-outer-worlds-2-will-start-at-79-99">supposed to debut at $79.99</a> in October, but it’s now going back to the regular $69.99 Xbox game price.</p><p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659430/microsoft-xbox-console-controller-game-price-increases-worldwide">announced earlier this year</a> that it would be raising the price of new Xbox first-party games from $69.99 to $79.99, alongside increases to its consoles and controllers. The move to suddenly drop the price of <em>The</em> <em>Outer Worlds 2</em> is a clear sign that preorders haven’t gone too well and that gamers are rejecting Microsoft’s initial move to $79.99 Xbox games.</p><p>If you’ve already purchased the game then refunds will be handled by the Microsoft Store, Steam, PlayStation store or wherever you preordered <em>The</em> <em>Outer Worlds 2</em>.</p><p>Other first-party Xbox games coming this holiday will also be sold at $69.99, instead of Microsoft’s new $79.99 pricing. “We’re focused on bringing players incredible worlds to explore, and will keep our full priced holiday releases, including The Outer Worlds 2, at $69.99 – in line with current market conditions,” says an unnamed Xbox spokesperson in a statement to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-u-turns-on-the-outer-worlds-2-80-price-point-reverting-to-70-and-reimbursing-pre-order-customers"><em>IGN</em></a>.</p><p>It will be interesting to see whether Microsoft continues to push its new Xbox game pricing in the new year, or whether this is a sign that it’s fully rethinking the increase to $79.99.</p><p><em><strong>Update, July 23rd</strong>: Article updated with Xbox statement.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/712371/the-outer-worlds-2-price-change-microsoft-xbox]]></content:encoded>

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>We already knew that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">Nintendo got off to a strong start with the Switch 2’s launch</a>, and now that the console has been out for a bit, we’re getting a clearer picture on exactly how it performed. According to market research firm Circana, Nintendo’s new console “debuted as the fastest selling video game hardware device in US history,” selling 1.6 million units in June. That topped the previous launch month record held by the PS4, which moved 1.1 million units in November of 2023.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Circana says that the Switch 2 was the best-selling console in the US in June overall, in terms of both units sold and dollars raked in. And overall the launch buoyed what the firm says is “a record high for hardware spending” in the month of June at $978 million. The previous record was $608 million in 2008.</p><p>As for games, it should come as no surprise that most Switch 2 owners also picked up a copy of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em>, which was the only major first-party exclusive for the console until <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></em> launched earlier this month. According to Circana, a whopping 82 percent of those who bought a Switch 2 also got a copy of <em>World</em>, either via a console bundle or buying a physical copy of the game. And in terms of accessories, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">the Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> had a 32 percent attach rate, according to the research firm.</p><div><p>Of course, the initial excitement around the Switch 2’s launch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/677301/the-switch-2s-promising-start-hides-an-uncertain-future">suggested it would get off to a strong start</a>. The challenge will be to keep that momentum going, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/708909/nintendo-switch-2-donkey-kong-bananza-exclusive-release-schedule">something Nintendo is attempting to do by pacing out its game releases</a>. While <em>World</em> and <em>Bananza</em> are out now, the rest of the year includes the likes of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/711445/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-bundle-trailer">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641602/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-masahiro-sakurai">Kirby Air Riders</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640231/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-2-enhanced-edition-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a></em>.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/712362/nintendo-switch-2-june-2025-sales]]></content:encoded>
