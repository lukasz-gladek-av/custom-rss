            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24345944/nintendo-switch-2-preview-event-how-to-register<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345091/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-event-schedule">taking the Switch 2 on tour</a>. With the console now revealed, the next question on everyone’s mind (outside of what games will be available at launch) is when will we be able to get our hands on it. While Nintendo hasn’t shared the release date for the console, it is offering the chance for the public to preview it before launch at a series of live events held across the world. Here’s what you need to know in order to demo the Switch 2.</p><p>The Switch 2 will be demoed in several cities across North America: New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Toronto. You can see the exact dates and locations <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fnintendo-switch-2-experience%2F">on Nintendo’s website here</a>. (There will also be events across Europe and Asia with registration for <a href="https://experience.nintendo.com/?_gl=1*1j9ey0o*_gcl_au*MTEyMjUzODAzOC4xNzMzMzI4MzA0*_ga*MTI3MjM4ODg2Ny4xNzI0NzY5NjE1*_ga_8CCMZ61YS8*MTczNzEzMzI2Mi4xLjAuMTczNzEzMzI2Mi4wLjAuMA..#/events/10447?lang=en-GB">London</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fjp%2Fevent%2Fexperience%2Findex.html">Tokyo</a> already live.) But getting the chance to play for yourself isn’t as simple as showing up and waiting in line. There’s a registration process to go through first and registering doesn’t guarantee you’ll get in.</p><p>First, anyone who wishes to attend must have a Nintendo account, including children aged seven years or older. If you don’t have an account, they’re free to make and young children can be registered under a Nintendo family account. Children younger than seven don’t need to register.</p><p>For families or folks who want to attend as a group of up to six people, all members must have a Nintendo account that’s linked to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fen-gb%2FSupport%2FNintendo-Switch%2FWhat-Is-a-Nintendo-Account-Family-Group-1468055.html%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopLwr000OYi6T0j1PEc0T6l1a4WVfRzCpmVYR51ky10T-2YVY-v">a Nintendo Family group</a> and everyone in the group must attend the same session.</p><p>Registration opens on Friday January 17th at 12PM PT / 3PM ET and closes on January 26th. Tickets are free but awarded by lottery, similar to what Nintendo does for admission to its museum. So once you’ve registered, you have to wait. There are multiple hour-long sessions for each day of the event but you can only register for one time slot. (Really, Nintendo?) Trying to sign-up for additional time slots will require you to cancel your previous registration.</p><p>The website doesn’t indicate exactly when folks will be notified if they’ve been selected, just that it should happen shortly after the registration window closes.</p><p>As with anything Nintendo, demand will be high so if you’re vying for a chance to see the Switch 2 early, good luck. You’ll need it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
