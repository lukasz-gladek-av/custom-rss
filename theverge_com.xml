            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/642869/genki-nintendo-switch-2-accessories-cases-shells-magnetic-battery<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>With every new portable console comes a mountain of new third-party accessories. We’ve already seen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642514/nintendo-switch-2-usb-c-camera-hori-piranha-plant-privacy">Hori’s Piranha Plant alternative</a> to the Switch 2’s USB-C camera, but Genki has announced a larger lineup of accessories designed to help protect the portable console while you’re playing away from home, plus some clever ways to keep it and its Joy-Con controllers charged.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/joy-station-pre-order">$49.99 Genki Joy-Station</a> looks like a sleek way to avoid the annoying juggling act of keeping more than two Joy-Cons charged, with some additional, well thought-out functionality. The Joy-Cons attach to two delta-shaped grips turning each pair into standalone controllers. Two Joy-Cons can be simultaneously charged using a USB-C cable while attached to the grips – useful for those times when you want to play and the Joy-Cons are nearly dead – but they also charge when the grips are reattached to the charging base.</p><p>Thanks in part to a larger screen, the Switch 2’s battery life is estimated to be between two and 6.5 hours per charge. You can extend that using <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/energy-pack-pre-order">Genki’s $69.99 Energy Pack</a> which is designed to conveniently magnetically attach to the back of the console and charge it at up to 30W speeds. The 10,000mAh Energy Pack is Qi2 compatible so you can also use it to wirelessly charge your phone, but the Switch 2 isn’t, so the battery instead connects to the console’s top USB-C port using a short included cable.</p><p>For gamers wanting added protection while they’re playing the Switch 2, <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/attack-vector-pre-order?variant=42025271623754">Genki’s Attack Vector is a $49.99 three-piece dock-compatible protective shell</a> that can be upgraded with a screen cover for an extra $10. Its most compelling feature is that it comes with three different sizes of sweat-resistant grips including a slim option designed for travel and a chunky option for maximum grip.</p><p>The $29.99 (or $39.99 with an optional screen cover) <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/force-field-2-pre-order?variant=42025278701642">Force Field 2 shell</a> is a cheaper alternative to the Attack Vector featuring a swing open design so you can detach and reattach the Switch 2’s Joy-Cons without having to fully remove it. It’s also dock-compatible, and allows for full use of the Switch 2’s folding stand.</p><p>If you’re simply looking for a way to keep the Switch 2 safe from dirt and scratches while it’s stuffed in a bag, <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/sleeper-case">Genki’s $42.99 Sleeper Case</a> features a hidden zipper and a soft wool finish inside and out wrapped around a sturdy shell the company describes as both “crushproof” and “virtually indestructible.”</p><p>Genki has also introduced a $19.99 Switch 2 screen protector called the <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/aegis-shield-pre-order">Aegis Shield</a>, and the <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/mimic-chest-pre-order">Mimic Chest</a>: a $19.99 plastic case sold in three-packs that each hold 12 game cartridges. All of the accessories are available for preorder now and expected to ship sometime in May or June 2025. If you want them all, <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/pre-order-genki-accessory-pack-for-switch-2?variant=42025332637770">Genki also sells the collection as a bundle</a> with either the Force Field 2 shell for $184.99 or the Attack Vector for $199.99.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/642868/nintendo-switch-2-price-console-games-accessories<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Just about everything with the Nintendo Switch 2 is more expensive than the original Switch. </p><p>It’s perhaps not unexpected that the console itself costs more money than the first Switch. That device launched more than eight years ago, after all. But following yesterday’s big Switch 2 Direct, there has been a lot of sticker shock as people have seen just how much Nintendo is charging for the console and its games, including multiple titles with a price tag of just under $80. (And some of those games are just improved versions of years-old Switch titles.)</p><p>Based on hands-on reports from my colleagues, the Switch 2 seems like another <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642420/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-preview">excellent device</a>, with upgrades like an improved <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642793/nintendo-switch-2-dlss-support-nvidia-ray-tracing">Nvidia processor</a> and a bigger screen with support for HDR and 120fps framerates. Nintendo games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642699/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-preview-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a> seem like they’re shaping up well, too.</p><p>But if you’re looking to buy a Switch 2 for yourself – pre-orders in the US start <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/24342715/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-price-release-date-availability-how-to-buy">on April 9th</a> – you’re going to have to pay up. (And, depending on the impact of President Trump’s newly-announced tariffs, the Switch 2 could cost <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642459/switch-2-price-donald-trump-tariffs-china-vietnam-cambodia">even more</a>.)</p><p>Here are some comparisons of console, accessory, and game costs between the Switch and Switch 2. </p><div><p id="console"><h4><strong>Console</strong></h4></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Switch:</span><ul><li><span>Switch Lite: $199</span></li><li><span>Switch: $299</span></li><li><span>Switch OLED: $349</span></li></ul></li><li><span>Switch 2:</span><ul><li><span>Switch 2: $449.99</span></li><li><span>Switch 2 + <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle: $499.99 (which is available for a limited time through fall 2025)</span></li></ul></li></ul></div><div><p id="games"><h4>Games</h4></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Switch (typically): $59.99</span></li><li><span>Switch 2: seems to be between $69.99 and $79.99</span><ul><li><span>Nintendo’s suggested retail price for <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is $69.99, while <em>Mario Kart World</em>’s is $79.99.</span></li><li><span>Wal-Mart lists <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Fswitch-2-hardware-and-software%2F0%2F0%3F_refineresult%3Dtrue%26_be_shelf_id%3D7433688%26search_sort%3D100%26facet%3Dshelf_id%253A7433688%26povid%3Dets_switch2_pov%26nrtv_cid%3Dq6408wp3nhonf%26clickid%3DQTFXQTy2wxyKT9I2Qh2KvSx-Uksyj3SByXfazY0%26irgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_QTFXQTy2wxyKT9I2Qh2KvSx-Uksyj3SByXfazY0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_376373%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383%26sharedid%3D" rel="sponsored">various prices</a> for Nintendo’s Switch 2 games, including:</span><ul><li><span><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em>: $69.00</span></li><li><span><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition:</em> $79.00</span></li><li><span><em>Kirby and The Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star Crossed World:</em> $79.00</span></li><li><span><em>Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</em>: $79.99</span></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div><div><p id="accessories"><h4>Accessories</h4></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Switch:</span><ul><li><span>Joy-Con: $79.99</span></li><li><span>Pro Controller: $69.99</span></li></ul></li><li><span>Switch 2:</span><ul><li><span>Joy-Con 2: $89.99</span></li><li><span>Pro Controller: $79.99</span></li><li><span>Camera: $49.99</span></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
