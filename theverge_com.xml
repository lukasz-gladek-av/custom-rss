            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/679367/fortnite-nintendo-switch-2-update-gamechat-mouse-controls<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/charles-pulliam-moore">Charles Pulliam-Moore</a> <span>is a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite/679077/epic-games-fortnite-creators-ai-npcs-darth-vader"><em>Fortnite</em></a> is coming to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/676901/nintendo-switch-2-launch-here">the Switch 2</a> with some massive visual improvements and new features that are going to make it feel like a new game for the Nintendo crowd.</p><p>While we knew that <em>Fortnite </em>would be playable on the Switch 2 at launch, today <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-comes-to-nintendo-switch-2">Epic announced</a> all of the new features that are being incorporated into the game via an update. After years of maxing out at 30 fps on the original Switch, <em>Fortnite </em>will now run at 60fps on the Switch 2. The game is also getting a resolution bump to 2176x1224 when docked and 1600x900 when undocked (up from 1560x880 docked / 1170x660 undocked). Draw distance, textures, shadows, and water rendering are also getting an overall quality boost that will make the game more crisp.</p><p>And on the newer side of things, <em>Fortnite </em>is also launching support for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">the Switch 2’s GameChat feature</a> as well as support for the console’s Joy-Con 2 mouse controls. While Epic has already pushed the <em>Fortnite </em>update for folks who have gotten their hands on the Switch, support for mouse controls — which work in Battle Royale, Zero Build, Team Rumble, Reload, and Fortnite OG — isn’t set to launch until June 7th. June 7th also just so happens to be the day when <em>Fortnite</em>’s ongoing <em>Star Wars</em>-themed season comes to an end with the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/death-star-sabotage-on-june-7-the-fortnite-live-event-concluding-galactic-battle">Death Star Sabotage live</a> event, which is probably going to look at lot better on the Switch 2 compared to its predecessor.</p><p>All of this might not seem too special to people who have been playing <em>Fortnite </em>on other consoles, but it truly cannot be stressed enough how <em>not great </em>the game has looked on the Switch in the past. Mouse controls aside, these updates might not change gameplay all that much, but they’re going to make squadding up a much, much more enjoyable experience.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
