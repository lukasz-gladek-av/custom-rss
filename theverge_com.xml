He joined in 2018, and served as commerce editor at Polygon until May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There are so many QD-OLED gaming monitors to choose from, depending on what size, resolution, refresh rate, and design you’re happy to commit to. It’s not easy to find a monitor that balances all those factors, but a big discount can shoot one toward the top of the list. <strong>Sony’s InZone M10S</strong> is a 27-inch 1440p QD-OLED with a whopping 480Hz refresh rate, and it’s 35 percent off right now at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9R7HCVG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, selling for $714.99 (originally $1,099.99). For those who are pursuing a minimalist setup, there might not be a better choice.</p><p>The M10S features a super-thin design and a versatile stand that takes up very little desk space. The circular stand is only about the size of a CD, on which the monitor can swivel. It looks <em>really </em>nice. When I <a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/469727/sony-inzone-m10s-oled-pc-ps5-gaming-monitor">reviewed this monitor</a> during my days at <em>Polygon</em>, I didn’t think its performance justified its original price, as Asus had a similarly speedy 480Hz model that sold for $999.99 (and still costs that much). It’s a different story now that the M10S is steeply discounted.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->715</span></p><div><p>Sure, 480Hz refresh rate might be overkill for your GPU (plus, consoles top out at 120Hz), but it’s nice to have extra headroom.</p></div></div><div><p id="some-other-great-deals-to-check-out"><h2>Some other great deals to check out</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Summer is here, more or less. It’s a time associated with outdoors and relaxing, but unfortunately it’s also when wildfire smoke is at its worst, depending on your location. In case you don’t have an air purifier in your home (and you think it may be something you’ll need based on past experiences), <strong>Levoit’s Core 300-P</strong> model is selling at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEVOIT-Purifier-Home-Allergies-Pets/dp/B07VVK39F7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> with a rare 10 percent discount, costing $89.99. This model uses replaceable HEPA filters and runs quietly as it cuts down on dust and odors (you can opt for a special filter that filters pet allergens, too). This particular model can cover up to 1,074 square feet.</span></li><li><span>We covered this deal last week, but it bears repeating: <strong>Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses</strong> are 20 percent off in select styles, costing as low as $239 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Ray-Ban-Wayfarer-Standard-Glasses/dp/B0CGXYM9TP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-8836602-17048919" rel="sponsored">Meta</a>, and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fbrands%2Fray-ban-meta%2Fpcmcat1631133787648.c" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>. They’re a solid value, especially if you want to go all in with Meta AI features to help you identify landmarks, get live translations, and more. Alternatively, they’re also one of the best options if you just want some stylish shades that can let you snap pics or video, and can pipe your music and phone calls near your ears. These prices will be in effect through June 16th.</span></li><li><span>Here are some deals for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/676901/nintendo-switch-2-launch-here">Switch 2</a> owners excited for the upgraded versions of <em><strong>Super Mario Party Jamboree</strong></em> and <em><strong>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</strong></em> and who don’t own the original Switch versions.

The upcoming live-action movie based on <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> has been delayed — though only by a few weeks. The film was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/638133/legend-of-zelda-movie-premiere-date-2027">previously slated to hit theaters on March 26th, 2027</a>, but <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1932075231885382103">Nintendo now says</a> that it will be out on May 7th instead.</p></div><p>There wasn’t an explicit reason given for the delay, but in a statement on X, <em>Super Mario</em> and <em>Zelda</em> creator Shigeru Miyamoto — who is serving as a producer on the movie — said that the move was made for “production reasons” and that “we will take the extra time to make the film as good as it can be.”</p><div><p>There still aren’t a lot of details about the movie itself, other than the fact that it will be live-action and directed by Wes Ball, who most recently helmed <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/10/24152293/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review">Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</a></em>. The movie is part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23608700/super-nintendo-world-entertainment-miyamoto-takahashi-interview">Nintendo’s larger goal of expanding beyond games</a> through ventures like feature films, which started with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review">the animated <em>Super Mario Bros.
