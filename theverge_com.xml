The streamer announced the news <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1861071895484879274">via social media</a> and <a href="https://corp.rumble.com/blog/dr-disrespect-will-lead-rumble-gaming-join-rumble-premium/">Rumble confirmed it in a press release</a>, stating that the streamer will provide a mix of free and paid content for the platform as well as “acting as an advisor and helping to build the Rumble Gaming community.”</p><p>The move to Rumble is the latest development in the Dr Disrespect streaming saga that began four years ago. In 2020, Dr Disrespect, whose real name is Herschel “Guy” Beahm, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304907/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-no-reason-given">was banned from Twitch with little explanation</a> mere months after signing a multi-million dollar exclusivity deal. Earlier this year, <em>The Verge</em> and other outlets broke the news that the reason for his ban was due to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">inappropriate conversations Beahm had with a minor</a>. Beahm <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185821/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation-inappropriate-messages">denied any wrongdoing</a> stating that there were no “real intentions” behind the messages. He then took a two-month break before returning to stream on YouTube. In response to the allegations, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/28/24188157/dr-disrespect-youtube-channel-demonetization-partner-program">YouTube suspended monetization on his channel</a> and his membership in YouTube’s partner program and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/10/26/youtube-rejects-dr-disrespects-application-to-re-monetize/">denied his appeal to re-monetize his channel</a> late last month.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305606/dr-disrespect-rumble-streaming-youtube-twitch">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MjMxNjI=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/28/24188157/dr-disrespect-youtube-channel-demonetization-partner-program">YouTube is stopping Dr Disrespect’s channel from making money</a></h2><div><p><cite>Photo by David Becker / Getty Images</cite></p></div><div><p>Dr Disrespect’s YouTube channel has been demonetized. In a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, YouTube spokesperson Nicole Bell wrote, “We have suspended monetization on DrDisrespect’s channel for violating our Creator Responsibility policy.” Bell also wrote that Dr Disrespect has been suspended from <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72851?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid">YouTube’s partner program</a> “following serious allegations against the creator.”</p><p>The allegations refer to multiple reports that the streamer, whose real name is Guy Beahm, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304907/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-no-reason-given">was banned from Twitch in 2020</a> due to inappropriate messages sent to a minor through Whispers, a Twitch communication app. When Beahm was banned, neither he nor Twitch explained the reason, leaving it a mystery for four years. Late last week, however, Cody Conners, a former Twitch employee, <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676">posted on X the alleged reason for Beahm’s ban</a>. “He got banned because got caught sexting a minor in the then existing Twitch whispers product,” Conners wrote. “He was trying to meet up with her at TwitchCon.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/28/24188157/dr-disrespect-youtube-channel-demonetization-partner-program">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>YouTube didn’t give Dr Disrespect a contract because of rumblings about his Twitch ban.</p><div><blockquote><p>YouTube’s former global head of gaming partnerships at Google, Ryan Wyatt, confirmed to <em>Rolling Stone </em>that Beahm was not offered a contract due to chatter about the circumstances of his Twitch ban.

The disappearance comes two days after Twitch said it would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303185/twitch-sexual-harassment-assault-permanent-bans-streamers">begin issuing permanent suspensions</a> for streamers as it cracked down on accusations of harassment and sexual misconduct.</p><p>Twitch would not confirm that it had banned Dr Disrespect, why he might have been banned, or whether he might be permanently banned.
