In addition to letting you customize your character and your combat skills, you can also do not-heroic things like build a house (or many) and romance and marry a villager (or many). Characters in the game will react to how you’ve treated them or your reputation — if you’ve evicted a villager from one of your houses, they might greet you with disdain.</p><p>There is a morality system, but it seems like it will be more nuanced than it was in the older trilogy. “We’ve chosen to anchor this around the actions you do, and specifically the things you do in Albion that are <em>witnessed</em> by at least one other person,” according to <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/fable-interview-overview-details-developer-direct-2026/">director Ralph Fulton</a>. It also seems like it could be pretty funny, and yes, you will be able to kick chickens.</p><p>This new <em>Fable</em> has been a long time coming. The first game in the series debuted in 2004, and Xbox and Playground Games announced this new title, referred to as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVkSZXPklQ4">“new beginning,”</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335535/fable-xbox-series-x-pc-windows-10-trailer-game-pass-rpg">during</a> Microsoft’s 2020 Xbox Games Showcase. While Microsoft did show new trailers for the game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEQRwpMYPaw">in 2023</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FiBmVBaY0g&amp;t=1s">2024</a>, it was delayed from its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619046/microsoft-xbox-fable-game-delay-2026">planned 2025 release</a> to this year.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/865305/fable-xbox-playground-games-developer-direct-2026-ps5-pc]]></content:encoded>
