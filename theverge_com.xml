While <em>New Horizons</em>’ next major update, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/809975/animal-crossing-new-horizons-is-getting-a-big-switch-2-upgrade-in-january">which brings the life sim game to version 3.0</a>, was originally slated to launch on January 15th, it’s now available to download.</p><p>To be clear, this is not the paid Switch 2 upgrade for the game, which adds features like 4K visuals, 12 player online sessions, and mouse controls using the Switch 2’s new Joy-Con controllers. That update is still expected to launch on the 15th.</p><p>Instead, what launched early is the more robust — and free — 3.0 update that adds a host of gameplay features across all versions of the game, many of which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/845242/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update-switch-2-edition-features">fans have been clamoring for</a> since <em>New Horizons</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch">launched back in 2020</a>. That includes quality-of-life tweaks like increased storage, the ability to craft multiple items at once, and an automated service for cleaning up parts of your island. You’ll also find a new hotel on your island, and there are added features for Switch Online subscribers as well, like the ability to play certain NES games.</p><div><p>Whether or not the update results in a long-term boost for <em>New Horizons</em> remains to be seen, but it does have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/814497/animal-crossing-new-horizons-acnh-2025-return">more than a few players excited to get back into the game</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/861725/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update-early-launch-nintendo-switch]]></content:encoded>

DLSS 4.5 includes Nvidia’s second-generation Super Resolution transformer model, designed to improve image quality and reduce the artifacting found in DLSS 4.</p><p>While DLSS 4.5 was available in the beta version of the Nvidia app earlier this month, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss-4-5-super-resolution-available-now/">today’s rollout</a> brings the latest model to all RTX owners.

Nvidia has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760488/nvidia-app-dlss-override-control-panel-features">gradually migrating</a> all of its Control Panel features into the Nvidia app over the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/22/24079529/nvidia-app-geforce-experience-control-panel-windows">past couple of years</a>, in order to merge its Control Panel and GeForce Experience into a single app.</p><p>You can get the latest Nvidia app by simply letting it automatically update today, or by manually downloading the update over at <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/software/nvidia-app/">Nvidia’s website</a>. You’ll also need Nvidia’s latest <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss-4-5-geforce-game-ready-driver/">Game Ready driver</a> to enable DLSS 4.5.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/861640/nvidia-dlss-4-5-app-update-available-download]]></content:encoded>
