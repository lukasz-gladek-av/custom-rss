            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Spotify may have popularized the Wrapped user recap trend, but more companies are jumping on that bandwagon every year. From rival music streaming providers like Apple, Amazon, YouTube, and Deezer, to completely unrelated services across tech, gaming, and other industries, a huge range of companies are using fun visuals, stats, and personalization features to show how you’ve been using their platforms over the last 12 months.</p><p>The annual recaps trend shows no sign of slowing down, prompting companies to introduce new features every year to keep things fresh. Spotify Wrapped 2025 has added an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837127/spotify-wrapped-party-2025-music-competition">interactive Wrapped Party feature</a> that makes a game out of comparing your listening habits against your friends, for example, while YouTube has launched a separate <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/836173/youtube-recap-videos-eoy-review-wrapped">Recap review for video insights</a>, alongside its usual Music Recap.</p><p>This is also the time of year when companies drop their “best of” rankings charts for the year, charting the most downloaded apps across Apple and Google’s app stores, the most streamed music, movies, and TV shows, and more.</p><p>We’re rounding up all the biggest or most intriguing recaps for 2025 below as they’re announced, so check back to see how the services you’re using will be breaking down your data this year.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODM3MTc3" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837177/google-photos-2025-recap-selfie-count">Google Photos Recap will tell you how many selfies you took this year</a></h2><div><p>Google has added some new features to its end-of-year Photos app throwback experience, including a selfie count, CapCut integration, and photo curation capabilities. The Google Photos Recap includes insights and graphics that summarize what users have been snapping over the year, and follows the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24314709/google-photos-2024-recap-memories-spotify-wrapped">updated presentation format</a> Google introduced in 2024, which looks like a closer riff on Spotify Wrapped to me.</p><p>The Recap is available starting today. It will appear in the Google Photos Memories carousel and then be pinned in the Collections tab throughout December.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837177/google-photos-2025-recap-selfie-count">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODM3MTI3" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837127/spotify-wrapped-party-2025-music-competition">Spotify Wrapped 2025 turns listening into a competition</a></h2><div><p>It’s time for year-end lists, annual roundups, and, of course, <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/wrapped/">Spotify Wrapped</a>. The usual suspects are here, like your most listened to song, your total time listened, and your favorite artist. You also get your 2025 Wrapped playlist, which now shows how many times you listened to each of your top 100 tracks this year. But, as usual, Spotify is also adding a ton of new stuff to its annual tradition, including <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-12-03/wrapped-party-how-to/">Wrapped Party</a>, which pits you against your friends to see who is the bigger (or weirder) music fan.</p><p>Wrapped Party is an interactive feature that you “play” with friends. Granted, there isn’t much to actually do, since it’s mostly about what you’ve already listened to. You can’t go back in time and listen to a more obscure song than your friends, or retroactively listen to more horror audiobooks. Still, turning listening to music into a competitive sport is definitely a new twist on the annual Wrapped tradition.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837127/spotify-wrapped-party-2025-music-competition">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODM2NjEz" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/836613/apple-music-replay-2025-listening-stats-launch">Apple Music Replay 2025 is back with new listening stats</a></h2><div><p>Apple Music is getting ahead of Spotify Wrapped with the <a href="https://www.threads.com/@davidemery/post/DRxBR1VDTu0?xmt=AQF06UFNVYaw1syrayifMOkRYb8ays6HhD6UMyKBmArueg">launch of its yearly recaps</a>. This year’s Apple Music Replay is available natively within the app and comes packed with even more listening stats, allowing you to review all the new artists you listened to, which ones you kept returning to, and who made a comeback in your playlist.</p><p>It also highlights your most-listened-to songs, how many artists you listened to, your favorite genres, and how much time you spent listening to music on the app. There’s a shareable highlight reel as well, which you can post to apps like Instagram and TikTok. Apple already offers monthly music recaps and the ability to review <em>all</em> your listening stats, but it’s always fun to see how your taste has evolved throughout the year.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/836613/apple-music-replay-2025-listening-stats-launch">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODM2MTcz" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/836173/youtube-recap-videos-eoy-review-wrapped">YouTube introduces its own version of Spotify Wrapped for videos</a></h2><div><p>YouTube is rolling out a new roundup experience that lets you quickly review your most notable video habits over the last year. The Recap feature “uniquely highlights interests, deep dives, and moments” based on your watch history, according to YouTube’s announcement, providing up to 12 cards that spotlight top channels, interests, and how your taste in videos has changed over time.</p><p>It appears similar to Spotify’s end-of-year Wrapped experience, which other services like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24311987/apple-music-2024-recap-available-app">Apple Music</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312045/from-spotify-wrapped-to-amazon-music-delivered">Amazon Music</a> have also riffed on in recent years. YouTube’s Recap feature will even assign users a “personality type” based on viewing habits, such as Adventurer, Skill Builder, and Creative Spirit — which seem comparable to Spotify’s listening personality types.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/836173/youtube-recap-videos-eoy-review-wrapped">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Amazon Music Delivered puts your top tunes on a festival poster.</p><p>The service is back <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/amazon-music-delivered-streaming-insights">with another yearly recap</a>, and this time, it will create a personalized festival poster based on your most-played artists, tracks, and genres, while displaying other insights. You can find your recap by opening the Amazon Music app, tapping Library, and selecting “2025 Delivered.”</p></div></li></ul></section></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/837280/spotify-wrapped-2025-recap-annual-best-of-data]]></content:encoded>
