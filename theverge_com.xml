Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>We just got through the Switch 2’s first holiday season, which means that Nintendo has slowly started to reveal what 2026 will look like for the console. And while we already know about a bunch of upcoming first-party titles — including the Pokémon spinoff <em>Pokopia</em>, <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em>, and <em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em> — today the company revealed a number of major games coming from third-party studios. And there are plenty of familiar faces.</p><div><p>Perhaps the biggest news was that Bethesda revealed a trio of titles coming to the Switch 2 as part of Xbox’s ongoing plan to be a multiplatform publisher. <em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</em> is launching on February 24th (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/873816/fallout-season-2-finale-review">perfect timing if you’re in a <em>Fallout</em> mood post-season 2</a>), <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314376/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-bethesda-machinegames-xbox">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a></em> launches on May 12th, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/654770/oblivion-remaster-hands-on-xbox-gamepass-bethesda">the recent remaster of <em>Oblivion</em></a> is coming at some point in 2026.</p></div><p>Other big names detailed during the Direct including <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24079544/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a></em>, the second game in the remake trilogy, which launches on June 3rd, and some previously-known titles from Capcom: <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> launches on the Switch 2 on February 27th (<em>Biohazard</em> and <em>Village</em> will be available the same day) while sci-fi shooter <em>Pragmata </em>is available on April 24th. You can also check out<em> Pragmata</em> now with a Switch 2 demo available today in the eShop. And the original <em>Hollow Knight</em> is getting a Switch 2 edition that will be available later today.</p><p>Other notable titles shown off today include:</p><div><ul><li><span><em>Valheim</em>, the hit survival game that’s out in early access on Xbox and PC, comes to the Switch sometime this year</span></li><li><span><em>Orbitals</em>, an impressive-looking co-op adventure game inspired by classic anime, will be out in the summer</span></li><li><span><em>Paranormasight: The Mermaid’s Curse</em>, the latest entry in the investigative detective series, is out on February 19th</span></li><li><span><em>Tokyo Scramble</em>, a survival horror game about evading dinosaur-like monsters (possibly ideal for <em>Dino Crisis</em> fans), hits the Switch 2 on February 11th</span></li><li><span><em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/840080/square-enix-hd2d-games-octopath-dragon-quest">the latest in Square Enix’s HD-2D line of RPGs</a>, is out on June 18th</span></li></ul></div><p>And for retro gaming fans, <em>Super Bomberman Collection</em>, which includes some titles never released outside of Japan, is out today, while Hamster’s Arcade Archives is expanding with the release of <em>Rave Racer</em> on February 26th, along with a new line called Consoles Archives that debuts with <em>Cool Boarders</em> and <em>Ninja Gaiden II</em> when it kicks off today.</p><p>It’s a hefty list, and it’s a good sign that the Switch 2, much like its predecessor, will still be home to major third-party games in addition to Nintendo’s offerings, even if many of them are arriving a little late.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/874282/nintendo-direct-february-2026-fallout-ff7]]></content:encoded>
