While there have been some attempts at shrinking console gaming down into something that will fit in your hands, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21441254/nintendo-ds-3ds-discontinued-eulogy">many of the best handheld experiences have been downright weird</a>. Think of the Nintendo DS with its dual screens that helped inspire memorable games about walking dogs, doing surgery, and, well, whatever is going on in <em>Electroplankton</em>. There’s something about the smaller scale of these games that often invites creativity from developers.</p><p>The Playdate, from first-time hardware maker Panic — best known for its Mac software and publishing games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/8/10922560/firewatch-review-ps4-pc"><em>Firewatch</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20868532/untitled-goose-game-review-nintendo-switch-pc-house-panic"><em>Untitled Goose Game</em></a> — takes this idea to the extreme. It’s a tiny yellow square, not much bigger than a credit card, with a black-and-white screen and a crank that juts out of its side. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587172/playdate-hands-on-preview">It looks like a Game Boy from a parallel world</a>. And, much like with the DS and its contemporaries, those limitations and distinct features have inspired a library of games unlike anything I’ve ever played: everything from a strategy game about cryptid photography and a turn-based samurai adventure to a role-playing game where all you do is manage inventory.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025390/playdate-handheld-portable-gaming-console-review">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjMyNDE4" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/632418/playdate-price-increase-panic-malaysia">The Playdate is about to get a price increase</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Don’t Panic, the Playdate now has a matching power adapter.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaydateConsole/comments/1h7z76e/new_accessory_us_standard_ac_adapter/">Reddit user discovered</a> that Panic has <a href="https://play.date/shop/ac-adapter/">quietly introduced a 10W AC adapter</a> that matches the Playdate handheld’s bright yellow aesthetic. It’s available now for $5 and works with the USB-C to USB-A cable that’s included with the Playdate, but I would have gladly paid more for a USB-C port and a matching yellow USB-C to USB-C cable.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Pinball’s coming to the Playdate.</p><p>Developer Amano has <a href="https://amano.games/devlog/making-a-pinball-game-for-the-playdate-part-02-the-physics">shared an update on how it’s creating the realistic physics</a> for its upcoming Playdate pinball game, <a href="https://play.date/games/devils-on-the-moon-pinball/"><em>Devils on the Moon</em></a>.

And now Panic has confirmed that a second season is coming at some point in 2025.</p><p>As for what will be included, we don’t have a lot to go on right now. Panic says that “details on price, the exact number of games, and the developers behind the games of season 2 will come in 2025.” But during a livestream today, the company said it would probably feature “about a dozen games” and will also include a “really cool surprise.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284707/playdate-season-2-release-date">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6OTk4OA==" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282637/panic-playdate-stereo-dock-bluetooth-speaker-pause-development-challenges">The Playdate Stereo Dock has been shelved</a></h2></li><li role="article"><div><div><p>Don’t Panic.</p><p>On October 31st at 1PM ET, Panic is holding its next showcase event for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025390/playdate-handheld-portable-gaming-console-review">the Playdate</a>.

I don’t blame them: every time I pull out my phone to mindlessly scroll, I know my time could be put to better use. But as the owner of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24121232/sony-playstation-vita-steam-deck-switch">many fine gadgets</a>, I also don’t really want another device in my life, so I was pretty excited to stumble upon a partial solution with a gadget I already have: the Playdate.</p><p>Yes, I’m talking about that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24121232/sony-playstation-vita-steam-deck-switch">little yellow Game Boy from Panic and Teenage Engineering</a>, the one with a crank jutting out of its side. Since the launch of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/7/23627413/playdate-catalog-store-launch-date-best-games">its on-device store</a>, Catalog, the handheld has become home to quite a range of experiences. I’ve been playing tiny <a href="https://play.date/games/mega-dystopia-micro-architect/">city builders</a> and <a href="https://play.date/games/under-the-castle/">dungeon crawlers</a> and <a href="https://play.date/games/touch-egg/">egg touchers</a>.

And one year later, the company says it has sold more than 150,000 games through the store. “We want to let everyone who enjoys games know that there is a vibrant game dev community making hundreds of inventive and thoughtful games for Playdate,” Arisa Sudangnoi, head of Playdate developer relations, said in a statement. The news comes exactly two years after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025390/playdate-handheld-portable-gaming-console-review">the handheld first launched</a>.</p><p>At the beginning of 2024, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/13/24071704/playdate-preorders-sales-new-countries">Panic revealed that it had sold 70,000 Playdate units</a>, and it now says that more than half of those users — 38,000 — have purchased a game through Catalog. For context, the Playdate launched with a “season” of 24 games from notable developers that came as part of the purchase price. Panic says that “about 32,000 of those users who have not bought a game are still working through the games included in Playdate Season One.” Some more numbers: there are currently 181 titles in the store, and so far, sales have grossed just over $544,000 (“after taxes, processing fees, and Panic’s 25% revenue share for distribution on Catalog,” the company says).</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24133103/playdate-catalog-game-sales">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><div><p>The case of the missing $400,000 worth of cute hand-cranked game consoles.</p><p>Did they “fall off a truck”?
