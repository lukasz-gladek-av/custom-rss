            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294698/nintendo-switch-black-friday-discounts-games-controllers-holiday-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Nintendo games rarely see big discounts, but the holiday shopping season always proves a good opportunity to save on some contemporary classics. After initially offering special <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/16/24246126/nintendo-switch-mario-kart-8-oled-bundle-nintendo-online">holiday bundles of its Switch consoles</a>, Nintendo has also announced <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fnintendo-announces-black-friday-offers-providing-even-more-ways-to-play-this-holiday-season%2F">a Black Friday sale on various games and controllers</a> set to begin November 24th and run through the 30th.</p></div><p>Major Nintendo titles like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, <em>Pikmin 4</em>, <em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em>, and more will be $20 off at retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart once the sale commences. Additionally, Switch accessories like Joy-Con controllers and Nintendo’s Pro Controller will also be $20 off, along with a slick <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> carrying case getting a $10 discount. </p><p>This is all likely to be the tip of the iceberg, as early Black Friday deals are already beginning and retailers will run sales on further games and hardware come the day-of. But while it’s common for retailers to be aggressive with the sale during Black Friday and Cyber Monday times, we don’t always see Nintendo extending as far-reaching of discounts. Since there’s a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">Switch successor</a> poised to drop in the new year, it’s quite possible Nintendo is a little more sales-heavy this season to help retailers clear as much stock as possible before it’s inevitably replaced by updated hardware and accessories.</p><p>While Nintendo recently came forward to clarify that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation">the next Switch will be backwards compatible</a> with original Switch games, we don’t yet know if that will include physical cartridge versions. I’m crossing my fingers that the next Switch will maintain a cartridge slot for all my physical games, but the tides have been shifting towards digital distribution for years. It’s just a matter of time until one of the big three console-makers release a new generation based solely around digital titles, and with the Switch successor looming Nintendo could continue the status quo for a bit longer or really upend things.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294720/sony-playstation-5-ps5-price-cut-holidays<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony is cutting the price of the “slim” PS5 digital edition by $70, making it more affordable for the holiday season. Typically, that PS5 model costs $449.99, but it will start at $379.99 through December 24th, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J40QG4CVaww">according to a new ad</a>. </p><p>This holiday deal brings the slim PS5 digital edition just under the original $399.99 price of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21436287/sony-ps5-digital-edition-price-release-date">launch version of the PS5 digital console</a>. The footnote at the end of the ad specifies that this price is only for the disc-free console, so it seems like the model with a disc drive already attached will still start at $499.99. But the holiday pricing also means that by buying a digital PS5 slim and one of Sony’s separate $79.99 PS5 disc drives, you can make your own PS5 with a disc drive and save about $40.</p><p>Another way to save money would be to opt for one of Sony’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/11/24241914/sony-refurbished-playstation-5-ps5-dualsense">refurbished PS5s</a>: a digital refurb costs $349.99 while a model with a disc drive costs $399.99. But those refurbished consoles also come in the original design for the PS5 that’s larger (and arguably) uglier than the slimmer model.</p><p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, Sony offers the $699.99 PS5 Pro. But that doesn’t come with a disc drive, and whether it’s worth the higher cost might depend on how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">far away you sit from the screen</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
