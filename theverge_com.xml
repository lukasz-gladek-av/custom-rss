            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>At $380, MSI’s 27-inch 1440p QD-OLED gaming monitor is one of the best purchases <em>Verge </em>readers who want an awesome gaming upgrade can make now. That’s how much it costs in an online-only deal at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.costco.com/p/-/msi-265-wqhd-qd-oled-240hz-amd-freesync-premium-pro-gaming-monitor/4000411993?langId=-1" rel="sponsored">Costco</a> for <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.costco.com/join-costco.html" rel="sponsored">membership holders</a> through December 1st. In case you’re curious as to what kind of OLED monitor you can get for just $380, so was I. So I got MSI to send over a review unit, which I’ve been using for over a week.</p><p>This monitor (model MAG271QPX E2) doesn’t really differ from several other similarly-sized models. It offers a fast 240Hz refresh rate, fantastic viewing angles compared to cheaper panel types, and colors that really pop. It’s not typically one I’d suggest most people buy at its usual <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-QD-OLED-27-inch-Response-Adjustable/dp/B0D68C1BVS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$599</a> sale price, but it becomes an extremely compelling value for $200 less.</p><p>MSI’s QD-OLED replaced an aging Acer 1440p IPS 144Hz monitor at my desk, and the difference was profound when I jumped into a game. I’ve been playing a lot of <em>Battlefield 6</em> lately, and the landscapes look more lived-in than they do with the limited, pale color gamut that my IPS can muster. The chaotic action looks a little more real, thanks to more vivid-looking explosions. Every little aspect of the interface is easier to parse, too, thanks to OLEDs unbeatable contrast ratio.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>I’m happy with how this monitor looks, especially for this doorbuster price.</em></figcaption></p></div><p><em>Ambrosia Sky</em> is another title I recently picked up that looks particularly stunning on this display. I wish I had started testing this around Halloween, when I was playing more scary games, because its deep black levels look fantastic in my home office — it’s got great contrast. If this is your first OLED gaming monitor and you haven’t yet experienced the difference between that and an inferior panel type, you’re in for a treat that keeps on giving.</p><p>I play a lot of games, but I type articles in Google Docs more often because of my job. OLEDs have a bad reputation for rendering text; various subpixel layout types introduce color-tinged aliasing that’s not present on IPS and other types of non-OLED panels. The evidence of this is irrefutable under close inspection, as this <a href="https://youtu.be/lrdllziZe5w?si=isDLVHCijYqUKk2a&amp;t=159">Monitors Unboxed hands-on video</a> proves. However, as the video mentions, you may not notice it. From the distance I sit from the monitor, it looks fine to me.</p><p>This monitor’s specs make it a particularly good deal compared to other non-OLED monitors at this price point. This model supports variable refresh rate between the range of 48Hz and 240Hz. While it only lists support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro adaptive sync, not Nvidia G-Sync, I’ve been happy with its performance in a range of games while connected to my Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti-powered PC. The panel itself is covered in an “anti-reflection” coating that appears semi-glossy, so it might catch reflections in a well-lit room. This monitor comes with a nice height-adjustable stand that allows for tilting, swiveling, and pivoting, but I just tossed it on my monitor arm thanks to its VESA mount.</p><p>MSI covers the monitor with a three-year warranty that includes panel burn-in, which is great. I’m also smitten with this model’s ports. It sports one DisplayPort 1.4a port, two HDMI 2.1 ports supporting up to 240Hz on PC (or up to 120Hz on consoles), plus one USB-C with DisplayPort video, which works great with my Steam Deck, and a headphone jack. That port allows 15W PD charging, but is turned off by default.</p><p>If there’s one complaint that I have, it’s that the plastic chassis on the back is a bit chunky compared to other models that I’ve tested. However, MSI says that this is where the monitor’s heatsink is located, which allows it to have a fanless design. And at $380, this complaint doesn’t hold much water.</p><p>If you aren’t a Costco member, it may be worth it to become one if only just for this deal. But if you don’t plan to become one, it’s possible that we’ll see deals at other retailers for this model. It sold for $449.99 at Amazon during the Prime Big Deal Days, so hopefully that price (or ideally, something better) will pop up during Black Friday.</p><p>While Best Buy only sells the MSI monitor through a third-party seller, the retailer currently has <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Falienware-aw2725d-27-qd-oled-qhd-280hz-0-03-ms-freesync-and-g-sync-gaming-monitor-with-hdr-hdmi-displayport-black%2FJ3K4L6RFPL%2Fsku%2F6640502" rel="sponsored">Alienware’s AW2725D</a>, the company’s 27-inch 280Hz 1440p QD-OLED, for $499.99 — a $50 price drop. LG’s 27-inch 1440p OLED with 240Hz refresh rate (which seems very similar to MSI’s) is $499.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DF786923/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. In other words, there are deals to be had just about anywhere. But right now, Costco’s is the one to beat on a QD-OLED gaming monitor.</p><p><em>Photography by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</em></p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/820451/msi-qd-oled-1440p-gaming-monitor-deal-sale-black-friday]]></content:encoded>
