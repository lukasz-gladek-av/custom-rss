He joined in 2018, and after a two-year stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There’s a sale happening at Woot that’s delivering Black Friday-esque deals on video games through March 5th. The <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/plus/video-games-for-all/" rel="sponsored">“Video Games for All” sale</a> includes discounts on physical games for most modern consoles, making it a great time to treat yourself (or a pal) to some titles that you’ve been waiting to see big price drops for. There are also deals on gaming accessories like totes, controllers, and more. Through February 27th at 11:58PM CT, you can score an additional 20 percent off products looped into this sale by entering the code <strong>LEVEL20 </strong>at checkout (it caps at $30 total off your order).</p><p>Everyone’s tastes are different, but some picks in this sale that especially vibe with me include <em><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/silent-hill-f-amazon-exclusive-day-one-edition/" rel="sponsored">Silent Hill F</a></em>, which is fun and very different beast from Bloober Team’s <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake (less item hunting, more countering enemy attacks). Of course, who can argue against the pure fun contained within the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/super-mario-galaxy-super-mario-galaxy-2z-3" rel="sponsored"><em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> double-pack</a> for Switch that includes the original title and its sequel? It’s always cliché to say that there’s something for everyone here, but I think it’s actually true this time.</p><div><p id="more-deals-and-discounts"><h2>More deals and discounts</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Sometimes, a rug or table can pull the room together. In the event that doesn’t work, <strong>Govee’s Pendant Light</strong> might just be the ticket. This height-adjustable smart light makes for a fun upgrade in your home, and it’s now selling at its lowest price yet at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Three-Layer-Compatible-2700K-6500K-Adjustable/dp/B0FHQ3JQ9C/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. Normally $149.99, it’s down to $109.98. The dimmable LED enclosure is shielded by a smokey, translucent shell, and it’s capable of displaying three different lighting configurations at once. In other words, you can create some interesting color combinations if the mood strikes, or simply use it as a regular light. It can go between 2700K and 6500K color temperatures, and it’s Matter-compatible so it ties in neatly with plenty of smart home ecosystems.</span></li><li><span>There is always a new set of wireless earbuds to consider. Companies launching in the $200 or so price range have their work cut out for them because there are already well-established leaders, but it’s another story for the sub-$50 models. Despite the low price, they can be mighty impressive. An example of that is the <strong>Skullcandy Dime 3 earbuds</strong>, which are just $19.88 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Skullcandy-Wireless-Earbuds-Microphone-Bluetooth/dp/B0CFCQVZS6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSKULLCANDY-DIME-XT-3-TRUE-WIRELESS-IN-EAR-SOFT%2F13825259413" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fskullcandy-dime-3-true-wireless-earbuds-black%2FJ3GTFHVJ9P%2Fsku%2F6580352%2F" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> (originally $34.99) in multiple color schemes. This price has been available for much of this month, but in case the right time to buy for you is now, these offer up to 20 hours of battery life thanks to their lanyard-equipped charging case. Other features include multipoint pairing, letting you tether to more than one device over Bluetooth simultaneously. The Dime 3 also offer built-in Tile tracking, which is possible through the Tile mobile app.</span></li><li><span>So much for the Super Bowl being when the biggest TV deals land. <strong>LG’s 48-inch C5 OLED TV</strong> is currently selling at its best-ever price at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DYQ41RHB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, costing $819.99 (this model was $999.99 at the beginning of this month). Currently, it’s just about $80 cheaper than the smaller 42-inch version, and almost $400 cheaper than the 55-inch version. The 48-inch version packs in all of the enhancements found in bigger, pricier sizes, including four HDMI 2.1 ports for gaming at up to 144Hz at 4K, plus Dolby Vision HDR.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/885334/woot-ps5-nintendo-switch-video-game-sale-lg-c5-oled-tv-deal]]></content:encoded>
