Deepen your relationships with the island residents and Pals through daily conversation and gift-giving, and you may discover unexpected, special stories unfolding.” You’ll also have to defend your farm from “some nasty Pals that come to wreak havoc.” <em>Palfarm</em> will support multiplayer so you can play with your friends, too.</p><p>Pocketpair hasn’t provided a release date or saying what platforms the game will come to yet. But <em>Palfarm</em> continues Pocketpair’s efforts to branch out from the main <em>Palworld</em> game, which include <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640147/palworld-pubg-dating-sims">a <em>Palworld</em> dating simulator</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350273/pocketpair-palworld-indie-publishing-label-surgent-studios">an indie publishing label</a>.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782945/palworld-palfarm-farming-spinoff#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/782945/palworld-palfarm-farming-spinoff]]></content:encoded>

The free-to-play 2D platformer, titled <em>BlockBlasters</em>, took <a href="https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1969793042531107300">more than $150,000</a> from victims, including $32,000 from a streamer raising funds for their cancer treatment.</p><p>In a post on X, malware tracker vx-underground revealed that bad actors targeted some streamers with a spearphishing campaign that attempted to lure victims into <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1970036781765800212">promoting the game</a> in exchange for compensation. “Unfortunately, the Steam game was actually a cryptodrainer masquerading as a legitimate video game,” vx-underground wrote in a post on X.</p><p>As noted by <em>Bleeping Computer</em>, <em>BlockBlasters</em> first appeared on Steam on July 30th, but the game quietly added a cryptodrainer on August 30th. It was published by developer Genesis Interactive and garnered more than 200 “very positive” reviews. The malicious title mostly flew under the radar until Latvian streamer Raivo Plavnieks (Rastaland.TV), who has stage 4 cancer, <a href="https://x.com/rastalandTV/status/1969629808788181258">said that they lost $32,000</a> after downloading <em>BlockBlasters</em> over the weekend.</p><p>Steam has removed a flurry of games that have infected Windows computers with malware, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/did-you-download-this-steam-game-sorry-its-windows-malware">including <em>PirateFi</em></a>, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/steam-pulls-game-demo-infecting-windows-with-info-stealing-malware/"><em>Sniper: Phantom’s Resolution</em></a>, and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.malwarebytes.com%2Fblog%2Fnews%2F2025%2F07%2Fsteam-games-abused-to-deliver-malware-once-again" rel="sponsored"><em>Chemia</em></a>. Steam removed <em>BlockBlasters</em> on September 21st. <em>The Verge</em> reached out to Valve with a request for comment, but didn’t immediately hear back.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782993/steam-blockblasters-crypto-scam-malware#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/782993/steam-blockblasters-crypto-scam-malware]]></content:encoded>

The 256GB model that normally sells for $399.99 is $319.20 through October 6th at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. I, for one, thank Valve for dropping this deal now instead of when the servers inevitably hiccup at the start of the game sale.</p><p>For anyone out there deciding between the Steam Deck LCD, the pricier OLED, and perhaps other handhelds, it’s tough to beat the value of this discounted model. The Deck will be four years old in February, but it’s still a contender when it comes to good, reliable performance in PC games, especially considering how power-efficient it is. Another perk: it runs SteamOS, not Windows 11.</p><p>Also, game compatibility across Steam is generally great (more and more developers are building games with the Steam Deck’s specs in mind ahead of launch), and Valve has patched the Steam Deck frequently throughout the years with new features. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review">It didn’t start out great</a>, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">it eventually got there</a>.</p><p>Sure, the $549 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> boasts some nice perks that some will be willing to pay extra for, like a bigger battery, a 90Hz refresh rate OLED, faster Wi-Fi 6E. But at just over $200 less, you’re getting a pretty similar gaming experience in the Steam Deck LCD.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->319</span></p><div><p>The Steam Deck is a portable handheld console you can use to play PC games.</p></div></div><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/782737/the-steam-deck-lcd-is-20-percent-off-through-october-6th#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/782737/the-steam-deck-lcd-is-20-percent-off-through-october-6th]]></content:encoded>
