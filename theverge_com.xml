            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289634/nyt-tech-guild-connections-strike-edition-custom-creator<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Striking <em>New York Times</em> tech workers have created a <a href="https://www.threads.net/@nytguildtech/post/DCCV4LruxBh">custom <em>Connections</em> puzzle</a> so fans can get their daily fix without crossing the digital picket line.</p><p>The <a href="https://connections.swellgarfo.com/game/-OB15lz2phb8ai9RwufV">“Strike Edition” puzzle</a> was made on a website that lets people create their own <em>Connections. </em>The workers, part of the New York Times Tech Guild, specifically asked <em>NYT</em> readers <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/474209/new-york-times-strike-wordle-connections">not to play <em>NYT</em> games</a> when the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24287600/new-york-times-tech-guild-strike-before-presidential-election">strike began on Monday</a>, so the custom puzzle<em> </em>offers a way to play while still respecting the Guild’s wishes.</p><p>“We have seen a groundswell of support from subscribers who have been proudly tweeting about purposely breaking their game streaks to support our strikers,” says Jen Sheehan, spokesperson for the NewsGuild&nbsp;of New York.</p><p>The Guild didn’t make the website themselves; the site was made by Anthony Salazar, a freelance web developer who operates a creative studio named <a href="https://swellgarfo.com/">Swellgarfo</a>. Salazar tells <em>The Verge </em>that he made the app after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/26/crosswords/new-game-connections.html"><em>Connections</em> launched</a> last summer. “My friends couldn’t get enough and began making their own grids, jankly texting group chats with 4x4 word squares,” he says. Programming the site took about two hours. He didn’t expect anyone besides his friends to use it, but the creator tool has now been used 7 million times.</p><p>“I wasn’t aware that the Tech Guild was using my app, but I’m honored,” Salazar says.</p><p>There are aspects of the website that it’s easy to imagine <em>The New York Times </em>could take issue with, though. In addition to custom puzzles, the site also has a recreation of the <a href="https://connections.swellgarfo.com/archive"><em>NYT Connections</em> archive</a> that’s available to play for free — offering a way to get around <em>NYT’s</em> own <em>Connections</em> archive that it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24260742/now-you-can-suffer-through-old-connections-puzzles">just launched</a> as a feature for paid subscribers.</p><p><em>The New York Times </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094234/ny-times-wordle-clones-files-dmca-copyright-takedowns-knockoffs">targeted <em>Wordle</em> clones by filing copyright takedown notices</a> earlier this year, including against at least one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240306172335/https://github.com/cwackerfuss/reactle">shared on GitHub</a> that was strikingly similar to the <em>NYT’s</em> version of the game. It’s not out of the realm of possibility that the publication would do something similar for this <em>Connections</em> site.</p><p>Salazar says he would “happily take down the archive” if asked. He also says that the site uses the <em>NYT’s</em> publicly available API to create the archive, so “there would be many easy ways to completely dismantle that part of my app without even talking to me.” However, Salazar says that he wouldn’t take down the puzzle creator because “there is no <em>NYT</em> intellectual property contained there.”</p><p>The Guild, whose members help build these games, ultimately sees it as a form of support. “What we posted today and will post throughout our strike are fun ways people can support us,” says Sheehan, the NewsGuild spokesperson. “Generally speaking, we hope that <em>The Times</em> is more focused on getting back to the bargaining table than coming for our games.”</p><p><em>The New York Times</em> didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289674/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-backward-compatibility<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Nintendo’s next console is going to have a kickass library of games to start. Last night, when there was absolutely <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289558/in-case-you-missed-it">nothing else of note happening in the world</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation">Nintendo announced that its still-unannounced Switch successor would be backward-compatible with existing Switch games</a>. The announcement is an early sign that Nintendo might be able to avoid the painful transition between consoles and better unify its growing ambitions.</p></div><p>Backward compatibility is not a guarantee of success. The Wii U could play most Wii games, and it still ended up being a failure. But it’s a feature that benefits both consumers and the industry at large. In Nintendo’s case, its inclusion was never a sure thing. While bestselling hardware like the Wii and DS were able to play games from their predecessors, Nintendo often started over from scratch with a new console generation — which meant that players did, too.</p><p>The library of games you had built up over the lifespan of the Nintendo 64 or SNES stayed with that console. This is what has allowed Nintendo to resell <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> across countless devices; if you want to play the classics on the newest console, you usually have no choice but to buy it again. Otherwise, you’re forced to keep a Wii U around in order to enjoy that copy of <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD</em>. It sucks for consumers and it sucks for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23850347/video-game-preservation">video game preservation</a>, given how quickly older titles can become inaccessible.</p><p>Backward compatibility for the Switch is especially notable given what an incredible library it has accumulated. In fact, while the Switch is Nintendo’s second-bestselling piece of hardware, it has sold more games than any other Nintendo platform. During <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106e.pdf">an investor presentation</a>, the company said that the Switch’s “cumulative software sales have reached 1.3061 billion units, setting a new record for a Nintendo gaming platform. More software has been played on Nintendo Switch than on any other Nintendo hardware.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></p></div><div><p>That’s not a surprise when you think about the games that have come out since 2017: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18128015/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em></a>, and a whole lot of <em>Pokémon</em>. Ironically, the Switch was helped in a way by its lack of backward compatibility; Nintendo was able to keep up a steady stream of releases by putting out a number of Wii U ports. The Switch’s bestselling game is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/1/23941695/mario-kart-8-deluxe-wave-6-dlc-tracks-release-date-characters">an enhanced version of <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em></a>.</p></div><p>The decision to support backward compatibility means that all of those games will immediately be available to anyone who picks up the next console. For existing Switch owners, it imbues their collection with more value; for newcomers, it means they have a huge library to dive into from the jump.</p><div><p>The decision also helps explain why <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24185022/nintendo-switch-2024-game-lineup-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Nintendo has barely slowed down with releases, even as the Switch approaches the end of its life</a>. The first-party games that came out in 2024 — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24287092/mario-and-luigi-brothership-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24112407/princess-peach-showtime-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Princess Peach: Showtime</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> — will likely have a lifespan well beyond the final years of the Switch. That’s also why there are still more big Switch games in the works, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282741/xenoblade-chronicles-x-nintendo-switch-release-date-march-2025"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em></a>. Nintendo is even making services that exist beyond a single console, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24288201/nintendo-music-streaming-hands-on-impressions">the just-launched Nintendo Music streaming app</a>.</p></div><p>Signs have been pointing to this kind of more unified Nintendo for some time. The company’s account system links together various services and games, and more than a decade ago, Nintendo merged its console and portable game development divisions so <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17478950/nintendo-switch-structure-success-shinya-takahashi-interview">that everyone was focused on the Switch</a>. It has created more cohesiveness across the company’s offerings, which has become increasingly important <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23608700/super-nintendo-world-entertainment-miyamoto-takahashi-interview">as Nintendo branches out in new directions</a>. This has led to at least one sensible decision that sets up the Switch’s successor for a strong start — now we wait to see what oddball decision will make the new console distinctly “Nintendo.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24289524/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review-pc-ps5-xbox<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>At one point in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271682/life-is-strange-double-exposure-preview"><em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em></a>’s third episode, Max Caulfield tried to discuss the well-being of a student named Reggie with Loretta, another student on campus. Loretta became somewhat bewildered, asking Max who exactly she was referring to. That was when Max realized, much to her chagrin, that she had gotten the two parallel realities of Loretta mixed up. Turns out, one Loretta has met Reggie, but the other hasn’t. (Don’t ask me which; I can’t remember offhand, either.)</p><p>This moment is emblematic of how rapidly <em>Double Exposure</em> flits between its two universes. There’s the “Living World,” in which her best friend Safi was alive, and the “Dead World” where she wasn’t. Several puzzles in the game follow this trajectory: to circumvent certain obstacles when investigating Safi’s death, Max would tear a massive rift into the other reality to gather information she would otherwise not be privy to or grab some useful object as if pulling off a magician’s hat trick before returning to the first.</p><p>While this gimmick is a nifty mechanic that adds a fascinating dimension to Max’s sleuthing,&nbsp;it can also get confusing and tedious, especially as events are spun off in wildly different directions. Even Max’s fastidious note-taking does little to assuage this frustration. Ultimately, while the power does offer a look into the otherwise unseen facets of Max’s life, it’s also troublesome as a mechanic, at times reducing interactions to fetch quests.</p><p><em>This piece contains spoilers about&nbsp;</em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure, <em>its finale, and the first </em>Life is Strange<em>.</em></p><p>This tedium is why, as Max shuttles back and forth between the two realities with the flourish of a seasoned illusionist, there’s a sense that her inner turmoil is only growing. Her interactions vary between realities, and so do the myriad events that take place, leaving ripples in the way her relationships develop between universes. For instance, Max is close friends with the school’s administrative assistant in one universe but merely acquaintances in another. It’s no wonder she often engages in moments of quietude and self-reflection, such as pondering her decision to bombard a friend with relentless questions or ruminating over the dirty laundry of a disgraced colleague.</p><p>Thus it’s no surprise that as Max starts using her powers more, <em>Double Exposure </em>picks up from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271682/life-is-strange-double-exposure-preview">the largely languid pace of the first two episodes</a>. The melodrama has significantly ramped up from episode two’s astonishing cliffhanger, with major twists hinted at and then audaciously delivered with a sleight of hand. While it’s easy for these to become contrived, and for <em>Double Exposure</em> to lose the emotional core of its tale — that is, the game’s smaller, more tender moments of affection — <em>Double Exposure</em> hardly falters, persisting without drowning in these bombastic reveals.&nbsp;</p><p>The good news is that Max is learning to live with her grief from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/28/9627302/life-is-strange-season-wrap-up">the first game</a>. Small yet crucial choices, such as retaliating against a self-absorbed colleague by interrupting his class, using her supernatural powers to unravel clues, and even choosing which love interest to kiss (or none at all), paint a portrait of Max’s identity. Then there’s the pivotal scenario in which Max is seemingly confronted with the prospect of making yet another impossible decision but realizing that she can simply choose not to choose at all. <em>Double Exposure</em> is also at its most confident narratively when it’s chronicling her growth, with the game deftly bringing together the grandiose plot twists and the quieter, more intimate scenes with incredible sentiment.</p><p>But the final episode is where <em>Double Exposure</em> seems to run out of space for such ruminations. Episode five is eventually reduced to a series of rooms, with Max simply jogging from one door to the next to rescue the cast from their ghastly predicament. Familiar artifacts from her past life in Arcadia Bay, like the steel chair used by her ex-professor Jefferson, resurface, creating the macabre quality of a strange lucid dream sequence. A massive bowling alley mascot leers menacingly at Max as she struggles to break out of her restraints again. Binders full of photographs — the centerpiece of Jefferson’s twisted portfolio — taunt Max into perusing them once more. It’s a throwback to Max’s meltdown in the final episode of the original <em>Life is Strange</em>, but it felt like such an obligatory nod that it was more repetitive than inventive.</p><p>More disappointing still is that, in its conclusion, <em>Double Exposure</em> has opted to clumsily reconstruct the series — one beloved for exploring the emotional depths of everyday life — into a sci-fi story featuring a cast of troubled superheroic teens. It fails to understand that these powers, like Daniel’s telekinetic abilities in <em>Life is Strange 2,</em> are merely a lens with which to examine the anxieties of life at a heightened level. Without a stronger emotional hook, this development feels like a ham-fisted attempt to expand <em>Life is Strange</em> into an endlessly repeatable formula, set in another cinematic universe. A bigger failure is how Max is being established as the face of this new direction, with the credits announcing that “Max Caulfield Will Return.” </p><p>Perhaps an ending where Max gets a reprieve from the slew of misfortunes that the world seems to enjoy hurling at her is too idealistic. After all, reality can be just as perverse for the rest of us. But the idea that <em>Life is Strange</em> will present Max’s powers as somehow extraordinary feels a bit discordant. This isn’t the conclusion that <em>Double Exposure</em> deserves.</p><p><small><em>All episodes of </em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure<em> are available now on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
