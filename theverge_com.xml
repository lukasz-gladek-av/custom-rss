Created by Australian developer Orbx that’s <a href="https://orbxdirect.com/">known for its flight sim add-ons</a>, the expansion lets you visit many locations from the films while the islands will be teeming with more than 10 different species of dinosaurs.</p><p>According to an <a href="https://orbxstudios.com/jwarchipelago/faqs/">FAQ on Orbx Studios’ website</a>, the <em>Jurassic World: Archipelago</em> expansion is an official collaboration with Universal Products &amp; Experiences and will be available sometime in late August or early September, 2025. It will initially launch for all versions of <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> on Xbox and PC, but is compatible with the entry-level Standard Edition which is also available through Xbox Game Pass. The studio says it’s also “working towards making compatible products for <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020</em> and <em>X-Plane 12</em>.”</p><p>The expansion lets you visit the five new islands — including Isla Nublar, Sorna, Matanceros, Peña, and Tacaño — as they were before the events of 2015’s <em>Jurassic World</em> “when the park is operational but not everything is under control.” You’ll be able to fly over Isla Nublar and see the park alive with activity, while the breeding facilities on Isla Sorna, as seen in <em>The Lost World: Jurassic Park,</em> remain abandoned and overgrown.</p><p><em>Jurassic World: Archipelago</em> includes new flying challenges like transporting VIPs between the islands and nearby Costa Rica and conducting guided tours. You can visit the facilities and theme park structures seen in the various films and land at recognizable airfields and helipads, all while dodging the local wildlife that includes brachiosaurus, stegosaurus, velociraptor, t.rex, and flying pteranodons.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/720070/orbx-universal-jurassic-world-park-dinosaurs-microsoft-flight-simulator-2-024]]></content:encoded>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>To better protect against cheaters, Activision <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-05">says that</a> <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> players on PC will need to use hardware with Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 and have Windows’ Secure Boot feature turned on when the game is available later this year.</p><p>Ahead of that, Activision is doing a “phased rollout” of the features alongside the launch of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>’s fifth season on Thursday. At least for this season, it won’t be “enforcing against or requiring the use of either setting.” EA has <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/articles/battlefield/battlefield-6/pc-requirements/">also said</a> that <em>Battlefield 6</em> PC players will need to have Secure Boot and TPM 2.0 enabled to play the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-open-beta">upcoming open beta</a>.</p><p>While anti-cheat systems and other security measures can go a long way toward blocking cheaters in games, the tools have come under scrutiny for potentially slowing down gamers’ systems or for requiring users to turn on features they don’t want to use. As Activision even admits in today’s blog post, sometimes, they still aren’t enough to fully block cheaters.</p><p>Activision argues that “these hardware-level protections are a key part of our anti-cheat efforts, and we’re asking all players to get compliant now.” The update “will let us test our implementation of both features and gives you time to enable these settings.”</p><p>Regarding performance, “TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot will not impact in-game quality,” Activision says. “These features perform checks during system and game startup but remain inactive while you play.”</p><p>Activision is also encouraging users to turn on two-factor authentication. While two-factor authentication isn’t required to play the game right now, it “may become a requirement for all users in the future.”</p><p><em><strong>Update, August 6th</strong>: </em>Battlefield 6’s<em> open beta will also require Secure Boot and TPM 2.0 to be turned on.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/720007/call-of-duty-pc-anti-cheat-secure-boot-windows-black-ops-7]]></content:encoded>
