            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Amazon is continuing to celebrate The Game Awards, which took place on December 11th, with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=120158211011&amp;pf_rd_p=cb919822-ef92-44d0-941a-1bcdb4d30dd7&amp;pf_rd_r=7PJJHZQP9THN1Q4JEA03&amp;ref_=GoG24&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">a big sale</a> on titles that were nominated in their respective categories. The deals include a discount that brings the PC version of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clair-Obscur-Expedition-Standard-Online/dp/B0FNGXKPK9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>, which ended up taking home nine awards (including game of the year), back down to its all-time low of $39.99 ($10 off). If you’ve somehow made it through your gaming backlog, don’t mind adding to it, or need a last-minute gift for your favorite gamer, it’s a good time to pick up some of the top titles of 2025.</p><p><strong><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></strong> is a turn-based RPG with an engaging battle system with plenty of tactical diversity, an atmospheric soundtrack that sets the right mood, and a story that our reviewer found heart-wrenching, stirring, and humorous. Battles feel dynamic thanks to a dodge and parry system that rewards you for launching a countermove. Getting a perfectly timed parry can turn the tide of your battle, but it may take you some time to learn how certain enemies move before you can learn the right timing. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/656405/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-xbox-ps5-pc">Read our review</a>.</p><p><strong><em>Silent Hill f</em></strong> is the latest entry in the long-running survival horror series set in 1960s Japan, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Silent-Hill-PlayStation-Amazon-Exclusive-Day/dp/B0F1C14LY8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">PS5 version</a> is on sale for $44.99 ($25 off) exclusively for Prime members. Its strengths lie in its beautiful visuals, intriguing location, deep story, and tense, melancholic atmosphere. There aren’t many jump scares, but you may feel a general sense of unease. The game’s protagonist, a high schooler named Hinako, grows more assertive as the game progresses, and she wrestles with both the enemies in front of her and an internal struggle between tradition and modernity. The game has five possible endings, which adds to its replayability. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/782012/silent-hill-f-review-ps5-xbox-steam">Read our review</a>.</p><p><strong><em>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</em> </strong>is the latest title from Kojima Productions, and you can snag the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Death-Stranding-2-Beach-PlayStation-5/dp/B0F19GPDW3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">PS5 game</a> for $49.97 (around $20 off). The game is a direct sequel to the original <em>Death Stranding</em>, and it follows protagonist Sam and his adopted child Lou as the former continues his quest to connect the world to an internet-like network.</p><p>The game’s landscape is bleak and empty, and you’ll have to contend with ghostlike creatures as you trek through the game’s world with weapons, traversal gear, healing items, and cargo. The missions, which range from rescuing a hostage to keeping your cargo above a certain temperature in harsh terrain, keep the game feeling interesting. The game’s story is easier to follow than its predecessor, though knowing the backstory can help a lot. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/690468/death-stranding-2-review-ps5">Read our review</a>.</p><p><strong><em>Split Fiction </em></strong>is a co-op adventure game that takes place in two different worlds simultaneously, and both the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Split-Fiction-Playstation-5-PS5/dp/B0F6423HHW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Split-Fiction-Playstation-5-PS5/dp/B0DQF6GRT8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">PS5</a> versions are on sale for $30 ($20 off). Protagonists Zoe and Mio are both trapped in a machine, but one is transported to a land of futuristic cities, while the other finds themselves in a fantasy land full of magical kingdoms. The characters get new powers in each section, but two players need to work in tandem to navigate through their respective connected worlds. Coordination is key, whether you’re outwitting a boss in a section reminiscent of two-player pinball or playing little minigames that take place in the middle of its narrative. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/623660/split-fiction-review-hazelight-studios-it-takes-two">Read our review</a>.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandt Ranj</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/843459/game-awards-playstation-nintendo-pc-games-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
