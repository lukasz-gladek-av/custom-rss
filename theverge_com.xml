Thankfully, if you were still planning on picking up the <em>Elden Ring</em> spin-off when it launches on May 30th, it’s already available for preorder with a $10 gift card at <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/0k2dsz12d775j">Best Buy</a> for $39.99 or from <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/elden-ring-nightreign" rel="sponsored">Fanatical</a> for $35.19 (about $5 off).</p><p>From what we’ve seen, and our own Ash Parrish <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/610585/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview">has experienced</a>, <em>Neightrein</em> isn’t so much a sequel to <em>Elden Ring </em>as it is a standalone co-op title set in a parallel universe. It’s got all the visual hallmarks of FromSoftware’s 2022 epic — sweeping vistas, haunting ruins, etc. etc. — along with the brutal boss battles and combat on display in both the original game and its excellent DLC, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc">Shadow of the Erdtree</a></em>.</p><p>The big difference between <em>Nightreign</em> and previous <em>ER </em>titles is that you’re forced to tackle the new region of Limveld over a three-day span, either solo or in a team of three. Then you throw in a few character classes, a leveling system, and a <em>Fortnite</em>-like storm that shrinks the map over time, making each run absolute chaos. If it seems like an amalgamation of multiplayer games, well, it kind of is.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->35</span></p><div><p>FromSoftware’s forthcoming co-op title, <em>Nightreign</em>, pairs the visual flair and challenging combat of <em>Elden Ring</em> with a host of multiplayer elements, resulting in an ever-changing take on a beloved title.</p></div></div><div><p id="more-ways-to-save-this-weekend"><h2>More ways to save this weekend</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/609704/best-presidents-day-sales-deals-2025-apple-gaming-tech">Presidents Day sales</a> are in full swing right now — including at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D1025X1701640%26xs%3D1%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.mill.com%252Ffood-recycler" rel="sponsored">Mill’s online storefront</a>, where you can grab the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/5/24091220/mill-smart-kitchen-trash-can-second-generation-price-specs"><strong>Mill Food Recycler</strong></a> for an all-time low of $874 ($125 off). The smart trash can is about as niche as the model <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23828379/mill-kitchen-trash-can-bin-review">we tested back in 2023</a>; however, if you’re the kind of person who’s been dying to turn your leftovers into commercial-grade chicken feed or compost for your garden, the second-gen model is far quicker than the original, allowing you to process your scraps in about two and a half hours.</span></li><li><span>You can get<strong> Yogasleep’s Dohm Sound Machine</strong> for $39.99 ($10 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Marpac-Original-Machine-Soothing-Cancelling/dp/B07NJSDBQ3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fyogasleep-dohm-for-baby-sound-machine%2F-%2FA-51030299%2F" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored" target="_blank">Target</a>, and <a href="https://prf.hn/click/camref:1011l7UqB/%5Bp_id:1011l394533%5D/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chewy.com%2Fyogasleep-dohm-natural-sound-machine%2Fdp%2F311498" rel="sponsored">Chewy</a>, which is its second-best price to date. The inexpensive white noise machine is a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21249132/kid-best-favorite-gadgets-tech-baby-infants-nest-cam-alexa-echo"><em>Verge</em> favorite for helping babies</a> (or yourself) get some rest, as it can mask the sound of traffic, pets, and other unwanted distractions.

Plus, it supports Dolby Atmos and Bluetooth 5.3, meaning you can now pair it with Xbox consoles, mobile devices, and PC.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/613495/while-waiting-review-switch-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Boredom is something of a dying concept. Our phones, filled with games and videos and social feeds, allow us to fill every moment with <em>something</em>, whether we’re on a long flight or in line for 30 seconds waiting for coffee. But the silly and playful <em>While Waiting</em> is a good reminder that that can be a good thing — an opportunity for our minds to wander in unexpected directions.</p><p>Possibly the best way to describe <em>While Waiting</em> is that it’s what would happen if <em>WarioWare</em> also tried to tell the story of a human life. Which means that it’s a collection of extremely short, often weird minigames that all fit together to follow the story of a singular character through moments of waiting. It starts right from the beginning: the first thing you’re asked to do is wait to be born.</p><p>From there, you jump through time via idle moments. You have to wait for the commercials to end while watching a show with your parents, or wait to fall asleep while lying in bed, or wait for the water to heat up to take a shower. In each instance, you can simply wait and do nothing, and eventually, time will pass and whatever you’re waiting for will happen. But this is a game, after all, so you can also mess about.</p><p>There are a handful of stickers to collect in each level that hint at what you can do. While you wait to get your grade on an exam, for instance, you can sneak around the classroom and spy on your friends’ grades. It plays out like a stealth game, as you have to avoid your teacher’s gaze, lest you be forced back to your desk.</p><p>The tricky part is figuring out what you’re able to do, and how to do it, in a very limited timeframe. And since almost every level is different, that challenge repeats itself over the 100 or so minigames. This is eased by the incredibly simple controls. You use one stick to move around and one button to interact with things. That’s it, aside from another button that does nothing but let you play with a fidget toy.</p><p>For the most part, the minigames are very silly. You have to make sure you remembered to pack underwear for a flight or push through crowds to get a better view of fireworks. One of my favorite stages involved making up constellations to impress a date. It’s all very charming and goofy, often using wonky physics to add some slapstick comedy. Some of the stages can be melancholy as well; one involves simply waiting to grow up.</p><p>But each one shows that, in those brief moments of idling around that we’re so eager to fill with distractions, something surprising can happen — if only you’re bored enough to pay attention.</p><p><sub>While Waiting <em>is available now on the Nintendo Switch and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
