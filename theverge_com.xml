Supercell’s mobile strategy games <em>Clash of Clans</em> and <em>Clash Royale</em>, two of the biggest, highest grossing games in the world, will serve as the foundation for <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netflix.com%2Ftudum%2Farticles%2Fclash-of-clans-series" rel="sponsored">a new animated series at Netflix</a>. </p><p>According to Netflix, the show’s premise features, “a determined but in-over-his-head barbarian who must rally a band of misfits to defend their village and navigate the comically absurd politics of war.” The streaming platform has selected Fletcher Moules, director of several official <em>Clash of Clan</em>s animated shorts, as the showrunner with Ron Weiner from <em>30 Rock</em> and <em>Silicon Valley</em> joining him as the show’s writer.Video game adaptations are all the rage in Hollywood lately, aided by the critical success of shows like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tv-reviews/644415/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-hbo"><em>The Last of Us</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126474/fallout-review-amazon-prime-video"><em>Fallout</em></a><em>.</em> Netflix itself has produced several successful adaptations including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24291592/arcane-season-2-review-netflix"><em>Arcane: A League of Legends</em> <em>Story</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23891310/netflix-castlevania-nocturne-review-konami-animated"><em>Castlevania</em></a> making for an interesting synergy with the company’s own gaming offerings. And while Netflix Games offers a robust selection of casual and traditional games to play for free via subscription, <em>Clash of Clans</em> itself is not one of them.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
