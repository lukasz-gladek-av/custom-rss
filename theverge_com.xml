He joined in 2018, and after a two-year stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The EasySMX S10 is a fantastic wireless controller for the Switch 2 that offers nearly as many features as Nintendo’s $90 gamepad. I ranked it as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/791574/best-switch-2-controllers">best Switch 2 controller</a> you can buy, thanks to its satisfying rumble sensation in games, support for motion controls as well as Nintendo’s amiibo NFC figures, plus the ability to remotely wake your console. Not to mention, it has durable TMR joysticks that are designed to last a lot longer than the hardware used by Nintendo in its controller.</p><p>I think it’s worth considering even at its original $59.99, but it’s considerably cheaper for the rest of the day at <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FM7Z4D7D/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>. You can get the black version for $41.99, and the blue and white version is $44.99.</p><p>I’d wager that most people aren’t willing to spend $89.99 on Nintendo’s Switch 2 Pro controller. Even for those who have the cash to splash, the S10 proves to be just as comfortable to use, even during long gaming sessions. Aside from lacking the Switch 2 Pro’s 3.5mm headphone jack that’s used for private listening, this controller is functionally identical. My biggest issue with the S10 is that the Screenshot, GameChat, and Home button placement is cramped, leading to some accidental presses. But at this price, it’s easier to overlook a small design flaw.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/876544/easysmx-s10-switch-2-wireless-controller-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

Discord states in the post that “age prediction” using information Discord already has will likely be sufficient for many users:</p><div><blockquote><p>We’ve seen some questions about our age assurance update and we want to share more clarity. We know how important these changes are to our community.</p><p>Here’s what we want you to know:</p><p>• Discord is not requiring everyone to complete a face scan or upload an ID to use Discord.</p><p>• The vast majority of people can continue using Discord exactly as they do today, without ever being asked to confirm their age.</p><p>You need to be an adult to access age-restricted experiences such as age-restricted servers and channels or to modify certain safety settings.</p></blockquote></div><p>However, in the case that Discord’s age inference model can’t accurately or concretely estimate a user’s age, they will still have to use a video selfie or ID to verify that they’re an adult. Users who aren’t verified as adults or determined to be under 18 will have a “teen-appropriate” experience with certain limitations, like being blocked from age-restricted servers.</p><p>Some platforms, such as Instagram, YouTube, OpenAI, and Anthropic, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/715343/youtube-age-estimation-ai-minor-account-restrictions">already use AI to “guess” the age</a> of users on their services as they inch their way <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/876131/discord-age-verification-mandates-web-future">toward implementing age verification</a>. Discord says it uses account information, device and activity data, and “high-level patterns” across the platform’s communities to estimate someone’s age.</p><p>Many users <a href="https://x.com/zachbussey/status/2021297270281384424?s=20">expressed frustration</a> <a href="https://x.com/DachyVille/status/2021157445889118209?s=20">with Discord</a> after the platform announced that it would start <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/875309/discord-age-verification-global-roll-out">imposing an age verification requirement</a> on users around the globe next month. While some claimed they’re going to leave the platform and cancel their Nitro subscriptions, others raised privacy concerns. Last year, a third-party vendor used by Discord <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/792032/discord-customer-service-data-breach-hack">experienced a data breach</a>, exposing user information and a “small number” of ID cards uploaded to the platform for age verification. Discord says it has since stopped using this vendor.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/876575/discord-age-verification-vast-majority-users-inference]]></content:encoded>
