The game utilizes procedural generation to alter some of the base game’s locales. So, don’t let familiarity get to your head to the point that you’re trying to take this adventure on alone (I’m talking to you, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/14/23025610/elden-ring-pc-let-me-solo-her-malenia-boss">let me solo her</a>); both its difficulty and tuning weren’t exactly made with solo players in mind.

Sure, it doesn’t have some of the new models’ most appealing features, like person detection, higher video resolution (1440p versus 1080p), or a wider field-of-view, but it’s still worth considering if you’re trying to save money. It uses two AA batteries instead of three in the new model.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/676805/elden-ring-nightreign-review-fromsoftware-elden-ring<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Imagine playing <em>Fortnite</em>, but instead of fighting other players, all you want to do is break into houses to look for caches of slurp juice. Yes, the storm is closing in on you, and there’s a bunch of enemies waiting to kill you, but all you want to do is take a walking tour of Tilted Towers. Then when the match is over, instead of queueing again, you start reading the in-game lore for Peely and Sabrina Carpenter. You can count your number of player kills on one hand meanwhile your number of deaths is in the hundreds. You’ve never achieved a victory royale, but you’ve never had more fun.</p><p><em>Nightreign</em> is FromSoftware’s first <em>Elden Ring</em> spinoff, and it’s unlike any <em>Souls</em> game that the developer has done before. <em>Nightreign</em> has the conceit of so many battle royale games — multiplayer combat focused on acquiring resources across a large map that slowly shrinks over time — wrapped in the narrative, visual aesthetics, and combat of <em>Elden Ring</em>. Instead of the Tarnished, you are a Nightfarer. Instead of the expansive Lands Between, you are sent to Limveld, an island with an ever-shifting landscape. And instead of becoming the Elden Lord, your goal is to defeat the Night Lord and end the destructive storm that scours the land.</p><p><sub>Elden Ring Nightreign<em> aura-farming exhibit A.</em></sub></p><p>In <em>Nightreign</em>, gameplay sessions are broken up into expeditions, each of which is divided into three day-night cycles. During the day, you — either solo or with two other players — explore the world looking for weapon upgrades and fighting bosses for the enhancements they reward. You’ll be forced to move as the deadly Night’s Tide slowly consumes the map, whittling your health to nothing if you’re caught in it. When the map is at its smallest, you face a tough midboss. Defeat it to commence day two of the expedition or die and start it all over. Then, on the third day, you face the expedition’s final boss. There are several expeditions to conquer each with different bosses, mid-bosses, weapons to collect, and all kinds of events that make each run unique.</p><p>I had the opportunity to play <em>Nightreign</em> once before earlier this year (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts">and during a more recent network test</a>) , and it wasn’t the best preview, as the game was plagued with all kinds of issues that didn’t allow me to experience it the way the developers intended. Those technical issues have been ironed out but I still haven’t completed the game’s most basic objective: beat the first expedition. This isn’t because of any technical or gameplay issues I had. For the times I wanted to play as intended, my colleague Jay Peters stepped in to help me and I had no problem finding party members to tackle expeditions with on my own… I just never really wanted to. And part of the reason why I’m enjoying <em>Nightreign</em> so much is because the game lets me play it in a way that’s completely counterintuitive – slowly and alone.</p><p>Collaborative gaming doesn’t always feel good to me. I want to take things at my own pace, and that’s hard to do when there’s a group of people frustrated with me because they need my help to kill a boss while I’m still delving into a dungeon a mile away. But the ability to solo queue does come with a significant catch – you’re not gonna get very far. I died <em>often </em>and to everything from random enemies to bosses. It’s not often that I even make it to that first boss fight without dying to the warm-up battles that precede it. This <em>should </em>frustrate me, but I don’t care in the slightest. I’m just so pleased that I can go at my own pace to explore more of <em>Elden Ring</em>’s visually gorgeous and narratively sumptuous world.</p><p>Which brings me to my favorite part: its characters. <em>Nightreign</em> has eight new classes, each with their own unique abilities. The classes can still use every weapon you find (with some locked behind level requirements) so there’s an option to tailor a character to fit your playstyle. There are certain kinds of classes I gravitate toward, specifically ranged combat, but for the first time in a class-based game, I love every one of them. It is so much fun shredding enemies to ribbons with the Duchess, using her Restage ability to replay the attacks done to an enemy essentially doubling the damage they receive. I love the Raider’s powers of just being a big fuckin’ dude, slamming things with big ass great weapons. And true to my ranged combat loving heart, Ironeye’s specialty with bows makes it so nice when I wanna kill things without putting myself in danger.</p><p>Then there’s the Guardian. Look at him. He’s a giant armored bird-person with the busted wing and the huge-ass halberd and shield. His story involves being a protector who failed his flock and has found a new one in the other Nightfarers. I fell to my knees reading one of his codex entries and seeing how the Recluse, the mage character, helped him with his damaged wing. Every character has a codex that updates with their personal story the more expeditions you attempt. This is the shit I get out of bed for. </p><p>I thought I was going to hate the concept of <em>Nightreign</em>. I want more E<em>lden Ring</em>: I love that world, so any chance I can have to go back, I’ll take but… I just don’t like multiplayer games. Describing <em>Nightreign</em> makes it sound like the reason why it exists is because an out of touch CEO looked at the popularity of <em>Elden Ring</em> and at all the money <em>Fortnite</em> prints and went “Yeah, let’s do that.” Even if that’s the case, <em>Nightreign</em> has been constructed so that it still appeals to lore freaks like me and I can ignore the less savory bits around multiplayer with relative ease. </p><p>If I can take a moment and borrow a pair of words from my Gen Z niblings to describe <em>Nightreign</em> it’d be “aura” and “aura farming.” Aura is used to describe a person’s general coolness or badassery while aura farming is the activities one can engage in to increase one’s aura. John Wick has aura. In the first movie, when he performs his monologue about getting back in the assassin business spitting and screaming – that’s aura farming.</p><p>And between the cooperative nature of the game, its rapid-paced combat, and the new characters, abilities, and story, <em>Elden Ring</em> Nightreign has a ton of aura that I’m having a lot of fun farming – just not in the way I expected.</p><p><sub><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> is out now on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In addition to adding support for the new console, the app includes new options for managing and limiting a child’s access to the Switch 2’s GameChat feature, and provides more details on what games they have been playing.</p><p>With parental control limits activated, “It’s only possible for players under 16 to use GameChat with friends who have been approved by their parent or guardian,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fmobile-apps%2Fparental-controls%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOooRiJLZdgZyK9geaRT8U-xRryWWd1C5eh_GeEgrZ7JmsTxUgf8k" rel="sponsored">according to a support page</a> on Nintendo’s website. Parents or guardians will also be able to add notes in the app for each of their child’s friends if they need a reminder about who those contacts are. The app will also provide a detailed history of who children use GameChat with and for how long.</p><p>Nintendo is being especially restrictive when it comes to kids using GameChat’s video capabilities and a camera. “Permission is required from a parent or guardian every time younger players want to use video chat to ensure family rules about use of video sharing are followed.” When a player under 16 starts a video chat, a request will be sent to the parental controls app that needs to be approved before the chat can begin.</p><p>Earlier this week, Nintendo also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/676287/nintendo-switch-2-mobile-app-screenshots-backup-upload">updated its Nintendo Switch App</a> ahead of the new console’s arrival with new features that make it much easier to upload screenshots and videos to a mobile device, as well as expanded functionality for the Switch 2 editions of <em>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
