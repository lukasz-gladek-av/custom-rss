As spotted <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/new-geforce-rtx-50-design-teased-by-nvidia-dual-front-fans-and-led-strip">by <em>VideoCardz</em></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyM_5r3ApEs">a video</a> for Nvidia’s upcoming LAN party includes brief look at a shadowy PC that will be given as a prize, and if you brighten up the image, the GPU in the computer appears to be one that’s a new design.</p><p>See for yourself — I’ve included an image of the shadowed version at the top of this post, but here’s our take at tweaking the image to reveal what’s hidden:</p><div><p><cite>Image: Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>I’ll admit I am not an expert in GPU designs, but <em>VideoCardz</em> says the design is “unfamiliar” and that an RTX 5080 or 5070 Ti could be “among possible candidates” of what’s being shown.</p><p>Leaks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/17/24323555/leak-nvidia-rtx-5090-5080-5070-ti-5070-neural-rendering">last month</a> from Zotac and Acer indicated that Nvidia may reveal as many as five RTX 50 series GPUs very soon, including an RTX 5090, an RTX 5080, and an 5070 Ti. <em>VideoCardz</em> also reported today on a leak of <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/msi-geforce-rtx-5080-gpu-has-been-leaked-16gb-gddr7-and-256-bit-confirmed">an RTX 5080 from MSI</a> featuring 16GB of GDDR7 memory.</p><p>And Nvidia isn’t being particularly secretive about the potentially imminent launch of the RTX 50-series GPUs.
