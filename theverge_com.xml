            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The new Horizon 20 lineup of 4K Google TV projectors from Xgimi targets gamers who want to play day and night on the biggest screen possible. In addition to promising an incredibly bright image from the flagship model, Xgimi is at IFA 2025 saying the entire lineup supports low-latency gaming with an input lag of just 1ms — that’s very responsive for a projector that will likely be able to produce a large image in rooms where you can’t control the ambient lighting.</p><p>The Horizon 20 lineup — compromised of the base Horizon 20 model, the 20 Pro, and 20 Max — is built around an RGB triple laser architecture. The flagship Horizon 20 Max projector can produce an astounding 5700 ISO lumens of brightness, according to Xgimi, which is “perfect for viewers who want immersive visuals even in daylight or high-ambient light environments.” That puts it just behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/767898/dangei-6200-lumen-projector-specs-date">Dangbei’s 6200 ISO lumen claim</a> for its S7 Ultra Max projector. The Horizon 20 Pro model can still produce a very respectable 4200 ISO lumens while the base model drops it down to 3100 ISO lumens, according to Xgimi.</p><p>Chinese projector makers have <a href="https://www.projectorcentral.com/xgimi-downgrades-lumens-following-epson-complaint.htm">gotten into trouble for misleading customers</a> on brightness in the past, but that was before they started measuring brightness in ISO lumens — a legitimate measurement that often yields a number slightly smaller than tests conducted using the ANSI standard. 5,700 ISO lumens is so high that it’s in the range associated with projectors meant for large spaces that cost well over $10,000. Nevertheless, Xgimi tells me that it’s confident that reviewers and users will see this performance reflected in practice.</p><p>Xgimi’s projectors also support Dolby Vision, HDR10+, and IMAX Enhanced modes, with the inclusion of optical zoom and lens shifting tech. Lens shift works by physically adjusting the position of the lens relative to the DMD chip, allowing the image to move up, down, left, or right without distorting or scaling it digitally.</p><p>These projectors support a 240Hz refresh and VRR to match the output of a gaming console or PC. However, that 1ms response is only at 1080/240fps — lag increases to 2.2ms at 1080p/120Hz or 3ms at 4K/60Hz. Xgimi also claims a 10,000:1 contrast ratio when a dynamic black level enhancement mode is turned on. Netflix works out of the box which isn’t guaranteed with all-in-one projectors, and you get 24W of built-in Harman Kardon Speakers for 360-degree sound.</p><p>The Horizon 20 lineup can be preordered in the UK and US starting on September 5th with shipments expected in October. Retail pricing will range between $1,699 for the base model and $2,999 for the Horizon 20 Max. However, temporary early bird pricing at launch drops that range down to $1,189 to $2,399, and you also get a floor stand and an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game code.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/766515/xgimi-bright-4k-projector-targets-daytime-gamers#comments">1<!-- --> <!-- -->Comment</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTEy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Thomas Ricker</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/766515/xgimi-bright-4k-projector-targets-daytime-gamers]]></content:encoded>
