            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Ubisoft is announcing <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf">a major reorganization</a>, and with the changes, it’s refocusing its portfolio and canceling some games, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/667061/ubisoft-prince-of-persia-remake-release-date-by-april-2026">beleaguered remake</a> of <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</em>. With the reorganization, Ubisoft will focus its efforts on big open worlds and live service games and is making “accelerated investments” in “player-facing Generative AI.”</p><p>In the new structure, which goes into effect in April, Ubisoft’s new operating model will “be structured around five Creative Houses,” supported by a “Creative Network providing development resources, shared Core Services and a reshaped HQ.” The brands under each Creative House, which include the studio announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/789721/ubisoft-vantage-studios-subsidiary-assassins-creed-far-cry">last year</a> dedicated to <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six</em>, will be focused on different genres:</p><div><blockquote><p>CH1 (Vantage Studios), focused on scaling and extending Ubisoft’s largest and established franchises to turn them into annual billionaire brands;</p><p>Brands: Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, Rainbow Six</p><p>CH2 dedicated to competitive and cooperative shooter experiences;</p><p>Brands including The Division, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell</p><p>CH3 designed to operate a roster of select, sharp Live experiences;</p><p>Brands including For Honor, The Crew, Riders Republic, Brawlhalla, Skull &amp; Bones</p><p>CH4 dedicated to immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes;</p><p>Brands including Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman, Prince of Persia, Beyond Good &amp; Evil</p><p>CH5 focused on reclaiming position in casual and family-friendly games.</p><p>Brands including Just Dance, Idle Miner Tycoon, Ketchapp, Hungry Shark, Invincible: Guarding the Globe, Uno, Hasbro</p></blockquote></div><p>Ubisoft is also developing four new franchises, including <em>March of Giants</em>, the MOBA Amazon <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/844729/amazon-offloads-a-moba-to-ubisoft-as-part-of-its-gaming-pivot">offloaded last year</a> after its own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/808332/amazon-gaming-layoffs-mmo-aaa-first-party-games">recent gaming reprioritization</a>. Ubisoft is revising its three-year roadmap and has canceled six games with the reorganization, including four unannounced games, three new franchises, a mobile game, and the <em>Sands of Time</em> remake.</p><p>“While the project had real potential, we weren’t able to reach the level of quality you deserve, and continuing would have required more time and investment than we could responsibly commit. And, we didn’t want to release something that fell short of what <em>The Sands of Time</em> represents,” according to <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/2014018590396105121/photo/1">the <em>Prince of Persia</em> X account</a>. “<em>Prince of Persia</em> as a universe and a legacy continues to matter deeply to us, and this decision does not mean we’re stepping away from the franchise.”</p><p>Seven games are being delayed as well, including one unannounced game being pushed from fiscal year 2026 to fiscal year 2027. Ubisoft will bring employees back to the office five days per week, with an “an annual allowance” of work-from-home days.</p><p>The company has closed its Halifax mobile studio, its Stockholm studio, and is restructuring its Abu Dhabi, RedLynx, and Massive studios.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/865060/ubisoft-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled-reorganization]]></content:encoded>
