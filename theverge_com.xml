            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After recently admitting that it had a “spectacularly terrible response” to Joy-Con grip detachment complaints with its Killswitch Nintendo Switch 2 case, Dbrand <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lwrl9q/joycon_detachment_update_part_3_we_fixed_it/">has some good news</a>: it says its redesigned Joy-Con grips fix the issue <em>and</em> the company will be able to mass produce them.</p><p>Dbrand had already promised it would be replacing the grips for everyone, and now we know that the replacement will be the redesign instead of a refined version of what’s already available. Here’s a video from Dbrand showing the Joy-Con not detaching while being held from the Joy-Con with the updated grips.</p><p>In addition to the modification to the Joy-Con grips — which Dbrand is calling Joy-Lock — the company says it will be sending out silicone friction pads to place on the Killswitch adapter for Nintendo’s dock to address “the issue of one-handed undocking on our Dock Adapter” and keep the adapter “snugly seated” on the dock.</p><p>By “early next week,” Dbrand says it will “share a production schedule that outlines when you’ll be able to claim your free Joy-Lock replacements, and when you can expect them to ship.” New production and any unshipped orders will include the Joy-Lock Grips and have the silicone friction pads preinstalled on the Dock Adapter.</p><p>In June, some users of the original Killswitch Switch 2 case found that if they held the console primarily by a Joy-Con while the case and grips were on, the controller <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lgav3g/i_love_my_killswitch_2_buttttttt/">would pop off</a> and the console would drop down. Probably not what you want to have happen to your brand-new Nintendo console.</p><p>Dbrand published a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/">lengthy post</a> about the issue where it argued that “nobody routinely holds their Switch 2 like this” and that Joy-Con detachment only happens if you hold the console in a very specific way. But many users compared that response to when Steve Jobs told people running into iPhone 4 reception issues to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/06/25/iphone.problems.response/index.html">“just avoid holding it that way.”</a></p><p>The company soon after published <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1ljlhwy/joycon_detachment_update_part_2_were_fixing_it/">a mea culpa post</a> where it said that “you should be allowed to hold it however the fuck you want, without detachment occurring” and outlined how it was working on two potential fixes: a slightly tweaked version of the original grip and the one with a bigger redesign.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/704767/dbrand-switch-2-killswitch-joy-con-lock-grip-detachment-fixed]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>We just got a good, long look at PlayStation’s next major exclusive. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/700657/i-aint-afraid-of-no-ghosts-of-yotei">As promised</a>, Sony held an event dedicated to <em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/654227/ghost-of-yotei-ps5-release-date-trailer">the PS5-exclusive samurai game from Sucker Punch that launches on October 2nd</a>. The stream was a deep dive exploring everything from combat to the world itself — and it’s looking like an impressive step up from its predecessor. You can watch the full presentation in the video above.</p><p>The story is inspired in part by the folklore creature known as an onryō, a sort of vengeful spirit which seems to fit the themes of the game pretty well. It is, after all, about a ronin named Atsu who spends the game hunting down the six outlaws who killed her family when she was young. As the hunt progresses, Atsu takes up the onryō moniker, and her legend grows over time.</p><p>Sucker Punch says that the open world is designed around player choice, letting you focus on specific gameplay elements — like exploration or combat — based on what you’re interested in. “<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> isn’t going to rush you through anything,“ the developers explain. Like its predecessor, the world also looks beautiful, with a lush landscape to explore; it’s set in Ezo (what’s now known as Hokkaido) in 1603. As for combat, the team says the goal is to create the feel of a ”classic samurai movie.“ Oh, and this time you get to partner up with a wolf.</p><p><em>Yōtei</em> will feature what looks like an expanded photo mode, and will once again include “Kurosawa mode,” which renders the game in black-and-white like a classic Akira Kurosawa movie. But Sucker Punch also partnered with other notable directors. There’s now a “Miike mode” (inspired by Takashi Miike) for more visceral, close-up, and bloody action, along with a lo-fi “Watanabe mode” with chill beats inspired by Shinichirō Watanabe.</p><p>Alongside details of the game, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/10/first-look-ps5-ghost-of-yotei-limited-edition-console-designs/">Sony also revealed</a> a special edition of the PS5 and some accessories that when it launches in October:</p><p><em>Yōtei</em> is a sequel to <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, which served as a swan song of sorts for the PS4 when it launched in 2020. Enhanced versions of the game eventually made their way to the PC and PS5, and it was successful enough that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350484/sony-ghost-of-tsushima-movie-film-director-john-wick-sucker-punch">the director of <em>John Wick</em> is attached to a film adaptation</a>.</p><p>The sequel is particularly notable because 2025 has been a relatively quiet year for major PS5 exclusives. Another sequel, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/690468/death-stranding-2-review-ps5">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a></em>, just launched last month, but there isn’t much else in the schedule aside from a remastered version of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18514683/days-gone-review-ps4-open-world-zombie-game">the biker zombie game <em>Days Gone</em></a>. Bungie’s revamp of <em>Marathon</em> was originally expected in September <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688479/bungie-marathon-delay-sony">but has since been delayed</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/704597/ghost-of-yotei-ps5-gameplay-trailer]]></content:encoded>
