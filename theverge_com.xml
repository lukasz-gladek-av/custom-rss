One of those changes is an option to have horrifying / awesome <em>double eyes</em>:</p><p>The character creator is getting an improved randomizer that has a “plain-to-punk” slider, too. “Whether you’re aiming for an understated, casual look or a bold, edgy style for your V, you can now use the slider to strike the perfect balance,” CD Projekt Red says.</p><p>CD Projekt Red has also expanded the ability to change a car’s paint job to cars to more of the in-game brands. And if you see a paint job you like on another car, you’ll be able to scan it so you can use it later. But perhaps the best car-related change with update 2.2 is that Johnny Silverhand (played by Keanu Reeves) will now sometimes show up in the passenger seat while you’re driving.</p><p>Update 2.2 also brings some changes to photo mode, including a free camera and the ability to add characters to your shot. </p><div><p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> launched four years ago today, and while it had an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197547/cyberpunk-2077-glitches">infamously rocky launch</a>, the game is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23881536/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-2-0">now in an excellent place</a>. It’s coming to Macs with Apple Silicon in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283651/cyberpunk-2077-launch-mac">early 2025</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/10/24317950/castlevania-nocturne-season-2-trailer-premiere-date-netflix<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>We’ve known for some time that the second season of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23891310/netflix-castlevania-nocturne-review-konami-animated"><em>Castlevania: Nocturne</em></a> was scheduled to hit Netflix <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/16/24246189/castlevania-nocturne-season-2-teaser-january-premiere">some time in the new year</a>, but we finally have a solid release date and a bloody new trailer to boot.</p><p>Though the sun is shining bright in <em>Nocturne</em>’s new trailer, the fact that vampire god queen Erzsebet Báthory (Franka Potente) is still out there plotting has Annette (Thuso Mbedu) convinced that all hope is lost. Annette’s feelings seem reasonable considering how Erzsebet’s right hand woman Drolta Tzuentes (Elarica Johnson) is back in action despite appearing to be killed by Alucard (James Callis) in <em>Nocturne</em>’s first season. But with Alucard now working with Richter Belmont (Edward Bluemel), Richter’s grandfather Juste (Iain Glen), and a hardened Maria Renard (Pixie Davies), the vampires won’t exactly have an easy time plunging the world into darkness.</p><p>The trailer features a handful of shots — Maria is <em>finally </em>going to summon <a href="https://castlevania.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon">her dragon</a> — that make <em>Nocturne</em>’s second season look like it’s trying to top the first in terms of utterly batshit action. And while the trailer doesn’t exactly spell out just what Erzsebet’s up to this time around, we won’t have to wait long to find out for ourselves because <em>Castlevania: Nocturne </em>is set to return on January 16th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
