            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24317923/xbox-game-pass-best-games-2024-microsoft-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Even if it wasn’t the strongest year for Xbox exclusive games (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301358/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-launch-day-issues">and some of those exclusives had their issues</a>), Game Pass was still an extremely good deal for console owners. Mostly, it’s the variety; the subscription service continues to offer a great mix of new blockbuster releases, along with smaller indie games and older titles to round out the package. This year had everything from <em>Call of Duty</em>’s big coming-out party on Game Pass to a stop-motion adventure game to an expansion to one of last year’s biggest RPGs.</p><p>Here are nine great games to check out if you’re a new subscriber or just looking for something new to play.</p><p><h3><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></h3></p><p>Now that Activision Blizzard is under the Microsoft umbrella, the publisher’s biggest franchise is part of Game Pass. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166053/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass">And <em>Black Ops 6</em> is the first new release to debut on the subscription service</a>. That includes all of the game’s various modes: the cinematic single-player campaign, and multiplayer outings like Zombies.&nbsp;</p><div><p><cite>Image: Bethesda Softworks</cite></p></div><p><h3><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></h3></p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126474/fallout-review-amazon-prime-video">Amazon’s live-action <em>Fallout</em> show</a> had seemingly everyone thinking about a return to the wasteland, and Game Pass is a great way to jump in since it has every game in the series from <em>Fallout 3</em> on. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/28/24141907/best-fallout-3-4-76-new-vegas-start">There’s a lot to choose from</a> — but I’d recommend <em>New Vegas</em>. Not only does Sin City offer up a great location for a <em>Fallout</em> game but it’s also going to be a big part of the upcoming second season of the show.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24131922/harold-halibut-review-ps5-xbox-steam"><em>Harold Halibut</em></a></h3></p><p>If you’re looking for something a little more laid back, <em>Harold Halibut</em> might be just the thing. A fairly traditional adventure game, <em>Harold Halibut</em> sets itself apart with a slow and steady pace, a fascinating sci-fi world, a dry but charming sense of humor, and stunning visuals featuring real stop-motion animation. It’s the kind of game where you really want to slow down anyways, to soak in all of the small details.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23724560/humanity-review-ps4-ps5-steam-vr"><em>Humanity</em></a></h3></p><p>One of the best puzzle games of the last few years is now on Game Pass. <em>Humanity</em> seems a little weird at first, as you control an ethereal Shiba Inu in order to guide mindless swaths of humans through increasingly complex mazes. But once you get accustomed to the way things work, <em>Humanity</em> offers up some of the most satisfying brain teasers you’re likely to find. Plus, the ghost dog sure is cute.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314376/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-bethesda-machinegames-xbox"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a></h3></p><p>Reception has been mixed on this one, but it’s definitely worth checking out. <em>The Great Circle</em> blends together elements of adventure games and immersive sims, with the whip-cracking style of Indiana Jones. That makes it something of an acquired taste, but if that just so happens to be <em>your</em> taste, well, the flavor is delicious.</p><p><h3><em>Nine Sols</em></h3></p><p>In a great year for roguelike action games, <em>Nine Sols</em> still manages to stand out thanks to combat that’s so good it completely makes up for an underwhelming story. It’s the kind of action that really rewards being patient and learning to parry, which makes it all the more satisfying when you win a bout. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/9/23717855/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed">the wait for <em>Silksong</em></a> continues to drag on, <em>Nine Sols</em> could be just the thing to fill in the gap.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/2/24058364/persona-3-reload-review-xbox-ps5-steam"><em>Persona 3 Reload</em></a></h3></p><p>If you’ve somehow finished <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona">the sprawling fantasy RPG <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a>, there are thankfully plenty of excellent older titles from developer Atlus to check out. And this year, <em>Persona 3</em> — which originally launched on the PS2 and helped usher the series into a new era of popularity — got an excellent remake that helps bring it in line with its more modern successors.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24161514/hellblade-2-review-xbox-pc"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em></a></h3></p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/9/16117978/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review-ps4-pc">The original <em>Hellblade</em></a> was as terrifying as it was uncomfortable — and that hasn’t changed with the sequel. Instead, the developers at Ninja Theory have expanded the scale, improved the action, and somehow made the horror elements even scarier. It’s also a rare short blockbuster game, something you can complete in around 10 hours.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24262053/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-review"><em>Starfield: Shattered Space</em></a></h3></p><p>The first major expansion for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23852390/starfield-review-xbox-pc"><em>Starfield</em></a> is a good excuse to jump back into this sci-fi universe. While I wish <em>Shattered Space</em> was a little weirder and leaned more into the cosmic horror side of things, it’s still unlike anything else in the main storyline. The expansion is also largely self-contained, so you can spend your time exploring one big planet instead of constantly jumping around the galaxy.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24325371/2024s-best-games-classic-genres-astro-bot-balatro-metaphor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>In 2024, we gamed like it was 1997. Games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2023/12/7/23992947/metaphor-refantazio-looks-sick"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24237166/astro-bots-roll-out"><em>Astro Bot</em></a>, and the solo-developed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame"><em>Balatro</em></a> remixed genres of console generations past (or, in <em>Balatro</em>’s case, remixed the very old game of poker itself) to critical and commercial success, while Capcom was one of the most successful companies of the year supported by a healthy mix of titles across different genres. With the industry’s biggest publishers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172733/summer-game-fest-video-game-announcements-layoffs-labor-live-service-fortnite">increasingly chasing massive, broadly appealing games meant to be played forever</a>, it was heartening to see old formats come back with some new tricks. And these successes could provide the blueprint needed to pull the video game industry out of its current tailspin.</p><p><em>Persona</em> developer Atlus has once again innovated on the turn-based RPG with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a>. What makes <em>Metaphor</em>’s combat interesting in a way that’s hard to replicate with traditional turn-based RPGs is that Atlus has built a unique ability system powered by anticipation and anxiety. Characters have access to powerful summons, each with their own abilities, along with strengths and weaknesses that enemies also share. Hitting an enemy’s weakness or having your own exploited results in monumental shifts in the momentum of battle. Every attack becomes consequential, as you don’t know what will work against your foes or what they have to work against you.</p><div><p>Atlus has built a unique ability system powered by anticipation and anxiety.</p></div><p>Despite dominating with games like <em>Final Fantasy</em> in the late ’80s and through the ’90s, turn-based RPGs have largely been left behind. (With <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24297436/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">the notable exception of the <em>Dragon Quest </em>series</a>, which consistently sells beaucoup copies in Japan.) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/23/23180709/final-fantasy-16-eikons-naoki-yoshida-interview">Modern tastes</a> have evolved to prefer the active, frenetic, and combo-dependent combat of the action RPG over the passive, implied action of turn-based games. But through the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23553499/persona-p3-p4-review-switch-ps4-xbox"><em>Persona</em> series</a>, and now with <em>Metaphor</em>, Atlus has proven it is uniquely equipped to make turn-based RPGs feel just as kinetic and engaging as their action-based cousins.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24256010/how-to-play-balatro-mobile-localthunk-playstack">The poker roguelike <em>Balatro</em></a> is perhaps the game that best represents the success that can be had by melding old genres with new features. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc">Roguelikes can be a difficult sell</a>, especially to players unfamiliar with the genre. To get them to stick, players not only have to be okay with the idea of failure as progression but also have to be invested enough in the game’s wider world to want to keep playing through it multiple times. For every <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159911/hades-best-game-2020-nintendo-switch-supergiant-pc"><em>Hades</em></a>, there are hundreds of games on digital storefronts that blur together into smears of generic fantasy dungeon crawlers.&nbsp;</p><div><p>[Balatro is] catnip for the players who can’t resist “number go up.” </p></div><p>One of the reasons<em> Balatro</em> became an instant success was because it didn’t have that hurdle. Poker is known all over the world and hasn’t really changed much in the centuries since its invention.<em> Balatro</em> took advantage of that familiarity and combined it with great humor and an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24085031/balatro-jokers-break-the-game">ingenious progression system</a> that made it catnip for the players who can’t resist “number go up.” More than that, <em>Balatro</em> feels more permissive than its roguelike cousins. The best runs in <em>Hades</em> are typically the result of lucking into specific boons or items, whereas <em>Balatro</em> is lousy with jokers, card modifiers, perks, and more that make scores get stupid fast. <em>Balatro</em> took home a slew of Game Awards, and it probably would have won Game of the Year if not for that one meddling robot.</p><p>Speaking of… perhaps the biggest example of 2024’s Return trend is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year"><em>Astro Bot</em></a>. Developed by Team Asobi, <em>Astro Bot</em> is a full-sized, standalone expansion of the PS5 pack-in game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549072/astros-playroom-ps5-review-dualsense-controller"><em>Astro’s Playroom</em></a> that takes the little robot’s adventures beyond the confines of the PS5 console and into the wider universe. At its core, though, <em>Astro Bot is </em>a mascot platformer reminiscent of the games from PlayStation’s earliest days like <em>Crash Bandicoot </em>and <em>Spyro the Dragon</em>. Indeed, <em>Astro Bot</em> pays homage to those very characters, featuring them as robots to rescue along with other characters from PlayStation’s 30-year history.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Astro Bot </em>is stuffed with so many items and secrets to collect. That kind of mechanic can get tedious in games suited to “modern” tastes like <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, as finding things feels no better than ticking off a box in the slow march to 100 percent completion. But each of Astro’s powers — like the dog jetpack or the shrinking mouse — inject whimsy into the act of collecting.&nbsp;And when I do find a secret, I’m rewarded with a little celebration of cheering bots that somehow never gets old.</p><p>Mascot platformers fell out of favor, especially with PlayStation studios, despite initial success. Naughty Dog and Sucker Punch have transitioned away from the lightheartedness of Crash Bandicoot and Sly Cooper to make “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035730/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-review-ps5">serious</a>” games for “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/21323144/ghost-of-tsushima-review-ps4-game-developer-samurai">mature</a>” audiences, and PlayStation’s recent catalog reflects that overall trend. <em>Astro Bot</em> is an outlier in form and tone and parlayed that uniqueness into a shower of accolades. It would be such a missed opportunity if Sony didn’t respond to that success with similar projects.</p><div><p>When I do find a secret, I’m rewarded with a little celebration of cheering bots that somehow never gets old.</p></div><p>Over the last two years, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163110/embracer-laid-off-more-employees-than-riot-games-entire-workforce">prolific layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">studio closures</a> have left tens of thousands of developers unemployed, in large part because companies <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/18/23311082/embracer-group-acquisition-lord-of-the-rings-hobbit-limited-run-games-tripwire">spent too much money</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized">on getting bigger</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">developing huge</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/02/10/skull-and-bones-is-a-70-game-because-its-quadruple-a-says-ubisoft/">expensive games</a> that may have made sense years ago but no longer do. Companies dumped hundreds of millions of dollars and considerable development resources into the next live-service shooter in hopes of replicating <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Call of Duty</em>’s runaway success and profits. But as those games continue to top the monthly video game spending charts, refreshed by a steady cadence of new content, the idea that a newcomer like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312584/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-refunds"><em>XDefiant</em> could compete at that same level</a> becomes increasingly remote. This leaves studios with an expensive product nobody wants to play, along with a pipeline of upcoming games too sparse to make up the difference.</p><p>But the way out of this precipitous (and avoidable) decline doesn’t necessarily mean giving up on the big multiplayer or open-world projects. Capcom, for example, has proven that “por qué no los dos” can be a winning strategy. The company has boasted record profits <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/capcom-hits-new-record-for-sales-and-profits-in-2023-2024-financials"><em>the last seven years</em></a> with a diverse catalog composed of heavy hitters like <em>Monster Hunter</em>, <em>Resident Evil</em> remakes, and <em>Street Fighter, </em>along with smaller, weirder games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23979909/dragons-dogma-2-release-date-trailer-capcom"><em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24202033/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-review-capcom"><em>Kunitsu-gami: Path of The Goddess</em></a>. Contrast that with Square Enix <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/square-enix-president-bemoans-weak-final-fantasy-sales-and-says-his-restructure-is-existential-our-winning-formula-is-no-longer-effective/">reporting less-than-expected profits</a> after it <a href="https://kotaku.com/foamstars-servers-ending-free-ps5-square-enix-concord-1851714395">failed</a><em> </em>to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/16/24040124/square-enix-foamstars-ai-art-midjourney">make<em> Foamstars</em> happen</a> on top of releasing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23767669/final-fantasy-xvi-review-ps5">three</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24079544/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5">different</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24030282/final-fantasy-14-new-class-pictomancer-ffxiv-fan-fest-tokyo">AAA <em>Final Fantasy </em>titles</a> in a 12-month period. Capcom has the right idea <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e241213.html">and is doubling down on it</a>, stating that it plans on “re-activating dormant IPs that haven’t had a new title launch recently” after revealing new entries in its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320133/okami-2-announce-game-awards"><em>Okami</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320142/onimusha-is-back-and-very-bloody"><em>Onimusha</em></a> series.</p><p>But more than just appealing to gamer nostalgia, these success stories — which also extend to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24153478/crow-country-review-steam-ps5-xbox">survival horror</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035933/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-ubisoft">Metroidvanias</a> — offer a healthier alternative to the trends the big publishers and studios are pursuing. (Nintendo, of course, is always exempt from these generalizations.) While there will always be an appetite for big online shooters or bespoke open-world games with hours of Hollywood-acted voice and motion performance, these breakout releases of 2024 prove (or should at least remind decision-makers) that there is so much worth to also be found in smaller, quirkier, and most importantly, cheaper projects. If the big publishers want to staunch the bleeding of the last two miserable years, they could take the lessons Capcom, <em>Balatro</em>, <em>Metaphor,</em> and <em>Astro Bot </em>provide.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
