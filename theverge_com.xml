Other first-gen Switch models are now more expensive, too, with the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fnintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-oled-model-white-set%2F" rel="sponsored">Switch OLED</a> going from $349.99 to $399.99, and the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-lite-turquoise%2F" rel="sponsored">Switch Lite</a> increasing from $199.99 to $229.99.</p><p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717325/nintendo-switch-price-hike-tariffs">said on Friday</a> that its decision to raise the price was “based on market conditions,” just after implementing a similar new set of prices in Canada on August 1st. The US announcement came just one day after President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717139/trump-announces-new-reciprocal-tariff-hikes">signed an executive order</a> that will impose new “reciprocal” tariffs on a range of countries. Trump’s growing list of tariffs now includes a 20 percent levy on products imported from Vietnam, where Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/technology/nintendo-switch-tariffs-trump.html">transferred most of its production</a>.</p><p>Nintendo also issued $10 price increases for <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-121311%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOoocoMpTG_IskyZJaZzSHx3M4t4rtSyyH_n9DbeDbTAniUK2pGpx" rel="sponsored">the Alarmo</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fjoy-con-set-l-r%2F" rel="sponsored">Switch 1 Joy-Cons</a>, which now cost $109.99 and $89.99, respectively. Prices aren’t changing for the Switch 2 console, as well as Switch and Switch 2 games, whether physical or digital.</p><div><p>With the price increase, the Switch OLED is now only slightly less expensive than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">the $449.99 Switch 2</a> (which doesn’t have an OLED display).
