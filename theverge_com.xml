The RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 will follow that with their own releases in February, but some are already getting a sneak peek at the GPUs’ software benefits through DLSS 4.</p><p>Tom Warren’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark"><em>Verge</em> review</a> of the $1,999 RTX 5090 indicates it’s expectedly a powerhouse, but not quite the generational leap that the RTX 4090 was over its own predecessor. That didn’t stop <em>The Verge</em>’s Sean Hollister from being impressed with the two-slot RTX 5090 Founders Edition GPU when he stuffed it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349976/nvidia-rtx-5090-fe-small-form-factor-sff-hands-on">into his aging small-form-factor PC</a>.</p><p>Along with the 50-series GPUs comes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation</a>, a software trick that may be just as big a story as the hardware itself. This latest version of DLSS uses AI to predictively generate frames, making it possible to run games at higher resolutions without taking the same framerate hit they would without DLSS 4 turned on. Gamers who are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350558/nvidia-dlss-4-frame-generation-cyberpunk-2077-transformer-graphics-update-patch">already trying DLSS 4 out</a> in <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>using RTX 40-series GPUs report seeing huge improvements already.</p><p>We’ll be keeping up with all the news about Nvidia’s RTX 50-series GPUs right here at <em>The Verge</em>.</p></section><div><div><h2>Highlights</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/25/24351798/nvidia-rtx-5090-5080-5070-gpu-news-rumors#dmcyOnBvc3Q6NTYyOTMx">I fit the world’s most powerful graphics card in my aging miniature SFF PC</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/25/24351798/nvidia-rtx-5090-5080-5070-gpu-news-rumors#dmcyOnBvc3Q6NTYyNDI2">Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 review: a new king of 4K is here</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/25/24351798/nvidia-rtx-5090-5080-5070-gpu-news-rumors#dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODk5">A first look at Nvidia’s flagship RTX 5090 compared to the RTX 4090</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/25/24351798/nvidia-rtx-5090-5080-5070-gpu-news-rumors#dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTk1Mg==">Can Nvidia’s RTX 5070 really deliver RTX 4090 performance for $549?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/25/24351798/nvidia-rtx-5090-5080-5070-gpu-news-rumors#dmcyOnBvc3Q6MzY2MA==">Nvidia announces next-gen RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 GPUs</a></li></ul></div><section id="updates-section"><ul><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NTgyMDAy" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350558/nvidia-dlss-4-frame-generation-cyberpunk-2077-transformer-graphics-update-patch">Gamers are already using Nvidia’s DLSS 4 tech in Cyberpunk 2077</a></h2><div><p>You may have to wait until January 30th to buy Nvidia’s new RTX 5090 graphics card, but owners of last-gen Nvidia 40-series GPUs can already download and install <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</a> software via the Nvidia app. And if you want a compatible, graphically-intense game to test DLSS 4 out, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s newly-launched <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51296/patch-2-21">patch 2.21</a> adds support for it.</p><p>Here’s the important info from CD Projekt Red’s changelog for patch 2.21 about DLSS 4:</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350558/nvidia-dlss-4-frame-generation-cyberpunk-2077-transformer-graphics-update-patch">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NTYyOTMx" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349976/nvidia-rtx-5090-fe-small-form-factor-sff-hands-on">RTX 5090: I fit the world’s most powerful graphics card in my aging mini SFF PC</a></h2><div><p><figcaption><em>The Nvidia RTX 5090 Founder’s Edition in an Ncase M1. </em></figcaption></p></div><div><p>In 2022, I wrote that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/16/23462949/nvidia-amd-rtx-4080-rdna-3-7900-xt-price-size">GPUs were headed in the wrong direction</a> — their price, size, and power consumption were off the charts. And while I still believe that’s true, I can now confirm Nvidia has at least made one phenomenal exception in the size category: the two-slot “Founder’s Edition” of its RTX 5090 graphics card, on sale January 30th.</p><p>The last time Nvidia made a two-slot flagship graphics card, it was the 2021 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22461660/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-specs-price-release-date-features">RTX 3080 Ti FE</a> — the 3090, 4080 and 4090 were gigantic by comparison.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349976/nvidia-rtx-5090-fe-small-form-factor-sff-hands-on">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NTYyNDI2" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 review: a new king of 4K is here</a></h2><div><p><cite>Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p>Nvidia’s RTX 4090 was a beast of a graphics card. It was a huge GPU that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23398201/nvidia-rtx-4090-review-test-benchmark">delivered true 4K gaming</a> for those who really wanted it and a huge jump in performance over the previous-generation RTX 3090. Naturally, the company’s latest top-of-the-line GPU, the GeForce RTX 5090, now has a lot of expectations riding on it when it arrives on January 30th.</p><p>But at $1,999, the RTX 5090 is steep — $400 more than the RTX 4090 Founders Edition at its launch. (It could run you even more in the form of a new power supply or higher electricity bills, especially if you want to run games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> in 4K.)</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NTYyODIz" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349781/nvidia-quad-slot-titan-ada-4090-gpu-cooler-prototype-real">Nvidia’s triple-fan GPU cooler was one step along the way to a slimmer RTX 5090</a></h2><div><p>Nvidia has posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDr1pr_c6ts">a new video</a> showcasing a history of Founders Edition graphics card designs that explores the design of its new RTX 5090 and confirms a previously leaked prototype that used an unconventionally large four-slot design.</p><p>As noted by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-finally-shows-off-its-quad-slot-triple-fan-rtx-40-titan-prototype-with-rotated-pcb"><em>VideoCardz</em></a>, the prototype “Titan ADA” card first revealed by leaker Kopite7kimi included a triple-fan cooling system, and earlier this month, Gamers Nexus <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyliMCnrANI">tested and tore down</a> a working version of the prototype.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349781/nvidia-quad-slot-titan-ada-4090-gpu-cooler-prototype-real">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>The RTX 5090 might be in short supply.</p><p>Nvidia’s upcoming RTX 5090 launch on January 30th might be met with limited stock, according to some system builders and retailers.

Just like our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24339760/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-photos">first look at the RTX 5090</a>, this isn’t a review. Performance figures, benchmarks, and impressions beyond the hardware are coming later.</p><p>The first thing that’s notable about the RTX 5090 is the packaging design has totally changed since the Founders Edition RTX 40-series. Nvidia has switched to housing the RTX 5090 inside a smaller bone-shaped gray cardboard shell that sits inside a much larger brown cardboard box.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24347693/nvidia-rtx-5090-vs-rtx-4090-design-fans-hardware">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTk0NA==" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24339760/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-photos">Up close with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 FE, an incredibly compact flagship video card</a></h2><div><p><cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p>We might be skeptical of some of Nvidia’s claims, like whether a $549 RTX 5070 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338999/nvidia-rtx-5070-vs-rtx4090-performance-price">will truly deliver the performance of a $1599 RTX 4090</a>. But it’s almost impossible not to be impressed by the RTX 5090 Founder’s Edition, where Nvidia fit 575 watts of graphics power, including 21,760 CUDA cores and 32GB of GDDR7 memory, into a video card just two slots wide.</p><p>It almost has to be seen to be believed, and we sent my colleague Antonio G. Di Benedetto around the CES show floor in Las Vegas in what was initially a fruitless search. No PC manufacturer seemed to have an interactive game demo running on a 5090, much less the two-slot card.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24339760/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-photos">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>We finally played with an RTX 5090.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister">Sean</a> has been scouring CES for an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337396/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-5070-ti-5070-price-release-date">RTX 5090</a> demo with an actually playable game.

It’s a claim that’s been echoed on YouTube, TikTok, and social media networks and has generated a debate over the RTX 50 series and DLSS 4’s Multi Frame Generation.</p><p>So, can a $549 RTX 5070 really deliver the same level of performance as a $1,599 RTX 4090?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tv-reviews/24350444/mythic-quest-season-4-review-apple-tv-plus<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Mythic Quest</em>’s ability to spin some of the gaming industry’s ugliest aspects into genuinely funny comedy was what made it such <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21128489/mythic-quest-ravens-banquet-review-apple-tv">a surprising delight when it first hit Apple TV Plus back in 2020</a>. Even when it was joking about chaotic streamers or Nazi server takeovers, you could feel the respect <em>Mythic Quest</em>’s creative team <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21177373/ashly-burch-interview-mythic-quest">has for video games as an art form</a>. And by keeping its focus on the lives of people who actually dream up and build games, the series put itself in a position to tell poignant stories about the costs that come with chasing one’s dreams.</p><p><em>Mythic Quest</em>’s new fourth season still gets in its fair share of solid digs at gaming culture. But the show feels like even more of a character-driven narrative that’s trying to show you how every member of the MQ crew is evolving as they move deeper into their careers. <em>Mythic Quest </em>has always had a knack for switching up its relationships and power dynamics just enough to keep its office drama element feeling fresh yet familiar. This time around, though, the shuffling is all in service of giving everyone at Mythic Quest HQ a new (but not necessarily healthier) work-life balance.</p><p>While an unhealthy amount of dysfunction has always been part of Ian Grimm’s (Rob McElhenney) creative process, <em>Mythic Quest</em>’s fourth season finds him trying to be a better colleague and friend to all of the people who have helped bring his ideas to life. It’s still a little hard for Ian to remember that Poppy Li’s (Charlotte Nicdao) return to Mythic Quest Studios with him hinged on his respecting her personal boundaries and acknowledging her as an equal in their professional relationship. Ian also can’t stand how much time Poppy wants to spend with her new artist boyfriend Storm (Chase Yi). But everyone working on Mythic Quest (the fictional game) can feel how, after years of blowing up at one another, Poppy and Ian are in a new headspace where they can genuinely appreciate how they make each other stronger. </p><p>With Mythic Quest gearing up to launch a new Playpen update giving players the ability to create their own in-game content, executive producer David Hornsby (David Brittlesbee) and monetization head Rachel Meyee (Ashly Burch) are all too happy to have Ian and Poppy onboard cooking up ideas to make the feature shine. As the creator of <em>Cozy Galaxy</em>, the most popular game on the Playpen platform, former-tester-turned-developer Dana Bryant (Imani Hakim) can’t help feeling ticked at the way she’s being cut out of all the revenue Mythic Quest is raking in. But to money shark Brad Bakshi (Danny Pudi) and cutthroat assistant Jo (Jessie Ennis), Dana’s feelings about working at Mythic Quest Studios are a sign that it’s time for them to reconsider whose team they want to play for.</p><p>Like previous seasons, <em>Mythic Quest</em>’s new episodes use the fictional in-show game to dunk on uglier aspects of the real-world gaming industry with a specificity that makes it feel like the writers room has been keeping up with the news. Playpen’s popularity is a financial boon to the Mythic Quest team because of how it presents an opportunity to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/18/24346862/genshin-impact-developer-20-million-fine-ftc-data-lootboxes">roll out more in-game currencies</a>. It also raises serious questions about whether platforms like Playpen are built with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/4/24121420/roblox-child-exploitation-robux-child-labor">the intention of capitalizing on child labor</a>.</p><p>Those questions become even thornier as players start coming up with ways to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-director-thinks-mods-breathe-l%5B%E2%80%A6%5Dus-request-to-please-not-give-cait-sith-a-dump-truck-ass">bring sex into their Playpen creations</a>. But even though this season of <em>Mythic Quest </em>gets its dunks in on the larger gaming industry, the show spends more time focusing on the growing pains that come when interpersonal relationships start to change for the better.</p><p>You can see it most clearly in Ian and Poppy’s arc this season as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339070/mythic-quest-season-4-trailer">the two turn to AI assistants</a> to help work through their complicated feelings about one another, but it’s also highlighted in some of the season’s episodes — one of which is an excellent <em>Clue </em>riff — that take you outside of the Mythic Quest office. We see more of what David gets up to in his free time and how the evolution of Dana and Rachel’s careers has brought new tensions into their romance. And with so many of his colleagues (who are really his only friends) pairing off, this season underscores how Ian’s prickliness with other people stems from the fact that he doesn’t have anyone to come home to.</p><p>Though digging deeper into everyone’s personal lives and easing up on the workplace shenanigans doesn’t quite move <em>Mythic Quest </em>into straight dramatic territory, it does make this season feel like you’re meant to appreciate how far these characters (and a few other surprise cameos) have come since we first met them. This season’s video game jokes aren’t <em>quite </em>as scathing as some viewers might like, but they reinforce how Mythic Quest (the game) has become something much more than another fantasy MMORPG for both its players and creators — just as Apple seems intent on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296445/mythic-quest-season-4-premiere-date-side-quest">growing the show in similar ways</a>.</p><p><em>Mythic Quest </em>also stars Naomi Ekperigin, Andrew Friedman, and Michael Naughton. Season 4 hits Apple TV Plus on January 29th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
