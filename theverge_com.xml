            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony’s next console (presumably the PS6) is coming in “a few years time,” according to someone who I’d believe to make that claim. Mark Cerny, lead architect on the PS5 and PS5 Pro, joined Jack Huynh, SVP and GM of AMD’s computing and graphics group, in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCMzw-_dMw">YouTube video</a> wherein the pair spend nine minutes going through some very specific, co-developed advancements in graphics technology that will come to the next console. But the pair cautioned that the technologies are still in “very early days” and “only exist in simulation right now.”</p><p>Much of it boils down to how the companies are working to make it easier for future GPUs to handle graphics upscaling, ray tracing, and the super-intensive path tracing techniques used to make game worlds look more realistic. Cerny says “the current approach has reached its limit,” so Sony is working with AMD to integrate components of its next-gen RDNA architecture in future consoles. AMD’s Huynh introduced Radiance Cores (similar in theory to Nvidia’s RT Cores) that are dedicated to handling ray tracing and path tracing. In addition to Sony’s new consoles having the new cores, they will almost certainly be built into AMD’s future desktop GPUs, too, and likely within whatever it’s assisting with in its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688407/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-cloud-amd">Xbox partnership</a>.</p><p>The Radiance Cores supposedly deliver a speed boost to performance, freeing up other components to quickly process shaders and textures instead of having to spin so many plates, so to speak. This new GPU tech will also benefit from advancements in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/671961/amd-fsr-redstone-rdna-4">AMD’s FSR Redstone</a>, its latest AI-assisted upscaling technology, such as Neural Radiance Caching, as well as likely whatever upscaling tech comes after.</p><p>Another key area of improvement is compression, which will free up more bandwidth for GPUs to run future games at peak performance and fidelity. Sony’s improving on the Delta Color Compression technique (used on the PS5 and PS5 Pro) that compress textures and render targets. Its next hardware will utilize the new, more efficient technique called Universal Compression that compresses <em>everything </em>in the pipeline. Huynh says this will let the GPU deliver “more detail, higher frame rates, and greater efficiency.” More compression could raise the performance ceiling of a GPU, so it should also let it run more efficiently in a low-power mode, should the need arise.</p><p>Speaking of, it’s easy to see how these improvements could benefit the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305337/sony-handheld-gaming-console-playstation-nintendo-microsoft">rumored PlayStation handheld</a> that’s allegedly in development. Sony and AMD’s work to reduce the stress on GPUs could theoretically be applied to any form factor, such as a handheld. Sony has already made strides in efficiency on the PS5, with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712212/sony-ps5-power-saver-handheld-rumors">new Power Saver mode</a> that can scale back game performance in favor of lower power consumption. In a nutshell, those are the key ingredients necessary to run games on a handheld.</p><p>It’s encouraging to see Sony being proactive about showing how it’s working to make the GPUs in its upcoming devices (be it the PS6 or a handheld) as capable as possible. For now, we’ll pretend that this news doesn’t cast a shadow over the aging PS5 and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">not-as-powerful-as-we’d-hoped PS5 Pro</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/797640/sony-ps6-handheld-gpu-ray-path-tracing-amd-radiance-cores]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-is-a-pivotal-moment-for-the-series-%E2%80%94-and-ea.1320973/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Battlefield 6</em> is one of EA’s most important launches in years. As the company becomes laser-focused on big, bankable franchises and looks to compete with the beast that is Activision’s <em>Call of Duty</em>, EA needs <em>Battlefield 6</em> to be a hit when it debuts on October 10th — especially after the previous game in the series had a rough release — and it’s putting an incredible amount of effort into making it successful. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/787112/electronic-arts-55-billion-privacte-acquisition-pif-silver-lake-affinity-partners">recently announced $55 billion deal to take EA private</a> has only upped the stakes.</p><p>“EA’s fate is tightly tied to <em>Battlefield</em>,” New York University games professor Joost van Dreunen tells <em>The Verge</em>. “If <em>Battlefield 6</em> underperforms, it will call into question the strength of EA’s non-sports portfolio. At that point, the company faces pressure to rethink its strategy, perhaps even to divest and lean more heavily on the dependable sports business. It makes <em>Battlefield</em> a bellwether that will tell us if EA can still compete in blockbuster shooters.”</p><p>The pressure for <em>Battlefield 6</em> started building almost immediately after <em>Battlefield 2042</em>’s disastrous 2021 debut. The multiplayer-only <em>2042</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22524753/battlefield-2042-release-date-trailer-ps4-ps5-xbox-pc">added huge, 128-player battles</a> to a franchise already known for epic multiplayer skirmishes. But the game had a rough, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/battlefield-2042-bugs-fixes-known-issues">bug-filled launch</a> that necessitated multiple patches <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-1">shortly</a> <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-2">after</a> <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-3?isLocalized=true">release</a>. EA <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814517/ea-battlefield-vince-zampella-apex-legends-respawn-boss-ceo-shakeup">moved quickly</a> to put Vince Zampella, cofounder of <em>Apex Legends</em>-maker Respawn Entertainment and former head of <em>Call of Duty</em> studio Infinity Ward, in charge of the <em>Battlefield</em> series to help right the ship. But the damage was already done. A few months after <em>2042</em> came out, EA CEO Andrew Wilson <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/1/22913193/ea-battlefield-2042-launch-expectations">put things bluntly</a> on an earnings call: “The launch of <em>Battlefield 2042</em> did not meet expectations.”</p><p>The <em>Battlefield</em> series kicked off with <em>Battlefield 1942</em> in 2002, and even that first game had a reputation for its big multiplayer battles. I have a memory of a hectic, shenanigans-filled match in an older <em>Battlefield</em> at a LAN cafe when I was a teenager. But the franchise has been steadily overtaken by Activision’s <em>Call of Duty</em> as <em>the</em> multiplayer shooter — especially because <em>COD</em> now has an enormous amount of resources behind it for annual releases and major <em>Warzone</em> updates.</p><p>Despite the rocky launch, EA has kept <em>2042</em> going, even releasing <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-9-2-0">a surprise update in August</a> that added new weapons, vehicles, and a map. But it’s been clear for a long time that EA has been focusing much more on the <em>future</em> of the <em>Battlefield</em> franchise. Activision has several dedicated studios focused on <em>Call of Duty</em> that lets it launch a new blockbuster game nearly every year. <em>Battlefield</em> has historically been developed by Dice, but EA roped in three additional studios — Criterion, Motive, and Ripple Effect — to create a new Battlefield Studios structure so that it can make a better push to compete. (EA reportedly wants to get <em>Battlefield</em> on a similar type of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/analyst-says-ea-plans-to-milk-battlefield-for-everything-its-worth-their-goal-is-three-studios-making-battlefield-on-a-3-year-basis-so-they-can-get-to-battlefield-annually/">annual release cadence as <em>Call of Duty</em></a>.)</p><p>Even though EA is also known for titles like <em>Mass Effect</em> and <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em>, most of its money comes from a small number of franchises, along with add-ons like microtransactions and battle passes. Live service revenue is already big money for EA; according to its most recent <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2026/q1/Q1-FY26-Earnings-Release-FINAL1.pdf">quarterly earnings report</a>, 83 percent of its net revenue came from “live services and other.” If <em>Battlefield 6</em> is successful over the long term, that potentially makes the game a big cash cow for EA.</p><div><p>Perhaps more than anything, if <em>Battlefield 6</em> is a success, it gives the company another annual game that’s almost a sure hit. EA found a way to keep its soccer franchise going even after it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/10/23065405/ea-sports-fc-fifa-branding">dropped the <em>FIFA</em> branding</a>. It brought back an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158294/ea-sports-brings-college-football-back-to-game-consoles-on-july-19th">annual college football game last year</a>, meaning it now has two American football titles it can release annually. The next-generation release in <em>The Sims</em> series, codenamed “Project Rene,” will be free and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870172/project-rene-next-gen-sims-free">won’t replace</a> the hugely successful <em>The Sims 4</em>, which just got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4s-adventure-awaits-expansion-is-exactly-the-kind-of-getaway-ive-been-looking-for">its 20th expansion</a>. EA even just launched a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/761186/ea-skate-free-to-play-early-access-release-date">live service version of <em>Skate</em></a>, and even though that’s still in early access, <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1975229570807890000">more than 15 million players have already tried it</a>.</p></div><p>Beyond overcoming the stigma of <em>2042’s</em> poor launch, <em>Battlefield 6</em> also has the uphill battle of competing with the many other enduring multiplayer shooters on the market like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, and <em>Valorant</em> (a lesson <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">Sony learned the hard way</a>). Those also all have the advantage of being free-to-play games, while EA has to convince people to shell out a minimum of $69.99 for <em>Battlefield 6</em>, something that’s especially challenging when a third of video game players buy a new game less often than once per year, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m27zezw2ek2v">according to Circana data</a>. It’s not an impossible hurdle — the annual <em>Call of Duty</em> releases <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/circana-confirms-black-ops-6-is-2024s-biggest-hit-but-overall-game-spend-in-the-us-falls-9-yoy">still do numbers</a> — but EA has its work cut out.</p><div><p>And this was all the case <em>before</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/787723/ea-private-deal-buyout-future-games-layoffs">EA announced a $55 billion deal to take the company private</a> — a deal that includes $20 billion of debt financing. Should the deal go through, that debt adds a lot of money that the new version of EA will have to pay down, and the company could lean on <em>Battlefield 6</em> — and the in-development <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-battle-royale-testing"><em>Battlefield</em> battle royale</a> as well as future <em>Battlefield</em> titles — to help. The deal could <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/787723/ea-private-deal-buyout-future-games-layoffs">also eventually mean</a> cost-cutting measures like layoffs, like what Microsoft did <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs">following its Activision Blizzard acquisition</a>.</p></div><p>From what I’ve played of <em>Battlefield 6</em>, I feel like EA’s efforts may have paid off. I’ve spent the most time with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lw4WBofOkLE">single-player campaign</a>, a gripping thriller where an unstable NATO has to fight back against a shadowy private military group called Pax Armata. So far, it’s filled with chaotic firefights where I almost always feel like I survive by the skin of my teeth. One memorable mission involved night vision goggles, rising tensions between the city’s citizens and Pax Armata, and, eventually, taking down a helicopter. Though, in a chilling moment that made me lose some appetite to keep playing, the in-game helicopter once flew by at the same time <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/06/us/oregon-national-guard-trump-ruling-portland-hnk">a real military helicopter flew over</a> my home in Portland.</p><p>I’ve only dabbled a bit in multiplayer, but the matches I’ve played have been frantic and exciting, and I really like playing with a lot of other soldiers around me. (Even if, because of the relatively small playerbase during the review period, I was usually playing mostly against bots.) I’m a poor shot, so when I would get frustrated dying over and over again, I’d focus on reviving my teammates. And while the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/pc-portal-experience">sandbox Portal mode</a> wasn’t available during the review period, I’m guessing players will create some wild, imaginative new experiences that could be worth coming back for.</p><p>Early signs look good for <em>Battlefield 6</em>, and it has all of the pieces in place for a successful launch. But <em>Battlefield 6</em> needs to be more than that — it needs to be a hit long after it first comes out. The future of EA depends on it.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/795232/ea-battlefield-6-hit-launch-deal]]></content:encoded>

First <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/rubiks-wowcube-announced/">announced earlier this year</a>, the Rubik’s WOWCube is a simpler 2x2 version of the puzzle that trades colored squares for 24 tiny color LCD displays. It still rotates like a traditional Rubik’s Cube, but instead of aligning colored squares those mechanics are used to play mobile games such as guiding a race car to the finish line by lining up track pieces scattered across its various screens.</p><p>Cubios debuted an earlier version of the WOWCube a few years ago, but in 2024 the <a href="https://wowcube.com/news/wowcube-teams-up-with-spin-master-owners-of-the-world-famous-rubik-s-cube-">company announced a collaboration with Spin Master</a>, which had acquired the Rubik’s brand in early 2021, for an officially licensed version of the device. It’s now <a href="https://wowcube.com/">finally available for preorder for a steep $299</a>, with shipping expected ahead of the holidays this year. Battery life is claimed to be up to five hours, and the WOWCube comes with a proprietary charger.</p><p>In addition to being able to rotate the 24 screens, the WOWCube features sensors allowing games to be played by tilting the entire cube, shaking, or tapping it. Through a mobile app you have access to the <a href="https://wowcube.com/store">WOWCube’s app store</a> which includes a mix of free and paid titles that are sent to the device wirelessly over Bluetooth. Cubios also offers an SDK for developers wanting to make their own apps or games.</p><p>The selection isn’t anywhere near as expansive as what you’ll find on Apple or Google’s app stores, but it includes versions of popular games like <em>Space Invaders, 2048,</em> and <em>Cut the Rope</em> that have been customized with unique gameplay for the WOWCube. There are also productivity apps like timers, screensavers that create tiny aquariums, and widgets that can display the weather, upcoming appointments, and even stock prices.</p><p>And yes, the WOWCube can even function like a traditional Rubik’s Cube. Should you fail to solve it on your own, instead of having to peel and reposition stickers to realign the colored squares, you can just reset it.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/797601/spin-master-rubiks-cube-wowcube-puzzle-app-store-mobile-games]]></content:encoded>
