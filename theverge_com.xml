An Emergency SOS request came in via satellite from an Apple device, according to the CHP’s incident log.</p><p>The Highway Patrol did not identify Zampella, but CHP officer Marissa Mcintire sent over a press release about the crash that says:</p><div><blockquote><p>Preliminary investigation indicated Vehicle #1 was traveling southbound on Angeles Crest Highway, approaching MPM 62.70, within the #1 lane. For unknown reasons, the vehicle veered off the roadway, struck a concrete barrier, and became fully engulfed. The passenger was ejected from the vehicle and the driver remained trapped. Both parties succumbed to their injuries.</p></blockquote></div><p>Zampella co-founded Respawn Entertainment, which EA acquired <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/ea-completes-acquisition-of-respawn">in 2017</a> and is known for series like <em>Titanfall</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, and <em>Star Wars Jedi</em>.

Before founding Respawn, Zampella helped co-create the <em>Call of Duty</em> series at Infinity Ward, where he served as Studio Head and CEO.</p><p>”This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince’s family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work,” EA spokesperson Justin Higgs says in a statement. “Vince’s influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching. A friend, colleague, leader and visionary creator, his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers around the world. His legacy will continue to shape how games are made and how players connect for generations to come.”</p><p>“Rest in peace Vince,” <a href="https://x.com/infinityward/status/2003224882688283000?s=46">Infinity Ward says</a>. “As one of the founders of Infinity Ward and Call of Duty, you will always have a special place in our history.
