            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/642024/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controllers-mouse-magnetic-attach-c-button<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In its April 2nd Direct event, Nintendo revealed a lot of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">Switch 2 details</a> we’ve been waiting for, including the console’s price ($449.99 in the US), its June 5th release date, and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641985/nintendo-switch-2-every-game-announced-direct">slew of new games</a> coming to it, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641537/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a><em>. </em>The video and details the company published after the event also helped create a more complete picture of what we should expect from the second-generation Joy-Cons that come with the system.</p><p>The new Joy-Cons look a lot like the old Joy-Cons but are about a half-inch longer and black, with color accents on the connection rails and under the analog sticks — blue on the left and a pinkish-red on the right. Nintendo says they’ll be more comfortable, too. They have the same general button layout as the originals, but with a new “C” button on the right Joy-Con that’s used for a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">Discord-like GameChat feature</a> that lets you talk to friends using a microphone embedded in the top of the Switch 2 and that includes screen sharing functionality and the ability to start streaming with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641352/nintendo-switch-2-camera-launch">Switch 2 camera accessory</a> Nintendo is selling separately.</p><p>As Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto describes in a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-2%2F" rel="sponsored">new “Ask the Developer” interview</a> published today, the Switch 2’s Joy-Cons have “larger and more durable” analog sticks “with smoother movement.” On its site, the company says that the Joy-Con 2s are quieter, too. Smoother and quieter makes sense if Nintendo is using Hall effect sensors this time around, as previously rumored. Kawamoto also points out that the L and R buttons curve further down the side for easy reach. </p><p>The Joy-Con 2s connect to the Switch 2 magnetically, something Kawamoto says the company originally wanted to do with the first Switch. The Joy-Cons have larger SL and SR buttons that are made of metal, while the magnets themselves are embedded in the console. Disconnecting them involves pressing a release button on the back. In its Direct today, Nintendo claims they “won’t easily detach” on their own, but we’ll see about that when the system launches this summer. </p><p>Another big new feature of the Switch 2 Joy-Cons is that they can work like a mouse with select games. When they’re detached, you hold them, connection rail down, on a surface like a coffee table. Kawamoto said the feature will be used in games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640231/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-2-enhanced-edition-beyond"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a><em>, </em>for aiming (gyro control is still an option, too, according to a footnote on the page), and the thoroughly named <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</em>.</p><p>Comparing it to the Wii Remote’s cursor, Switch 2 director Takuhiro Dohta, who is also featured in the interview, says the company sees the mouse functionality of the new Joy-Cons as a way to let the Switch 2’s touchscreen capabilities transition to playing in docked mode. The Joy-Cons come with wrist straps, which Nintendo says gives them a wider base for “smoother gliding and better stability.”</p><p>Kawamoto said the new Joy-Con rumble feature, now called HD Rumble 2, is updated “to allow for a wider variety of vibrations.” They’ll also be stronger, he said, and have “quicker response times.” According to Nintendo’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ftech-specs%2F%23joycon2" rel="sponsored">official specs</a>, the controllers will last about 20 hours between charges and recharge in about 3.5 hours, same as the original Joy-Cons. </p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Faccessories%2F" rel="sponsored">As for accessories</a>, apart from the included wrist straps, Nintendo has also announced a $19.99 set of two wheels you can attach the Joy-Con 2s to for games like <em>Mario Kart World</em>. The company will sell a $34.99 charging grip, and the console comes with a standard non-charging grip as well. </p><p>Nintendo did away with the IR sensor found on the right-hand first-generation Joy-Con, which I will miss for no reason other than that I love when gadgets have IR sensors. In every other way, the updated Joy-Cons sound like an improvement over their predecessors, with intriguing new features and Nintendo’s promise of better comfort and improved rumble. Now, we just have to wait to see if Nintendo managed to solve the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained">stick drift problem</a> of the first Joy-Cons.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/641966/nintendo-eshop-smooth-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/umar-shakir">Umar Shakir</a> <span>is a news writer fond of the electric vehicle lifestyle and things that plug in via USB-C. He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you’ve dreaded entering the eShop for most of the original Switch’s life because of how slow it is, well, Nintendo knows and won’t make that mistake again. The Switch 2 will have a faster-performing eShop channel “even when displaying a large number of games,” Takuhiro Dohta, Nintendo’s senior director for entertainment planning and development, said in an <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Ask the Developer</em> interview</a>.</p><p>Dohta said the Switch 2’s eShop speed improvements are “thanks to the system’s performance capabilities,” which, of course, is a significant jump from the original system’s aging software that increasingly struggled in both menu and games over the years. “We believe the act of finding the game you want to play is itself part of the game system experience,” Dohta said.</p><p>Additionally, the eShop will have a new “Game Finds for You” feature that, as explained by producer for entertainment planning and development Kouichi Kawamoto, will let you “quickly see screenshots and watch introduction videos” for various games so you don’t have to “search every nook and cranny” of the store.</p><p>Nintendo has the chance to nail the next generation of the digital games experience if it can make the eShop more intuitive and easier to navigate. Add on the Virtual Game Card feature that lets you share your digital games locally with others for a limited time, and things feel even better. Whether <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer#:~:text=collar%2Dtugging%20$79.99%20price%20tag">the $79.99 price tag</a> for some digital first-party games is worth it will be up to you.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
