Old-heads like me may recall it as a bad mid-90s cyberpunk film (written by William Gibson!) about a data courier whose brain is the storage medium, but who had to have his childhood memories erased to make space for the work. </p><p>I hadn’t seen it since I was a kid, and you know what? It’s still not a good movie. But if you ignore the plot holes, mostly awful acting, and terrible pacing, it’s at least very cool to look at. Also, I had totally forgotten about Ice T’s turn as J-Bone, leader of the Lo-Tek underground. It was fun enough, but it was weird to hear the theater audience erupt with applause at the end, though, knowing how it was received almost three decades ago.</p><p>At least some of the movies below, from the last week’s worth of trailers, are bound to be better.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300863/minecraft-movie-trailer-jack-black-steve">A Minecraft Movie</a></h3></p><p>Jack Black’s Steve gets a backstory in the latest <em>Minecraft </em>trailer. The trailer shows young Steve (you can tell he’s young because his beard is brown at first) mining his way into the blocky game world, where he discovers he can build anything he imagines, as long as it’s made with blocks. Plus we get a look at Jason Momoa, Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers, and Sebastian Eugene Hansen, who all find themselves dropped into this world with a now-much-older Steve (who now has a gray beard to show the passage of time).</p><p>You can catch <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> in theaters on April 4th. Then you can follow it up with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300607/minecraft-theme-park-attractions-merlin-entertainment"><em>Minecraft</em> theme park</a> in 2026 or so. </p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/21/24302530/remember-elio-from-pixars-upcoming-film-elio">Elio</a></h3></p><p>The new teaser trailer from Pixar’s <em>Elio</em> lets us know the film is still alive and well. The movie comes from <em>Coco</em> screenwriter Adrian Molina, who co-directs alongside Domee Shi and Madeline Sharafian. It features the voice of Yonas Kibreab as Elio, a child who gets abducted by aliens and pretends to be Earth’s leader. If <em>Coco</em> is any indication, I expect I’ll be openly sobbing at the end. It’s out on June 13th.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301448/hot-xenomorph-summer">Alien: Earth</a></h3></p><p>The FX spinoff <em>Alien: Earth</em> is on its way in summer 2025, when it promises to finally* show us what it might be like to see xenomorphs on our planet. There’s little revealed here apart from the release timeframe and that, as <em>The Verge</em>’s Andrew Webster remarks, the aliens are “still <em>very</em> shiny.”</p><p>*Unless you count the <em>Aliens vs. Predator </em>films.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/21/24302318/star-wars-outlaws-lando-dlc-steam-launch-stealth-update">Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card</a></h3></p><p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is getting its first DLC in the form of <em>Wild Card</em>, a storyline that brings Lando Calrissian into the game. If you haven’t been playing the game lately, maybe hopping into a space battle with Han’s old buddy will draw you back in. <em>Wild Card</em> is available now for $14.99.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300929/the-live-action-remakes-continue-to-drag-on">How to Train Your Dragon</a></h3></p><p>Oh hey, look, a live-action version of an animated movie. <em>How to Train Your Dragon </em>will go head-to-head with <em>Elio</em> when it’s released on June 13th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/24/24302297/nintendo-switch-pro-controller-black-friday-2024-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo recently announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294698/nintendo-switch-black-friday-discounts-games-controllers-holiday-sale">a batch of Black Friday deals</a>, all of which run through November 30th. This includes a steep discount on the <strong>Nintendo Switch Pro Controller</strong>, which drops it to an all-time low of $49.99 ($20 off) at <a href="https://howl.link/omm6z5optv67g">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fgaming-accessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-wireless-pro-controller---black%2F349481.html">GameStop</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-pro-controller%2F-%2FA-52180631%23lnk%3Dsametab">Target</a>. This is one of the more notable Black Friday discounts from Nintendo this year — that is, aside from the current promo on <a href="https://howl.link/8sph2j3w4vl68"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a> and <a href="https://howl.link/anfm53kkpq2qk">Nintendo’s latest Switch OLED bundle</a> — namely because the Pro Controller rarely goes on sale, even today.</p><p>Although there are many great third-party gamepads available, the Switch Pro Controller remains the best all-around controller for Nintendo’s aging console. It’s much more comfortable to use a full-size controller than a pair of Joy-Cons for extended hours, and its larger sticks are far more accurate. It also features a proper D-pad instead of four individual buttons and parity with Nintendo’s Joy-Con controllers, meaning you get gyro controls, HD rumble, and Amiibo support.</p><div><p>The Switch Pro released alongside the Switch console in 2017, and it’s a tough controller to beat. It offers an unmatched set of features (HD rumble, motion controls, NFC), and it’s one of the most comfortable Switch controllers out there.</p></div><p>Other controllers, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23350899/nintendo-switch-controllers-best-wireless-joy-con-gamepad#:~:text=AT%20BEST%20BUY-,The%20best%20Xbox%2Dstyle%20controller%20for%20the%20Switch,-GuliKit%20KingKong%202">Gulikit’s King Kong series</a>, have some of these features and one-up the Pro Controller with drift-free Hall effect sticks and some customizability. However, they don’t provide <em>quite</em> the same foolproof, plug-and-play experience as Nintendo’s gamepad, which you can hand to a child and know everything will work.</p><p>While Nintendo recently came out to announce that its next console will be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation">backward-compatible with Switch games</a>, it hasn’t said what that means for accessories like the Pro Controller. There’s a chance that it will not be 100 percent compatible with the successor to the Switch, but since it uses an open protocol like Bluetooth, there’s really no reason it shouldn’t. That is, unless Nintendo drastically changes something with its wireless controller setup or really wants us to purchase new controllers. (Fingers crossed it doesn’t come to that.)</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
