            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>This is </em><a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/">Lowpass<em> by Janko Roettgers</em></a><em>, a newsletter on the ever-evolving intersection of tech and entertainment, syndicated just for </em>The Verge<em> subscribers once a week.</em></p><p>The glasses stole the show: When Meta held its annual Connect developer conference last month, the company’s new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/779566/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-smart-glasses-price-battery-specs">Ray-Ban Display glasses</a> got a lot of attention. Without new hardware to announce, VR took a bit of a backseat. Sure, <a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/p/james-cameron-mixed-reality-headsets-generative-ai">there was James Cameron</a>, who is helping the company bring 3D movies, shows, and sports events to Quest headsets. But what about that whole metaverse thing? How’s that going? To get an update on Meta’s efforts to make VR social, I talked to the company’s metaverse VP, Vishal Shah.</p><p>Meta’s struggles with Horizon Worlds, the company’s social metaverse platform, have been well-documented. Shah himself complained in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/6/23391895/meta-facebook-horizon-worlds-vr-social-network-too-buggy-leaked-memo?utm_source=www.lowpass.cc&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=exclusive-inside-meta-s-horizon-worlds-reboot">a series of leaked 2022 memos</a> that not even Meta’s employees were using the platform, leading him to pose the question: “If we don’t love it, how can we expect our users to love it?”</p><p>The company has since launched a series of polished games within <em>Horizon</em> and spent heavily to attract VR developers to the platform. At this year’s Connect conference, Meta doubled down on those efforts by announcing not just AI developer tools, but also a whole new game engine for Horizon Worlds.</p><p>All of this is part of the company’s efforts to turn Horizon Worlds into a link between social 3D spaces everywhere, from headsets to phones to your Facebook and Instagram feeds — and one day, as Mark Zuckerberg suggested during his Meta Connect keynote, perhaps even glasses.</p><div><p id="worlds-apart-making-vr-games-work-on-phones-isnt-easy"><h2>Worlds apart: making VR games work on phones isn’t easy</h2></p></div><p>When Meta launched the first version of Horizon Worlds in late 2021, it very much embraced a kind of DIY ethos. Developers could easily build games and worlds in headset, but the resulting experiences all lacked texture and complexity. Remember <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/19/23313469/mark-zuckerberg-horizon-worlds-screenshot-memes-response-upgrades">Zuckerberg’s selfie in front of the Eiffel Tower?</a> That was essentially how Horizon Worlds games looked at the time. “The ceiling of what you could make was low,” Shah says. “It was just not compelling enough.”</p><p>The company began shifting away from this approach in 2023 by building and <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/meta-horizon-worlds-50-million-creator-fund/">investing in</a> higher-quality games like <em>Super Rumble</em>, a PvP shooter built by Meta’s in-house studio Ouro Interactive. It eventually fully transitioned from in-headset creator tools to a desktop solution for building worlds <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/horizon-worlds-desktop-editor-now-publicly-available-in-early-access/">earlier this year</a>. That software, Meta Horizon Studio, lets developers create more complex games with TypeScript, including <a href="https://horizon.meta.com/world/10221079610486872/?locale=en_US">haunted houses</a>, <a href="https://horizon.meta.com/world/393502540519645/?locale=en_US">sports competitions</a>, and <a href="https://horizon.meta.com/world/462305146410908/?locale=en_US">party games</a>.</p><p>“That required a skill that not everyone has,” admits Shah. “So can we lower the floor of what you need to get started, but still keep the ceiling really high?” Meta’s answer to that question is AI: At Connect, the company unveiled <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/780256/meta-horizon-worlds-engine-studio">new tools for developers</a> to create 3D environments, NPCs, and even game mechanics with simple prompts.</p><p>Embracing desktop creator tools has also allowed Meta to take Horizon Worlds beyond the headset. The company <a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/p/horizon-worlds-super-rumble-reboot-mobile-app">began making select games, including <em>Super Rumble</em></a>, available on mobile in 2023. “We have this chicken-and-egg problem,” Shah tells me. “We know the most immersive experiences are in VR. But that’s not where all the people are today. People are on mobile.” And once people discover <em>Horizon</em> games on mobile, they’re more likely to try them in VR, or so the logic goes.</p><p>However, getting people to try <em>Horizon</em> games on mobile hasn’t been easy, with Shah acknowledging that the company’s initial push to bring VR games like <em>Super Rumble</em> to phones didn’t work. “The control specs weren’t right,” he says. “It just didn’t feel right.”</p><p>Now, Meta also allows developers to build mobile-only Horizon Worlds games. Engagement on mobile has supposedly increased by 4x since, but Shah admits that overall mobile use is still nascent. “It’s smaller than VR, but it’s not nearly as small as it was,” he tells me.</p><p>And while Meta keeps investing in mobile <em>Horizon</em> games, its ultimate goal remains unchanged. “This is not about [building] a mobile-only thing,” Shah says. “This is about cross-platform play. This is about making sure people can find these [worlds] from whatever device they’re on, and whatever experience they’re in.”</p><div><p id="why-meta-built-a-new-game-engine"><h2>Why Meta built a new game engine</h2></p></div><p>To that end, the company is also looking to bring <em>Horizon</em> to some of its other platforms. “If you go to the games tab on Facebook, you can find <em>Horizon</em> games,” Shah says, adding that the company was also testing the integration of <em>Horizon</em> games into Instagram.</p><p>Part of this push to bring Horizon Worlds everywhere is the transition to a new game engine to replace the Unity engine the platform was originally built on. “That was the right place to start for us,” Shah says about the popular game engine. However, Unity is primarily known as an engine for developers looking to build single games, while titles like <em>Roblox</em> and <em>Minecraft</em> tend to run on proprietary engines. “So we made the decision that we’d have to build something much more bespoke for our needs.”</p><p>The new <a href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/meta-horizon-engine-at-a-glance/">Meta Horizon Engine</a> makes it possible to have many more players in the same world at the same time while also reducing load times. The latter is key to making <em>Horizon</em> feel more like a series of interconnected worlds, and, for instance, allows a group of friends to easily jump from one experience to another without having to spend a lot of time waiting for worlds to load.</p><p>“We’ve done research on this,” he says. “You feel like something takes a long time to load if it’s anywhere over 15 to 20 seconds. It feels much faster if it’s under 15, but the real magic number is under seven [seconds], where it almost feels instantaneous.”</p><p>The new engine will be rolling out in stages. One of the first worlds running on the new engine is Horizon Central, the town square that many people start their journey into Horizon Worlds on. Higher concurrencies also make the new engine the best solution for Horizon Arena, Meta’s concert and events space in VR.</p><p>However, most Quest owners will get their first glimpse of something powered by the new engine as soon as they put on their headset when the company rolls out a redesigned home base soon. “That home environment is just a world,” Shah says.</p><div><p id="everything-is-just-a-world"><h2>Everything is just a world</h2></p></div><p>It’s just a world: That could ultimately become the unofficial tag line for Horizon Worlds. The VR comedy club, meditation space, or 3D shooter? They’re all just worlds. The games your friends are playing on Facebook or Instagram? Also just worlds. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/780044/meta-quest-metaverse-hyperscape-capture-vr">virtual replica of your living room</a>, powered by Gaussian splats? Just another world. Future avatar-powered co-presence experiences that will likely be added to wearables like Meta’s Ray-Ban Display glasses? At some point, probably yet another world.</p><p>Turning Horizon Worlds into the connective tissue that ties together social VR hangouts, mobile gaming, and even future XR co-presence experiences is ambitious, to say the least. It will also require the company to make some tough decisions, which could alienate early VR users.</p><p>Meta has taken such steps across its VR efforts in recent years. It stopped updating the original Oculus Quest headset in early 2024, pulled the plug on its fitness tracking service Move <a href="https://www.meta.com/nl-nl/blog/oculus-move-updates-track-your-vr-fitness-stats-and-goals-outside-your-headset/">earlier this year</a>, and has removed some early Horizon Worlds games from the platform. More painful choices may be needed, admits Shah.</p><p>“That’s kind of the phase that we’re in,” he says. “We have to clean up a lot of the core experiences. I’m [spending] a lot of my time just moving throughout the entire OS, saying, ‘Okay, what can we deprecate here? How do we consolidate here?’ We have this amazing ecosystem that’s complex. And if we really want to expand the audience, we’ve got to simplify.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTM1Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Janko Roettgers</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/column/797624/meta-metaverse-horizon-worlds-mobile-vr-social]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-teases-new-gpu-tech-for-the-ps6.1320976/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony’s next console (presumably the PS6) is coming in “a few years time,” according to someone who I’d believe to make that claim. Mark Cerny, lead architect on the PS5 and PS5 Pro, joined Jack Huynh, SVP and GM of AMD’s computing and graphics group, in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCMzw-_dMw">YouTube video</a> wherein the pair spend nine minutes going through some very specific, co-developed advancements in graphics technology that will come to the next console. But the pair cautioned that the technologies are still in “very early days” and “only exist in simulation right now.”</p><p>Much of it boils down to how the companies are working to make it easier for future GPUs to handle graphics upscaling, ray tracing, and the super-intensive path tracing techniques used to make game worlds look more realistic. Cerny says “the current approach has reached its limit,” so Sony is working with AMD to integrate components of its next-gen RDNA architecture in future consoles. AMD’s Huynh introduced Radiance Cores (similar in theory to Nvidia’s RT Cores) that are dedicated to handling ray tracing and path tracing. In addition to Sony’s new consoles having the new cores, they will almost certainly be built into AMD’s future desktop GPUs, too, and likely within whatever it’s assisting with in its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688407/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-cloud-amd">Xbox partnership</a>.</p><p>The Radiance Cores supposedly deliver a speed boost to performance, freeing up other components to quickly process shaders and textures instead of having to spin so many plates, so to speak. This new GPU tech will also benefit from advancements in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/671961/amd-fsr-redstone-rdna-4">AMD’s FSR Redstone</a>, its latest AI-assisted upscaling technology, such as Neural Radiance Caching, as well as likely whatever upscaling tech comes after.</p><p>Another key area of improvement is compression, which will free up more bandwidth for GPUs to run future games at peak performance and fidelity. Sony’s improving on the Delta Color Compression technique (used on the PS5 and PS5 Pro) that compress textures and render targets. Its next hardware will utilize the new, more efficient technique called Universal Compression that compresses <em>everything </em>in the pipeline. Huynh says this will let the GPU deliver “more detail, higher frame rates, and greater efficiency.” More compression could raise the performance ceiling of a GPU, so it should also let it run more efficiently in a low-power mode, should the need arise.</p><p>Speaking of, it’s easy to see how these improvements could benefit the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305337/sony-handheld-gaming-console-playstation-nintendo-microsoft">rumored PlayStation handheld</a> that’s allegedly in development. Sony and AMD’s work to reduce the stress on GPUs could theoretically be applied to any form factor, such as a handheld. Sony has already made strides in efficiency on the PS5, with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712212/sony-ps5-power-saver-handheld-rumors">new Power Saver mode</a> that can scale back game performance in favor of lower power consumption. In a nutshell, those are the key ingredients necessary to run games on a handheld.</p><p>It’s encouraging to see Sony being proactive about showing how it’s working to make the GPUs in its upcoming devices (be it the PS6 or a handheld) as capable as possible. For now, we’ll pretend that this news doesn’t cast a shadow over the aging PS5 and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">not-as-powerful-as-we’d-hoped PS5 Pro</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/797640/sony-ps6-handheld-gpu-ray-path-tracing-amd-radiance-cores]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-is-a-pivotal-moment-for-the-series-%E2%80%94-and-ea.1320973/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Battlefield 6</em> is one of EA’s most important launches in years. As the company becomes laser-focused on big, bankable franchises and looks to compete with the beast that is Activision’s <em>Call of Duty</em>, EA needs <em>Battlefield 6</em> to be a hit when it debuts on October 10th — especially after the previous game in the series had a rough release — and it’s putting an incredible amount of effort into making it successful. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/787112/electronic-arts-55-billion-privacte-acquisition-pif-silver-lake-affinity-partners">recently announced $55 billion deal to take EA private</a> has only upped the stakes.</p><p>“EA’s fate is tightly tied to <em>Battlefield</em>,” New York University games professor Joost van Dreunen tells <em>The Verge</em>. “If <em>Battlefield 6</em> underperforms, it will call into question the strength of EA’s non-sports portfolio. At that point, the company faces pressure to rethink its strategy, perhaps even to divest and lean more heavily on the dependable sports business. It makes <em>Battlefield</em> a bellwether that will tell us if EA can still compete in blockbuster shooters.”</p><p>The pressure for <em>Battlefield 6</em> started building almost immediately after <em>Battlefield 2042</em>’s disastrous 2021 debut. The multiplayer-only <em>2042</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22524753/battlefield-2042-release-date-trailer-ps4-ps5-xbox-pc">added huge, 128-player battles</a> to a franchise already known for epic multiplayer skirmishes. But the game had a rough, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/battlefield-2042-bugs-fixes-known-issues">bug-filled launch</a> that necessitated multiple patches <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-1">shortly</a> <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-2">after</a> <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-3?isLocalized=true">release</a>. EA <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814517/ea-battlefield-vince-zampella-apex-legends-respawn-boss-ceo-shakeup">moved quickly</a> to put Vince Zampella, cofounder of <em>Apex Legends</em>-maker Respawn Entertainment and former head of <em>Call of Duty</em> studio Infinity Ward, in charge of the <em>Battlefield</em> series to help right the ship. But the damage was already done. A few months after <em>2042</em> came out, EA CEO Andrew Wilson <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/1/22913193/ea-battlefield-2042-launch-expectations">put things bluntly</a> on an earnings call: “The launch of <em>Battlefield 2042</em> did not meet expectations.”</p><p>The <em>Battlefield</em> series kicked off with <em>Battlefield 1942</em> in 2002, and even that first game had a reputation for its big multiplayer battles. I have a memory of a hectic, shenanigans-filled match in an older <em>Battlefield</em> at a LAN cafe when I was a teenager. But the franchise has been steadily overtaken by Activision’s <em>Call of Duty</em> as <em>the</em> multiplayer shooter — especially because <em>COD</em> now has an enormous amount of resources behind it for annual releases and major <em>Warzone</em> updates.</p><p>Despite the rocky launch, EA has kept <em>2042</em> going, even releasing <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-9-2-0">a surprise update in August</a> that added new weapons, vehicles, and a map. But it’s been clear for a long time that EA has been focusing much more on the <em>future</em> of the <em>Battlefield</em> franchise. Activision has several dedicated studios focused on <em>Call of Duty</em> that lets it launch a new blockbuster game nearly every year. <em>Battlefield</em> has historically been developed by Dice, but EA roped in three additional studios — Criterion, Motive, and Ripple Effect — to create a new Battlefield Studios structure so that it can make a better push to compete. (EA reportedly wants to get <em>Battlefield</em> on a similar type of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/analyst-says-ea-plans-to-milk-battlefield-for-everything-its-worth-their-goal-is-three-studios-making-battlefield-on-a-3-year-basis-so-they-can-get-to-battlefield-annually/">annual release cadence as <em>Call of Duty</em></a>.)</p><p>Even though EA is also known for titles like <em>Mass Effect</em> and <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em>, most of its money comes from a small number of franchises, along with add-ons like microtransactions and battle passes. Live service revenue is already big money for EA; according to its most recent <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2026/q1/Q1-FY26-Earnings-Release-FINAL1.pdf">quarterly earnings report</a>, 83 percent of its net revenue came from “live services and other.” If <em>Battlefield 6</em> is successful over the long term, that potentially makes the game a big cash cow for EA.</p><div><p>Perhaps more than anything, if <em>Battlefield 6</em> is a success, it gives the company another annual game that’s almost a sure hit. EA found a way to keep its soccer franchise going even after it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/10/23065405/ea-sports-fc-fifa-branding">dropped the <em>FIFA</em> branding</a>. It brought back an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158294/ea-sports-brings-college-football-back-to-game-consoles-on-july-19th">annual college football game last year</a>, meaning it now has two American football titles it can release annually. The next-generation release in <em>The Sims</em> series, codenamed “Project Rene,” will be free and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870172/project-rene-next-gen-sims-free">won’t replace</a> the hugely successful <em>The Sims 4</em>, which just got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4s-adventure-awaits-expansion-is-exactly-the-kind-of-getaway-ive-been-looking-for">its 20th expansion</a>. EA even just launched a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/761186/ea-skate-free-to-play-early-access-release-date">live service version of <em>Skate</em></a>, and even though that’s still in early access, <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1975229570807890000">more than 15 million players have already tried it</a>.</p></div><p>Beyond overcoming the stigma of <em>2042’s</em> poor launch, <em>Battlefield 6</em> also has the uphill battle of competing with the many other enduring multiplayer shooters on the market like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, and <em>Valorant</em> (a lesson <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">Sony learned the hard way</a>). Those also all have the advantage of being free-to-play games, while EA has to convince people to shell out a minimum of $69.99 for <em>Battlefield 6</em>, something that’s especially challenging when a third of video game players buy a new game less often than once per year, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m27zezw2ek2v">according to Circana data</a>. It’s not an impossible hurdle — the annual <em>Call of Duty</em> releases <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/circana-confirms-black-ops-6-is-2024s-biggest-hit-but-overall-game-spend-in-the-us-falls-9-yoy">still do numbers</a> — but EA has its work cut out.</p><div><p>And this was all the case <em>before</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/787723/ea-private-deal-buyout-future-games-layoffs">EA announced a $55 billion deal to take the company private</a> — a deal that includes $20 billion of debt financing. Should the deal go through, that debt adds a lot of money that the new version of EA will have to pay down, and the company could lean on <em>Battlefield 6</em> — and the in-development <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-battle-royale-testing"><em>Battlefield</em> battle royale</a> as well as future <em>Battlefield</em> titles — to help. The deal could <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/787723/ea-private-deal-buyout-future-games-layoffs">also eventually mean</a> cost-cutting measures like layoffs, like what Microsoft did <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs">following its Activision Blizzard acquisition</a>.</p></div><p>From what I’ve played of <em>Battlefield 6</em>, I feel like EA’s efforts may have paid off. I’ve spent the most time with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lw4WBofOkLE">single-player campaign</a>, a gripping thriller where an unstable NATO has to fight back against a shadowy private military group called Pax Armata. So far, it’s filled with chaotic firefights where I almost always feel like I survive by the skin of my teeth. One memorable mission involved night vision goggles, rising tensions between the city’s citizens and Pax Armata, and, eventually, taking down a helicopter. Though, in a chilling moment that made me lose some appetite to keep playing, the in-game helicopter once flew by at the same time <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/06/us/oregon-national-guard-trump-ruling-portland-hnk">a real military helicopter flew over</a> my home in Portland.</p><p>I’ve only dabbled a bit in multiplayer, but the matches I’ve played have been frantic and exciting, and I really like playing with a lot of other soldiers around me. (Even if, because of the relatively small playerbase during the review period, I was usually playing mostly against bots.) I’m a poor shot, so when I would get frustrated dying over and over again, I’d focus on reviving my teammates. And while the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/pc-portal-experience">sandbox Portal mode</a> wasn’t available during the review period, I’m guessing players will create some wild, imaginative new experiences that could be worth coming back for.</p><p>Early signs look good for <em>Battlefield 6</em>, and it has all of the pieces in place for a successful launch. But <em>Battlefield 6</em> needs to be more than that — it needs to be a hit long after it first comes out. The future of EA depends on it.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/795232/ea-battlefield-6-hit-launch-deal]]></content:encoded>
