He was 55.</p><p>NBC Los Angeles and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/angeles-crest-highway-altadena-deadly-crash/">CBS Los Angeles</a> report California Highway Patrol responded to a single-car crash at around 12:45PM local time on Angeles Crest Highway in Altadena. An Emergency SOS request came in via satellite from an Apple device, according to the CHP’s incident log.</p><p>The Highway Patrol did not identify Zampella, but CHP officer Marissa Mcintire sent over a press release about the crash that says:</p><div><blockquote><p>Preliminary investigation indicated Vehicle #1 was traveling southbound on Angeles Crest Highway, approaching MPM 62.70, within the #1 lane. For unknown reasons, the vehicle veered off the roadway, struck a concrete barrier, and became fully engulfed. The passenger was ejected from the vehicle and the driver remained trapped. Both parties succumbed to their injuries.</p></blockquote></div><p>Zampella co-founded Respawn Entertainment, which EA acquired <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/ea-completes-acquisition-of-respawn">in 2017</a> and is known for series like <em>Titanfall</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, and <em>Star Wars Jedi</em>. EA put him in charge of the <em>Battlefield</em> series <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814517/ea-battlefield-vince-zampella-apex-legends-respawn-boss-ceo-shakeup">in 2021</a> after the rocky launch of <em>Battlefield 2042</em>, and the series’ latest entry, <em>Battlefield 6</em>, has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/825171/battlefield-6-had-a-big-launch-month">had a strong release</a>. Before founding Respawn, Zampella helped co-create the <em>Call of Duty</em> series at Infinity Ward, where he served as Studio Head and CEO.</p><p>”This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince’s family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work,” EA spokesperson Justin Higgs says in a statement. “Vince’s influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching. A friend, colleague, leader and visionary creator, his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers around the world. His legacy will continue to shape how games are made and how players connect for generations to come.”</p><p><em><strong>Update, December 22nd</strong>: Added statement from EA.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/849297/vince-zampella-dies-call-of-duty-titanfall-respawn-battlefield]]></content:encoded>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> had earned another Game of the Year award by the Indie Game Awards last week, but the organization has since announced that the award would be retracted because developer Sandfall Interactive used generative AI during development. The Indie Game Awards also rescinded the Debut Game award given to <em>Expedition 33</em>.</p><p>Here is the Indie Game Awards’ explanation, <a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/faq">from an FAQ</a>:</p><div><blockquote><p>The Indie Game Awards have a hard stance on the use of gen AI throughout the nomination process and during the ceremony itself. When it was submitted for consideration, a representative of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. In light of a resurfaced interview with <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Clair-Obscur-Expedition-33-producer-confirms-generative-AI-use-in-Game-of-the-Year-winner.1187946.0.html">Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI art</a> in production being brought to our attention on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from its nomination. While the <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-alters-ai-controversy/">assets in question were patched out</a> and it is a wonderful game, it does go against the regulations we have in place.</p></blockquote></div><p>The Indie Game Awards’ Mike Towndrow also explained the decision in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/indiegameawards.gg/post/3magufzccy22i">a video on Bluesky</a>.</p><p>The Indie Game Awards’ criteria, as outlined in that FAQ, says that “Games developed using generative AI are strictly ineligible for nomination.” Sandfall Interactive didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><p>Game of the Year is instead being awarded to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/647451/blue-prince-review-architectural-roguelike-balatro">puzzle game <em>Blue Prince</em></a>. Publisher Raw Fury said <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rawfury.bsky.social/post/3maivmd5kps2w">on Sunday</a> that “there is no AI used in Blue Prince” and that the game “was built and crafted with full human instinct” by Tonda Ros and the Dogubomb team.</p><p>“As gen AI becomes more prevalent in our industry, we will better navigate it appropriately,” the Indie Game Awards says.</p><p>The Indie Game Awards is also retracting an Indie Vanguard award from studio Gortyn Code, which developed the Game Boy-inspired game <em>Chantey</em>. The game is sold on a physical cartridge by Palmer Luckey’s ModRetro, which makes the Chromatic Game Boy. Luckey also founded defense contractor Anduril, and Chromatic recently announced an Anduril-branded Chromatic made from “the same magnesium aluminum alloy as Anduril’s attack drones.”</p><p>“The IGAs nomination committee were unfortunately made aware of ModRetro’s nature and principles the day after the 2025 premiere with the news of their upcoming handheld console,” the Indie Game Awards says. Because of <em>Chantey’s</em> ties with ModRetro, “Indie Vanguard has also been retracted as we do not want to provide the company with a platform.” The organization also says that “The decision does not reflect Gortyn Code, but ModRetro alone.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/849144/indie-game-awards-game-of-the-year-expedition-33-generative-ai-chantey-modretro]]></content:encoded>
