            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Evo 2025, the biggest fighting game tournament in North America, starts this weekend. If you tune into one of the nine different Evo Twitch channels you’ll see some of the top players in the world compete in fighting game staples like <em>Street Fighter</em> and <em>Tekken</em>, and newer games like <em>King of Fighters: City of the Wolves</em>, and<em> Rivals of Aether II</em>. The fighting starts today and lasts till late Sunday, August 3rd. Though this year is smaller, with fewer entrants than last year, there’s still plenty of reasons to watch.</p><p>While Evo remains one of the most highly attended fighting game tournaments in the world, this year, the number of entrants are slipping. Last year there were over 10,000 attendees — <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240724192201/https://evo.gg/news/evo-2024-record">setting a record for the highest number of unique competitors</a> in a fighting game tournament ever. This year, that number is significantly lower with the number of entrants <a href="https://evo.gg/news/evo-2025-competitors-by-the-numbers">slipping to over 8,500</a>.</p><p>There could be a number of explanations for this. Economic volatility driven by inflation and policy has made the cost of living rise precipitously. When people have to think twice between groceries and a trip to Vegas (where Evo is annually held), the trip to Vegas typically loses out. Evo has also expanded, adding tournaments <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/7/17/12210570/evo-japan-announced/">first in Japan</a>, then <a href="https://evo.gg/events/2025-france">France</a>, and now <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-to-host-evo-2026-the-world-cup-of-fighting-games">Singapore</a>, giving international players more of a choice of which events to attend.</p><p>Safety is potentially another reason why players are staying away. Evo is an internationally known and recognized tournament, players from all over the world compete in this event. But in the US, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have been <a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/politics-power/social-justice/immigrant-families-split-ice-deportations-REEFYKMZ6ZB43GYXWQN3WL4TXY/">conducting raids across the country</a>, ostensibly to arrest immigrants for deportation. But there have been numerous reports that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/634094/trump-dhs-arresting-palestine-student-activists-ice">legal residents,</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ice-detained-us-citizen-l-charged-obstructing-arrest-rcna215481">US citizens</a>, and even <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/u-s-detention-of-european-and-canadian-tourists-creates-fear-over-traveling-to-america">tourists with valid visas</a> are being arrested and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/23/nx-s1-5441691/mahmoud-khalil-interview">detained for months</a> or even <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/08/us/timeline-deportation-maryland-father-el-salvador-hnk">illegally deported</a>. In an email to <em>The Verge</em>, the Las Vegas Convention Center director of communications Erica Johnson wrote, “The LVCVA’s policy is to abide by all federal, state, and local laws and cooperate with the lawful execution of those.” Evo did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Some notable international players, though, have decided to brave crossing the US border. Arslan “Arslan Ash” Siddique from Pakistan is registered to attend Evo, returning again to compete for another <em>Tekken </em>Championship. Matías “Scorpionprocs” Martínez and Nicolás “Nicolas” Martínez, Chilean twins known for dominating <em>Mortal Komba</em>t tournaments, will also be competing.</p><p>The games themselves might also be contributing to reduced turnout. <em>Tekken 8</em> has the second highest number of entrants after <em>Street Fighter VI</em>, but the game’s second season <a href="https://twistedvoxel.com/fans-are-unhappy-with-tekken-8-season-2-heres-whats-causing-the-backlash/">was so poorly received</a> by players that Tekken executive producer Katsuhiro Harada <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1911974797225173345">wrote</a>, “I personally do not think this backlash is at all unjustified.” That frustration with the game might have led to its player count being cut nearly in half going from 4,646 players in 2024 to just 2,521 this year.</p><p>Whatever the reason, this year’s Evo will be a slightly smaller, but no less exciting affair that’s worth watching. Take a look at the schedule <a href="https://evo.gg/events/usa2025">here</a>.</p><p>Even though <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em> <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fatal-fury-salvatore-ganacci-pushback-reveal">received criticism for some of its character choices</a>, I’m generally excited to watch any game I haven’t seen before. Evo 2025 is also adding two new streams to the schedule for people to watch any of the smaller games that are always featured at Evo but not large or notable enough to get main event stage billing. Also my absolute favorite competitor Dominique “Trans Rights” / “SonicFox” McLean will be there and I’ll watch them whenever he’s on.</p><p>Here’s some other things to look out for:</p><div><ul><li><span><em>Mortal Kombat Top 8</em> at 1PM ET on Saturday August 2nd: <em>MK 1</em> has the least amount of entrants that I have ever seen and I want as many people to watch as possible so the competitors don’t feel so lonely.</span></li><li><span><em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em> top 8 on Sunday August 3rd at 3PM: I really want to see someone using Cristano Ronaldo lose badly.</span></li><li><span><em>Street Fighter 6</em> Top 8 on Sunday August 3rd at 11 PM ET: <em>Street Fighter 6</em> is the most popular game at Evo, boasting the highest number of entrants the last three years, and its finals are always events you wanna watch.</span></li></ul></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/717660/how-to-watch-evo-2025-las-vegas]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-nintendo-didn%E2%80%99t-raise-the-price-of-the-switch-2-yet.1260192/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Just about every piece of hardware that Nintendo sells is getting a little more expensive in the US — with the exception of the Switch 2. That includes all models of the original Switch, a bunch of accessories, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">even a motion-activated alarm clock</a>. The changes were made ahead of sweeping Trump administration tariffs that are scheduled to go into effect in August, and they show Nintendo is leaning on a strategy that it has employed across its business: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/671949/nintendo-switch-2-era-risks">largely avoiding risk</a>. Raising the price of a new console isn’t the best look, and so the company is trying to claw back some of that money in safer ways, without gambling on the success of its most important product.</p><p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717325/nintendo-switch-price-hike-tariffs">Nintendo announced</a> that these new prices would go into effect starting on August 3rd. The actual increase hasn’t been announced yet, but a since-removed listing from Target suggests that the console hikes could range from $30 for the base Switch model to $50 for the OLED version. The move follows similar increases in Canada, and Nintendo says they’re being implemented “based on market conditions,” which is corporate speak for tariffs. Notably absent from the list of impacted products is the Switch 2. Nintendo says that current-gen hardware, along with games and Nintendo Switch Online subscriptions, “will remain unchanged at this time.”</p><p>So what’s the point of raising the price on old consoles and alarm clocks? Nintendo is infamous for being a fiscally conservative company, and it understands that, like everyone else, it will be impacted by the coming wave of tariffs. But Nintendo also knows that raising the price of the Switch 2 — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/646776/switch-2-price-editorial-dollar-yen-exchange-rate-inflation">which was already controversially expensive</a> — less than two months after launch would not go down well. The early days of a console’s life are very important to help establish a baseline audience that a company can then build off of. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">And the Switch 2 is off to a great start</a>. Just this morning <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717163/nintendo-earnings-q1-2025-switch-2-sales">the company announced</a> that it had sold nearly 6 million Switch 2 units since its launch in June.</p><p>It seems the company has decided that it’s worth eating whatever added costs come its way if it means a successful launch for the Switch 2 — that includes the impending 20 percent tariff on imports from Vietnam, where many of the consoles are produced. But the same can’t be said for the original Switch or products like Alarmo. At this point in time, sales of the first Switch aren’t as integral to Nintendo’s success, and so the company is comfortable raising its price in response to its own rising costs. The original Switch is less important now but it’s not insignificant; Nintendo noted in its most recent earnings that “demand for Nintendo Switch has remained after Nintendo Switch 2 launched in June.” And so it appears that Nintendo is trying to nickel and dime its way into making up some of what it will lose through the tariffs it’s forced to deal with, all without disrupting the Switch 2’s momentum.</p><p>This sort of risk-avoidance has become how Nintendo operates of late. While it often takes risks creatively, the company is much more shrewd from a business perspective. In its current incarnation Nintendo is an entertainment powerhouse that has expanded into film and theme parks, all while launching a successful new console. But in each instance the company has taken a relatively safe path forward, whether it’s partnering with an established animation studio like Illumination or a global theme park firm like Universal. The Switch 2 itself is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">an attempt to continue the original Switch’s success without changing things up all that much</a>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256070/nintendo-museum-kyoto-tour-shigeru-miyamoto">Even the Nintendo Museum tries to present a safe, squeaky clean image of the company</a>.</p><p>The new price hikes are simply a way of applying that way of thinking to the current chaos of Trump’s tariffs. That said, they could also end up being a soft launch of sorts, a way for Nintendo to gauge reactions before it does anything more drastic. Right now it has decided that it’s worth eating those costs, but that might not always be true moving forward. As it noted in today’s announcement, “price adjustments may be necessary in the future.” We don’t know yet what that might look like, but we do know that Nintendo will do whatever it can to avoid disrupting the Switch 2’s chances at success.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/717611/nintendo-switch-price-increase-risk-safety]]></content:encoded>
