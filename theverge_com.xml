            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/14/24320757/infinity-nikki-review-gacha-dress-up-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>You know that flavor of internet conversation where one familiar item is identified as another, wholly different item in a way that shouldn’t make sense but weirdly does? Like how <a href="https://www.eater.com/2017/7/24/16019500/hot-dog-sandwich-controversy-lol">a hot dog could be classified as a sandwich</a>, or because it has a filling enclosed by dough, a Pop-Tart is ravioli. Despite <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home"><em>Infinity Nikki</em></a>’s looks of a high-quality dress-up gacha game, it is actually <em>Breath of the Wild</em> reborn in some fancy-ass clothes.</p><p>In the game, you play as Nikki, an ordinary girl who gets whisked away to the fantasy world of Miraland along with her talking, bipedal, pantsless cat Momo. In Miraland, fashion is magic and a guild of stylists use it to combat the world’s evils and one another.</p><div><p>I had issues with its clunky, unintuitive, and at times unresponsive control scheme.</p></div><p><em>Infinity Nikki </em>having so much in common with <em>Breath of the Wild</em> was not immediately obvious. I started out disliking the game immensely. I had issues with its clunky, unintuitive, and at times unresponsive control scheme. The menu icon is in the top-right corner of the screen but is opened by holding the <em>left </em>shoulder button. But when you open the radial menu, you can only highlight icons with the right thumbstick. The direction pad is straight-up not functional, and while you use the X button to confirm selections, circle is used to click through dialogue. It’s a mess and a platform switch between mobile and PS5 didn’t address this at all.&nbsp;</p><div><p>There is an issue with linking accounts on PlayStation that could result in being unable to use cross-progression. This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-link-accounts-infinity-nikki"><em>Eurogamer</em></a> article explains the confusing details. To avoid any issues, before your first<em> Infinity Nikki</em> session on any platform, make an Infold Games account on their <a href="https://account.infoldgames.com/login">website</a> and use that to sign in where you like.</p></div><div><p>Control issues aside, <em>Nikki</em> then rubbed up against my antipathy for gacha games. I don’t hate them outright despite their reputation for having the same kind of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18226852/loot-boxes-gaming-regulation-gambling-free-to-play">predatory design elements</a> that led to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/19/16783136/loot-boxes-video-games-gambling-legal">crackdowns on lootboxes</a>. Rather, I’ve found them to be either <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24195175/zenless-zone-zero-impressions-genshin-impact-mihoyo">completely impenetrable</a> with their thousand million progression systems and currencies layered over utterly banal gameplay, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/1/23150381/diablo-immortal-preview-mobile-activision-blizzard">so naked in their core purpose to extract my time and money</a> that they turn me off. At first blush,<em> Infinity Nikki</em> felt like that.</p></div><p><small>In addition to exploration and fashion battles, Infinity Nikki is filled with all kinds of mini-games that provide an entertaining break from gameplay like this take on <em>Flappy Bird. </em></small></p><p>But as I was running through a pastoral countryside, gentle piano music playing at a default volume a few notches below a whisper, I spied a golden twinkle in the distance. I found a plant I could collect. Then another. Then Momo, who is basically the mobile game version of <em>Persona 5</em>’s Morgana, told me something called a “whimstar” was nearby. I found it at the top of a rocky cliff, requiring some light platforming to reach. From the elevation, I saw a treasure chest, so I used my bubble outfit to gently glide toward it before changing into my purification outfit to dispatch the monsters guarding it. Once they were gone, I saw a bug I could collect with the new bug catcher’s outfit I had just made. Then I…&nbsp;</p><p>It’s easy to read this and think that all <em>Infinity Nikki</em> has done is take <em>BOTW</em> and stuff it with microtransactions (which I’ll get to later). But by the time I had my, “Oh shit. This is <em>Zelda</em>,” revelation, it didn’t feel like a cheap clone. The same pleasing jolt I got solving a Korok puzzle, I felt from getting a whimstar. And the dress-up mechanics added a layer of novelty that further enhanced the game and my enjoyment.</p><div><figcaption>Infinity Nikki has a seriously robust photo mode.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Infold Games</cite></p></div><p>Everything in <em>Nikki </em>is powered by fashion. There are special outfits, like my monster purification dress or bug catcher uniform, that impart abilities that let you traverse the map, collect materials, and fight monsters. You then use materials you’ve gathered from those activities to upgrade your ability outfits or obtain the clothing you want to customize your avatar. There are so many pieces of clothing and accessories, each one rendered in intricately beautiful detail, that you use to exude your own style and win fashion battles against other stylists.</p><p>After exploration, I had the most fun crafting outfits in fashion duels against NPC stylists. Each piece of clothing is assigned points in five categories: sweet, fresh, elegant, sexy, or cool. Whoever has the highest points in the designated categories wins. Since these battles are based on score, you can easily win wearing an ugly mishmash of high-value clothes – kinda like how I won my first battle. The experience was so rewarding that it made me want to try winning future battles with looks that are both high-scoring and high-fashion.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption>The absolute atrocity with which I won my first stylist duel.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Infold Games</cite></p></div><p>To borrow a phrase from <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, <a href="https://www.rpgfan.com/feature/in-final-fantasy-xiv-glamour-is-the-true-endgame/">“Glamour is the endgame.”</a> It means that you’re not playing to become powerful or beat the game, you’re playing solely to fund your fashion habit. And it’s surprisingly not expensive.</p><p>Despite<em> Nikki </em>being a gacha game that is, at its core, designed to get you to spend money, its monetization systems feel more vestigial than critical. Most gacha games never require players to spend money, but are usually designed such that you can’t help it. Core game activities are arbitrarily limited and if you want to keep playing, you have to pay up. From what I’ve seen after 15 hours,<em> Nikki</em> doesn’t have that.&nbsp;</p><p>Dressing up is the core feature and there’s a cash shop where you can spend money on consumables that give you the chance (known as “pulling” in the gacha community) of winning high-value, tantalizingly pretty clothes. But there are so many other, cash-free ways to get outfits that are just as pleasing as anything for sale.&nbsp;</p><p>You can make a look out of mixing and matching pieces from your ability outfits, earn clothing or the blueprints to make them from quest rewards, or simply buy stuff from in-game vendors with in-game cash. I was not a fan of all the lace, sparkles, and pastels I made for my first outfit that I considered tossing a few bucks into the fashion slot machine. But as I continued my magpie-like adventures I made a punk rock look I’d actually wear in real life without spending a dime. It felt like the shop is only there for the folks who just have to have the exclusives it offers.</p><div><figcaption>An example of the kinds of clothing you can “pull” for with Infinity Nikki’s gacha mechanic.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Infold Games</cite></p></div><p>I enjoyed how <em>Infinity Nikki </em>subverted my expectations. A gacha game managed to recreate <em>Breath of the Wild</em> in function and spirit while the depth and detail of the fashions spoke directly to my love of individual expression in games. It wasn’t simply an Unreal Engine 5 version of the dress-up games of the early internet but a spiritual, sartorial successor of one of the best games of the last decade.</p><p><small><em>Infinity Nikki </em>is available now on Android, iOS, PlayStation, and PC.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo is inching ever closer to its promised deadline to reveal the Switch’s successor <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">before April 2025</a>. But new leaks from case manufacturers appear to reveal exactly what the Nintendo’s next console could look like, and a few notable upgrades it might have over the original Switch.</p><p>We were inspired to write this article in the first place because of Dbrand’s just-announced “Killswitch 2” case. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fgrip%2Fnintendo-switch-2-cases">The website for the product</a> features an in-motion render of the case and, inside, a mockup of hardware that has some key differences from the Switch and Switch OLED: the new console appears to be larger, and it has a mysterious new second button on the right Joy-Con under the Home button. Accessory leaks over the past several days have shown a similar <a href="https://www.theshortcut.com/p/new-nintendo-switch-2-leak-all-but-confirms-how-the-console-will-look">potential</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">design</a> for the hardware.</p><p>It seems Dbrand is reasonably confident in its case, but we asked CEO Adam Ijaz&nbsp;to be sure. He says Dbrand has “actual dimensions” — not an educated guess — based on a “3D scan of the real hardware.” (When we asked how he knows that, Ijaz only said “Nice try, Nintendo<em>.</em>”)</p><div><figcaption><em>Here’s a GIF we cut of the new case from Dbrand’s video.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Video: Dbrand</cite></p></div><p>Based on Dbrand’s measurements, the next Switch (which we’ll call the Switch 2) will both be larger and taller than Nintendo’s Switch OLED, but roughly the same thickness. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fmy%2Fhardware%2Fswitch%2Fmodal%2Fspecs%2Fbody_oled.html">Nintendo’s spec sheet</a> shows its previous handheld is 242mm wide, 102mm tall and 13.9mm thick, where Ijaz says the Switch 2 should measure 270mm wide, 116mm tall, and 14mm thick, with the console portion taking up 200mm worth of that width. </p><p>Ijaz also says the kickstand will still measure around half the console’s height at around 55mm; a diagonal measurement of the cover glass supports previous rumors that it’ll have an 8-inch screen. </p><p>Ijaz says it’s his “understanding” that Joy-Cons are “magnetically attached” with an “an ejection button” that’s on the back of the Joy-Cons near the top, and his new case takes advantage of the detachable controllers — he says the controller portions of Dbrand’s case can detach with them inside.</p><p>He doesn’t know what the second square button is under the Home button, which he says has a “C” printed on it. The left Joy-Con in Dbrand’s mockup still has a button on the left Joy-Con, which is where you’ll find the capture button on the original Switch, so it’s unclear if this “C” button now means capture or if both buttons work differently. (Nintendo originally introduced C-buttons on the Nintendo 64 controller in 1996 as a way to control a game’s camera, before gamepads introduced a second stick to let you shift perspective.) </p><p>Ijaz says the joysticks stand 6.27mm tall, and the D-pad and ABXY buttons protrude by 1.57mm, with a 180mm wide kickstand, and back triggers that extend 9.1mm.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->5</p><div><figcaption><em>Since the controller parts of the Killswitch 2 are detachable, this version uses a teal bungee cord, rather than a form-fitting design, to secure its protective travel cover.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Dbrand</cite></p></div></div><p>While Dbrand does seem to know a lot about the console, Ijaz is “genuinely unsure” about its potential release date. He says that Dbrand is working toward a late March or early April release for its case, though. Ijaz also doesn’t know about Nintendo’s possible TV dock for the Switch 2, but says that Dbrand’s assumption is that “the form factor will be similar to the previous gen.” He doesn’t know if the screen will be LCD or OLED.</p><p>While it’s highly unusual for an accessory maker to publicly reveal this much about a product from a powerful, litigious company like Nintendo, it’s not surprising that Dbrand’s the one stepping up to the plate. Having beef with console makers is an intentional (and often fun!) part of its marketing strategy, and Nintendo is a frequent target — like that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23713293/dbrand-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-skin">Zelda skin that was a middle finger to Nintendo’s lawyers</a>, or the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21231434/animal-crossing-switch-skin-nintendo-dbrand-copyright-price-design">“(not) Animal Crossing”</a> one. </p><p>Much of what Dbrand is showing and what Ijaz is saying lines up with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nacn4yqUY1s">a video from SwitchUp</a> showing what it calls a Switch 2 mockup sent to them by a case manufacturer. That mockup is clearly larger than today’s existing Switch OLED, and the new Joy-Cons are clearly bigger than the old Joy-Cons. You can also see the second square button under the home button there, the larger button under the triggers that presumably ejects them from the console, and a wide kickstand similar to the one on the Switch OLED.</p><p>One other nice addition? A second USB-C port on the top of the mockup, which theoretically means you’ll be able to plug in a charging cable while you’re using it in tabletop mode; with the current Switch, the charging port on the bottom is blocked when you’re standing it up on a table.</p><p>While we’re still waiting for Nintendo to actually announce concrete details about the Switch 2, the company has shared that the console will be able to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation">play current Switch games</a> and it will have Nintendo Switch Online as well.</p><p><em><strong>Correction, December 13th: </strong>Ijaz says he measured the Switch 2 triggers wrong; they extend 9.1mm, not 14.1mm. </em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
