            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/688483/nintendo-switch-2-ban-error-code-mig-flash-cartridge-online<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/cameron-faulkner">Cameron Faulkner</a> <span>is an editor covering deals and commerce. He joined in 2018, and served as commerce editor at Polygon until May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Some Switch 2 owners have received the<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fau%2Fsupport%2Farticles%2Ferror-codes-2124-4007-2124-4508%2F" rel="sponsored"> error code 2134-4508</a>, which results in their consoles being permanently banned from accessing any of its online services, as spotted by <a href="http://against/"><em>IGN</em></a>. It’s not a ban hammer from sucking at <em>Mario Kart World</em>, thankfully for me, but one that’s targeting consoles that have used a Mig – a microSD card-equipped Switch cartridge that can be filled with copies of games. </p><p>Running games on the Mig requires you to download them from others who have dumped files off of cartridges, or dump the games yourself with something like the <a href="https://www.migflashunited.shop/products/mig-switch-dumper">Mig Dumper</a>, then load them onto a microSD card. Whether you’ve used one to play pirated games, or to play copies of games that you own, Nintendo’s stance on the matter is broad: It considers both to be violations of its user agreements.</p><p>The makers of the Mig cartridge have taken reasonable efforts to distance itself from what a majority of buyers will likely do with it, which is play pirated games. The cartridge’s product page notes that it “serves as a backup and development device solely supporting gaming using personal game backups. [...] To maintain the Mig Flash warranty during online play, it’s essential to utilize self-dumped backups with authentic Certificate, UID, and Card Set ID.”</p><p>Nintendo isn’t bricking the consoles of offenders, at least, not immediately. YouTube creator Scattered Brain posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExgYTA18_vo">video</a> about their banned Switch 2 in which they tried to find a way around the ban. Attempting to visit the eShop wasn’t possible, nor was unlinking an account from the console, since both activities require the internet. They were able to unlink Virtual Game Cards from their Switch 2 from Nintendo’s account management site and load them onto a Switch OLED, suggesting that the ban is limited to the hardware and not the account. However, a factory reset essentially bricked their Switch 2, as it no longer allowed signing into any Nintendo Account. This is something that Nintendo reserves <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/665765/nintendo-privacy-policy-update-switch-2">the right to do</a> per its updated account services user agreement and privacy policy.</p><p>No one, but especially Mig users, should be surprised about this ban. Nintendo has a rich history of aggressively pursuing those who pirate its games, as well as those <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">who build emulators</a> that can run pirated copies of games originally made for its platforms. Considering that the Switch 2 is the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">fastest-selling console of all time</a>, Nintendo’s clearly throwing everything it’s got at making sure gamers are playing by its rules. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Just maybe not <em>today</em>? If you decided today was the day to finally drop hundreds of dollars on your first handheld, I might advise you to wait.</p><p>Four reasons:</p><div><ul><li><span>The best handhelds are sold out</span></li><li><span>The second-best handhelds just got more expensive</span></li><li><span>Third-tier handhelds are riddled with compromises </span></li><li><span>The entire state of gaming handhelds will improve if you wait</span></li></ul></div><div><p id="the-best-handhelds-are-sold-out"><h2><strong>The best handhelds are sold out</strong></h2></p></div><p>If you’re reading this story, I suspect you’ve been on the fence about handheld gaming machines — until the Nintendo Switch 2, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">the fastest-selling game console of all time</a>, caught your attention. Perhaps you liked the idea of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2">bigger <em>Mario Kart</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite/681222/fortnite-nintendo-switch-2-hands-on">smoother <em>Fortnite</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/679031/pokemon-violet-scarlet-switch-2-update-hands-on"><em>Pokémon</em></a>; perhaps you liked the idea of taking graphically intensive games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on the go.</p><p>Unfortunately, the $450 Nintendo Switch 2 is sold out everywhere as of this writing, and its alternatives may not offer the experience you’d hope.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">$550 Steam Deck OLED</a> is the best, most Switch-like handheld you can buy thanks to its pick-up-and-play SteamOS operating system, its similarly decent battery life, and an eye-popping HDR OLED screen. You might even be happier with a Deck OLED than a Switch 2 if you prefer the freedom of PC gaming to Nintendo’s first-party games. But the Steam Deck OLED, too, is entirely <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamdeck" rel="sponsored">out of stock</a> in the US and Canada. You’d have to wait.</p><div><p id="the-second-best-handhelds-just-got-more-expensive"><h2><strong>The second-best handhelds just got more expensive</strong></h2></p></div><p>If I were buying today and couldn’t get a Switch 2 or Deck OLED, what would I buy instead? A few months ago, the choice seemed clear: I would personally spend a bit more money for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">the $800 Asus ROG Ally X</a>, the best Windows gaming handheld yet — and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">arguably the best PC gaming handheld period</a> once you replace Windows with the SteamOS-like Bazzite. </p><p>If I couldn’t afford that, I would have waited for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">$500 Lenovo Legion Go S</a>, the first true Steam Deck competitor authorized to use SteamOS. </p><p>But both of those prices no longer apply. Ahead of the Nintendo Switch 2’s launch on June 5th, Asus and Lenovo’s handhelds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/682594/asus-rog-ally-x-price-hike-legion-go-s-steam-deck-oled-supply">suddenly cost $100 more</a> than promised in the US. So does their rival the MSI Claw, with both 7- and 8-inch models $100 pricier than originally communicated. It’s possible these increases are tied to China tariffs and could go down again, but neither company would tell us so. </p><div><p id="third-tier-handhelds-are-riddled-with-compromises"><h2><strong>Third-tier handhelds are riddled with compromises </strong></h2></p></div><p>If money were burning a hole in my pocket, the next thing I’d probably do is talk myself into buying a first-gen handheld PC. I’d (correctly!) point out that the original $650 Asus ROG Ally and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">original Lenovo Legion Go</a> have the same AMD Z1 Extreme chips as the newer Ally X and Legion Go S. But I’d be tricking myself into buying dramatically shorter battery life and a less comfortable experience. </p><p>Both the Ally X and the Legion Go S are better than the originals, with slightly better performance and <em>far</em> longer playtime from the Ally X’s doubled battery pack. Asus and Lenovo have made their cooling systems quieter and more efficient, the Legion’s speakers and charging are improved, and its lower-res variable-refresh-rate screen can sometimes make games run smoothly that’d be choppy on its predecessor.</p><p>In some cases ignorance is bliss; some power users would be perfectly happy if they found a good deal on the original Ally or Legion Go. But for a new buyer, the totality of these changes could be profound — the difference between “I don’t know why anybody would want a PC gaming handheld” and “where has this been all my life?” </p><div><p id="the-entire-state-of-gaming-handhelds-will-improve-if-you-wait"><h2><strong>The entire state of gaming handhelds will improve if you wait</strong></h2></p></div><p>But the most profound change, for many gamers, would be having a potent portable game system that just works. The original Nintendo Switch offered portability and ease of use, but it’s never been a powerhouse; almost all of today’s Windows handhelds are more powerful than a Switch 2 or a Steam Deck, but I can’t rely on them to wake and sleep and launch games reliably. </p><p>Excitingly, both Valve and Microsoft finally appear poised to fix that.</p><p>Valve is finally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/673114/valves-huge-steam-deck-update-is-now-ready-for-everyone-including-rival-amd-handhelds">bringing its pick-up-and-play SteamOS to other handhelds</a> beyond the Steam Deck, including official support for the Legion Go S and unofficial support for the Legion Go and Asus ROG Ally line. (But as I’ll explain, you might not want to rush out and download Valve’s recovery image just yet.)</p><p>Meanwhile, Microsoft has announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">a stripped-down version of Windows for gaming handhelds</a>, one that ditches the desktop in favor of an “Xbox full-screen experience” that will come to various handhelds next year, including the existing Ally and Ally X. It promises to improve sleep, wake, performance, and battery life while making non-Steam storefronts into first-class citizens. </p><p>Presumably, any major PC handheld will soon let you choose between Windows and Steam. But that’s not a reason to buy them today.</p><p>For one, it seems that both Microsoft and Valve are prioritizing their partners’ flashiest hardware launches first. The new Xbox-ified Windows will first arrive on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">a pair of “Xbox Ally” handhelds co-developed with Asus</a> this holiday season, which could suck all the air out of the room for rival Windows machines, particularly if Microsoft decides this is the moment to compete with Valve’s Steam Deck on price.</p><p>And while you can indeed install Valve’s big SteamOS update on rival Windows handhelds with AMD chips, it only fully supports the SteamOS version of the Lenovo Legion Go S at this point. When I tried installing it on an Asus ROG Ally or even the Windows version of the Legion Go S, it was missing necessary power modes to keep it from unnecessarily draining its own battery and had some bugs as well.</p><p>Here’s Valve’s Lawrence Yang to <em>The Verge</em> on the rollout plans:</p><div><blockquote><p><em>Currently, the SteamOS model of Legion Go S (dark purple model) is the only officially supported non-Steam Deck device with SteamOS. We are continuing to improve compatibility with more devices, starting with other AMD powered handhelds like the ROG Ally. Features like RGB controls and power management for the Ally are in the pipe, and will be noted in patch notes as we ship updates. </em></p><p><em>We’re looking at support across AMD powered handhelds, including Legion Go, Legion Go S + Windows, and ROG Ally models.</em></p></blockquote></div><p>Even the SteamOS version of the Legion Go S didn’t launch 100 percent baked: I keep seeing the tiny trackpad stop working properly (Valve tells me it’s investigating), and there’s no official way to control the RGB lighting. </p><p>Speaking of fully baked, it seems even Nintendo launched its Switch 2 with notable issues. We’ve heard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQG7R5mcHPE">reports of crashes</a> and freezes, an issue <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fau%2Fsupport%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-2-freezes-locks-up-or-will-not-power-off%2F" rel="sponsored">that has its own Nintendo support page</a>, and some (including me) have found intermittent issues getting a system to stay connected to wired ethernet. Many are having trouble <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688152/nintendo-switch-2-hdr-washed-out-bright-fix">getting content to display properly on a TV</a> without washing out or oversaturating. </p><p>It’s not clear when the biggest issues facing today’s gaming handhelds will get fixed, or how evenly distributed the fixes might be. I’m not saying that’s a reason to stay away for <em>long</em> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884863/valve-steam-deck-2-refresh-upgrade-cpu-2025">nobody’s expecting a Steam Deck 2</a> or a Switch 2 OLED anytime soon, so I don’t fear that particular flavor of buyer’s remorse. </p><p>But knowing what I know today, I wouldn’t rush to buy a handheld now. I’d wait a month or three until Switch 2 and Steam Deck OLED supplies return — or at least until the future of Windows and SteamOS get a little less fuzzy.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
