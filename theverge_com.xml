            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>For the last few years, subscription gaming services like Apple Arcade and Netflix have offered mobile game developers something of a haven for high-quality, premium mobile games: a type of game that had become vanishingly rare following the rise of the microtransaction-stuffed free-to-play model. But as these services’ once enviable lineup of indie games dwindles, that haven appears to be shrinking.</p><p>In 2021, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759628/netflix-games-global-rollout-mobile-android-devices">Netflix announced a new gaming initiative</a>, offering users a chance to play games through the streaming service’s mobile app. Apple launched a similar program <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/25/18280589/apple-arcade-gaming-subscription-release-date-pricing-features">with Apple Arcade</a> just two years before that. Both services offered an interesting value proposition: Pay a monthly subscription fee to get access to a library of premium games, with some of those games available as mobile exclusives. Those games would have no ads or in-app purchases, and the money paid to studios would ostensibly be used to fund the development of more games.</p><div><p>The games themselves covered an interesting range of genres and topics, from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/29/23378549/netflix-desta-the-memories-mobile-ustwo-games">strategy games featuring depression and dodgeball</a> to finding one’s place by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24206836/arranger-puzzle-game-review-netflix-summer-game-fest">literally rearranging the space around you</a>. Netflix funding something like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24190846/harmonium-the-musical-developer-interview-deaf-culture-experience">Harmonium: The Musical</a></em>, a game about a Deaf girl’s love of music, signaled that the platform was taking its gaming initiative seriously, bringing titles from off the beaten path to the platform. But now that game <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/netflix-games/harmonium-the-musical-no-longer-set-to-release-on-netflix-games/">appears to have been pulled</a> from Netflix’s lineup.</p></div><p>In addition to serving as a publisher, Netflix took the additional step of outright purchasing game studios like <em>Oxenfree</em> developer Night School Studio and <em>Cozy Grove</em> studio Spry Fox to make bespoke games for the service. But late last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276700/netflix-gaming-studio-closure-blue">Netflix closed down the studio</a> it spun up to produce what was going to be the service’s first blockbuster AAA game. Then, just this month, it announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692227/netflix-games-delisting-hades-braid-gaming-strategy">it was going to delist some of its most notable third-party titles</a>, including indie darlings like <em>Hades</em> and the <em>Monument Valley</em> series.</p><div><p>Netflix is increasingly focused on games tied to its own content. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/FINAL-Q2-25-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">the platform briefly extolled its continued investment</a> in titles like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/20/24325810/squid-game-unleashed-netflix-mobile-game">Squid Game: Unleashed</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645952/black-mirror-game-thronglets-season-7-netflix">Thronglets</a></em> — games tied to Netflix-produced<em> Squid Game</em> and <em>Black Mirror</em>, respectively.</p></div><p>This focus, though, seems to come at the expense of adding existing original games from independent developers. It’s easy to understand this shift. While these services don’t share much about hard numbers, third-party reporting suggested that the majority of Netflix users <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/8/23296545/netflix-games-1-percent-subscribers">never engaged with the platform’s gaming offerings</a>. And the games they were playing, in however limited amounts, were familiar titles. It’s no surprise that <em>GTA</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/23/24048412/gta-is-netflixs-biggest-gaming-launch-so-far">had Netflix’s biggest game launch</a>.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The </em>GTA series<em> are some of the most-played games on Netflix.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>At GDC 2025, Netflix’s president of games, Alain Tascan, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview">spoke to <em>The Verge</em> about the platform refocusing its gaming efforts</a>, saying of indie games, “We will continue supporting some of them, but I feel that indie gamers are not really coming to Netflix to find indie games.”</p><div><p>So far Apple has only <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675241/apple-game-center-app-replace-rac7-sneaky-sasquatch-acquisition">purchased a single game studio</a> to make content for Apple Arcade, though its retreat to more casual offerings follows a similar pattern as Netflix. Original or indie games appear less frequently in favor of those attached to big, family-friendly IP like <em>Uno</em>, <em>Angry Birds</em>, and <em>Bluey</em>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/newsroom/2025/06/apple-arcade-welcomes-nine-new-games/">all three of which are featured in Apple Arcade’s July update</a>. <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-apple-arcade-axed-games-declining-payouts-disillusioned-studios-and-an-uncertain-future/">Payouts from Apple Arcade have reportedly been shrinking</a> while developers have complained that it’s hard to get their games noticed on the platform.</p></div><p>The free-to-play model has conditioned users that spending money for gaming content can be optional. Casual games like <em>Monopoly Go</em> make money through in-game advertisements or opt-in consumer spending on microtransactions, and few traditional paid games outside of <em>Minecraft</em> are now able to break through that mindset.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20893691/apple-arcade-subscription-gaming-price-premium-games-zach-gage-noodlecake-snowman">Subscription services were viewed as a kind of equalizer</a>. With investment from Apple and Netflix and elsewhere, quality games could be brought to a platform not generally associated with quality gaming experiences. Developers could fund their vision and not have to worry about monetization, while consumers could access those games with a monthly subscription and no added costs.</p><p>But a few years in, the aim of these services has been adjusted, and casual games designed to keep eyeballs on an app for as long as possible, or promote the latest streaming series, have won out. Despite strong lineups of indie games, neither Netflix nor Apple could really cut through the noise, and their offerings are no longer unique. Worse still, the unique games they did have now have fewer places to go.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/analysis/711575/netflix-games-apple-arcade-mobile-games]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/report/711116/onexsugar-sugar-1-hands-on-preview-transforming-dual-screen</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/onexsugar-playing-with-the-first-dual-screen-transforming-handheld.1250187/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>I can’t believe they’re actually making these</em>, was my very first thought, as I powered on a working prototype of the OneXSugar Sugar 1.</p><p>This week, One-Netbook <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/onexsugar-1st-dual-screen-transformable-handheld">is crowdfunding a gaming handheld on Indiegogo</a> like none I’ve ever touched before. It’s got two OLED touchscreens, two power buttons, two sets of volume controls, and two <em>hinged rotating</em> gamepads that let it transform into entirely different modes.</p><p>Folded down, it’s like a Nintendo Switch, with a single 6-inch screen flanked by half-gamepads. Pop open the 3.92-inch secondary screen and rotate the gamepads, and it’s like a Nintendo DS with one screen on top of the other! Whichever mode you pick, the main controls instantly and automatically remap themselves to their new orientation.</p><p>And that’s just the start. Check out my video below for an extended look:</p><p>This is a handheld that can emulate Wii, GameCube, and play the most demanding Android games like <em>Genshin Impact</em> on high settings — and, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLRKYoReFI0">according to <em>RetroGameCorps</em></a>, its flagship Qualcomm Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 and 16GB of RAM can even play original Nintendo Switch games smoothly with <a href="https://github.com/K11MCH1/AdrenoToolsDrivers/releases/tag/v25.2.0-rc.14">the right drivers</a>.</p><p>But there’s only so much I can show you in a two-minute video, so I expect you’re wondering: just how competent is this handheld? How does it actually feel? Do you think it’ll be a worthy product by its planned September ship date? Will it be worth the $599 early bird price, let alone its now-revealed $799 MSRP?</p><p>I can’t say for sure — it’s a prototype, after all — but so far, the fun is outweighing the frustrations.</p><p>First, because I know you’ll ask: yes, the multitasking is real. I’ve played with dual-screen phones where the manufacturer artificially limits what you can do with the second screen, but that’s not happening here. You can send <em>any</em> app to either screen, even press a virtual button to swap which screen is “primary” as far as Android is concerned. You can turn off either screen to save battery, too, and use whichever you need. As I show in my video, there are all sorts of fun possibilities!</p><p>Second, I didn’t have to baby this prototype’s hinges, despite some worrying flex. I just flip them around and enjoy the loud <em>thock</em> as the pads magnetically snap into place. OneXSugar tells me the final hinges are SK7 tool steel and screwed directly into the aluminum alloy underframe, and will have more screws than the prototype. Still, I’m surprised the final hinge pins will still only attach to one half of the handheld’s frame rather than being sandwiched between top and bottom for more strength.</p><p>I’m continually surprised at how pleasant the Sugar 1 is to hold. The drift-resistant Hall effect joysticks and the microswitch buttons both feel smooth and responsive, and the grips feel quite sufficient in DS mode — with the secondary screen flipped out of the main body, it leaves a comfortable gap to place my fingers. The one notable caveat is there’s no real D-pad. OneXSugar includes a strong magnetic one that floats atop four face buttons of your choice, but I’m having trouble with accidental extra button presses that way; the buttons are better by themselves.</p><p>It’s not the mechanics that worry me most, despite many comments I’ve read about how unnecessarily fragile a multi-hinge device will be. What gives me pause is the software, which feels quite unfinished just over a month before it’s supposed to ship.</p><p>One-Netbook has been building miniature Windows laptops, tablets and handhelds for years now, but its first Android device will ship with the last-gen Android 14, with no promise of future upgrades for future game compatibility, and only a single “Sugar Console” app to make the OS gaming-handheld friendly.</p><p>Often, it works fine! But while I can generally just flip the controllers up or down and largely have gaming buttons instantly work the way my muscle memory expects, that’s not true of every button: the Start button, Android’s back button and the button that summons OneXSugar’s overlay are hard-coded for now, and I’ve had quite a few apps accidentally open or pause because I pressed the wrong button at the wrong time.</p><p>And since you can only swipe out of apps from the designated “primary” screen, I often try to close apps only to find it’s not working because I’m doing it the wrong way.</p><p>I’ve also had occasional issues charging the Sugar 1 reliably, or stretching some Android apps across both screens at the same time. Both are getting fixed in software, according to the company.</p><p>Though the Sugar 1’s primary selling point is the flexibility of its twin OLED screens, I was surprised to find OneXSugar doesn’t yet have a way to resize your games to use those screens optimally — it only offers the equivalent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat_(picture_framing)">picture frame matting</a> to minimize the black borders you see. In order to play Nintendo DS and SNES games at their proper aspect ratios on the Sugar 1, I was at the mercy of the resizing, window dragging, and arranging tools each emulator offers.</p><p>Some of the Android games I was able to download didn’t run properly quite yet, as they apparently haven’t yet whitelisted Qualcomm’s new handheld chip; <em>Fortnite</em> refused to run entirely, and <em>Genshin Impact</em> complained about overloading the processor as I ramped up the settings, even as the game seemed to run smoothly.</p><p>I wasn’t able to download a lot of native Android titles to begin with: prototypes went out to reviewers without any Google apps or the Google Play Store. That drastically limited what I was able to test, as many top English-language Android games require Google components, and many top Chinese-language games require Chinese logins. The company confirms to <em>The Verge</em> that final units will ship with Google Play, though.</p><p>Lastly, I suspect you’re curious about the battery life from its 21.5Wh pack, I won’t be able to give you a good idea yet because my tool was clearly misreporting the battery drain. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLRKYoReFI0">Over at <em>Retro</em> <em>Game Corps</em></a>, Russ seems to be seeing anywhere from 1 to 12 hours depending on the title.</p><p>I’ve seen lots of zany and droolworthy gaming prototypes in my 15-plus years covering gadgets, but transforming ones like this typically never ship because they’re too complicated and too niche to be worth a manufacturer’s trouble. But One-Netbook, a brand that’s built a reputation <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/21/24161887/onexplayer-x1-mini-handheld-gaming-pc-ssd">for modular portable computers,</a> sees this as an opportunity to make a splash in the crowded Android market, VP Jason Zeng tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>He says the goal was to “create something different,” and that his company actually wants to release more such splashy products in the future. For now, its gaming handheld efforts are indeed niche: the 200-person company has only sold around 100,000 pieces, Zeng estimates on a call, with 60 percent of those sales in China. But he says the US is One Netbook’s fastest growing market, and the company sees Android devices as a more affordable way to access a larger population of customers than it’s done with Windows handhelds so far.</p><p>One-Netbook has no plans for Windows on ARM yet, Zeng tells us, but would like to connect with Valve. He says the company would find it “very interesting” to discuss a potential SteamOS handheld.</p><div><div><p id="onexsugar-sugar-1-specs"><h2>OneXSugar Sugar 1 specs</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>6.01-inch 1080 x 2160 60Hz 450-nit OLED primary screen (18:9)</span></li><li><span>3.92-inch 1080 x 1240 60Hz 450-nit OLED secondary screen (8:7)</span></li><li><span>Qualcomm Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 8-core (1+5+2) w/ Adreno A32 GPU</span></li><li><span>16GB RAM (8533MHz), 512GB storage (UFS 4.0)</span></li><li><span>MicroSD expansion up to 1TB (UHS-I)</span></li><li><span>21.5Wh battery (5600mAh), bundled 45W charger</span></li><li><span>Hall effect joysticks</span></li><li><span>Microswitches for face, shoulder, and trigger buttons</span></li><li><span>Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.3</span></li><li><span>USB-C x1 10Gbps w/ 1080p60 DP output and USB-OTG mode</span></li><li><span>Aluminum internal frame overmolded with PC+ABS plastic composite; SK7 steel hinges</span></li><li><span>Stereo speakers, single microphone</span></li><li><span>1.07 lbs (486.3g)</span></li><li><span>Android 14</span></li></ul></div></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/711116/onexsugar-sugar-1-hands-on-preview-transforming-dual-screen]]></content:encoded>
