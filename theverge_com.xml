            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Nintendo’s latest livestreamed event is highlighting the smattering of indie games coming to the Switch consoles later this year, and the Indie World Showcase is scheduled to start on Thursday, August 7th, at 9 AM ET.</p><p><em>Hades 2</em> might make an appearance, and there’s a slim chance the long-awaited <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> might show up as well. It’s a 15-minute showcase, and while I’m not expecting any earth-shattering announcements, I am looking forward to seeing the games that’ll pad my Switch 2 library while I wait for news on the bigger titles like <em>Metroid Prime 4.</em></p><div><p>In its recent earnings report, Nintendo shared that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/718176/thats-a-lot-of-mario-karts">it sold nearly six million Switch 2 consoles</a> since the system’s launch in June, so there are a lot of people waiting for some new games to play, indie or otherwise. Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717610/nintendo-switch-original-price-increase">has also raised the price of the original Switch</a> in response to US tariff policy.</p></div><p>Even though there aren’t that many Switch 2 exclusives out there yet, Nintendo, through <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/718847/whats-better-than-one-nintendo-direct-two">back-to-back</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/716586/nintendo-partner-direct-july-2025-news-trailers">directs</a>, is working to ensure people know what other games will be available to play. This event is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mTv0HmKoUqw?si=CRv9AcQV-tALADGL">streaming live on YouTube</a>, and you can read on below for all of the updates as they’re announced.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article"><div><p>Don’t forget to like and sub-die.</p><p><em>Content Warning</em> was one of the games featured during the Nintendo Indie World presentation, coming exclusively to the Nintendo Switch 2 next year. In the game, you and three friends journey underwater to film spooky goings-on in order to go viral, but there’s a catch. You might die...<em>horribly</em>.</p><p><em>Content Warning</em> blew up on Steam joining the likes of similar co-op chaos games including <em>Phasmophobia</em> and <em>Lethal Company</em>. The game will make extensive use of the Switch 2 gamechat features and I hope there’s a setting where, if you’re using a camera, you can put your friends actual faces on their avatars. We’ll see if my wish comes true when <em>Content Warning</em> launches next year.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Love a good stealth launch.</p><p>During Nintendo’s Indie World showcase, we got a bunch of games coming out in the nearterm, like <em><a href="https://youtu.be/Uvho9b_hq8Y?si=Mf1L7qMVHu943F2c">Herdling</a></em>, out on August 21st. There are also games coming out in the nebulous future of 2026 like <a href="https://youtu.be/_IkNnvX8Mvo?si=6D--yisFH1dyW9MF"><em>Neverway</em></a>. But there were some games featured that are just coming out today like <em>Is This Seat Taken</em>?</p><p><em>Is This Seat Taken? </em>is a cozy puzzle game where you arrange people according to their preferences. A set of clues tells you who likes what, and its your job to put them in the most appropriate place like the world’s most powerful wedding planner. And best of all, the game launches today on Nintendo Switch.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>UFO Soft just launched their next game on the Switch.</p><p>That’s <em>UFO 50</em>. Each game represents the journey of the hardware and you get to see how the technology and development skills develop over time just like they do across a real console’s lifetime. And what if I told you that you could play this collection of 50 games on the Switch today? Because you can.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Well this game certainly looks cool.</p><p>In the thick of the Indie World presentation and I can’t help but be powerfully intrigued by <em>Well Dweller</em>. <em>Well Dweller</em>, created by the developer of <em>Crypt Custodian</em> and <em>Islets</em>, is a metroidvania (or search action game, if you like) with an interesting artstyle.</p><p>You play as a bird with a matchstick, sent out to save her species from an evil and queen and seeing all the platforming and progression unlocking weapons, I think this is the kind of game I’m looking for right now. But unfortunately, I’ll have to wait for its release sometime next year.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Wanna get hollowed?</p><p>During the Nintendo Indie World showcase, <em>Mina The Hollower</em> was announced for the Nintendo Switch. Earlier this year the game got a notoriety boost with a demo being featured during Steam Next Fest. And the retro-style, <em>A Link To The Past</em>-looking game featuring a very cute sword-swinging mouse also has a demo out now on the Switch. Not too long to wait now, Mina the Hollower comes out on Switch and PC October 31st.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>What’s better than one Nintendo Direct? Two.</p><p>Nintendo has some more games to show us. After the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/716586/nintendo-partner-direct-july-2025-news-trailers">Partner Direct showcase last week</a>, Nintendo has announced yet another showcase, this time an Indie World presentation, for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTv0HmKoUqw">Thursday, August 7th, at 9AM ET on YouTube</a>. The presentation will be 15 minutes long which is plenty of time to share at least one new trailer for <em>Silksong</em>.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NzE3MTYz" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717163/nintendo-earnings-q1-2025-switch-2-sales">Nintendo’s Switch 2 doubles first-month sales of the original</a></h2><div><p>Nintendo’s financial year is off to a bumper start thanks to explosive sales of its Switch 2 console. Following its launch in June, the Switch 2 console has now sold 5.82 million units according to <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf">Nintendo’s Q1 earnings report</a>, more than double the 2.7 million unit sales achieved by the original Switch in its first month.</p><p>“Currently, demand for Nintendo Switch 2 is exceeding supply in many countries, and we regret the inconvenience this is causing our consumers,” Nintendo said in its report, pledging to strengthen production. While Switch 2 preorders sold out across major retailers in the US ahead of the launch, some limited stock was still available on launch day, likely because Nintendo had built up enough inventory to meet initial demand.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717163/nintendo-earnings-q1-2025-switch-2-sales">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>I see a new Hades II update.</p></div></li></ul></section></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/719807/nintendo-switch-2-indie-world-direct-showcase-livestream]]></content:encoded>
