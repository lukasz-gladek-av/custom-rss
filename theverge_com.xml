Nvidia has been gradually improving its new app over the past 18 months since its release, and it’s getting closer to fully migrating all the legacy control panel options.</p><p>This week’s Nvidia app update will include anisotropic filtering, anti-aliasing, and ambient occlusion options, meaning you won’t have to navigate to Nvidia’s older control panel app to improve classic games. The setup tool for Nvidia Surround will also be part of the Nvidia app now.</p><p>You also won’t have to configure DLSS override features on a per game basis anymore, as Nvidia is now adding a global option. You can set your DLSS preferences across all override supported games, and Nvidia’s overlay will also show which DLSS settings are active if you toggle this option on.</p><p>Nvidia is also bringing its <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fnvidia-app-update-dlss-overrides-and-more%2F%23nvidia-smooth-motion&amp;xcust=__vg0818awD__602963__________________google.com" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored" target="_blank">new Smooth Motion feature</a>, which was previously exclusive to RTX 50-series GPUs, to all RTX 40-series owners. It’s a driver-based AI model that enables smoother gameplay for games that don’t support DLSS Frame Generation. Smooth Motion can be applied to games running with DLSS Super Resolution, at native resolution, or even titles with other upscaling technologies. Nvidia says it will typically double “the perceived frame rate.”</p><p>If you’re a fan of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/635155/nvidia-g-assist-ai-assistant-available-download">Nvidia’s G-Assist AI assistant</a>, Nvidia is changing the AI model behind the scenes so it will use 40 percent less memory. The smaller footprint won’t affect performance either, as it’s designed to respond even faster to queries.</p><p>These latest Nvidia app changes will arrive on August 19th for beta users at 9AM PT / 12PM ET, followed by a general release next week.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/760488/nvidia-app-dlss-override-control-panel-features]]></content:encoded>

Nvidia, Discord, and Epic Games have teamed up for an early test of instant game demos for Discord servers, which could theoretically let you immediately try a game without buying it, downloading it, or signing up for an account.</p><div><p>Sound familiar?

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft hints at ‘more affordable’ Xbox Cloud Gaming plan]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/760813/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-new-price-plan-hint</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-hints-at-%E2%80%98more-affordable%E2%80%99-xbox-cloud-gaming-plan.1273062/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Two years ago we learned, thanks to the FTC, that Microsoft was working on a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/22/23770460/microsoft-xbox-xcloud-gaming-subscription">separate “dedicated” version</a> of Xbox Cloud Gaming. Microsoft Gaming CFO Tim Stuart then hinted, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/13/23999661/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-free-version-ads">a few months later</a>, that there could be a free version Xbox Cloud Gaming in exchange for ads. Now, Microsoft is hinting at making Xbox Cloud Gaming “more affordable” again.</p><p>Jason Ronald, Microsoft’s VP of Next Generation, has appeared on the company’s official Xbox podcast today, to discuss Xbox Cloud Gaming, Xbox Play Anywhere, and Microsoft’s next-gen chip partnership with AMD. At the moment Xbox Cloud Gaming is only part of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, meaning you have to pay $19.99 a month to get access to xCloud.</p><p>“One of the things we see is there’s a lot of players who use Game Pass Ultimate to access the cloud, whether that’s the primary way they play, or an additional way to play on the go,” says Ronald. “I think for us, it really opens up the opportunity to make it much more affordable, and make it more accessible to players. Whether that’s going into new regions, or new ways to actually access the [Xbox] cloud.”</p><p>Microsoft’s hints of a more affordable version of Xbox Cloud Gaming come just hours before Nvidia has some “major” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760527/nvidia-geforce-now-major-news-gamescom-stream">GeForce Now news</a>. Nvidia’s cloud gaming service is far superior to Xbox Cloud Gaming, thanks to PC-powered performance, better bitrates, higher resolution gameplay, and lower latency. Microsoft has even integrated GeForce Now into its own Xbox game pages.</p><p>Ronald stops short of announcing a new Xbox Cloud Gaming tier, but it’s clear that’s been Microsoft’s thinking for a few years now. Microsoft started expanding Xbox Cloud Gaming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24300547/xbox-cloud-gaming-game-library-streaming">beyond just the Game Pass library</a> last year, with the ability to stream games you own as long as you’re an Ultimate subscriber.</p><p>There’s an opportunity to bring that Ultimate paywall down, especially for mobile streaming. Microsoft had planned to sell games directly in its Xbox app for Android and allow customers to immediately stream those games directly to their phones and tablets, but a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313976/microsoft-google-xbox-app-android-future-notepad">legal battle</a> has put those plans on hold.</p><p>Microsoft is currently preparing the next generation of Xbox Cloud Gaming, alongside its next-gen Xbox console work. “Together with AMD, we’re designing dedicated silicon and hardware to enable the next generation of gaming experiences,” says Ronald. “We’re investing deeply in the next generation of rendering technologies, such as neural rendering, which will bring a new level of quality to the games that you’re having.”</p><p>That next generation of Xbox hardware will likely see Xbox and Windows move even closer together, alongside the choice of different stores for Xbox owners. It’s also an opportunity for Microsoft to bring more AI-powered features to the next Xbox.</p><p>“We’re also investing in dedicated silicon to enable the next generation of AI capabilities, that will be transformative in how you actually experience your gameplay,” says Ronald. Microsoft will “start experimenting” with some of these AI-powered features on the upcoming Xbox Ally X device, because it has a dedicated NPU chip just like Microsoft’s Copilot Plus PCs.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/760813/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-new-price-plan-hint]]></content:encoded>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Roblox is updating its policies prohibiting romantic or sexual content to also forbid “content, settings, or behavior that <em>implies</em> sexual activity,” according to a Friday post <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/extending-roblox-policy-on-romantic-and-sexual-content">from chief safety officer Matt Kaufman</a> (emphasis Kaufman’s).</p><p>The changes follow recent lawsuits against the company, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760162/roblox-louisiana-lawsuit-child-predators-safety">one from</a> Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill that alleges the platform creates an environment where “child predators thrive.” It claims Roblox has “directly facilitated the widespread sexual exploitation of minors and inflicted severe, lasting harm upon the children of Louisiana.”</p><p>In response, Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/roblox-responds-to-louisiana-ag-lawsuit">said that</a> “any assertion that Roblox would intentionally put our users at risk of exploitation is simply untrue.” Roblox has rolled out many safety-focused features in recent months, including an age estimator tool for users to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/708670/roblox-trusted-connections-age-estimation-privacy">verify they are over 13</a> so they can chat with “Trusted Connections,” accounts parents can use to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/18/24298330/roblox-child-safety-chat-parent-accounts">remotely manage their kids’ accounts</a>, and blocking kids under 13 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289837/roblox-banning-preteens-social-hangout-spaces">from accessing</a> social hangout spaces. “Fix it, or shut it down!” <a href="https://x.com/AGLizMurrill/status/1956466102365561137">Murrill replied</a>.</p><p>According to Kaufman’s post, in the “coming months,” Roblox will restrict all unrated experiences — previously restricted to players who are 13 or older — to just the developer and anyone “actively working on the experience.” If a developer wants to make these experiences public, they will have to fill out a questionnaire to receive a content maturity label.</p><p>Roblox is also rolling out “new technology to detect violative scenes,” which is intended to detect user behavior that violates Roblox’s rules in experiences that are otherwise compliant with its policies, such as inappropriate drawings in an experience with a drawing feature. “If this feature detects a server with a high volume of violative user behavior, the system will automatically take that server down,” Kaufman says.</p><p>Social hangout spaces depicting private spaces like bedrooms and bathrooms, as well as experiences primarily set in private spaces and in places like virtual bars and clubs, will now only be available to users who are 17 or older and have verified their ID. Developers will have to verify that they are 17 years or older if they want to make an experience for users in that same age group.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/760805/roblox-sexual-content-lawsuit-age-verification]]></content:encoded>
