            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you told me last year the Nex Playground would outsell Microsoft’s Xbox, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/844380/nex-playground-outselling-the-xbox">even for two weeks</a>, I would have laughed my way out of the room.</p><p>It’s a three-inch cube of a game console that’s likely less powerful than your phone, one which uses a single camera to track your body. It only plays curated, <a href="https://www.kidsafeseal.com/aboutourseals.html">certified kid-safe</a> games. Though frequently compared to the Nintendo Wii and Microsoft Kinect, the Nex Playground is worse than either at tracking motion.</p><p>Nor is it cheap: $250 upfront <em>plus</em> $89-a-year or $49-a-quarter annual subscription to get more than a basic sampler. If you like a game, you can’t buy it separately. Many are little better than shovelware and most are graphically ugly; I haven’t tried a single game with the charm or polish of Nintendo or the best of Apple Arcade.</p><p>And yet, lying sick in bed with a 99-degree fever, my five-year-old begged me to let her play.</p><p>When we started a game of virtual bowling, even Grandpa wanted in. (Grandpa <em>never</em> wants in.)</p><p>“I want to try again!” said my nine-year-old, after she sent her low-rent airplane plummeting to its doom.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>This one wide-angle camera tracks up to four people.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>They didn’t care that the games were bad. They cared that they were dead simple to pick up and play, no controller and no experience necessary, on a big screen. They cared that the games made them dance and jump and swing their arms, and that their dad looked pretty funny doing the same.</p><p>I just wish the games didn’t make them cry, too.</p><p>Nearly 20 years ago, the Nintendo Wii put an infrared camera and an accelerometer in your hand to tell if you moved your arm fast, slow, closer or further, and track basic orientation. A few years later, Microsoft’s Kinect captured your whole body with no controller at all: it painted your room with a structured pattern of infrared light to estimate your skeletal position in 3D space.</p><p>The Playground is different: a single wide-angle camera up front and HDMI and USB-C power around back, nothing else to plug in. But it also doesn’t “see” 3D depth. It has to estimate your body pose from flat images.</p><div id=":R1j1djeab96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>“Holding” my bowling ball with a six-joint skeletal pose.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The bowling game has fun Christmas unlockables like a gingerbread ball and toy nutcracker pins.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>Sometimes, it’s impressive: by identifying just six joints — shoulders, elbows, hands — you can throw a bowling ball straight down the lane or veer it left and right. But with no real depth perception, it can easily get confused: my nine-year-old couldn’t sit on the couch while my five-year-old was bowling several feet ahead, because the Playground assumed all their limbs belonged to the same person. My youngest cried for several minutes when the eldest raised a hand and accidentally stole her turn.</p><p>Soon it was the eldest’s turn to cry, too, when the Playground lost her hand mid-swing and sent her ball careening into the gutter. She got mad when it happened again.</p><p>There are <em>so</em> many things that can confuse single-camera tracking, and Nex knows it. Warnings include: Don’t wear clothing with repeating patterns. Don’t wear long sleeves. Play in a well-lit room, but not <em>back</em>lit. “Avoid non-players in the camera view.”</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The USB-C power cable comes with a detachable magnetic camera privacy cover</em>.</figcaption></p></div><p>These all help a single camera tell people from their background — but parents know some are harder than they sound! Our kids get game time after their evening bath, which means PJs. Have you seen kids’ PJs? They have long sleeves and repeating patterns. Hearts. Stars. Smiley faces. Repeating cats and unicorns till the cows come home.</p><p>We had to roll up sleeves and rethink seating. Realistically, “Avoid non-players in the camera view” meant clearing the entire living room of anyone who wasn’t bowling, having them stand far off to the side, so that the camera didn’t suddenly snap to the wrong person mid-play. Sometimes we could sit on the couch with hands hidden behind blankets or laptops.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The bundled remote. Most games make you switch to it for navigating menus; rarely used for gameplay.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Even so, my kids frequently got too frustrated with the controls. “I can’t keep my hand steady! I just can’t keep it steady!” complained my five-year-old, trying to send her cute puppy for a spa treatment in Nex’s <em>Nintendogs</em>-like game. Many games don’t penalize kids for swinging their arms wildly, but some inexplicably require dragging a cursor to press virtual buttons.</p><p>It also feels like the Playground lags behind my movements, even plugged directly into a low-latency OLED TV with Game Mode turned on. In Nex’s kart racer game, I couldn’t turn the steering wheel as fast as I wanted in its fastest 150cc mode.</p><p>Again, the issues didn’t stop us from having fun, particularly when with games that don’t require precision. The kids had a blast <a href="https://www.nexplayground.com/games/mirrorama">with <em>Mirrorama</em></a><em>,</em> which turns your TV into a giant mirror with magical camera filters that let kids shoot lightning bolts from their hands, stretch their face, blur like as speedy as Sonic the Hedgehog, dance with their own clone.</p><p><sup><em>Mirrorama, above, made my kids laugh the most. </em></sup></p><p>They enjoyed <a href="https://www.nexplayground.com/games/copy-cat-deluxe"><em>Copy Cat</em></a>, where they just had to strike a zany cartoon pose and let AI judge who did it better. Meanwhile, I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwBAO7kifFA"><em>Brick Buster</em></a> to be an excellent Breakout clone — you only need move your body left or right to move the paddle, which is forgivingly large, and thrilling multiball action makes it fun.</p><p>I can’t say we’d get our money’s worth, though, because so many games are simple and inanely repetitive, or — like <em>Connect 4</em> <em>Bounce</em>, where my kid and I gave up trying to get balls to even go in — frustrating from the get-go. Many sports games are either laughably easy or have a large learning curve because the camera can’t see depth, so it can’t detect how you’re hitting a ball. With tennis, for example, you can’t aim with your arm: it only controls the timing of your swing. You have to move the rest of your body to aim left or right.</p><p>One of Nex’s biggest marketing points is that it’s already attracted huge kid brands to the platform: Bluey, Peppa Pig, Gabby’s Dollhouse, Sesame Street, How to Train Your Dragon, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. But my kids weren’t necessarily sold.</p><p><sup><em>Bluey, is one of the better licensed experiences — but my Bluey-loving kids weren’t that into it.</em></sup></p><p>They seemed entranced at first with <a href="https://www.nexplayground.com/games/unicorn-academy-friendship-adventures"><em>Unicorn Academy</em></a>, but quickly disappointed when they couldn’t ride the unicorn anywhere interesting. The TMNT game is a frustrating endless runner where you constantly have to hop into the air to clear obstacles, though I suppose it could help tire out my kids. And even though they love <em>Bluey</em>, my kids quickly asked me to quit its too-repetitive balloon-bouncing game.</p><p>There’s enough in the Playground’s library that I bet your kids will find <em>something</em> they enjoy. My eldest wants to go visit her puppy, and the other night at dinner, my youngest erupted into cheers of “Bowling!!! I love bowling!!!” when we said we might play it again. Despite countless tracking failures, they say that Nex’s <em>Flappy Bird</em> clone, where up to four people hop in the air to keep their dragons eating fruit instead of crashing into towers, is one of their favs.</p><p>I think the Playground is far too much money for not nearly enough game. But it goes to show fun isn’t all about quality of execution. Many classic arcade games are frustratingly unfair, even broken — but sometimes you just want another turn to beat the machine.</p><p><em>Photography by Sean Hollister / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/848449/nex-playground-review-nintendo-wii-microsoft-kinect-motion-tracking-camera]]></content:encoded>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>On Friday, retro and arcade game publisher ININ Games surprisingly announced it’s been able to “recalculate production” on offering a physical version of <em>R-Type Dimensions III </em>for the Switch 2 because “Two days ago Nintendo announced two new smaller cartridge sizes for Nintendo Switch 2.” Physical games on the Switch 2 have been something of a contentious topic; full physical games are reportedly expensive for developers, while game-key cards don’t actually have the game on the cart.</p><p>But later in the day, ININ removed that line from its post and published <a href="https://x.com/ININ_Games/status/2002062795857174721">a significant correction</a>: “There has been no official announcement or confirmation from Nintendo concerning cartridge storage capacities. Any references to specific storage sizes should not be interpreted as official information from Nintendo.” However, it will still be able to offer the physical Switch 2 version of <em>R-Type Dimensions III</em>, though by tacking on €10 to the retail price.</p><p>Nintendo didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Solid information about why more developers don’t offer games fully on-cartridge is hard to find, though it may come down to cost. In May, a Brazilian Nintendo journalist <a href="https://x.com/necrolipe/status/1921315639563608384?s=19">reported that</a>, based on leaks from Arc System Works, Nintendo only offered two types of physical games for developers: a 64GB cartridge and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/643635/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-explained">game-key card</a>. The YouTube channel Physical Paradise has <a href="https://youtu.be/x1wCUjEwklg?si=PhTU7qqhdB_t7nFT&amp;t=274">also reported that</a> the cost of a physical cartridge is “about” $16, “which is quite expensive.”</p><p>Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad, replying to ININ Games’ initial announcement about the new cartridge sizes, <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/2002066817704194487">said on X that</a> “cost was always the primary factor between key cards vs full cart releases.”</p><div><div><p id="do-you-know-the-actual-cost-of-switch-2-cartridges"><h2>Do you know the actual cost of Switch 2 cartridges?</h2></p></div><p>If you do, please email me at jay.peters@theverge.com or message me on Signal @jaypeters.11.</p></div><p>It’s unclear exactly how much more affordable additional cartridge capacity sizes could be or why the company might offer them to developers now. New York University games professor Joost van Dreunen tells me it could be because of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/839353/pc-ram-shortage-pricing-spike-news">rising cost of memory</a>; his two cents is that this “is in anticipation of memory going up in cost soon, allowing Nintendo to charge a more reasonable price especially for third-party games.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/848462/nintendo-switch-2-smaller-cartridges-inin-games]]></content:encoded>
