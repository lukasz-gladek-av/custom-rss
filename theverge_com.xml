Not to worry; I’ve got you covered for some of the best ones.</p><p>This week’s trailers included a teaser for Netflix’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284809/squid-game-season-2-teaser-trailer">second season of <em>Squid Game</em></a><em>, </em>a new haunted house horror film from Steven Soderbergh, and a look at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285689/disney-plus-star-wars-skeleton-crew-trailer-wild-ride"><em>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew</em></a>. Daniel Craig showed up in a trailer for a new A24 movie called <em>Queer.</em> </p><p><h3>Squid Game season 2</h3></p><p><em>Squid Game</em> is finally returning for its second season soon, and in a new teaser, Lee Jung-jae’s Gi-hun looks like he’s preparing to stage an uprising. Whatever happens, it looks like the season will be a bloody, violent return for the dystopian competition on December 26th.</p><p><h3>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew</h3></p><p>I’m very excited that Jude Law’s <em>Star Wars </em>debut, <em>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, </em>is essentially a swashbuckling pirate adventure. The vibes it’s throwing off feel like a nice blend of <em>The Goonies</em> and <em>Star Trek: Prodigy, </em>and I’m certainly ready. The series debuts December 3rd on Disney Plus.</p><p><h3>Presence</h3></p><p>The moody trailer for Steven Soderbergh’s haunted house horror film <em>Presence </em>doesn’t show the supernatural figure that’s terrorizing Lucy Liu and her suburban family. That’s because it all takes place from the perspective of the ghost itself, which I didn’t realize until I read <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/trailers/presence-trailer-steven-soderbergh-horror-1236195815/"><em>Variety’</em>s write-up of this trailer</a>. It’s already an eerie preview, but knowing that made it much more so on my second viewing. The movie hits theaters on January 24th.</p><p><h3>Queer</h3></p><p>Luca Guadagnino’s <em>Queer, </em>based on William Burroughs’ semi-autobiographical novel of the same name, stars Daniel Craig as William Lee, an American expat who lives in 1950s Mexico City and falls for a younger man named Eugene (Drew Starkey). Having already gotten showings at the Venice Film Festival, some reviews have praised it for <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/queer-review-luca-guadagnino-daniel-craig-venice-film-festival-1236076219/">Daniel Craig’s performance</a> and <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/queer-review-daniel-craig-luca-guadagninos-1235986089/">Guadagnino’s “trippy” direction</a>. <em>Queer </em>releases <a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/05a98e4d-2610-420f-ab75-503e09238d6e">on November 27th</a>.</p><p><h3>Xenoblade Chronicles X</h3></p><div><p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284092/nintendo-is-keeping-things-interesting">continued to <em>not</em> reveal</a> the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284092/nintendo-is-keeping-things-interesting">successor to the Switch</a> in a batch of announcements this week that included the surprise launch of a new music streaming app that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284073/nintendo-music-streaming-app-switch-online-subscribers">only plays Nintendo songs</a>, the release of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282741/xenoblade-chronicles-x-nintendo-switch-release-date-march-2025"><em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em></a> as a paid app, and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282741/xenoblade-chronicles-x-nintendo-switch-release-date-march-2025">remaster of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em></a>, a 2015 Monolith Soft action RPG. The game will be available on March 20th, 2025, for the Nintendo Switch.</p></div><p><h3>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</h3></p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180608/mario-and-luigi-brothership-release-date-nintendo-direct"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em></a> got a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/2/24286150/yo-ho-row-ho-with-mario-luigi">new trailer</a> this week, backed by a banger of a sea shanty that’s been stuck in my head all day today. The latest game in the <em>Mario &amp; Luigi</em> RPG series puts the brothers on a seafaring adventure that continues to make the Switch an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24162364/paper-mario-rpg-nintendo-switch">excellent Nintendo console for <em>Mario </em>RPG games</a>. It’s available November 7th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/2/24284956/windblown-roguelikes-friends-multiplayer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some of the most beloved roguelikes are single-player — the likes of <em>Hades</em>, <em>Balatro</em>, and <em>Dead Cells</em> are all solo titles. But <em>Windblown</em>, the new roguelike from Motion Twin, the studio that created <em>Dead Cells</em>, showed me just how cool it can be to play a roguelike with other people.</p><p>In <em>Windblown</em>, your character, one of a few adorable animal adventurers like an axolotl or a bat, is shot out of a cannon into a mysterious giant tornado to fight your way through various zones. Like <em>Dead Cells</em>, you can equip up to two main weapons. I typically have one for close-range bouts and another for long-distance attacks. But with every weapon, you’re also able to pull off a combo that uses a special move from the <em>other weapon</em> called an “Alterattack.”</p><p>Here’s an example. I love using a crossbow to attack enemies from a distance, and I pair it with a giant heavy blade. I rarely use the blade on its own; instead, I use its Alterattack that cracks open the earth in a straight line to continue to wallop on enemies at range. That turns a run into a steady rhythm of slinging arrows and using the Alterattack at <em>exactly</em> the right time, and with my five hours so far with the game, I haven’t gotten tired of the pattern.</p><p><em>Windblown</em> just launched in early access, and you can already unlock more than a dozen weapons, meaning there are a lot of combinations that I haven’t messed around with. And with four different biomes to get through on a run, there’s a lot to see, too.</p><div><figcaption><em>The bosses are no joke.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Motion Twin</cite></p></div><p>All of that would be enough to make <em>Windblown</em> part of my regular rotation of roguelikes I use to wind down at the end of a long day. But the game’s multiplayer is making <em>Windblown</em> the game I turn to every time I turn on my Steam Deck.</p><p><em>Windblown’s</em> multiplayer lobbies, which you unlock fairly early on, let you play a full run with a team of three people. You can use voice and text chat to communicate, but it’s not required; I haven’t used those at all, instead relying on four in-game emoji. I also like that you can name your lobbies. I created one titled “help me get 1st win” and immediately had two helpful people join up to help me tackle the tornado. (Sadly, we did not get the win.)&nbsp;</p><p>When playing solo, I’ve found that I’m somewhat cautious and strategic as I think about how to use weapons and positioning to take on the game’s aggressive enemies and dodge their attacks. With the help of a team, battles are speedier and become delightful explosions of light, color, sound, and damage. It’s <em>so</em> fun to absolutely annihilate baddies with other people, and it’s comforting to know that they’ve got your back in a pinch.</p><p>There are <em>a lot</em> of great roguelikes to play right now; <em>Hades II</em> just got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271897/hades-ii-2-major-update-olympic">a huge update</a>, <em>Balatro</em> is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">nearly impossible</a> to put down (especially now that it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24256010/how-to-play-balatro-mobile-localthunk-playstack">on mobile</a>), and I’ve wanted to get back into <em>Shogun Showdown</em>, which I think <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/15/24243908/shogun-showdown-review">everyone is sleeping on</a>. <em>Windblown</em> needed more than just its Motion Twin pedigree to stand out, but so far, the multiplayer is the hook that keeps me coming back.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
