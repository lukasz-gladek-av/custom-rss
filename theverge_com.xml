            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350273/pocketpair-palworld-indie-publishing-label-surgent-studios<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Pocketpair is getting into the games publishing business. <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20250123">The company has announced</a> that it’s taking the gobs of money it made after launching <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/22/24047087/palworld-early-access-steam-xbox-gamepass"><em>Palworld</em></a>, the Steam-record busting, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-sells-15-million-on-steam-in-a-month">15-million-copies-sold-in-its-first-month</a>, monster-catching adventure game, to establish Pocketpair Publishing.</p></div><p>“Pocketpair Publishing provides comprehensive support for game development through funding, development assistance, and publishing for indie game developers and small studios,” Pocketpair wrote in its press release.  </p><p>We don’t even have to wait long for the company’s first game. Pocketpair Publishing has teamed up with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24146692/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review-metroidvania-platformer"><em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em></a><em> </em>developer Surgent Studios to produce its next title, a horror game slated for release later this year. Surgent Studios was founded by video game voice performer and on-screen actor Abubakar Salim. After launching <em>Tales of Kenzera</em>, an afro-futuristic metroidvania, the company was forced <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/takes-of-kenzera-zau-dev-surgent-studios-puts-entire-games-team-on-hiatus-due-to-lack-of-funding">to furlough its games division</a> due to lack of funding — a common occurrence that’s become endemic over the last two years.</p><p>The indie game space has not been insulated from the effects of the layoff crisis that’s plagued the game industry. The big publishers, from which smaller indie outfits typically receive funding, are tightening their belts, choosing to either keep their cash or only dole it out to projects they believe are sure to make money. And even the publishers known for supporting quality indie games, like Annapurna Games, are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/9/12/24243317/annapurna-interactive-staff-reportedly-resigns">having a hard time staying in operation</a>. </p><p>However, Pocketpair Publishing joins a group of new companies that have entered the indie games space via non-traditional means. In 2022, YouTube video game critic and content creator videogamedunkey, created his own publishing company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/22/23365263/videogamedunkey-publishing-company-bigmode">Bigmode</a> which published its first game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24162572/animal-well-platforming-difficulty-bigmode"><em>Animal Well</em></a><em>,</em> to critical acclaim last year. Also last year, Innersloth, developers of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221075/among-us-2020-most-downloaded-mobile-game">wildly-popular murder mystery multiplayer game <em>Among Us</em></a>, <a href="https://www.innersloth.com/outersloth/">established Outersloth</a>, which is an indie game fund rather than a traditional publisher. Like Outersloth and Bigmode, Pocketpair Publishing is seeking to parlay its commercial success into an avenue for more indie games like <em>Palworld </em>to get made.</p><p>“Game development comes with many challenges,” said Pocketpair Publishing head John Buckley. “But we want to ease that process as much as possible and provide an environment where creators can pursue their dreams.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
