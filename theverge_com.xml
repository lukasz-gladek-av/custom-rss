            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/619372/infinity-nikki-eerie-season-event-march-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>It’s time to put all the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/605811/infinity-nikki-gacha-mechanics">lessons I’ve learned about<em> Infinity Nikki</em>’s gacha system</a> to the test. There’s <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/news/122">a new event coming</a> to the game and with that comes a new outfit I actually want this time. </p></div><p>After the game taught me an unfortunate lesson on the gacha economy, I’ve kinda taken it easy with <em>Infinity Nikki</em>, and have found myself enjoying it way more at a slower pace.</p><p>Updates come about once a month, and when I first started playing, I’d blaze through all the new and shiny quests within days only to spin my wheels at the tail end of the month desperate for something new to do. With that in mind, I slowly worked my way through all the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348535/infinity-nikki-firework-season-update-trailer-january-date">Lunar New Year content</a>, completing everything I wanted mere hours before the event was due to wrap up. It feels like I’ve finally gotten into a steady rhythm with the game. I know how to play and how to spend and I’m happy again enjoying the game for what it is.</p><p>With the flashy fireworks in the distance, I took a look ahead to the next event, Eerie Season, due to start February 26th. It’s an oddly themed update. Typically games save their spooky events for October not March. But the community has been clamoring for more darker themed clothing since the overwhelming majority of the game’s items are pink and pastel so this seems like a response to that. The update will also flesh out the Queen’s Palace Ruins, an area of the game that’s visually interesting with its dilapidated and haunted castle vibe but devoid of any story or quest content. I am interested in poking at the darker bits of <em>Infinity Nikki’</em>s story and the overall lore of the world and Eerie Season seems poised to give me just what I’m looking for.</p><p>One of the things that’s helped me stick to my guns about not spending any extra money is the fact that premium outfits have never really moved me at all. Everything’s cute, of course, but nothing’s made me sit up and go “I must have this!” However, that apathy disappeared the moment I took a look at the premium outfits for Eerie Season.</p><p>I saw that cowboy outfit and audibly cursed. I’m from the midwest, we don’t have cowboys here. I don’t even like cowboys like that but … <em>I must have this</em>. So I’ve decided to apply all the tricks and tips I’ve learned about gacha game to acquiring this one outfit without spending any extra money. I think I’ll be able to do it, too. </p><p>After that rather frustrating lesson on exactly how gacha games can fleece even the most clear-eyed players, I haven’t spent any more money and have ignored the game’s clothing slot machine. As a result, I’ve amassed a small but tidy sum of premium currency, although not enough to get the cowboy outfit outright. After some light mathing, I’ve determined that I’ll need another 4,000 or so of the premium currency (or roughly $15). Thankfully, with what the battle pass and the new event quests will provide, I’m reasonably confident that I’ll have more than enough to get the entire outfit without any extra spending.</p><p>Weirdly enough, I’m excited about it. Not just because I’ll have an outfit that I truly want but also because there’s a thrill to making, executing, and succeeding with a plan. We’ll see how that goes when the new event starts February 26th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/619229/8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-tmr-anti-drift-joysticks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>8BitDo has released an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/30/23326887/8bitdo-ultimate-pro-controller-bluetooth-preorder-nintendo-switch-wireless">upgraded version of its Ultimate controller </a>now available to <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DR8Y5W6Z?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">preorder through Amazon</a> for $59.99 in purple, black, and white color options. The new 8BitDo Ultimate 2 features a similar asymmetrical stick layout to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/30/23326887/8bitdo-ultimate-pro-controller-bluetooth-preorder-nintendo-switch-wireless">8BitDo’s original Ultimate controller that launched in 2022</a>, but adds additional buttons, interactive LED lighting, and tunneling magneto-resistance (TMR) joysticks that are even more durable than Hall effect sticks.</p></div><p>We still don’t know if <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo">Nintendo will switch to Hall effect joysticks</a> for the Switch 2, but companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177912/gulikit-hall-effect-dualsense-dualshock-4-xbox-series-switch-joystick">GuliKit have already moved away from them</a> in favor of TMR. The technology has already long been used in hard drives to boost storage capacities. For controllers, it allows for joysticks that draw less power, which can improve battery life while nearly eliminating the risk of joystick drift that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained">plagued the Nintendo Switch</a> and other modern controllers before magnetic Hall effect technology was adopted.</p><p>8BitDo is also bringing over the RGB Fire Ring lighting effects first introduced on its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/19/24325092/8bitdo-ultimate-mini-wired-microsoft-xbox-controller-rgb-lighting">smaller-sized Ultimate C wired Xbox controller</a>. As the branding implies, both joysticks feature a ring of color-changing LEDs around their base with several lighting modes that react to button presses (including the triggers) or the direction the joysticks are being pushed.</p><p>The Ultimate 2’s triggers still use Hall effect sensors for improved accuracy and reliability, but 8BitDo has introduced a switch that lets you swap their behavior between longer draw triggers ideal for racing games and short pull tactile triggers for quicker responses while playing first-person shooters. And like the budget-minded <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185806/gaming-8bitdo-controller-ultimate-2c-hall-effect">8BitDo Ultimate 2c</a>, the Ultimate 2 has an extra pair of customizable shoulder buttons on the back.</p><p>The controller connects to 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software V2, which is also available as a mobile app, allowing buttons to be remapped and the sensitivity of joysticks and triggers to be adjusted. The controller has support for motion controls for games that support it, and a charging dock is still included.</p><p>Connectivity options include Bluetooth, a wired USB-C connection, or a low-lag 2.4GHz wireless connection using an included USB-C dongle. But like the cheaper Ultimate 2C, 8BitDo has only made its new Ultimate 2 controller compatible with PCs running Windows 10 and later or Android devices running Android 9.0 and newer.</p><p>Versions of the new Ultimate 2 compatible with the Xbox, iOS, or Nintendo Switch (and presumably the Switch 2) haven’t been announced yet, but 8BitDo previously released <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-3-mode-controller-xbox/">additional versions of the original Ultimate controller</a> with alternate compatibility.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Warner Bros. Discovery is making even more big changes to its troubled gaming efforts. As reported <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-25/warner-bros-shuts-three-video-game-studios-in-restructuring?embedded-checkout=true">by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the company’s gaming division is canceling the <em>Wonder Woman</em> game announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22827161/wonder-woman-game-warner-bros-monolith-productions-the-game-awards">in 2021</a> and shutting down three studios: <em>Wonder Woman</em> developer Monolith Productions, <em>MultiVersus</em> developer Player First Games, and Warner Bros. Games San Diego.</p><p>WBD confirmed the changes in a statement to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lizl4fakrs24"><em>Kotaku’s</em> Ethan Gach</a>. “We have had to make some very difficult decisions to structure our development studios and investments around building the best games possible with our key franchises — <em>Harry Potter</em>, <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, DC and <em>Game of Thrones</em>,” according to the statement. “After careful consideration, we are closing three of our development studios Monolith Productions, Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego. This is a strategic change in direction and not a reflection of these teams or the talent that consists within them.”</p><p>As for why <em>Wonder Woman</em> is being canceled, “our hope was to give players and fans the highest quality experience possible for the iconic character, and unfortunately this is no longer possible within our strategic priorities,” the statement says. “This is another tough decision, as we recognize Monolith’s storied history of delivering epic fan experiences through amazing games.”</p><p>Warner Bros. Discovery says in the statement that it remains “focused on and excited about getting back to producing high-quality games for our passionate fans and developed by our world class studios and getting our Games business back to profitability and growth in 2025 and beyond.”</p><p>The cancellation and shutdowns are yet another rough spot in Warner Bros.’ gaming efforts. Player First Games recently announced that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24097129/multiversus-release-date-warner-bros-games"><em>MultiVersus</em> will be taken offline</a>, ending a development period that has already included a long hiatus and a relaunch. <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> was a flop, with that game receiving its last season <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317407/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-final-season-offline-mode">less than a year after launch</a>. A previous report from <em>Bloomberg</em> said that WB’s gaming division <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/608375/warner-bros-games-has-burned-a-300-million-hole">suffered $300 million in losses last year</a>.</p><p>2023’s <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> has been a success for WB, and the company is reportedly working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition/">a definitive edition for the game</a> with more content.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/618785/framework-desktop-annoucement-price-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Framework, the modular computer company, has just announced its first desktop PC, which is something it absolutely did not need to do because desktops are <em>already</em> modular — but I’m glad it did.</p><p>Partly because the world needs more tiny <em>4.5-liter </em>mini-ITX PCs, partly because it uses <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337025/amd-ryzen-ai-max-strix-halo-fire-range-9955hx3d">AMD’s most powerful APU ever</a> (Strix Halo) with some actual gaming chops and up to 128GB of unified LPDDR5x memory… and partly because it looks like <em>this</em>.</p><p>Yes, you can create your own front panel out of 21 interchangeable (and freely 3D printable) tiles, pick your own two front I/O ports, and yes, that’s a standard-size mini-ITX motherboard below, along with a custom thermal system co-developed by Cooler Master and Noctua with standard 120mm fans, a semi-custom 400W Flex ATX power supply co-developed by FSP, a whole lot of seemingly perfect-length cables for a relatively cable-light system, your choice of black or translucent side panels… and, at left, an optional LAN party carry handle!</p><p>Just don’t look for any memory slots — it’s soldered. “We spent months working with AMD to explore ways around this but ultimately determined that it wasn’t technically feasible to land modular memory at high throughput with the 256-bit memory bus,” writes Framework.</p><p>I got to check out the system today at Framework’s event in San Francisco, and while we’re still working on some photos and video, my early impressions are good: this desktop is smaller than an PS5 or Xbox Series X, feels more powerful, and fits together nicely, with magnetic side and front panels that snap and then slide into place, a top plate that locks them in, folding thumbscrews that lock that top place, and a seemingly cool and quiet build overall based on the PCs I saw in an admittedly noisy room.</p><p>Below, find a closer look at Framework’s desktop motherboard and cooling; you only get a PCIe x4 port, not PCIe x8 or x16, and no legacy connectors like SATA, but it’s more loaded than the image lets on: Framework says it’s got onboard 5Gbps Ethernet, two USB4, two DisplayPort, one HDMI, not one but two M.2 2280 NVMe SSD slots for up to 16TB of storage, and a Wi-Fi 7 module, plus what appear to be two full-size USB-A ports and a headphone jack (at the rear).</p><p>Here’s a little bit of the build process, as told by the images Framework sent us:</p><p>I will say that you can’t just slide the Framework Desktop mainboard in and out of the chassis, like I tried and failed to do at the event — an employee explained you do have to unscrew the top rails first.</p><p>And here are some better images of the Framework Desktop mainboard’s I/O, in a rack-mounted, daisy-chained configuration that the company expects some AI enthusiasts might snap up — thanks to the local AI chops and 128GB of memory on the highest-end Ryzen AI Max Plus 395 Plus config.</p><p>“With Framework Desktop, you can run giant, capable models like Llama 3.3 70B Q6 at real-time conversational speed right on your desk,” the company claims, adding, “With USB4 and 5Gbit Ethernet networking, you can connect multiple systems or Mainboards to run even larger models like the full DeepSeek R1 671B.”</p><p>Framework CEO Nirav Patel says it was also designed with LANs in mind — though with a bit less bulk than the massive CRT monitors and desktops of old.</p><p>What kind of gaming chops might it really have? While most Framework Desktops at the event were running the easy-to-play <em>Counter-Strike</em>, I was able to run and configure <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>too — and at a native 1440p, ultra spec minus ray-tracing, I completed a benchmark run with a <em>low</em> of 60fps and average north of 70fps. Not bad. That’s with the top-end Ryzen AI Max 395 Plus chip, which the Framework Desktop can run at its full 120 watts.</p><p>My colleague Antonio has also seen in his time <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335012/asus-rog-flow-z13-gaming-tablet-amd-ryzen-max-plus-price-specs">with the Asus Z13 gaming tablet</a> that Strix Halo is roughly around the performance of an Nvidia RTX 4060 mobile chip in that portable configuration. AMD chief gaming solutions architect Frank Azor was also here with some 1080p benchmarks at high settings, and he seemed to actually undersell the chip a bit; AMD’s benchmarks suggested it can’t quite play the most demanding games (like <em>Black Myth Wukong </em>and <em>Starfield</em>) at over 60fps at native resolution with everything turned up, and that 1440p60 might require FSR upscaling, but my <em>Cyberpunk</em> seems to suggest it can do a bit better.</p><p>Even if you’re not getting your money’s worth out of AI, the prices on these desktops don’t seem all that outlandish. While a desktop with 16 CPU cores, 40 graphics cores, 80MB of cache of the 395 Plus chip, and 128GB of memory will cost $1,999 — not including bring-your-own storage and OS — you can pick one with 8 CPU cores, 32 graphics cores, 40MB of cache and 32GB of memory for $1,099. There’s also a 395 Plus with just 64GB of RAM for $1,599. Or, you can buy a mainboard alone for $799 if you provide your own mini-ITX case and power supply, too.</p><p>If you’re looking for the most powerful mini-PC, Patel suggested the $1,999 model compares favorably to an Apple Mac Studio, which can cost over twice as much for the same 128GB of RAM. And the prices seem competitive <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/22/24109140/asus-rog-nuc-pricing-availability">with the Asus ROG NUC tiny gaming PC</a>, though that one was deemed overpriced at launch and is much smaller at 2.5 liters.</p><div><p>Framework says these desktops and mainboard should be available to preorder today, with plans to ship in Q3. The company also just introduced a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/618769">new AMD-powered version of its Framework Laptop 13</a> today, as well as the new Framework Laptop 12: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618784/framework-laptop-12-touchscreen-convertible-announcement-release-date">its first budget laptop, its first touchscreen, and its first convertible. </a></p></div><p><em><strong>Updat</strong></em><strong>e,</strong> <em><strong>February 25th</strong>: Added some hands-on impressions; video and pics coming tomorrow!</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
