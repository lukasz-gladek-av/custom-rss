It launches on February 27th, 2026 on PC, PS5, and Xbox.</p><p>The announcement came via a lengthy trailer that took quite a while before revealing itself to indeed be the next <em>Resident Evil</em>, focused instead on an office space. But then, naturally, things got pretty creepy. Capcom says the new game will indeed be survival horror, but didn’t provide much other info, explaining only that players will “escape death in a heart-stopping experience that will chill you to your core.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
