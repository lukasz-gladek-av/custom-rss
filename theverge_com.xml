            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/686862/anbernic-rg-slide-handheld-emulator-console-psp-go<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Anbernic hasn’t officially released or even put its new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675596/anbernic-handheld-teaser-rg-slide">RG Slide handheld</a> up for preorder yet, but a handful of reviewers have recently shared their first impressions of the new console. Anbernic may be leaning a bit too far into novelty and nostalgia with the RG Slide’s design, while not actually capitalizing on what made devices like the light and compact PSP Go and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/24/2509174/sony-ericsson-xperia-play-review">Xperia Play smartphone</a> so fondly remembered.</p><p>The RG Slide will be priced at $189 and is expected to go on sale starting on June 20th, 2025, <a href="https://retrododo.com/anbernic-rg-slide-review-in-progress-a-psp-go-like-android-handheld/">according to <em>RetroDodo</em></a>. It’s powered by an octa-core Unisoc Tiger T820 CPU, which is a processor Anbernic already uses in its higher-end handhelds like the <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg-cube">RG Cube</a> that can emulate most games from the PS2 and Nintendo GameCube era. That’s paired with 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, a microSD card slot, and a 5,000mAh rechargeable battery that’s estimated to power the console for up to six hours between charges.</p><p><em>Retro Dodo</em> liked the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678650/anbernic-rg-slide-handheld-emulator-screen-resolution-refresh-rate">RG Slide’s 4.7-inch, 1280 x 960 pixel resolution screen</a> and found it makes “retro consoles such as GameCube, Dreamcast, and PS2 look slightly more vivid in comparison to previous Anberic products.” It also found the console’s sliding mechanism to be satisfyingly solid, but lamented the loud “clack” it makes when opening or closing the device.</p><p>The console’s controls are as good as what’s found on other Anbernic devices and seem reasonably comfortable and well-balanced, but not quite as ergonomic as other handhelds. </p><p>Both <em>Retro Dodo</em> and Russ Crandall, who runs <a href="https://retrogamecorps.com/">Retro Game Corps</a>, feel that Anbernic missed the mark when it comes to the RG Slide’s size, which feels too large and thick to be comfortably pocketable. It also weighs 380 grams, which is just shy of the original Nintendo Switch that weighed 390 grams and much heavier than the 158-gram PSP Go.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/686719/dbrand-killswitch-switch-2-case-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’ve been checking out a lot of new Switch 2 accessories recently, almost all of which were produced before the companies that made them ever touched a real Switch 2. Even a millimeter’s difference in dimensions could completely throw off a design, and some products I’ve tried lack a perfect fit. For example, Genki’s Attack Vector <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1l7hpz6/warning_for_switch_2_owners_who_bought_an_attack/">has problems</a>, which the company is now reworking. It’s probably not the only one. However, Dbrand’s Killswitch kit offers the best fit and best protection right out of the gate.</p><p>I adored the kit when I tested it on my <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/28/23373094/dbrand-project-killswitch-steam-deck-case-magnet-stand">Steam Deck</a>, and this one doesn’t mess with the winning formula. Dbrand had to engineer its own USB-C dock adapter since a Killswitch-equipped console doesn’t fit in Nintendo’s dock. Its adapter is included, with no cutbacks to visual fidelity in docked mode. It’s a little clunky, but I’m mainly just happy that it works, so I don’t have to take the Killswitch off every time I want to dock the Switch 2.</p><p>The most basic “Essentials” kit is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fkillswitch%2Fnintendo-switch-2-cases" rel="sponsored">$59.95</a> and includes a grippy, form-fitting shell that latches around the Switch 2’s back, slightly latching around the front. It can be secured to your console with some small adhesive strips. A separate, adhesive-backed strip of protection for the kickstand comes with the kit, too. Dbrand includes two Joy-Con 2 shells that have thick, textured grips that make them significantly more comfortable to use without adding too much weight. Unlike Joy-Con shells from other accessory makers, these were as easy to install as I hoped they would be, sliding securely into place thanks to the Killswitch’s tough, but just-malleable-enough materials.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><figcaption>Each component that attaches to the Switch 2 is malleable enough to easily fit onto its pieces, but secure enough not to wiggle off.</figcaption> <cite>Image: Cameron Faulkner/The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fkillswitch%2Fnintendo-switch-2-cases" rel="sponsored">$79.85</a> “Travel” option adds a tough latch-on cover that protects the front of your Switch 2, and a tray that fits within it for storing up to 10 game cartridges. Of the cases I’ve tried so far, I have the fewest reservations about putting my Switch 2 in this one. With the front cover on, it provides hard case protection. When detached, it offers solid protection with an understated look for the parts of the Switch 2 that are most vulnerable to damage.</p><p>The most expensive <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fkillswitch%2Fnintendo-switch-2-cases" rel="sponsored">$99.80</a> “Ultra” kit includes everything mentioned above, plus additional stick grips and two glass screen protectors. The added cost isn’t outrageous if you still need a screen protector.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><figcaption>The Killswitch secures to the Switch 2 and Joy-Con 2 with a small lip that keeps it on. And yet, it’s simple to remove if you want to.</figcaption> <cite>Image: Cameron Faulkner/The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The Killswitch is great. I often forget that it’s installed. I thought I’d miss the console’s slim design, arguably one of its biggest selling points compared to chunkier handhelds like the Steam Deck. But, after mainly using a Deck instead of the aging Switch, I’m spoiled by big grips, and the Killswitch turns the Switch 2 into something that I want to use in handheld mode.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
