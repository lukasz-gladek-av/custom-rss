            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tim-sweeney-is-mocking-apple-for-letting-fortnite-fakes-into-the-app-store.1190760/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/668101/apple-epic-games-fortnite-tim-sweeney-app-store-fakes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Epic Games has been waiting for Apple to approve <em>Fortnite</em> for the US iOS App Store for nearly a week, and now Epic CEO Tim Sweeney is using X to try and put pressure on Apple. On Thursday, he highlighted examples of <em>Fortnite</em> lookalikes that are currently on the App Store and made a direct appeal to Apple CEO Tim Cook.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1923095640394916069">one post</a>, Sweeney included screenshots of the App Store listing for a game called <em>Fort Battle Royale Epic Shoot</em>. A screenshot in the app listing shows a game with <em>Fortnite</em>-inspired graphics, but it’s clear if you look closely that it isn’t the real <em>Fortnite</em>. “Hey @AppStore can we get the real Fortnite up pls?” <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1923096606972215510">Sweeney asked</a>. </p><p>Soon after, Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1923120512189763697">said that</a> <em>Fort Battle Royale Epic Shoot</em> had been taken down from the App Store but also highlighted another <em>Fortnite</em> clone, <em>Epic Survival Battle Royale 3D</em>. That app, as of this writing, is still available on the App Store. (Apple has something of a history of letting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/657370/blue-prince-ios-port-app-store">unofficial</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22879295/wordle-clones-app-store-removal-online-backlash-copycats">fakes</a> of popular games slip onto the store.)</p><p>Sweeney also replied to a post Cook made earlier in the day. “Hi Tim. How about if you let our mutual customers access Fortnite? Just a thought,” <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1923133214748471391">Sweeney wrote</a>.</p><p>Shortly after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">April 30th ruling</a> in <em>Epic Games v. Apple</em> that blocked Apple from charging a fee on purchases made outside the App Store, Sweeney announced that Epic would bring <em>Fortnite</em> back to the US iOS App Store <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659271/fortnite-ios-apple-app-store-us-return">“next week.”</a></p><p>Epic said it submitted <em>Fortnite</em> to Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664245/epic-submitted-fortnite-to-apple">on Friday, May 9th</a>, but the app hasn’t yet been approved. (Apple’s website <a href="https://developer.apple.com/distribute/app-review/">says that</a> “on average, 90 percent of submissions are reviewed in less than 24 hours.”)</p><p>Sweeney <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/667206/epic-submitted-a-new-version-of-fortnite-to-apple">said yesterday</a> that the company submitted a new version because “we need to release a weekly Fortnite update with new content this Friday, and all platforms must update simultaneously.” But that updated submission still hasn’t been approved, either.</p><p>“We don’t have an update on our <em>Fortnite</em> submission to the App Store,” Sweeney said <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1923081155089183012">earlier on Thursday</a>. “Apple has neither accepted nor rejected it. So the Friday update to <em>Fortnite</em> is now in jeopardy.”</p><p>It’s unclear if that last sentence means that Epic plans to delay the <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1923097626460795026">planned Friday <em>Fortnite</em> update</a> for all platforms where <em>Fortnite</em> is available as a result of Apple not yet approving the update.</p><p>Apple and Epic Games didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
