            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314376/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-bethesda-machinegames-xbox<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>I am Indiana Jones. I am trying to investigate the Great Pyramid of Giza but it’s currently swarmed by Nazis looking for the same artifacts I am. Some of the lower ranking soldiers don’t pay me any mind as I’m dressed like one of the local workers. However, the higher ups see right through my disguise which causes problems: I’m forced to either run away before they sound the alarm, or fight them and risk bringing a horde of Nazis down on my head.&nbsp;</p><p>But! Through intrepid exploration and stealth I’ve managed to find a newer, better outfit, one that disguises me as a Wehrmacht soldier. Surely those pesky commandants will recognize me as one of their own and I’ll be able to stride through Giza, plundering pharaohs’ tombs unmolested. But within five minutes of donning out my new outfit, I got shot by one of those pesky commandants.</p><p>My time with <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> was filled with similar disappointments. Taken together, those moments coalesced into one prevailing sentiment — this game would be better as a movie.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> takes place within the Indiana Jones canon between <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> and <em>The Last Crusade</em>. In it, Dr. Jones (who I always forget has the given name of Henry <em>not</em> Indiana) is investigating the theft of one of the artifacts he “liberated” from an Egyptian tomb. His search leads him on a merry, globe-trotting chase thwarting the ambitions of Nazis and the designs of an ancient cult of “giants.”</p><div><p><em>The Great Circle </em>is filled with all kinds of references and flourishes that scream, “This is an Indiana Jones movie.”</p></div><p><em>The Great Circle </em>is filled with all kinds of references and flourishes that scream, “This is an Indiana Jones movie!” There’s the fun, John Williams-esque orchestral sting that plays when Indy discovers a secret. The dialogue is chock full of witty repartee and one-liners that sound exactly like something Harrison Ford would say to his co-stars. Even <a href="https://youtu.be/vujiFT4cQm8?si=OBO4kYyX0Zy9XU3d&amp;t=544">the punching sound effect</a> is <a href="https://youtu.be/47nkHeMGsuo?si=hm1_uMgES1TYcJwM">ripped straight from the movies</a>. Those elements are fun, comforting even, since <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23728708/indiana-jones-dial-of-destiny-review-harrison-ford"><em>Crystal Skull</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23779495/indiana-jones-dial-of-destiny-review"><em>Dial of Destiny</em></a> failed to capture audiences the way the original trilogy did. But the developers at Machinegames, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/2/16594166/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-nazi-white-supremacist-political-commentaryhttps://www.theverge.com/2017/11/2/16594166/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-nazi-white-supremacist-political-commentary">the studio best-known for <em>Wolfenstein</em></a>, took their mandate too seriously, making what is essentially a spiritual successor to <em>Raiders</em> and <em>Temple of Doom</em>, instead of a video game that is fun to play.</p><p>The game is played in the first-person perspective. Don’t expect to flip and dip a la Lara Croft or Nathan Drake, though, as platforming is a bunch of ladder climbing and wall-shimmying broken up by occasional bouts of whip swinging. I do appreciate that the developers took the <a href="https://kotaku.com/yellow-paint-debate-ff7-rebirth-demo-resident-evil-4-1851249608">yellow</a> <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/ignore-the-yellow-paint-detractors-visual-cues-are-great-for-games/">paint</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-has-a-special-mode-to-address-that-perennial-yellow-paint-debate">discourse</a> seriously, choosing white as the color to denote a climbable surface. It’s still there as a visual marker in case you get stuck, but because the faded white paint blends in a bit more naturally, you don’t feel condescended to when you notice it.</p><div><p>Don’t expect to flip and dip a la Lara Croft or Nathan Drake.</p></div><p>Like the platforming, puzzles leave a lot to be desired. The puzzles I’ve encountered after roughly 25 hours with the game are wildly inconsistent. Some come pre-solved, requiring you to just press buttons to input the solution, or are the kinds of puzzles you’ve seen in just about every adventure game (use beams of light to unlock doors, for example). Conversely, others are so esoterically constructed that they are simply unsolvable.&nbsp;</p><p>I got so excited when I ran into a locked safe right next to a cryptogram consisting of a poem with certain letters circled, and a key with letters and numbers arranged on a grid. I figured the way it worked was to treat the circled letters as coordinates that would point to the right number on the grid. I tried every permutation of letters and numbers to get to the right combination. Nothing worked. I even Googled the type of puzzle it was, found a website that solved them, and input the letters and the key and still couldn’t get the right answer. With no in-game hints or a way to look up a solution, I was forced to abandon the only puzzle that I felt <em>good</em> about trying to solve.</p><p>With banal platforming and puzzle solving a bit too simplistic, the last gameplay element left is combat and, well, that wasn’t all that enjoyable either. <em>The Great Circle</em> put a lot of emphasis on giving me options. When I encountered an enemy, I could choose to engage them directly, covertly, or not at all. I often chose not at all, sneaking around locations and hiding behind objects until my enemies walked by none the wiser. When forced to confront an enemy, guns were useless if not outright hostile to me as the user.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption>The most action you get in combat is in cutscenes like this.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Bethesda</cite></p></div><p>I get that for stealthy games like <em>The Great Circle</em>, guns are meant to be used sparingly as a weapon of last resort. I did that. I spent every encounter killing enemies with the various blunt objects littered throughout the game. I only started using firearms in one of the game’s later levels where gunplay was all but mandatory because there weren’t very many melee weapons for me to find on my own. I would shoot a Nazi point blank in the face no fewer than three times before they went down, or, as was usually the case, before they shot me once, killing me almost instantly. It felt like I had played the game the way it asked me to, but I was still punished for it.</p><p>That said, <em>The Great Circle</em> isn’t totally joyless. The levels incorporate multiple ways to reach an objective and it is legitimately fun to wheedle around to find the solution off the beaten path. I first found that Wehrmacht uniform behind a locked door requiring a key, and I walked away dismayed because I didn’t have the patience to go rooting around for the Nazi who had it. But I just happened to look up and see this locked room was connected to a tower with an open door; all I had to do was shimmy up there, beat up the lone guard, and the uniform was mine. That was fun. When I noticed the two enemies I had beaten up were standing in a pool of water investigating a broken electrical device, I reloaded the checkpoint just to see if I could electrocute them instead. I could. Well done.</p><div><p>But those little thrills were so few and far between because it felt like Machinegames went topsy turvy with its game design.</p></div><p>But those little thrills were so few and far between because it felt like Machinegames went topsy turvy with its game design. Its most interesting moments, like a knockdown, drag out fight with the main villain that happens midgame, were rendered as cutscenes. Meanwhile the less interesting bits are actions you have to perform. This certainly matches beat-for-beat the kind of stuff Indy gets up to in the movies. But those already exist, and I can watch them any time. <em>The Great Circle</em> is missing something more important: a reason this adventure needed to be a game.</p><div><p><small>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle <em>launches December 9th on Xbox and PC, </em></small><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224284/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date"><small><em>with a PS5 version due out in 2025</em></small></a><small><em>.</em></small></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Riot Games announced today that it’s developing a physical trading card game set in the <em>League</em> universe. The game is currently known as “Project K,” and Riot says it’s working with an unnamed partner in China to release the game there in early 2025. As for a global release, Riot says, “We are taking our time to find the right publishing partners.”</p><p>There aren’t a lot of details available about Project K. According to Riot, the game “has unique gameplay and is best when played with friends and in person,” and development is being led by director Dave Guskin and producer Chengran Chai. You can get a sense of the game in the images below:</p><p>Of course, this is far from the first spinoff from <em>League</em>. So far, that has included mobile games like <em>Teamfight Tactics</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Wild Rift</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24291592/arcane-season-2-review-netflix">the Netflix series <em>Arcane</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/22/24079608/project-l-2kxo-fighting-game-league-of-legends">the competitive fighting game <em>2XKO</em></a>, which is expected to launch next year. Not all of these bets have paid off. In January, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/22/24047568/riot-games-league-of-legends-forge-runeterra-layoffs">Riot announced that it was cutting more than 500 jobs</a>, which included shutting down Riot Forge Games, a publishing label for indie games set inside of <em>League</em>. Also impacted was <em>Legends of Runeterra</em>, a mobile card game that launched in 2020, which Riot said “hasn’t performed as well as we need it to.”</p><div><p>The Project K news comes as card games are having another moment, led largely by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248306/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hands-on">the new smartphone version of the <em>Pokémon Trading Card</em> <em>Game</em></a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was an indie-focused showcase, which means that there was quite a bit of inventiveness on display; everything from a unique take on TMNT to a platformer where you jump around computer windows. If you missed the show live — which also included some news updates, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313965/pubg-brendan-playerunknown-greene-new-games-krafton">like PlayerUnknown’s ambitious plans for the future</a> — here’s a curated list of some of the best stuff that was on display.</p><p><h3><em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em></h3></p><p>The original <em>Moonlighter</em> mixed action RPG gameplay with the mundanity of running a shop, and the sequel looks like much of the same: only this time, players are transported to another dimension they need to escape. <em>The Endless Vault</em> launches in 2025 on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.</p><p><h3><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em></h3></p><p>One of the biggest surprises was<em> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em>, from indie studio Strange Scaffold. It’s billed as a turn-based take on the turtles, which is billed as an experience designed in part for “quick-play sessions that feel meaningful.” It takes place in a timeline without icons Shredder and Splinter. Given the studio’s history — see <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3011440%2FCLICKOLDING%2F"><em>Clickolding</em></a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1246250%2FAn_Airport_for_Aliens_Currently_Run_by_Dogs%2F%3Fcurator_clanid%3D41064705"><em>An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs</em></a> — it will hopefully also be weird in a good way. <em>Tactical Takedown </em>launches on PC in 2025.</p><p><h3><em>Cairn</em></h3></p><div><p>This rock-climbing adventure / survival game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24171651/day-of-the-devs-showcase-summer-game-fest-2024-best">has been looking good for a while now</a>, and you can finally check it out for yourself: <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1588550%2FCairn%2F"><em>Cairn</em> just got a free demo on Steam</a>.</p></div><p><h3><em>Sol Mates</em></h3></p><p>There can never be enough co-op games. This release from Daruma Games supports local and online co-op for up to four players, who are tasked with surviving in the great expanse of space by doing “odd jobs through the galaxy.” It’s also pretty darn cute. <em>Sol Mates</em> launches in early access next year.</p><p><h3><em>The Legend of Baboo</em></h3></p><p>Billed as a “heartfelt nod to Middle Eastern fables,” this game looks like a potentially great mix of adventure, action, and puzzle solving, with a great big fluffy dog to ride on. In fact, you play as both the boy and the dog, who form a bond over the course of the game. Let’s hope it has a happier ending than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/5/13837896/the-last-guardian-review-ps4"><em>The Last Guardian</em></a>. <em>The Legend of Baboo</em> is launching in 2025 on both PC and Xbox.</p><p><h3><em>Abyssus</em></h3></p><p>Thanks to this game, I’ve learned of a fictional genre called “brinepunk,” where tech is powered by sea brine. It sounds weird, but this co-op shooter does take place in the fascinating underwater ruins of a long-gone civilization. Developer DoubleMoose says <em>Abyssus</em> will go into alpha on December 6th, with a full release next year.</p><p><h3><em>MainFrames</em></h3></p><p>All you really need to know is that this is a platformer where you’re jumping across a desktop PC interface, rearranging icons to solve puzzles, and fighting bosses controlled by the OS. It launches on both PC and the Nintendo Switch on March 6th.</p><p><h3><em>Deepest Fear</em></h3></p><p>Developed by Variable State, the indie studio behind games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2016/9/22/13001942/virginia-game-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"><em>Virginia</em></a> and <em>Last Stop</em>, <em>Deepest Fear</em> is an immersive sci-fi horror title with distinct shades of <em>Alien</em> and <em>The Thing</em>. The developers say that it “combines Metroidvania level design in the context of a classic FPS immersive sim, where the game’s setting is a puzzle to unravel and where creativity and improvisation are your greatest assets.” There’s no release date yet, but <em>Deepest Fear</em> will (obviously) be launching on PC whenever it’s ready.</p><p><h3><em>Blue Prince</em></h3></p><p>It looks a bit like a more colorful take on <em>Myst</em>, and <em>Blue Prince</em> is described as a game that “combines compelling mystery, strategy, and puzzle elements to create an unpredictable journey through Mt. Holly, a peculiar manor with ever-changing rooms.” It doesn’t have a release date yet, but according to the new trailer, it’s due out next spring.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
