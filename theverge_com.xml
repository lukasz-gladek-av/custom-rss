As the Joy-Con moves away, you can also see a small cylinder receding back into the top part of the inside of the controller; to me, that indicates that when you push the trigger, you’re actually pushing out that cylinder to help bump the Joy-Con out. </p><p>Here’s a GIF of the relevant part of the video:</p><div><p><cite>GIF by Andrew Liszewski / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The mechanism to remove the Joy-Con controllers looks similar to what was included in a 3D-printed mockup that accessories-maker Genki <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">brought to CES</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348858/microsoft-edge-game-assist-game-bar-browser<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft is rolling out its new in-game browser overlay on Windows 11 this week, after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/23/24303988/microsoft-game-assist-browser-overlay-game-bar-pc-gaming">months of beta testing</a>. The Microsoft Edge Game Assist feature is a widget that appears in the Game Bar in Windows 11 much like Valve’s Steam overlay browser. It’s also game-aware, so it can detect games you’re playing and offer up tips and guides in a little side panel.</p><p>The Game Assist overlay was previously restricted to beta users, but it’s <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2025/01/21/expanding-microsoft-edge-game-assist-preview-to-edge-stable/">now available in the stable version</a> of Microsoft Edge. If you want to enable the in-game browser you can open up Microsoft Edge and go to Settings and more &gt; Settings and then search for Game Assist and install the widget. The Game Assist feature will then be available in the Game Bar, which can be opened with the Windows key + G.</p><p>“The initial preview of Game Assist offers contextual tips and guides for a selection of popular PC games while we optimize the experience based on your feedback,” explains William Devereux, senior product manager for Microsoft Edge. Microsoft has also added support for more popular PC games, including <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, <em>Marvel Rivals,</em> and <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>.</p><p>“We’ll add tips and guides for even more popular games throughout the preview and over time,” says Devereux. “In the meantime, you can still use Game Assist to browse your favorite guides or other websites while playing any game.”</p><p>Game Assist works by using the same cookies, autofill, and favorites data from your main Microsoft Edge browser. Microsoft has also added support for extensions like ad blockers to this Game Assist feature, and it’s planning to add support for keyboard shortcuts in the future, alongside an improved picture-in-picture experience and the ability to add a tab from Microsoft Edge to the sidebar.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The news was <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1881728578712474019">shared on X</a> and featured a shout out to The Game Awards. </p><p>“To everyone who picked up Balatro after seeing it at <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards">@thegameawards</a>, we hope you’re having an amazing time with it!” the post read. <em>Balatro</em> was featured prominently during The Game Awards, nominated for a number of awards including Game of the Year and winning the best indie, best debut indie, and best mobile categories. </p><p>On X, Wout van Halderen, PR manager for <em>Balatro</em> publisher Playstack, added that the game had sold 3.5 million copies <a href="https://x.com/TheHashtag0nist/status/1881729707521257851">by the first week of December</a>. With The Game Awards taking place the second week in December, the implication is that <em>Balatro</em> received a significant 1.5 million unit bump in sales after being featured during Keighley’s Christmas Commercial telethon. Even more impressive, the 5 million figure is total units sold and doesn’t count the number of downloads the game got for being on the Apple Arcade subscription.</p><p>Since its launch in February, <em>Balatro</em> has quickly become one of the biggest indie hits of 2024. <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/balatro-localthunk-interview">Developed by a single person</a> over the course of two years, the poker roguelike has garnered a reputation for being a well-crafted “number-go-up” game with its developer leaning in on the joke that <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1839702508454687062">it devours players’ free and not-so-free time</a>.</p><div><p>In the 11 months since the game’s release, it’s only gotten small, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278578/balatro-is-getting-more-cards-featuring-other-games">cosmetic</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319769/dont-watch-this-balatro-video">updates</a> but developer LocalThunk has hinted <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215342/balatro-free-major-gameplay-update-2025">a major gameplay-focused update</a> is forthcoming this year.</p></div><p>Jimbo help us all. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
