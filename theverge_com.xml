It’s part of a number of customization changes to the Xbox Home UI, including the ability to hide system apps and reduce the number of apps and games listed in the most recently used section.</p><p>You can pin up to three of your recently launched games or apps to the homescreen, and these will stay at the front of the recently used section even if you launch other apps or games. You can also turn off system apps, like Settings and the Store, from even showing up on the Xbox Home UI altogether.</p><p>If you really want to hide more of these recently used apps or games, you can also reduce the amount listed to just four tiles. There are options to pick between four and up to the nine that Microsoft shows by default.</p><p>All of these new customizations are part of the June Xbox dashboard update rolling out today, and can be found in Settings &gt; General &gt; Personalization &gt; Games &amp; apps. Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/668668/xbox-home-screen-pin-favorite-games-apps-changes-testing">first started testing</a> these new customizations last month, so it’s a particularly quick rollout to all Xbox users this week.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/691287/xbox-home-ui-pin-favorite-games-apps-rolling-out]]></content:encoded>
