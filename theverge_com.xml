            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318530/google-gemini-2-0-understand-rules-video-games-genie<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Google just announced Gemini 2.0, and as part of its suite of news today, the company is revealing that it’s been exploring how AI agents built with Gemini 2.0 can understand rules in video games to help you out.</p><p>The agents can “reason about the game based solely on the action on the screen, and offer up suggestions for what to do next in real time conversation,” Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and CTO Koray Kavukcuoglu write <a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/google-gemini-ai-update-december-2024">in a blog post</a>. Hassabis and Kavukcuoglu also say that the agents can also “tap into Google Search to connect you with the wealth of gaming knowledge on the web.”</p><p>Google is testing the agents’ “ability to interpret rules and challenges” in games like <em>Clash of Clans</em> and <em>Hay Day </em>from Supercell<em>, </em>according to Hassabis and Kavukcuoglu.</p><p>I’m not surprised Google is chasing these ideas: in theory, an AI agent coaching you through a strategy or puzzle could be useful. It sounds like this work is very early, though, and I have many questions about whether or not these agents actually give sound advice.</p><p>Google is also investing in video games and AI in another way: creating playable virtual worlds on the fly from a prompt image using a “foundation world model” called Genie 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313409/a-google-ai-model-can-create-playable-virtual-worlds-on-the-fly">that it showed off last week</a>. That work seems early, too: Genie 2 can only generate consistent worlds for “up to a minute,” <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-2-a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/">Google says</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
