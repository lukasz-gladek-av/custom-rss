            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Today, AMD is soft-launching its latest suite of graphics and performance-enhancing tech, FSR Redstone — and it might take a second to wrap your head around. It certainly did for me.</p><p>The good news is that in <a href="https://gpuopen.com/news/amd-fsr4-over-85-games/">just three months</a>, AMD has more than doubled the number of games that support the flagship machine-learning version of its upscaling tech, FSR4, to over 200 games in all, and it’s launching ML-based frame generation (yes, “fake frames”) for over 30 titles too. You should be able to <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/technologies/fidelityfx/supported-games.html">find full game lists here </a>sometime today. Both techniques can dramatically increase your framerate while preserving image quality better than FSR 1, 2, or 3 allowed.</p><p>The awkward news is that after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/671961/amd-fsr-redstone-rdna-4">previously promising</a> “FSR Redstone” would arrive in the second half of this year, AMD is fulfilling that promise primarily by absorbing FSR4 into Redstone. FSR 4 is now “AMD FSR Upscaling (formerly AMD FSR4)”, and Redstone is the umbrella brand for the whole current suite of machine-learning product.</p><p>The absorption might be because AMD has only one game to show off its new FSR Ray Regeneration technique — <em><a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2025/11/fsr-redstones-strange-debut-ray-regeneration-tested-in-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a></em>, which already launched with it last month — and no games with FSR Radiance Caching, which it now says is available for game <em>developers</em> to bring to their games in 2026.</p><p>The slightly confusing news is that you won’t find options for FSR Redstone (or even FSR 4) inside most of your games. You’ll need to have a Radeon RX 9000-series card, as the company’s still saying the machine-learning versions of FSR are exclusive to those. You’ll also need to go into your AMD Software app to enable “AMD FSR Upscaling” and/or “AMD FSR Frame Generation” under the Gaming &gt; Graphics tab, and then you’ll need to enable AMD FSR 3.1 (or occasionally 4) inside the game itself.</p><p>That’s because the superior ML versions of these techniques need to be enabled on a per-game basis, but AMD can do it for you (and game developers) in the driver, as long as the games already support FSR 3.1 or FSR 4.</p><p>I bought an AMD RX 9070 XT myself <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/672637/nvidia-rtx-5060-review-meddling-gamersnexus-wake-up-call">after the last stunt Nvidia pulled</a>, but adoption of AMD’s latest hardware is still a little slow. They’ve<a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/343558/amd-radeon-rx-9000-series-still-absent-from-steam-hardware-survey"> yet to show up in the Steam Hardware Survey</a>, which could mean less than 0.15 percent of today’s PC gamers currently use them — though a generic “AMD Radeon(TM) Graphics” has gained 0.75 percent share on Steam since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241214073529/https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/?sort=name">a year ago.</a></p><p>That could change now that the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/products/video-card/#c=591,592&amp;sort=price">can finally be found</a> at their original promised MSRP prices. They are good cards for that amount of money; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/624423/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review-benchmarks-price">here’s our March 2025 review</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/841342/amd-fsr-redstone-is-an-exciting-and-confusing-upgrade-for-radeon-pc-gamers]]></content:encoded>
