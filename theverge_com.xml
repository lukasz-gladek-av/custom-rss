He joined in 2018, and after a two-year stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo recently issued an update (21.0.0) for its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Switch 2 console</a> that, in addition to <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/~/nintendo-switch-system-update-information">some small changes</a>, has caused some third-party docks to stop working as intended. In the early weeks and months of the console’s availability this summer, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/701381/confirmed-nintendos-switch-2-can-work-with-existing-docks-and-webcams-after-replacing-their-firmware">companies raced</a> to figure out the right commands, the right power draw, and the right chips to use in order to trick the Switch 2 into thinking it had connected to the real thing — Nintendo’s dock, which is included with every console. Now, some of them will have to figure out how to do it again.</p><p>You’re not alone if you think Nintendo did this on purpose. But did it? According to Nintendo, not exactly. Gaming site <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-just-blocked-third-party-switch-2-docks-and-it-sucks-2000644081"><em>Kotaku</em></a> published a new statement from the company that says it “does not have any intention to hinder or invalidate legal third-party dock compatibility.” Read in one way, it seems like Nintendo didn’t intend to cause these issues with its latest update. Read another way, Nintendo has apparently established that there’s a legal and an illegal way to create a third-party Switch 2 dock, and a lot of the ones out there were made illegally, apparently.</p><p>The fact that some third-party Switch 2 docks still work makes this more confusing. I tried out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Compatible-PlayStation-Supports-Handheld/dp/B0D3LT6BJW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Viture’s Pro mobile dock</a> (one of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/701381/confirmed-nintendos-switch-2-can-work-with-existing-docks-and-webcams-after-replacing-their-firmware">early third-party docks to provide Switch 2 support</a>), for use with its Pro XR glasses, and it just works fine with the same firmware that’s been on it since I started testing it months ago.</p><p>Without more details from Nintendo, it’s tough to know what this spells for the future. Are more docks on the dock chopping block? Is it reconfiguring its proprietary Switch 2 dock handshake to leave third-party dock makers in a constant scramble? Will it develop (or has it already developed) something similar to the Apple MFi certification program to let companies pay a fee to promise support out of the box with its locked-down port?</p><p>Whatever the answers are, Nintendo will naturally want to push consumers towards using its pricey dock, and push third-party companies away from trying to engineer duplicative gadgets at a fraction of the cost. That spells an interesting next couple of months for third-party makers, including the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/783976/covert-dock-3-shadowcast-3-switch-2-rog-ally-xbox-specs-price">Genki</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/801096/you-can-leave-your-switch-2s-dock-at-home-with-this-40-charger">JSAUX</a>, which are both launching compact, power adapter-size docks later this year. Switch 2 support is on each of their feature lists, but we’ll see if it remains a selling point closer to their launches.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/821250/switch-2-update-third-party-dock-update-blocked]]></content:encoded>
