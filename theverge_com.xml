The interesting part? The black one has a Steam button.</p><p>While the low resolution images don’t immediately scream SteamOS, if you look closely you’ll notice a Steam logo is visible on a button to the left of the display. Interestingly, the white model doesn’t have the same Steam button — which could indicate Lenovo is preparing Windows- and SteamOS-powered models of its Legion Go S.</p><div><figcaption><em>You can clearly see a Steam logo on the button to the left of the display.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Evan Blass (<a href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1867499994090963132">X</a>)</cite></p></div><p>PC makers like Lenovo, Asus, and MSI have all opted for Windows-based handhelds so far, but as consumer patience with Windows on tiny screens wears thin and Microsoft’s progress in improving the experience is slow, it seems like OEMs are looking for a better alternative.</p><p>Lenovo’s potential entry into a SteamOS handheld comes just days after Valve quietly updated a document with new branding guidelines that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr">include “Powered by SteamOS” hardware</a>. It’s the surest sign yet that Valve is working with more third-party hardware manufacturers, beyond Asus, to certify devices with SteamOS. With CES 2025 just a few weeks away, we could be about to witness a lot more SteamOS-powered hardware.</p><p>Valve has been here before, though. At CES in 2013, it tried to tempt PC manufacturers to sign up to its Steam Machines initiative, but it didn’t get far enough with developers to convince them to port games to Linux to make these machines successful. There’s reason to believe this time things will be very different, thanks to Proton. The Steam Deck uses the Proton software compatibility layer and has already proved that many Windows games can even run better on Linux as a result.</p><div><p>As my colleague Sean Hollister <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr">wrote earlier this month</a>: “it’s just as intriguing an idea&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/16/3652756/valve-big-picture-mode-steam-os-linux-game-console">as it was 12 years ago</a>&nbsp;when Gabe Newell&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3852144/gabe-newell-interview-steam-box-future-of-gaming">explained the initial vision to us</a>, and this time, there’s a far better chance it’ll work.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
