            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/634773/alienware-aw2725df-oled-gaming-monitor-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’m still getting accustomed to seeing 27-inch 1440p QD-OLED gaming monitors for less than $700 — after all, it wasn’t long ago that they were retailing for around $1,000. So imagine the feeling of sticker shock (complimentary) to spot one of Alienware’s models with a fast 360Hz refresh rate for hundreds of dollars off, which is the case <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/apd/210-bljd" rel="sponsored">right now at Dell’s website</a>.</p><p>Originally $899.99, this monitor’s final price plunges to $599.99 when you use promo code <strong>AW27300 </strong>at checkout. With tax, my checkout total rang up to a cool $653.24. An OLED gaming monitor that costs less than a mid-range GPU? Hell yeah. At this price, there’s no need to wait for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/623428/dell-alienware-oled-monitor-aw2725d-price-release-date">Alienware’s forthcoming AW2725D</a>, which the company hopes (but isn’t promising) to launch for $549. It’ll have 1440p resolution with a 280Hz refresh rate, so it’s actually slower than Alienware’s discounted AW2725DF.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->600</span></p><div><p>The AW2725DF has a 360Hz refresh rate, 1440p resolution, and a decent PPI to ensure that text looks clear.</p></div></div><p>In terms of the specs, Alienware’s 27-inch AW2725DF sports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, plus support for VRR via either its HDMI 2.1 port or through either of its DisplayPort 1.4 ports. That’ll ensure that the screen looks smooth and tear-free, even during moments when the frame rate fluctuates wildly. While the panel can achieve up to a 360Hz refresh rate — equating to 360 visible frames per second, if your GPU can keep up — it’s only supported via the DisplayPort. Through HDMI 2.1, the monitor’s refresh rate tops out at a respectable 144Hz.</p><p>The AW2725DF has an anti-reflective coating, but since I haven’t used this exact display, I can’t vouch as to whether it’s fully matte or slightly on the glossy side (the<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/623428/dell-alienware-oled-monitor-aw2725d-price-release-date"> newer AW2725Q</a> is more glossy than matte, in turn letting more contrast through). It has 111 pixels per inch (PPI), which should be enough clarity to avoid seeing pixelated text. A low PPI dampened my enthusiasm for other OLED monitors, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23509955/corsair-xeneon-flex-oled-gaming-monitor-features-price-hands-on">Corsair Xeneon Flex</a> that I reviewed in late 2022.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
