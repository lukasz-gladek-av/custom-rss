            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo hasn’t announced its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">Switch successor</a> yet, but we do know one thing for sure: it will be able to play current Switch games and have carryover for your Nintendo Switch Online services and account. The news was announced during Nintendo’s midyear policy briefing, with further information promised “at a later date.”</p><p>Nintendo also talked about numbers for the current Switch (<a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106e.pdf">PDF</a>), noting that it sold 4.72 million units in the past three months, a drop of 31 percent compared to the same period last year but well above previous consoles eight years after they launched. </p><p>That adds up to 146 million Switch units sold and a new record for software sales on a Nintendo platform, which reached 1.3 billion units as of September 30th, 2024. It also noted that Switch Online subscriptions dropped slightly from last year to about 34 million members. At the same time, the number of people opting for the pricier version with the Expansion Pack library of games continues to increase.</p><p>According to the presentation, “More software has been played on Nintendo Switch than on any other Nintendo hardware.”</p><p>All three of the major console manufacturers have had spotty records with backward compatibility. Both the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782746/microsoft-xbox-backward-compatibility-76-new-games">Xbox Series X</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440748/ps5-playstation-5-99-percent-backward-compatible-ps4-games-jim-ryan">PS5</a> are mostly backward-compatible. But since the transition from the Wii U involved going from discs to cartridges, the Switch is not. Playing a game from previous Nintendo consoles at the moment is a function of optimism, involving the hope that either Nintendo releases a remastered Switch port or brings the game to its Switch Online library, but that won’t be the case this time around.</p><p>According to Nintendo, the Switch 2 (or whatever it’s actually called) is still on schedule to be revealed during this fiscal year, which runs until the end of March 2025, without interrupting Nintendo’s existing connection with over 100 million annual Switch players. </p><p>The conversation about backward compatibility isn’t just about player satisfaction but also video game preservation. A <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/14/23792586/classic-game-preservation-video-game-history-foundation-esa">report from the Video Game History Foundation</a> found that over 87 percent of games released before 2010 are “critically endangered” or unavailable for purchase. While Nintendo has brought some of its back catalog to the Switch, there are still a lot of inaccessible games. Nintendo also directly contributed to the increasing scarcity of older games by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/19/23269792/nintendo-wii-u-3ds-eshop-closing-date-2023">shutting down the Wii U / 3DS e-shop last year</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Update, November 5th, 2024:</strong> Added additional details.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24289138/steam-game-recording-now-available-all-users<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steam Game Recording <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4472730495692571025">is officially out of beta</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fgamerecording">available to all users</a>, giving PC, Mac, and Steam Deck players a built-in way to record and share audio and video from their gaming sessions. It joins many other ways PC gamers have been able to record their highlights, including as a feature of tools like the<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21222533/record-screen-pc-windows-laptop-xbox-game-bar-how-to"> Xbox Game Bar</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/23/4358300/nvidia-shadowplay-and-geforce-gtx-780">Nvidia GeForce</a>, and AMD’s Adrenalin.</p><p>This version of the Steam client is also the first to drop support for Windows 7 and 8 machines, as well as Macs running macOS 10.13 and 10.14 after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/1/24021950/steam-has-now-officially-stopped-supporting-windows-7-windows-8-and-windows-8-1">Valve announced the move</a> at the beginning of this year. </p><p>After an automatic update, players can start recordings manually using a hotkey (Ctrl + F11 is the default) or set it to trigger automatically, with options to restrict the length, quality, and storage space that Steam can use. Valve says it works with any game, including non-Steam games that allow Steam Overlay to run. Recording is off by default — you’ll find its settings in a new Game Recording tab in Steam’s settings. </p><p>Valve has updated Steam Game Recording with a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4530150757095178611?utm_source=SteamDB">handful of new features</a> that weren’t there when the beta period <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186716/valve-steam-native-game-recording-tool-deck">began in June</a>, including adding “advanced” export options and the ability to configure game-specific settings. The company also added Session View, which includes a “Recordings &amp; Screenshots manager with game-specific tags and data.” </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
