It’s playable solo and multiplayer, where your Meta avatar represents you in a match. Meta says the game can adapt to your play space, but it also uses the Quest boundaryless mode for those with access to wide-open spaces. </p><p>A blatant knockoff of Nintendo’s <em>Sports </em>series<em> </em>it may be, but I’m not mad.</p><p>It’ll be hard to replicate the crucial component of a group of people holding Wii remotes and watching each other fail at bowling. However, this could be a good time, assuming that developer Resolution Games otherwise got the feel right and you have enough headsets to go around. </p><p><em><strong>Correction November 25th: </strong>A previous version of this article misspelled the name of the developer. It’s Resolution, not Revolution.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
