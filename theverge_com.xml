The average graphical performance impact is 4%, with no impact on AI and Compute workloads. Affected consumers can contact the board manufacturer for a replacement. The production anomaly has been corrected.</em></p></blockquote></div><div><p>In the grand scheme of things, that doesn’t sound like a lot of affected GPUs, particularly because there <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/603863/nvidia-rtx-5090-out-of-stock-paper-launch">weren’t a lot of 5090s on shelves to begin with</a>, nor was it a huge hit to performance — as those who discovered the missing render units <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/332884/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-spotted-with-missing-rops-performance-loss-confirmed-multiple-vendors-affected">can already attest</a>. But it is the latest in a line of annoyances with Nvidia’s latest pricy cards, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/605231/rtx-5090-5080-driver-issues-uk-delay-japan-raffle">launch driver issues</a> (including some ongoing black screen issues <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-confirms-it-is-investigating-rtx-50-series-bsod-and-black-screen-troubles-no-timeline-for-a-fix">that Nvidia is still investigating</a>) and some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/609207/nvidia-rtx-5090-power-connector-melting-burning-issues">melting power connectors</a>.</p></div><p>While limited, the manufacturing issue affected multiple Nvidia graphics card partners: reports came in <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/332884/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-spotted-with-missing-rops-performance-loss-confirmed-multiple-vendors-affected">of Zotac</a>, <a href="https://x.com/9550pro/status/1892939362629030233">MSI</a>, <a href="https://cdn.rios.hu/dl/upc/2025-02/21/499547_bm0jh37xqmttp6ka_nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-spotted-with-missing-rops.jpg">Gigabyte</a>, <a href="https://x.com/9550pro/status/1892940297228759430">Manli</a>, and even <a href="https://x.com/harukaze5719/status/1892959114809974947">an Nvidia Founders Edition card</a> with missing ROPs. You can use<a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/gpuz/"> GPU-Z</a> to check your card and see if it’s showing the proper number of 176 ROPs; if fewer, you should probably get it replaced.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
