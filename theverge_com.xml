Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Midnight Society, the game studio co-founded by Dr Disrespect (real name Herschel “Guy” Beahm) has shut down, killing the first-person shooter title it was developing. The studio made <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/midnight-society-layoffs-dr-disrespect/">“significant” layoffs</a> in September after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/24/24185172/dr-disrespect-midnight-society-termination">terminating its relationship</a> with the controversial streamer in June due to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24185864/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban">“inappropriate” messages he exchanged with a minor</a>. </p></div><p>Within hours of the closure, YouTube, which also took action against Beahm in June by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/28/24188157/dr-disrespect-youtube-channel-demonetization-partner-program">demonetizing his account</a>, decided to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/pSAgxyGV4iQ?t=8056s">reinstate the streamer’s ability</a> to make money on Google’s video platform. The decision was made after “careful review of the channel’s recent activity,” YouTube spokesperson Boot Bullwinkle told <em>The Verge</em>. “If there are further violations, we’ll take appropriate action.”</p><p>Midnight Society was co-founded in 2021 by Beahm, former Call of Duty creative strategist Robert Bowling, and former 343 Industries lead sandbox designer Quinn Delhoyo.</p><p>“We are actively seeking other game studios that would be interested in offering employment opportunities to our talented team members,” <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1885061680398213160">Midnight Society said in its shutdown announcement on X</a>. “We express our sincere gratitude to each and every one of our community members and deeply sorry we were unable to reach our ultimate goal.”</p><p>The “ultimate goal” mentioned in Midnight Society’s departing message was <em>Deadrop</em> — a free-to-play vertical extraction shooter that was initially funded by selling NFTs at the height of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893216/gdc-annual-survey-2022-game-developers-nfts">blockchain gaming frenzy</a>. <em>Deadrop</em> was expected to release in 2024, and was the only game being developed by Midnight Society.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/603863/nvidia-rtx-5090-out-of-stock-paper-launch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/598793/nvidia-rtx-5090-5080-low-stock-warning">warned of stock shortages</a> earlier this week, and now its launch of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">$1,999 RTX 5090</a> yesterday is being branded a “paper launch” after people camped outside retailers only to find a handful of cards available, if any at all.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Microcenter/comments/1iddh0i/5080_and_5090_stock_numbers_from_microcenter_by/">Reddit users</a> have been tracking inventory for RTX 5090 and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/598045/nvidia-rtx-5080-review-test-benchmark">RTX 5080</a> cards at Micro Center locations across the US, with some stores opening on Thursday with no RTX 5090 cards at all. The Tustin, California Micro Center store seems to have received the most stock, but other stores reportedly had 10 or less RTX 5090 cards. While Nvidia’s RTX 5080 was a little easier to purchase on launch day, cards rapidly went out of stock at retailers like Best Buy and Amazon.</p><p>One <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Microcenter/comments/1ie4y57/3_days_and_2_nights_later/">Reddit poster</a> claims to have secured an RTX 5090 after three days waiting in line, and others have posted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Microcenter/comments/1idr7en/thank_you_miami_microcenter_for_the_surprise_fes/">purchase vouchers</a> that were handed out to people in line at a Miami Micro Center. The overwhelming amount of posts are from people complaining about the launch and lack of stock, though.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMd2WHKnceI&amp;t=731s">Gamers Nexus claims</a> that one of the biggest system integrators in the US only received a single RTX 5090 on launch day, before a smaller shipment arrived later in the day. Another big system builder reportedly received no units and third one received 20 RTX 5090s that it sold in pre-built machines in a matter of minutes.</p><p>Many retailers are now simply listing preorders for RTX 5090 cards, with Scan in the UK <a href="https://www.scan.co.uk/shop/computer-hardware/gpu-nvidia-gaming/geforce-rtx-5090-graphics-cards">warning</a> that some cards aren’t due in stock until the end of May — four months after the launch date. Naturally, such low stock levels in the face of high demand means there are scalpers selling RTX 5090 cards <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F135526084360%3F_skw%3DRTX%2B5090%26itmmeta%3D01JJXZBP50G6YQ74BV2GKTJ4M7%26hash%3Ditem1f8dfbef08%3Ag%3A~VUAAOSwPndnm-M0" rel="sponsored">on eBay</a> for $5,000 or more. YouTuber JayzTwoCents <a href="https://x.com/JayzTwoCents/status/1885046213889663457">even found</a> an RTX 5090 on sale for $5,800 on Facebook, after he signed the card at the Tustin Micro Center store earlier in the day.</p><p>We reached out to Nvidia to comment on the RTX 5090 launch issues, but the company refused to comment beyond its previous warning about stock shortages.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
