            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It actually happened: <em>Silksong</em>, the standalone sequel to <em>Hollow Knight</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/680636/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-trailer">has a release date</a>. After seven years in development, and almost as many shrouded in silence, the game is coming out on September 4th. It’s welcome news for the millions of <em>Hollow Knight</em> fans who have been impatiently waiting. But it’s also part of a welcome trend: 2025 is shaping up to be the year that several long-in-development games finally see the light of day.</p><div><p>Joining <em>Silksong</em> later this year will be <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. While it doesn’t have a specific release date, the shooter is part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/708909/nintendo-switch-2-donkey-kong-bananza-exclusive-release-schedule">Nintendo’s steady stream of releases for the first year of the Switch 2</a>. The game has been in development so long it’s releasing on both versions of the Switch. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15782806/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-announced-e3-2017">It was first announced in 2017</a>, but in 2019, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197164/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-delay-release-date">Nintendo said that it was rebooting development of the game</a>, with original <em>Prime</em> studio Retro taking over the project. Five years went by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer">before the game appeared again</a>, with the new subtitle <em>Beyond</em>, and earlier this year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197164/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-delay-release-date">it was confirmed as a Switch 2 title</a>.</p></div><div><p>The development of <em>Routine</em> from Lunar Software has been similarly protracted. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/15/3507340/routine-sci-fi-horror-game">I originally wrote about this ’80s-style indie horror game in 2012</a>, and at one point it had been planned for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/1/13486328/routine-sci-fi-horror-game-launch-date-trailer">a 2016 launch</a>. That obviously didn’t happen, and six years later the game was “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_wpvT6uDDQ">re-revealed</a>” with a new trailer and the news that Swedish label Raw Fury would be publishing it. Then, earlier this week, slightly hidden among <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760975/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-news-trailers">all of the trailers and reveals during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live keynote</a>, was confirmation that barring any more delays, <em>Routine</em> would be launching later in 2025.</p></div><p>While both <em>Routine</em> and <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> seem to have suffered from the technical and design difficulties that can plague the development of big, complex games — at one point Nintendo’s senior managing executive officer Shinya Takahashi called <em>Metroid</em>’s development “very challenged” — that hasn’t been the case for <em>Silksong</em>. It’s just a game being built by a small team who were able to take a slow and steady approach. “It was never stuck or anything,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?srnd=undefined">Team Cherry co-founder Ari Gibson told <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. “It was always progressing. It’s just the case that we’re a small team, and games take a lot of time. There wasn’t any big controversial moment behind it.”</p><p>Of course, there’s another long-in-the-works game that was originally slated to launch in 2025 but has since been pushed back: <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>. Rockstar released the first trailer for the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23988446/gta-vi-trailer-leaked-vice-city">at the end of 2023</a>, a decade after the launch of <em>GTAV</em>, and initially planned to release <em>VI</em> in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158510/gta-6-release-date-fall-2025">the fall of this year</a>. It’s now supposed to come out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660057/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026">on May 26th, 2026</a>, so fans will have to continue to wait for that one.</p><p>But even without the blockbuster behemoth that is <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, this year will be one that satiates many fans who have been eagerly awaiting a specific game. You could even throw <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/697019/deltarune-chapters-1-2-3-4-review-pc-playstation-switch">the latest chapters of <em>Deltarune</em></a> onto that list. The real question is, with all of these games finally coming out, what’s next to obsess over? Is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/14/15801280/beyond-good-evil-2-preview-michel-ancel-interview-e3-2017">the sequel to <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em></a> really still alive? When will <em>Stardew Valley</em>’s creator launch his next game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739112/stardew-valley-creator-concernedapes-haunted-chocolatier-announcement-trailer-gameplay"><em>Haunted Chocolatier</em></a>? Will <em>Knights of the Old Republic</em> get its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/26/23279810/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-kotor-remake-development-on-pause">announced remake</a> — or will <em>Bloodborne</em> get one at all? What’s up with the next <em>Elder Scrolls</em> and <em>Half-Life 3</em>? Let’s hope for more good news in 2026.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/763698/delayed-games-silksong-metroid-prime-4-2025#comments">0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/763698/delayed-games-silksong-metroid-prime-4-2025]]></content:encoded>
