Microsoft also asks game developers to build multiple game modes to support its Xbox Series S console.</p><p>While you won’t be able to test the Power Saver mode just yet, today’s PS5 beta will allow you to pair up to four devices simultaneously to a single DualSense controller. You’ll also be able to easily switch between devices from your controller, using the PS button and the triangle, circle, cross, and square buttons for the four paired slots.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/712212/sony-ps5-power-saver-handheld-rumors]]></content:encoded>
