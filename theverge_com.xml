            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/667094/nintendo-switch-2-specs-digital-foundry<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ftech-specs%2F" rel="sponsored">Switch 2 specs page</a> is light on details. However, <em>Digital Foundry </em>has shared what it says are “rock solid” specifications for the upcoming console in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-final-tech-specs-and-system-reservations-confirmed">an article</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huxDoYXS8Ng">a video</a>, offering new information about its processor and a testing tool for developers for GameChat.</p><p>On its specs page, Nintendo only describes the Switch 2’s chip as a “custom processor made by Nvidia.” Nvidia shared <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642793/nintendo-switch-2-dlss-support-nvidia-ray-tracing">a bit more last month</a>, including that its chip enables DLSS and real-time ray tracing on the Switch 2. <em>Digital Foundry </em>gets more specific: it says the Switch 2’s custom Nvidia T239 system-on-a-chip uses an ARM Cortex A78C CPU with eight cores. Six cores will be available to developers, while two will be used for the system.</p><p>The GPU uses Nvidia’s Ampere architecture. The console also has 12GB of LPDDR5X memory, though the system will hold 3GB in reserve.</p><p>As for the Switch 2’s display capabilities, while VRR is supported on the console’s screen, the device doesn’t support VRR while in docked mode and connected to HDMI, <em>Digital Foundry </em>reports. Nintendo originally advertised that VRR would be available while docked as well, but it’s since <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-scrubs-mentions-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-supporting-vrr-on-a-tv-while-docked.1166361/">scrubbed mentions of that</a> on its website. </p><p><em>Digital Foundry</em> also notes an interesting tidbit about GameChat, the new Discord-like chat system for the Switch 2. Nintendo is offering developers a GameChat testing tool that “simulates API latency and L3 cache misses that the real world GameChat system incurs on the system, meaning developers can test this without needing active GameChat sessions running,” <em>Digital Foundry</em> says. Hopefully, this testing tool will help developers make sure that GameChat doesn’t bog down their games.</p><p><em>Digital Foundry</em> has a lot more detail than I covered here, so check out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-final-tech-specs-and-system-reservations-confirmed">its</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huxDoYXS8Ng">coverage</a> of the specs to learn more. The Switch 2 is scheduled to launch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">on June 5th</a>, and if you missed getting a preorder, you might want to consider <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/665958/nintendo-switch-2-best-buy-stock-launch-day">lining up at Best Buy</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
