            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Greetings from the year of Linux on my desktop.</p><p>In November, I got fed up and said <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/823337/switching-linux-gaming-desktop-cachyos">screw it, I’m installing Linux</a>. Since that article was published, I have dealt with one minor catastrophe after another. None of that has anything to do with Linux, mind you. It just meant I didn’t install it on my desktop until Sunday evening.</p><p>My goal here is to see how far I can get using Linux as my main OS <em>without</em> spending a ton of time futzing with it — or even much time researching beforehand. I am not looking for more high-maintenance hobbies at this stage. I want to see if Linux is a wingable alternative to Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/821948/microsoft-windows-11-ai-agents-taskbar-integration">increasingly annoying OS</a>.</p><p>Honestly? So far it’s been fine. Many things I expected to be difficult — like getting my Nvidia graphics card working properly — were perfectly straightforward. A few things I thought would be simple weren’t. And I’ve run into one very funny issue with a gaming mouse that <em>only</em> works in games. But I’ve been able to use my Linux setup for work this week, I played exactly one video game, and I even printed something from my accursed printer.</p><div><p id="day-one"><h2>Day one</h2></p></div><p>I picked <a href="https://cachyos.org/">CachyOS</a> rather than a better-known distro like Ubuntu because it’s optimized for modern hardware, and I had heard that it’s easy to install and set up for gaming, which is one of the reasons I’d stuck with Windows for this long. After backing up my Windows image sometime in December (close enough), I follow the <a href="https://wiki.cachyos.org/installation/installation_on_root/">installation instructions in the Cachy wiki</a> and download the <a href="https://cachyos.org/">CachyOS</a> live image to a <a href="https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html">Ventoy</a> USB drive, plug it into my PC, reboot into the BIOS to disable Secure Boot, reboot again into the Ventoy bootloader, and launch the CachyOS disk image.</p><p>First challenge: My mouse buttons don’t work. I can move the cursor, but can’t click on anything. I try plugging in a mouse (without unplugging the first one), same deal. Not a major issue; I can get around fine with just the keyboard. Maybe this is just an issue with the live image.</p><p>I launch the installer and am thrust into analysis paralysis. An operating system needs lots of little pieces to work — stuff you don’t even think of as individual components if you use Mac or Windows. How do you boot into the OS? What runs the desktop environment? How are windows drawn? What’s the file system? Where do you get software updates? In Mac and Windows, all those decisions are made for you. But Linux is fundamentally different: The core of the OS is the kernel, and everything else is kind of up to you. A distro is just somebody’s idea of what pieces to use. Some, like <a href="https://system76.com/pop/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaheiCcxLI9c_91oVN7uwiR6EIckpvCR9HWEN3781ua9N_u3E3">Pop_OS!</a> and <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Mint</a>, aim for simplicity and make all those choices for you (though you can still change them if you want). But Cachy is based on <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch</a>, a notoriously DIY distro, and before I do anything else, I have to pick one of four bootloaders. I pick Limine, for reasons I can’t recall.</p><p>Next, I need to figure out where to install it. On the recommendation of Will Smith from the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2888221/check-out-pcworlds-new-linux-podcast.html"><em>Dual Boot Diaries</em> podcast</a> — from whom the “an operating system is a bunch of pieces” thing above is largely cribbed — I install Cachy on a different physical drive from Windows, since Windows updates tend not to care if they overwrite other bootloaders.</p><p>I have a 4TB storage drive with just over a terabyte of data on it, so I shrink that partition down to 2TB using the installer’s manual partitioning interface, then (following the guide) make a 2GB boot partition and a root partition using the btrfs file system. The guide says it needs at least 20GB, so I go big and make it 100GB. This will cause a minor problem later.</p><p>Next, I have to pick <a href="https://wiki.cachyos.org/installation/desktop_environments/">one of <em>thirteen</em> different desktop environments</a>. This is too many options. KDE and Gnome seem to be the best-supported for gaming, so I pick KDE. I could rabbit-hole on this, but I don’t.</p><p>And then I just have to pick a username and password and name the computer. After some thought, I go with Maggie, after my in-laws’ cat, who half the family calls Linux. She doesn’t answer to either name.</p><p>Installation takes six minutes. I reboot the computer, and it loads into the Limine bootloader, which has also found my Windows install, so I can choose between Cachy and Windows.</p><p>Then I’m on the Cachy desktop, and my mouse buttons <em>still</em> aren’t working. Swapping USB ports doesn’t do anything. Plugging in my trackball doesn’t fix it either. I finally try <em>unplugging</em> the mouse, which makes the trackball work normally. My gaming mouse is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2010/07/overkill-as-art-ars-reviews-the-cyborg-rat-7/">an ancient Mad Catz Cyborg RAT 7</a>; it turns out this is a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Mad_Catz_Mouse">known issue</a>. I defer editing configuration files for now and just keep the mouse unplugged.</p><div><p id="stuff-that-works"><h2><strong>Stuff that works</strong></h2></p></div><p>That weird mouse aside, all of the hardware I’ve tried so far has just worked. Cachy automatically installed the correct GPU drivers; my monitor, speakers, and Logitech webcam work fine with no effort. Even my printer prints, with only a tweak to my firewall settings.</p><p>There are lots of ways to install apps on Linux. Sometimes you can just download them from a company’s website, or you get them from your distro’s official repositories, or GitHub, or wherever. There’s no official app store for Linux, but there are at least three projects aiming to provide universal Linux apps: Flatpak, AppImage, and Snap. Neat! Commence hodgepodging.</p><p>I grab Chromium, Discord, Slack, and Audacity using the “Install Apps” button on Cachy’s welcome screen. Slack I get from the Arch User Repository. Twenty minutes later, I try to install 1Password from the same location, but the repository is down. I pick up my kid from a playdate and try again. It works.</p><div><p id="whats-missing"><h2><strong>What’s missing</strong></h2></p></div><p>I prefer the Arc browser, which doesn’t have a Linux build, but there are plenty of browsers. Firefox and Chromium will do. I can’t find official apps for Airtable (which I use for work), Spotify, or Apple Music, but they all work fine in the browser in the short term, and I’ll revisit this later.</p><div><p id="shall-we-play-a-game"><h2><strong>Shall we play a game?</strong></h2></p></div><p>Cachy has a one-click gaming package install that includes the Proton compatibility layer, Steam, and <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/">Heroic</a> (a launcher for Epic, GOG, and Amazon). I figure I ought to try <em>one</em> game. Then I remember that my root partition is only 100GB. I reboot back into the Cachy live image and use the Parted utility to increase it to 1TB, then make a second btrfs partition in the remaining space. I reboot, log into Epic and GOG, and start downloading <em>The Outer Worlds</em>, a game from 2019 I’ve been playing a bit lately. It runs fine with Proton, and I can even sync my saves from the cloud. I play it for a few minutes with my trackball, remember I hate gaming on a trackball, and plug my gaming mouse back in. It works fine as long as I’m in the game, but outside the game, mouse clicks stop working again. It makes sense — the bug is on the desktop, not in games — but it’s very funny to have a gaming mouse that <em>only</em> works for gaming.</p><div><p id="the-children-yearn-for-the-mines"><h2><strong>The children yearn for the mines</strong></h2></p></div><p>The biggest issue I’ve had so far is <em>Minecraft: Bedrock Edition</em>. For some reason, Microsoft hasn’t prioritized making a Linux version of Bedrock. Java Edition works fine in Linux, but I play <em>Minecraft</em> with my kids, and they’re on Bedrock Edition on their iPads. There’s supposed to be a way to run the Android app with <a href="https://flathub.org/en/apps/io.mrarm.mcpelauncher">MCPE Launcher</a>, but I couldn’t get it to work. There’s also a project to get the Windows version running on Proton, which will be my next step.</p><div><p id="stuff-i-havent-tried-yet"><h2><strong>Stuff I haven’t tried yet</strong></h2></p></div><p>I hear good things about <a href="https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy?tab=readme-ov-file">howdy</a>, a Linux equivalent to Windows Hello face authentication, but I haven’t installed it yet. I hear the <a href="https://zen-browser.app/">Zen</a> browser is a good Arc alternative. I also haven’t gotten my cloud storage synced, configured git so I can compile programs from scratch, figured out a backup strategy, or tried much other hardware beyond what’s currently plugged into my computer. There’s a command-line Spotify player I want to try. I’ve only scratched the surface.</p><div><p>I did take the time to install a KDE Plasma <a href="https://store.kde.org/p/2136378">theme that makes it look like Windows XP,</a> though. Just because.</p></div><div><p id="regret-level-none"><h2><strong>Regret level: none</strong></h2></p></div><p>I’m well aware this is the honeymoon phase. And using Linux for less than a week isn’t exactly a flex. Many people use Linux. And I haven’t even tried doing anything particularly difficult, or playing a game that came out this decade. But so far it’s been a much easier transition than expected, and a quieter experience overall. My OS isn’t trying to change my browser or search engine to make some shareholder happy somewhere. It’s not nudging me to try some bullshit AI feature.</p><p>Will I go crawling back to macOS or Windows the first time I have to edit a batch of photos? Possibly! I’ll definitely boot back into Windows — or pull out a Chromebook — to play <em>Minecraft</em> with my kids, if I can’t get it running on Linux. And I don’t think I’ll ever be able to use Linux exclusively; my job as a reviews editor means I have to stay familiar with as many operating systems as possible. (This is a good way to drive yourself nuts.)</p><p>I’m sure I’ll run into plenty of fun problems soon enough. But the first few days have been great.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Mzk1"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Nathan Edwards</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/858910/linux-diary-gaming-desktop]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Stevie Bonifield is a news writer here at </em>The Verge<em> and, they say, “I cover a little bit of just about everything, from the FCC to AI shopping tools to Linux.” Before joining our news team, they wrote weekend news for </em>PC Gamer <em>and did reviews, news, features, and guides for </em>Laptop Mag<em>, along with some stories for </em>Tom’s Guide, IGN, TechRadar<em>, and </em>XDA<em>. “I’ve been reading (and watching) </em>The Verge<em> since I was in high school,“ they add, ”so it’s pretty exciting to be part of the team now.“ </em></p><p><em>Outside of writing, Stevie says “I also love gaming, reading, and TTRPGs (tabletop roleplaying games). As you’ll probably be able to tell from my workspace, I’m kind of a total nerd.” </em></p><p><strong>Let’s begin with the basics. Where is your work space located?</strong></p><p>My desk and work space are in my bedroom. I share my apartment with a roommate, so we both work from our bedrooms so we don’t distract each other during the day. I don’t really mind not having a separate office — it means I only have to worry about decorating and managing one space instead of two. I recently moved to New Jersey from Pittsburgh, PA, so I’m still getting everything set up here.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>A VIVO adjustable desk, together with a Haworth Breck chair, makes working more comfortable.</em></figcaption></p></div><p><strong>Could you tell us about your desk and your chair?</strong></p><div><p>I’m using a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073K1JSW7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">VIVO 3-stage adjustable desk</a> with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WQ117GP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">VIVO 60-inch desktop</a> and a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D1025X1701640%26xs%3D1%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fstore.haworth.com%252Fproducts%252Fbreck-office-chair" rel="sponsored">Haworth Breck</a> chair. I got both when I moved last month, so I haven’t been using them for long, but I like them so far.</p></div><p>This is actually a standing desk, which I’ve never used before. I got it so I could have my desk height pretty low — I’m on the shorter side and most desks are too high for me. This one goes all the way down to 24 inches, lower than even I need, which is really nice. The option to use it as a standing desk is a cool perk, even though that isn’t what I bought it for. My cable management under the desk still needs some cleaning up, but I’m working on it! I have a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CV9P2FR5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">VIVO clamp-on cable management net</a> containing most of it for now.</p><p>I like the Haworth Breck so far, but it’s a pretty basic chair. Like my desk, a big part of why I got this one is its height range. It’s extremely difficult for me to find decent desk chairs that go as low as I need them to (<em>without</em> requiring a footrest). This one has a minimum seat height of around 15 inches and has adjustable seat depth, both of which I’ve really appreciated. That said, I wish it had a headrest.</p><p><strong>Tell us about the various tech devices you’re using. </strong></p><p>My setup is a little crazy because I have three different computers running to my two monitors.</p><div id=":R1j1djeab96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>A gaming PC with unfortunate issues.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>This desk side device lets laptops hang off the side of the desk.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>My gaming PC lives on the floor under my desk. It’s currently temporarily out of commission because I’m having a hardware issue. Unfortunately, my RAM seems to be on the fritz, which is pretty bad timing considering the current <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/839506/ram-shortage-price-increases-pc-gaming-smartphones">RAM pricing nightmare</a>. Most of it is still working, though! It has an AMD Ryzen 7 7700X CPU, an AMD Radeon RX 6600 GPU, an Asus ROG Strix B650-A motherboard, and a pair of 16GB Corsair Vengeance DDR5 RAM sticks (which apparently need to be replaced, after less than a year of use).</p><p>That’s also my Linux PC — it’s currently running Fedora 41 with the Cinnamon desktop environment, but I’m updating to Fedora 43 soon and planning to switch to the KDE Plasma desktop environment.</p><p>Hanging off the side of my desk are my work and personal laptops, both the M4 MacBook Air. My laptops are only connected to my left monitor, which is a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZTBVKKW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">27-inch 1440p Viewsonic Omni (VX2728J-2K)</a>. My gaming PC is connected to both monitors. I mainly play games on the right monitor since it has better color accuracy. It’s a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CV24GQ9W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">27-inch 1440p Asus ROG Strix gaming monitor (XG27ACS)</a>.</p><p>Neither one of my monitors is anything fancy, but both are good enough for my needs. Between the two, I would probably recommend the ROG one more, although I’m not a huge fan of the buttons being located on the back since I need those to swap input modes so I can switch to my Mac. When I’m working during the day I usually have my work laptop running on the left monitor and my Linux PC on the right monitor. My keyboard and mouse I chose specifically because they make it easy to jump between all my devices.</p><div id=":R1k9djeab96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The Nuphy Halo75 V2 with Nuphy’s Mint switches.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>This mouse is Stevie’s favorite right now.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>I’ve reviewed quite a few keyboards, so it’s a little ironic that the one I’m using now I actually haven’t reviewed. It’s the <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/nuphy-Mechancial-Swappable-Bluetooth-Raspberry/dp/B0D5Q5XYLV?sr=8-2&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Nuphy Halo75 V2</a> with Nuphy’s Mint switches. It sounds and feels great, works really smoothly with macOS, and I can jump between my laptops and PC with a quick keyboard shortcut. The battery life could be a bit better, but admittedly I leave the RGB on, so that’s probably not helping. Overall, though, I really like the design and sound quality on the Halo75 — it’s one of the only keyboards I’ve tried that I’m happy with out-of-the-box without making any DIY customizations.</p><p>My mouse is actually one of my favorite devices right now. I’ve tested some great gaming mice, but this one is my personal daily driver and not one I reviewed. It’s the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22403511/razer-orochi-v2-wireless-gaming-mouse-battery-life-custom-price-features">Razer Orochi V2</a>, and I got it on sale for $35 on Amazon earlier this year. It’s nothing fancy, but the size and feel are perfect for me. Most gaming mice feel kind of enormous in my hand, but I swear Razer designed the Orochi for my palm specifically. Like my keyboard, it’s also able to jump between a Bluetooth connection and a 2.4GHz dongle. Despite the budget-friendly price, it’s a great mouse.</p><p>Underneath that I’m currently using a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09GWBBPXK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Matrix Blizzard mousepad</a>. I got it on Amazon, but unfortunately, I think it’s sold out now. I wanted something with a little bit of a design going on, but not anything too detailed or distracting. This design just about perfectly fit what I was looking for. I wish it was a tad thicker, but it’s more interesting than a plain black mousepad, and that’s good enough for me.</p><p>I have two controllers on my desk, a <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Headsets-Console/dp/B0F1HTGDTL?sr=8-2&amp;tag=theverge02-20">standard Xbox controller</a> for my Mac and the <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Xbox-One-X-S-Windows/dp/B09C13DWYL?sr=1-1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">wired Razer Wolverine V2</a> for my gaming PC. I don’t normally like wired controllers, but I really love the Wolverine. The clicky buttons on Razer controllers are so satisfying to me, and they tend to offer consistently good performance in my experience. My favorite mobile controller is also from Razer, the <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Gaming-Controller-Android-iPhone-Smartphone/dp/B0CXGMPLWK?sr=1-1&amp;ufe=app_do:amzn1.fos.9fe8cbfa-bf43-43d1-a707-3f4e65a4b666&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Kishi Ultra</a>.</p><p>My preferred headphones are my <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Translation-Headphones-High-Fidelity/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?sr=1-3&amp;tag=theverge02-20">AirPods Pro 3</a>. The ANC and spatial audio is fantastic for watching shows and movies on my laptop (and helps me focus when I’m working). I don’t like wearing earbuds all the time, though, so I also keep a basic pair of on-ear Sony headphones around, the <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-CH520-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone/dp/B0BS1QB15L?sr=1-2&amp;tag=theverge02-20">WH-CH250</a>. The audio quality on these isn’t particularly impressive, but they’re super affordable.</p><p>Last, but certainly not least, I also have a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Seiren-Chroma-Microphone-Mute/dp/B0CT7D7JVR?sr=8-2&amp;ufe=app_do:amzn1.fos.9fe8cbfa-bf43-43d1-a707-3f4e65a4b666&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Razer Seiren V3 Chroma</a> mic off to the side of my desk on a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091TL554W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">clamp-on mic arm</a> I got on Amazon. I’ve been using the Seiren for a couple years now for gaming and playing <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> with my online group. The audio quality could be a bit better, but it’s a significant improvement over most built-in headphone mics, and I’ve never had any bugs or issues with it. Notably, it works on Linux for me without needing any tweaks or work-arounds.</p><p><strong>That is a great laptop holder you have at the side of your desk. What is it?</strong></p><p>I just got that when I moved last month, and it’s one of my favorite additions to my desk setup. It’s a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQX3WTB8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">double-decker laptop mount</a> I got for around $30 on Amazon and just clamps onto the side of my desk (no screws necessary!).</p><p>I wanted to free up some desk space, and this lets me keep both of my laptops nearby and out of the way at the same time. I also used a command strip to stick a USB-C hub to the back of the laptop tray, so I can quickly hop between my personal and work laptops on my external monitor by just moving over the USB-C cable and charging cable.</p><p><strong>Great wall decorations. Tell us a bit about your Elmville map and what surrounds it.</strong></p><p>This is the wall across from my desk that people see when I have my webcam on, so I put all my coolest stuff on it. I’m a huge fan of <a href="https://watch.dropout.tv/dimension-20"><em>Dimension 20</em></a> on Dropout, so I immediately picked up one of those Elmville maps when they released them. For those who haven’t checked out <em>Dimension 20</em> yet, Elmville is the main setting for <em>Fantasy High</em>, one of the best shows Dropout has to offer, in my humble opinion.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>There is a lot of really cool stuff up on the wall across from the desk.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The smaller horizontal picture below the map is actually a page from Dropout’s 2025 <em>Dimension 20</em> calendar that I got at their Madison Square Garden show last January. It’s a scene from season 2 of <em>Fantasy High</em>, and I just thought the artist did such a great job with it that it deserved to be framed. Off to the right above that one is a print I got from an art convention. It’s not from any show or movie as far as I know; the design just resonated with me.</p><p>The two smaller prints above the map are also from art conventions and were made by the same artist, <a href="https://www.1000deaddraculas.com/">Natasha Tara Petrović</a>. The purple one is some cool Mothman art — I have a soft spot for cryptids and spooky stuff. The blue one is a <em>Dark Souls</em> print that makes the game look <em>way</em> cozier than it is.</p><p>And last but not least, I’ve got some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B83GQKR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Nanoleaf Elements</a> tiles lighting up that wall. These are the first smart lights I’ve ever bought, and they’re pretty cool, especially with the more mellow wood look. I have them set to shift colors and brightness throughout the day.</p><p><strong>You’re obviously into <em>Star Wars</em> and other science fiction / fantasy worlds, judging from the toys over your bookcase and the figures on that little shelf. Are you a serious fan or do you just like the genre?</strong></p><p>I am a huge <em>Star Wars</em> fan. One of my earliest memories is watching <em>The Phantom Menace</em> on VHS, and I’ve loved the franchise ever since. Obi-Wan is my favorite character, which I’m noticing is a bit obvious in my work space.</p><p>The lightsaber above my bookcase is Obi-Wan’s from<em> The Phantom Menace</em>. I’ve had it since probably kindergarten or first grade, so it’s a little beat up. And next to that I’ve got a special edition Obi-Wan Funko Pop. Then above my desk I have a Lego model of Obi-Wan’s Jedi starfighter from <em>Attack of the Clones</em>.</p><p>On the shelf below that I’ve managed to squeeze in the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> series minifigures I’ve collected (I’m a few shy of the full collection). These shelves ended up being way smaller than expected, so I’m planning to add more so things aren’t quite so cramped. I thought Lego did a great job with these <em>D&amp;D</em> minifigures, though, and would love to see them do more <em>D&amp;D</em> sets. My personal favorite from this series is the dragonborn paladin.</p><div id=":R1ppdjeab96:"><div><div><p><figcaption><em> Obi-Wan’s lightsaber from </em>The Phantom Menace <em>along with some Funko Pops.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>A Lego model of Obi-Wan’s Jedi starfighter.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><div><div><p><figcaption><em>A collection of </em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons<em> series minifigures.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>And finally, the rock collection.</em></figcaption></p></div></div></div><p>The other Funko Pop next to Obi-Wan is Vi from <em>Arcane</em>, which is a truly phenomenal show and a personal favorite of mine. I’m not much of a Funko Pop person, but I’ll get them from time to time if it’s a character I really like.</p><p>I guess I would say I’m a serious sci-fi and fantasy fan, although I tend to connect with specific series or books and stick with those. To go back to the <em>Star Wars</em> example, on one of the lower shelves in my bookcase, I have most of the old <em>Jedi Apprentice</em> books. They’ve gotten pretty hard to find, but I loved them as a kid, so I’m trying to collect them all again.</p><p>On the fantasy side of things, I love epic fantasy like <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, but also like some YA books, especially <em>The Hunger Games</em> and <em>Percy Jackson</em>. At the moment, I’m reading <em>The Name of the Wind</em> by Patrick Rothfuss and <em>Brigands &amp; Breadknives</em> by Travis Baldree, which is the third book in his <em>Legends &amp; Lattes</em> series. Both are great, although they have drastically different tones.</p><p><strong>You also have a rock collection!</strong></p><p>I do! Much like a goldfish, it has grown to fill the size of its container, and now it can grow no more. I’ve always had an interest in geology and have had some of the rocks and minerals in that case since I was a kid.</p><p>I have a bunch of quartz, a geode, some copper, chalcopyrite, amazonite, dravite, moissanite, a sliver of obsidian, a lump of basalt, some feldspar and sedimentary rocks, and a bunch of smaller tumbled stones. There’s also a chunk of petrified wood in the back that I found in a streambed. My favorites are the chunk of amber in the front and the bismuth above it — I love how bismuth crystals get that neat geometric shape.</p><p><strong>Anything else I missed that you’d like to add?</strong></p><p>While I don’t use it for work, my <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.kobobooks.com%2Fproducts%2Fkobo-clara-bw" rel="sponsored">Kobo Clara BW e-reader</a> is almost always on my desk. My bookcases are pretty much full (and a bit small — I’m planning to replace them eventually), so I’ve been reading more ebooks over the past year or so.</p><p>I switched from a Kindle to a Kobo several months ago and have been loving the Kobo. The display and user experience on the Clara are better than their Kindle counterparts in my experience, and you have more freedom to add books from outside Kobo’s store and back up everything in your library on other devices. My Kobo is in my everyday carry now, although in hindsight, I wish I’d gotten one with a color display.</p><p><em>Photography by Stevie Bonifield</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzA3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Barbara Krasnoff</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/850479/desk-pc-keyboard-razer-kobo]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://play.date/games/diora/"><em>Diora</em></a> might be the most ambitious game I’ve played on the Playdate. It’s all about perspective: You turn the handheld’s crank to rotate your viewpoint of the bite-size 3D landscapes, which lets you peek around corners to find solutions to various puzzles. On a device with a 1-bit, black-and-white display, the miniature worlds feel miraculous, like little dioramas you can spin around in your hands. But the most impressive part is the puzzles that will have you twisting your brain as much as the crank.</p><p>In <em>Diora</em> you play a “network technician” traveling to various locations across a city, fixing up machinery in the wake of a strange accident. Repairing things is easy; all you have to do is reach the computer at the end of each level. Getting there is the hard part.</p><p><em>Diora</em> starts out relatively simple. You hit switches to open up gates or push platforms to create pathways. What makes these familiar puzzles interesting, though, is how <em>Diora</em> plays with your viewpoint. You have to constantly shift where you’re looking to find the right way forward. This can turn even seemingly simple challenges into real brain-scratchers. Each level also steadily ratchets up the intensity. Most have you exploring multi-level structures where the first few floors introduce a concept before hitting you with something more complex.</p><p>It’s reminiscent of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317107/monument-valley-3-netflix-launch-ustwo-games-interview"><em>Monument Valley</em></a> or <em>Fez</em>, though <em>Diora</em> is different in a few key ways. For one, the architecture (mostly) isn’t filled with M.C. Escher-inspired impossibilities, but instead buildings and structures rooted in reality. And whereas <em>Monument Valley</em> is an almost serene experience, <em>Diora</em> can get <em>really</em> hard. I found myself stuck on more than one occasion, as many of the solutions involve making decisions in a very precise order. There’s no hint system to help you out, which can be frustrating, but <em>Diora</em> does at least have a checkpoint system that means you won’t be replaying huge chunks of the game after making a mistake.</p><p>This game is also a good sign that, a few years after launch, developers are really pushing the edges of what the Playdate is capable of. There aren’t many 3D titles on the handheld, and <em>Diora</em> has a sort of grittiness that both fits the Playdate’s aesthetic and lends the game a surprisingly chill postapocalyptic vibe. <em>Diora</em> even has a built-in level editor so you can create your own puzzles.</p><p>Not long ago I wrote that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/811497/playdate-puzzle-game-reviews-lexgrid-togglebot-what-time-is-it">one of the Playdate’s strengths was its steadily growing library of puzzle games</a>. They suit the device perfectly: experiences you can play in short bursts when you’re on the go, but also lose yourself in when you’re traveling or otherwise killing time. <em>Diora</em> is right near the top of the list of games I’d recommend; it’s technically impressive, but more importantly, it’s a puzzler that forces your brain to see things in different ways.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/859675/diora-review-playdate-monument-valley]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342952/best-runs-of-agdq-2025-speedrunning-charity-twitch">Games Done Quick</a>, the biannual charity speedrunning event currently going on right now, not only helps organizations like the Prevent Cancer Foundation and Doctors Without Borders — it helps indie games get noticed, too. Indie game developers face an incredible uphill battle not only getting their projects funded, completed, and launched, but discovered as well. Events like GDQ can be a boon to developers, exposing tens of thousands of viewers to little-known games like <em>Bat to the Heavens</em>, <em>Small Saga</em>, and more.</p><p>“It was extremely exciting,” said Ceroro, developer of <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3044100%2FBat_to_the_Heavens%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Bat to the Heavens</em></a>, a platformer in which the character must ascend to the heavens using a bat because she cannot jump. <em>Bat to the Heavens</em> is Ceroro’s first official game and was released in 2024. It was featured during Awesome Games Done Quick 2026 and late last year at <a href="https://horaro.org/rtaij/rtaijw2025">RTA in Japan</a>. Ceroro said that while her game has been generally successful, getting on GDQ gave it a big boost. “Right after the AGDQ run, there was a large burst in sales and wishlists I haven’t seen since I initially released the game!” she said.</p><p>Solo developer Darya Noghani said <a href="https://smallsaga.com/"><em>Small Saga</em></a>, her turn-based RPG about a mouse who wants to kill god, got a nice uptick in attention after being featured at GDQ as well. “A number of streamers played the game on Twitch, several commenters recommended the game on platforms like Bluesky, and there was a nice uptick in sales,” they said.</p><p>But the attention of getting your game run at a GDQ event can come with a price. “You’re in a state of apprehension,” said Noghani. Speedrunners extensively exploit glitches and develop techniques to skip large chunks of gameplay, which might show viewers a less-than-ideal version of the game. “Runners are pushing the game to break in particular ways, and you know this is adjacent to the game just crashing and ruining the run.”</p><p>But Noghani also said that the <em>Small Saga </em>run was relatively glitch-free: “I’ll take that as a win.”</p><p>Sometimes a runner breaking a game is what the developer had in mind. “Exploits and glitches are something that taps into the nature of game design,” Ceroro said. While the <em>Bat to the Heavens </em>run also didn’t make extensive use of glitches, “A lot of the extreme movement and techniques used in the run are pretty much within bounds of the intended design,” she said.</p><p>Ceroro’s also not worried that watching a speedrun of <em>Bat to the Heavens</em> will spoil the game for potential new players. “The speedrun for <em>Bat to the Heavens</em> went by too fast to actually get a good understanding of everything or how the game actually feels, so it’ll be a shock to new players,” she said.</p><p>Thanks to GDQ, new players are coming. But while all the developers I spoke to were pleased with the newfound attention and increased sales, they also said the personal achievement of getting their game run at GDQ was just as important.</p><p>“It’s been exciting,” said Noghani. “Because GDQ is genuinely well-loved by both players and developers, not just for its charitable causes, but because of the efforts they’ve taken to cultivate an uplifting community.”</p><p>GDQ is much beloved in the online gaming community. Over the years, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23341082/awesome-games-done-quick-2023-online-event-florida-ron-desantis">event runners have implemented a top-down approach</a> to diversity and inclusion, hosting <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/site/blackinaflash">several</a> <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/site/framefatales">smaller events</a> focused on highlighting streamers from marginalized backgrounds. GDQ has also fostered a community where saying “trans rights” elicits the same kind of enthusiastic response that an OSU alum would get <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2180057762412949">shouting “O-H”</a> in a crowded Columbus bar.</p><p>“In the development community, it’s a giant moment,” said Xalavier Nelson Jr., creative director at <em>Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator </em>developer Strange Scaffold, which has had <a href="https://youtu.be/PevqoNW1ktg?si=VPZCw0Pze-wnE6Up">its games featured in GDQ events</a>. “I got about as many congratulations for appearing on Games Done Quick as I have for getting married. It’s that much of a touchstone — and that positive of an overall event and community.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/859891/awesome-games-done-quick-2026-indie-games-small-saga]]></content:encoded>
