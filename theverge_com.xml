            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/logitech/652423/logitech-price-increases-mouse-keyboard-accessories<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/wes-davis">Wes Davis</a> <span>is a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Many of Logitech’s products are pricier now than they were in the recent past. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4d__01u2mc">video published this week</a>, YouTuber Cameron Dougherty detailed increases as high as 25 percent on the company’s PC and gaming accessories, including well-known Logitech gear like the MX Master 3S mouse.</p><p>I took a peek at a few Internet Archive captures of Logitech’s current offerings to confirm the YouTuber’s findings, and sure enough, prices are going up. The MX Master 3S, my favorite mouse and the one I’m using at this very moment, <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fp%2Fmx-master-3s.910-006556" rel="sponsored">now costs $119.99</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250219183053/https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/mx-master-3s.910-006556">$20 increase from before</a>. And on the keyboards side, for instance, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23858523/logitech-pro-x-tkl-lightspeed-mechanical-gaming-keyboard-price-release-date-specs-features">Pro X TKL</a> has <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fgaming-keyboards%2Fpro-x-tkl-wireless-keyboard.html" rel="sponsored">gone up to $219.99</a> from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250303235239/https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/pro-x-tkl-wireless-keyboard.920-012154">$199.99 before</a>. One keyboard Dougherty calls out, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250321205050/https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/k400-plus-touchpad-keyboard.920-007119">previously $27.99</a> K400 Plus Wireless Touch, <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fp%2Fk400-plus-touchpad-keyboard.920-007119" rel="sponsored">went up by $7 to $34.99</a> — a relatively small increase that, at 25 percent, is one of the higher price bumps Logitech made.</p><p>Dougherty notes a few products that didn’t see price increases, including the MX Ergo mouse and the G703 gaming mouse. And according to the video, a handful of products have actually dropped in price, like the Pro X Superlight mouse, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250207231555/https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/pro-x-superlight-wireless-mouse.910-005940.html">was $159.99</a>, but is <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fgaming-mice%2Fpro-x-superlight-wireless-mouse.910-005940.html" rel="sponsored">now $149.99</a>.</p><p>Logitech doesn’t seem to have publicly announced the price changes, so we can’t say for certain when or why it made the changes. The most likely explanation is that it’s a response to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">President Donald Trump’s global tariffs</a>, which the company cited earlier this month as it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/647130/logitech-has-withdrawn-its-fiscal-year-2026-outlook-because-of-tariffs">withdrew its financial outlook</a> for fiscal year 2026. Logitech didn’t immediately respond to our request for comment.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This time, it’s through the <em>Star Wars</em>-themed Galactic Battle, a new Battle Royale season that starts May 2nd and features Darth Jar Jar and the debut of Force Lightning, a new in-game ability. The news was appropriately <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/swcj-2025-fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle">revealed at Star Wars Celebration</a> in Japan. As with most <em>Fortnite</em> seasons, this one had been heavily rumored in the runup.</p><p>For the uninitiated, Darth Jar Jar is a <a href="https://screenrant.com/star-wars-darth-jar-jar-theory-explained/">goofy fan theory</a> that holds that Jar Jar Binks was secretly a Force user and possibly the real villain of the <em>Star Wars</em> prequel trilogy.</p><p>Ahmed Best, the voice of Jar Jar Binks since <em>Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace</em>, said on stage at the event that he improvised some Darth Jar Jar lines for the portrayal. When asked to list any of his favorites, he said, “‘I am the phantom menace’ was totally [improvised],” adding that the line was something he’s “been meaning to say for over 20 years.”</p><p>Galactic Battle will include X-Wings and TIE Fighters that players can pilot, themed maps, and “all-new Item Shop offerings including Mace Windu.” Players will also be able to buy put their hard-earned Fortnite V-Bucks towards a <em>Star Wars-</em>themed Battle Pass with characters like Emperor Palpatine and Wookiee Cuddle Team Leader. Galactic Battle will play out over five weeks with different themes leading up to a narrative live event. Here’s the schedule, <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/swcj-2025-fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle">from StarWars.com</a>:</p><div><blockquote><p>Imperial Takeover – May 2, 2025</p><p>The Pull of the Force – May 8, 2025</p><p>Mandalorian Rising – May 22, 2025</p><p>Star Destroyer Bombardment – May 29, 2025</p><p>Death Star Sabotage – June 7, 2025</p></blockquote></div><div><p>Of course, this is far from the first collaboration between the two pop culture behemoths.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/interview/649723/henk-rogers-tetris-book-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When Henk Rogers first read the script for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23650577/apple-tetris-movie-taron-egerton-review">the <em>Tetris</em> movie</a>, he was shocked. “There was so much Hollywood in the movie,” he tells <em>The Verge</em>. “It just drove me nuts.” The film largely follows a pivotal period in Rogers’ life, when he traveled to the Soviet Union to navigate the complex rights issues for <em>Tetris</em> to bring it to platforms like the Game Boy. There, he connected with game’s creator Alexey Pajitnov, with whom he eventually formed a lifelong friendship, and turned <em>Tetris </em>into a global phenomenon.</p><p>The movie turned this experience into something resembling a high-stakes spy thriller — and while Rogers ended up loving the final product, that initial experience inspired him to tell the story of what really happened. “While reading the script I said, ‘I have to set the record straight,’” he says.</p><p>That story now exists in the form of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Game-Tetris-Russia-Love/dp/1962603202?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored"><em>The Perfect Game</em></a>. While Rogers originally sat down to write about the events that transpired in the movie, he soon realized the story was much bigger than that. “I started writing it, and somebody looked at it and said, ‘That could be a book, it’s just not big enough,’” he explains. “I didn’t want to rewrite that part and add water, so to speak, so I added the before and after. So it ended up being about my game career.”</p><p><em>The Perfect Game</em> starts out by exploring Rogers’ early life, bouncing around from the Netherlands to New York City to Hawaii, before eventually landing in Japan, where he founded Bullet-Proof Software and went on to release the influential RPG <em>The Black Onyx</em>. Even before the book gets to the <em>Tetris</em> part of the tale, it’s filled with fascinating insight into the early days of game development. Rogers talks through the many complications and nuances of dealing with publishers and funding, as well as releasing and marketing a game in Japan despite not speaking Japanese.</p><p>But things really kicked into gear at CES in 1988, when he flew to Las Vegas in search of a new game to publish and stumbled on a puzzle game about falling blocks. As he tells it, he knew immediately that he found something special. “I left the Consumer Electronics Show with a sense of purpose,” Rogers writes in his book. “I was determined to publish <em>Tetris </em>in Japan.” That proved tricky, of course, due in large part to the web of copyright laws in the Soviet Union at the time. Rogers found himself traveling back and forth between the Soviet Union and Japan, dealing with everyone from the higher-ups at Nintendo — including legendary designer Shigeru Miyamoto — to the intimidating employees at Soviet trade organizations.</p><div><p>“There’s times when my memory is a little shady, but it was such an exciting time that I pretty much remember.”</p></div><p>Rogers’ account is a detailed one, and he says that he wrote the book entirely from memory. That said, he did check with his friend Pajitnov on a few details, which resulted in one of the book’s more charming features. At various points, Pajitnov’s thoughts are inserted into the book, where he often disagrees with Rogers on small details, like how impressed he was by the Famicom version of <em>Tetris</em> or the quality of the elevator in his apartment building.</p><p>“Alexei read my manuscript and was writing in the margins where his memory is different, so I decided to keep those and put them in the book,” Rogers explains. “There’s times when my memory is a little shady, but it was such an exciting time that I pretty much remember.”</p><p>Even if it’s missing the Hollywood thrills of the script that inspired Rogers to write in the first place, <em>The Perfect Game</em> is a fascinating read, particularly if you’re interested in game development anecdotes. And because the story covers the entirety of Rogers’ career to date, which includes setting up The Tetris Company and bringing the game to just about every platform imaginable, there are a lot of stories about pivotal points in the medium, from the launch of the Game Boy to the burgeoning days of mobile gaming.</p><p>The story is especially notable as<em> Tetris</em> continues to thrive. In addition to the movie and book, Rogers was also featured prominently in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24291537/tetris-forever-review-ps5-switch-pc-xbox">Digital Eclipse’s playable documentary <em>Tetris Forever</em></a><em>,</em> and the game still pops up frequently in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/636581/nintendo-music-app-tetris-dr-mario-kirby-edit-share-playlists-update">places like Nintendo’s new music app</a>. Rogers has largely stepped away from the business, which is now run by his daughter Maya. So now when he sees the game appear somewhere surprising, it elicits a different kind of feeling. “It feels like success,” he says. “Every time <em>Tetris</em> pops up somewhere, or a new deal comes down the pike, it’s like, ‘Wow, she’s killing it.‘”</p><p>As for that movie, Rogers changed his mind when he actually saw it, describing the film as “emotionally correct,” even if it didn’t get all of the facts right. “The first time I saw it I cried about things that never actually happened,” he says.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
