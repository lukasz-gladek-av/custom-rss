The new game is called <em>Game of Thrones: War for Westeros</em>, and it’s described as a “classic, premium” RTS game for PC that will let players take control of the various houses and factions in George R.R. Martin’s fantasy universe.</p><p>The game is being developed by PlaySide Studios, and will include both a single-player campaign and multiplayer options. Here’s the official description:</p><div><blockquote><p>In <em>War for Westeros, </em>players will lead the armies of House Stark, House Lannister, House Targaryen, or the Night King in ruthless free-for-all battles where trust is fleeting and power is everything. Engaging in epic real-time strategy battles, forging strategic alliances, and weaving deceit against rival forces will be key.</p><p>Each faction offers deeply asymmetric strategies, with signature heroes, armies, and mechanics forged from the brutal legacy of Westeros. Players can deploy infantry, cavalry, siege engines, giants, and dragons to break enemy lines as they work to outplay and outmaneuver rivals with inspiring hero abilities and the ruthless instincts of a true war commander.</p></blockquote></div><p>While there have been plenty of <em>Game of Thrones</em> video games, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/23/17764070/reigns-game-of-thrones-hbo-devolver">some clever</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365603/game-of-thrones-got-tale-of-crows-review-apple-arcade-iphone-ipad">indie spinoffs</a>, <em>War for Westeros</em> seems like a very natural expansion for the franchise. The game is launching at some point in 2026.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
