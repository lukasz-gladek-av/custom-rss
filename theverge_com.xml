It’s an encouraging sign for the theme park expansion devoted to Mario’s first nemesis, the opening of which was <a href="https://www.themeparkinsider.com/flume/202404/10170/">delayed earlier this year</a>. </p><p>Nintendo first confirmed that it was building the area, which will feature a mine cart rollercoaster ride, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697850/super-nintendo-world-donkey-kong-area-confirmed">back in 2021</a>. Nintendo and Universal Studios showed the region off — or a digital render of it, anyway — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/2/24147170/universal-orlando-super-nintendo-world-donkey-kong-country">earlier this year</a>, and confirmed that when the Orlando, Florida version of Super Nintendo World opens on May 22nd, 2025, it will have all of the same attractions as its Osaka counterpart.</p><p>As for Nintendo Switch 2 news, well, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276650/nintendo-switch-2-predictions-playtest-alarmo">don’t get your hopes up</a>. Nintendo says “no game information will be featured.”</p><p>Nintendo <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fsuper-nintendo-world-coming-to-universal-epic-universe-in-2025%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOooX9dh_AxAr4vSXVvl_R98i8BzL8a7s9cwNfBDsFaQqD-G4lwG_">said in May</a> that Donkey Kong Country’s Mine-Cart Madness rollercoaster will have “jaw-dropping maneuvers” that include being “blasted out of a barrel, seemingly jumping over gaps as they speed along the rickety track.” And like other parts of the park, visitors can expect Donkey Kong-themed merchandise and interactive experiences. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
