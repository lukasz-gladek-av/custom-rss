Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve founder Gabe Newell is setting out on a new adventure — and it doesn’t involve <em>Half-Life 3</em>. Instead, Newell is acquiring Oceanco, the yacht-building company that’s creating his <a href="https://luxurylaunches.com/transport/gabe-newell-upcoming-superyacht-09012025.php">$400 million super ship</a>, as reported <a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/boat-pro/news/oceanco-yacht-builder-sold-to-gabe-newell">earlier by <em>Boat International</em></a>.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.oceancoyacht.com/new-chapter-gabe-newell/">a post about the change</a>, Oceanco says Newell’s interest in the brand comes from a “lifelong fascination with the sea” and “a deep respect for the people who live and work on it.” Oceanco is based in the Netherlands, and it has changed leadership a few times since its founding in 1987, with private investor Mohammed Al Barwani <a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/yacht-market-intelligence/brokerage-sales-news/superyacht-builder-oceanco-under-new-ownership--4673">helming the company</a> for the past 15 years before Newell came along.</p><p>Along with Newell’s 364-foot-long superyacht, Oceanco developed Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ <a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/news/jeff-bezos-koru-yacht-best-pics">$500 million sailing yacht, Koru</a>, which stretches 417 feet long. It’s also behind <a href="https://www.superyachtfan.com/yacht/kaos/">the Kaos sailing superyacht</a> owned by Walmart heir Nancy Walton Laurie, as well as <a href="https://www.superyachtfan.com/yacht/bravo-eugenia/">the Bravo Eugenia</a>, owned by Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.</p><p>Newell has a growing fleet of yachts as well, including the <a href="https://luxurylaunches.com/transport/gabe-newell-tranquility-superyacht-to-be-upgraded.php">Oceanco-built Draak</a> (formerly called the Tranquility) and <a href="https://luxurylaunches.com/transport/gabe-newell-rocinante-superyacht-10092024.php">the Rocinante superyacht</a>, built by German yacht-maker Lürssen.</p><p>As for what Newell plans to do now that he’s the head of a big superyacht builder, Oceanco puts it pretty simply: “His first decision? Leave the team alone. Seriously. Oceanco has vision and integrity, and a culture that actually works. Gabe doesn’t want to fix it, he wants to fuel it.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/718639/gabe-newell-valve-superyacht-oceanco]]></content:encoded>
