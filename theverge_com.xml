Nintendo will host a 30-minute Direct showcase featuring games that will keep the vanilla Switch warm in the twilight of its last days as Nintendo’s premier console.</p><p>This direct won’t feature any news on the Switch 2 and therefore probably won’t have too many big reveals. Nintendo likely wants to save any big-time announcements for the Switch 2 direct next month. However, there are still a few unchecked boxes on fans’ Switch 1 wishlist like, say, remasters of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</em> and <em>Twilight Princess</em>, that could make an appearance. We’ll find out during the direct on March 27th at 10AM ET.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article"><div><p>Gritty Pac-Man is still a thing.</p><p>First seen in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24313309/secret-level-review-amazon-prime-video">the Amazon series <em>Secret Level</em></a>, the dark reboot of the classic arcade game got a new trailer today showing off some of the exploration gameplay. <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> launches on July 18th.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Nintendo Direct: classic edition.</p><p>Before we get into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606504/nintendo-switch-2-direct-new-time">all of that Switch 2 business</a>, Nintendo has a 30 minute presentation covering games for its current hardware.

The company <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1904896350853960065">announced</a> that it will be holding a Nintendo Direct on March 27th at 10AM ET, which will feature “around 30 minutes” of news about upcoming Switch games. Notably, Nintendo says that “there will be no updates about Nintendo Switch 2 during this presentation.”</p><p>With the launch of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/629964/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review-nintendo-switch">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a></em> last week, there aren’t a lot of first-party games currently on the Switch calendar. But there are still some notable titles in the works including the long-in-development <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618705/pokemon-legends-z-a-chikorita-tepig-totodile-battles">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a></em>. It’s also possible we’ll see a few more remasters for the Switch, like the much-rumored Switch version of <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/636324/nintendo-switch-direct-march-2025">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li></ul></section></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
