            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686591/nintendo-switch-2-accessibility-features-analysis<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One of the biggest surprises of the Nintendo Switch 2’s reveal was its proposed accessibility. For years, Nintendo has been known for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tears-of-the-kingdom-shows-that-without-change-accessibility-in-nintendo-games-will-remain-accidental">accidentally stumbling on accessibility solutions</a> while stubbornly refusing to engage with the broader subject. Yet, in the Switch 2, there appeared a more holistic approach to accessibility for which disabled players have been crying out. This was supported by a webpage dedicated to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fen-gb%2FHardware%2FNintendo-Switch-2%2FNintendo-Switch-2-Accessibility-2785631.html%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOoo_dOcl-VTBHzJx3R68LDlmAWIVWPctlJw4BlkSm8BRR32PNCNJ" rel="sponsored">the Switch 2’s hardware accessibility</a>. </p><p>However, specifics were thin and no further information emerged ahead of the Switch 2’s debut. Now, having spent the last week with the Switch 2, I’ve found that this limited information hid, aside from a few missteps, an impressive suite of system-level accessibility considerations and advances that somewhat offset <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682661/nintendo-switch-2-early-hands-on-mario-kart-world">the otherwise gradual update the Switch 2 represents</a>. But as we finally answer lingering accessibility questions over the Switch 2, there’s a nagging sense that this information should have been readily available ahead of launch.</p><div><p id="how-intuitive-is-the-setup-very-but-blind-players-may-need-assistance"><h2>How intuitive is the setup? Very, but blind players may need assistance</h2></p></div><p>I tend to find setup procedures dense and unapproachable thanks to cognitive disability. Yet I was pleasantly surprised at how breezy the Switch 2’s setup was. Aside from a few hiccups trying to decipher <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659074/nintendo-switch-online-game-sharing-loophole">Virtual Game Cards</a> (a feature I ended up opting out of), the whole process was intuitive and fast.</p><p>Accessibility features, however, are not available during setup. The console’s text-to-speech is not enabled by default, nor can you access text sizing and zoom options. This will represent a significant barrier to entry for some, and blind players may require sighted assistance during setup.</p><div><p id="are-switch-controllers-and-joy-cons-compatible-with-the-switch-2-yes-including-the-hori-flex"><h2>Are Switch controllers and Joy-Cons compatible with the Switch 2? Yes, including the Hori Flex</h2></p></div><p>The increased size of the Joy-Con 2 feels better this time around, as does the Joy-Con 2 grip. But the controller size and the grip’s unergonomic square shape still don’t take long to incite my hand pain. Fortunately, Switch controllers and Joy-Cons are usable on the Switch 2, and the ability to default to the original Pro Controller is welcome.</p><p>It’s encouraging that you can pair other controllers with the Switch 2 using peripherals like the Magic-S Pro 2. Though, given recent trends in third-party peripheral support, I’d be reluctant to suggest that support is here to stay. We’re already seeing some connectivity issues around third-party controllers, especially 8BitDo gamepads, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/681153/8bitdo-controller-gamepad-nintendo-switch-2-compatible-firmware-update">8BitDo working on updates to get those working with the Switch 2</a>.</p><p>What <em>is </em>supported, however, is Nintendo’s licensed adaptive controller: <a href="https://stores.horiusa.com/flex-controller-for-nintendo-switch/">the Hori Flex</a>. This works docked and in tabletop mode for games that don’t require mouse controls (some other features, like motion controls, may also cause issues). Keep in mind, you will need a USB-A to USB-C adapter to connect in tabletop mode.</p><div><p><cite>Photo: Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="can-you-connect-a-usb-keyboard-yes"><h2><strong>Can you connect a USB keyboard? Yes</strong></h2></p></div><p>Not everyone finds onscreen keyboards intuitive or accessible. The good news is you can connect a USB keyboard through the console’s USB-C ports and use that instead, including during setup.</p><div><p id="what-is-the-text-to-speech-speed-its-inconsistent-but-us-english-is-120-130-words-per-minute-on-average"><h2><strong>What is the text-to-speech speed? It’s inconsistent, but US English is 120–130 words per minute on average</strong></h2></p></div><p>We have no official number on the speed at which the Switch 2’s text-to-speech reads, but we can estimate. Using the information the system reads when you enable text-to-speech, we’ve found that both voice options averaged around 120–130 words per minute in US English. For UK English, it was 130–140 words per minute. Different languages will see different rates. There was some inconsistency in repeated tests that could not be accounted for simply by considering when timers were started and stopped.</p><p>That’s not the only quirk in the system. Players should be aware there is a noticeable delay between landing on a menu option and the text-to-speech kicking in. Similarly, during testing, toggling text-to-speech off led to a notification with the word “disabled.” Reenabling the function without moving out of the accessibility menu, however, did not lead to anything suggesting text-to-speech was back on.</p><p>All told, however, it’s a good system, controlled by a discrete speed slider that ranges from 50 percent to 300 percent. The slowest rate for US English users reads at around 60–70 words per minute and the max speed, where many blind players operate, is in the region of 400–420 words per minute.</p><div><p id="what-screens-dont-support-text-to-speech-the-eshop"><h2><strong>What screens don’t support text-to-speech? The eShop</strong></h2></p></div><p>When enabling text-to-speech, you’re told the function may not be supported on all screens. As things stand, it looks like text-to-speech works across all system-level menus, but not on the Nintendo eShop. Given this is the first place most players visit after setup, that’s an oversight that needs rectifying <em>soon</em>. Most games also don’t support system-level text-to-speech, including <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p><div><p id="can-you-adjust-the-switch-2s-audio-balance-no"><h2><strong>Can you adjust the Switch 2’s audio balance? No</strong></h2></p></div><p>Outside the ability to toggle mono audio — an important feature for hard-of-hearing players — greater audio customization is not available on the Switch 2 at a system level.</p><div><p id="does-gamechats-speech-to-text-transcribe-swearing-you-bet-it-fucking-does"><h2><strong>Does GameChat’s speech-to-text transcribe swearing? You bet it fucking does!</strong></h2></p></div><p>You may already know that GameChat’s speech-to-text will transcribe swear words. While this was reported widely as a bit of fun, it’s also an important accessibility feature that allows users — especially deaf players — to engage <em>fully </em>with in-game communication without having to decipher improper transcription and censored text.</p><p>It’s not perfect. You may find speech-to-text swaps in odd words at times, but this is an error rather than censorship of specific terms.</p><div><p id="can-you-remap-controls-at-a-system-level-yes"><h2><strong>Can you remap controls? At a system level, yes</strong></h2></p></div><p>Within the Switch 2’s settings, players can remap all inputs on connected controllers, and do so for each Joy-Con independently. You can also toggle the ability to access this menu at any time from the Switch 2’s quick menu, accessed by holding Home.</p><p>Unfortunately, current evidence suggests this option will not be present in Nintendo’s first-party games. <em>Mario Kart World </em>does not include any remapping options. Some might ask why this is a problem if system-level input rebinding exists, but in-game options for remapping are more instructive and convenient, and they limit rebindings to specific actions in-game rather than having to continuously rebind on a system level for every game. Being able to remap on the fly through the quick menu only mitigates this so much.</p><p>This is something Nintendo appears to understand, allowing remapping in the new GameCube games available to Switch Online subscribers. </p><div><p id="a-quiet-win-overall"><h2>A quiet win overall</h2></p></div><p>It all adds up to an impressive suite of accessibility features and customization that will, hopefully, grow in time. The strange part is that Nintendo is being so quiet about it. <em>The Verge </em>reached out multiple times for clarification on the Switch 2’s accessibility and for more information relating to the questions above, but Nintendo didn’t respond.</p><p>One might expect that points to an internal awareness that features aren’t as robust as they should be. Outside a few missteps, however, this is a significant accessibility win and one would think Nintendo would want it out there. More importantly, and this is a lesson to anyone releasing a device or game: players need clear accessibility information ahead of release to make informed buying decisions and secure any help that might be needed. </p><p>Nintendo’s shift to greater accessibility is welcome. But in restricting the flow of information before release, the win is tempered somewhat by Nintendo’s willingness to keep its players in the dark.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The first Switch was such a hit that Nintendo decided not to mess with a good thing. Instead of releasing a successor that feels like a generational leap or a pivot in a new direction, it’s following up the hugely successful original with the Switch 2 — a welcome upgrade that largely sticks to the formula. It looks about the same, works about the same, and plays most of the same games. It’s the Switch, just better.</p><p>Nintendo’s bet is that it doesn’t have to wow people all over again, and so it made a sequel that’s only as good as it needs to be. After spending a week with the new console, I’ve realized that good enough is exactly what the Switch needed.</p><div><p id="a-refined-and-bigger-nintendo-switch"><h2>A refined (and bigger) Nintendo Switch</h2></p></div><p>Fundamentally, the concept of the Switch hasn’t changed. It’s still a tablet with a split controller stuck on either side, with a dock that connects to your television. </p><p>But the idea has been refined. The Switch 2 is much bigger, for one thing. It now has a 7.9-inch LCD panel, up from the original’s 6.2 inches, making it great for playing text-heavy games. It also means the entire device has become larger as a result, now weighing in at a comparatively hefty 1.18 pounds with the controllers attached. The larger size hasn’t bothered me, though your mileage may vary. My 12-year-old keeps stealing it to play <em>Pokémon</em> and hasn’t complained. But she’ll do anything for more screentime.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->449</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Improved hardware and display</li><li>Faster load times</li><li>New social features</li><li>It plays <em>Mario Kart</em></li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Disappointing battery life</li><li>Few first-party Switch 2 games at launch</li><li>No standout feature</li></ul></div></div></div><p>There are some other nice upgrades. Like the most recent OLED model of the original Switch, the Switch 2 has a kickstand that can prop the system up at a wide range of angles, and the updated version feels a little sturdier to me, making it great for playing in tabletop mode. It’s a huge improvement over the original Switch’s flimsy kickstand. The Switch 2 also adds a second USB-C port to the top of the console, which enables you to plug in a webcam for online play. It’s handy for attaching a charger or battery pack whichever way is most convenient, too.</p><p>What you get with that larger and heavier device is games that look and run better. The handheld’s screen has a 1920 x 1080 resolution, which supports HDR10 and VRR up to 120Hz. It’s bright and crisp, and games look a lot smoother thanks to the higher refresh rate. But I do miss <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review">the more vibrant OLED display of the most recent iteration of the original Switch</a>, which featured deeper blacks and more contrast-y images. The new screen is a huge leap from the original, but it isn’t an all-around improvement if you’ve been using the OLED for a while.</p><p>The story is different when connected to your TV: the Switch 2 can finally output at 4K, with support for HDR10. You’ll need to play supported games to really take advantage of this, but it’s immediately noticeable how much crisper everything from text to gameplay is. HDR promises to make games more vibrant, though there doesn’t seem to be a standout game to show this off just yet.</p><p>Games are bigger this generation, too. Nintendo has increased the internal storage size to 256GB, but you’ll need to be diligent with how you use it; <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, for example, takes up 59GB on its own. Expanding that storage means buying <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/676075/switch-2-microsd-express-cards-where-to-buy">a new and relatively expensive microSD Express card</a>; your old microSD cards won’t work.</p><p>More annoying is that the battery life is worse than the original Switch. Nintendo estimates between two and six and a half hours of gameplay on a single charge, and I found my device dying around the lower end of that spectrum, especially when playing more intensive games like <em>Cyberpunk</em>. That’s not a great sign for the future if the Switch 2 continues to get more demanding games.</p><p>Some of this owes to the fact that this is simply a much more capable console. It’s built around a new Nvidia chip, custom designed for the Switch 2, and offering modern features like DLSS and ray tracing. There’s more RAM. The internal storage is faster. This is why the Switch 2 is able to run a game as demanding as <em>Cyberpunk</em>; it’s also why the Switch 2’s battery might die after a short two-hour stint.</p><p>The Switch 2 also has slightly redesigned Joy-Con controllers. They’re functionally mostly the same, but bigger and with a few small upgrades, like more subtle vibrations. They connect via magnets now, which are less fiddly than the previous rail design. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/644457/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controller-hall-effect-joystick-drift">Nintendo says that the joysticks have been redesigned</a>, too, but they still aren’t using anti-drift Hall effect sensors. That means there’s a chance owners will once again be dealing with the dreaded Joy-Con drift that plagued the original Switch.</p><p>As similar as they are, the Joy-Con also introduces some of the truly new elements of the Switch 2.</p><p>To start, the right Joy-Con has an all-new button dedicated entirely to Nintendo’s GameChat social features. Chatting with friends while playing games isn’t a new concept, but Nintendo has finally made it not only a core but a relatively painless part of its user experience. You simply pull up the app, and you can see what friends are online and what they’re playing.</p><p>For the most part, it works as advertised. It’s easy to connect, voices come in clear through the Switch 2’s built-in mic, and video looks fine over the USB camera from Nintendo, which is sold separately. (The Switch 2 also supports <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682008/which-webcams-work-with-nintendo-switch-2">an unclear number of third-party webcams</a>.) This is a huge upgrade over Nintendo’s old way of doing things, where you needed to download a separate Nintendo Switch Online app onto your phone and use that secondary device to chat.</p><p>The one flaw I’ve noticed with the new system is that screensharing — in which, for instance, four people can share their gameplay in <em>Mario Kart World</em> while they race against each other — looks choppy and ugly, to the point that I stopped using it.</p><p>The redesigned Joy-Con controllers also introduce a new control option. By turning the Joy-Con on its side and placing it down on a flat surface, you’re able to use it like a mouse. Unfortunately, the Switch 2 doesn’t come with a next-gen version of <em>Mario Paint</em> to show all the mouse clicking possibilities, but I spent some time with the Switch 2 update of <em>Civilization VII</em> to test it out. And while it took some getting used to, I found the Switch 2’s mouse controls worked surprisingly well. This may not be as true in a twitchy first-person shooter where every millimeter matters, but for turn-based strategy, the mouse was a big improvement over a standard controller layout. </p><p>In a nice touch, using the mouse is seamless; you don’t choose the option from a menu, you simply turn the Joy-Con on its side, place it down, and it begins mouse mode. This makes it easy to swap between control options on the fly. You also don’t need to use the mouse on a completely flat surface like a table or desk. I was able to play <em>Civ</em> just fine moving the Joy-Con around on my thigh.</p><p>However, it wasn’t particularly comfortable to play that way for extended periods. So it’s hard to see it as something I’ll use often.</p><p>So yes, the Switch 2 is exactly what it sounds like hardware-wise: it takes a winning concept and improves on it in subtle ways, and mostly doesn’t mess with what already worked. None of the changes are a huge leap, nor are any of the issues dealbreakers.</p><div><p id="a-launch-lineup-that-mixes-old-and-new"><h2>A launch lineup that mixes old and new</h2></p></div><p>Of course, the most important aspect of any system is its games. And the launch lineup for the Switch 2 is a combination of new titles that take advantage of the more powerful hardware and older games that have been updated and are noticeably better compared to the original Switch versions.</p><p>The best showcase for the console at launch is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>. It expands upon its predecessor in ways that Nintendo says weren’t possible on the original Switch. The game takes place in a large, connected open world and doubles the number of racers from 12 to 24. It’s bigger, more ambitious, and more chaotic than any <em>Mario Kart</em> before it, and yet it also runs incredibly well on the Switch 2. It loads fast and the frame rate holds up, even when playing four-player split-screen, which introduces a frankly absurd number of explosions and crashes on your TV at any given moment.</p><div><p>Outside of that, though, the first-party lineup is surprisingly thin. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642699/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-preview-switch-2">An impressive-looking <em>Donkey Kong</em> game is coming</a>, but it doesn’t launch until July, so the only other Nintendo-made release is <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>, an extremely drab collection of minigames and quizzes designed to teach you about the new console. It’s a nice idea, but the $10 collection is missing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/18/17253574/nintendo-labo-review-switch-learning-diy">the Nintendo charm that can even make folding cardboard into a fun experience</a>.</p></div><p>That doesn’t mean there isn’t anything to play right now, though. There are just a few brand-new games. Many of the highlights of the Switch 2’s launch lineup are games that already exist on other platforms, but were likely too technically demanding for the original Switch. These include the likes of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, and <em>Yakuza 0</em>, all of which look good, run smoothly, and load quickly. The new handheld is not as powerful as other current-generation consoles, let alone a high-end PC, but it’s still pretty remarkable being able to take Night City with you wherever you go, and have it feel good to play, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/17/23834520/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-hands-on">instead of just fine</a>.</p><p>Two of my favorite launch games take advantage of one of the Switch 2’s best features. Called GameShare, it lets you play select multiplayer games with anyone else nearby with a Switch 2 or original Switch, and it requires only one copy of the game. It’s not perfect — the second player is essentially streaming the game, and so the visual quality can dip at times — but it is a very fun way to enjoy co-op games that require a lot of coordination. I used it to play through a chunk of <em>Split Fiction</em> with my wife, and a few hours of <em>Survival Kids</em> with my, uh, kids, and it was a great alternative to couch co-op. We simply sat near each other, barking orders on what needed to be done next.</p><p>While the core launch lineup may be lacking, there are a lot of games that have been updated in a significant way to support the Switch 2. Some of these are paid upgrades; I dropped $10 to be able to use those mouse controls in <em>Civ</em>, and it’ll cost you the same to get <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/681361/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-edition">a much smoother and faster-loading version of <em>Breath of the Wild</em></a> or <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. These titles don’t look radically different, but they’re obviously sharper and running smoother; the faster loading times in <em>Zelda </em>may be worth the price of the upgrade alone.</p><p>Many of the free upgrades are just as impressive. I’ve been especially struck by games I’ve already played for hundreds of hours — <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>No Man’s Sky</em> — both of which struggled mightily on the original Switch. But on the Switch 2 they look like and play like, well, modern games. </p><p>Actually, my favorite launch games might be the oldest of all. One of the benefits for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers on the Switch 2 is the addition of GameCube games. To start, there are only three titles, but they’re excellent ones: <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, <em>Soulcalibur II</em> (with Link as a playable fighter!), and <em>F-Zero GX</em>. It’s not exactly impressive that a sci-fi racer from 2003 plays fast and smooth on a modern console, but it’s still a nice bonus. And the GameCube has plenty of heavy hitters that will surely round out the service in the coming months. (<em>Mario Kart: Double Dash</em>, please.)</p><div><p id="a-new-generation-that-feels-much-like-the-last"><h2>A new generation that feels much like the last</h2></p></div><p>In 2017, there was nothing like the Nintendo Switch. At a time when dedicated handheld gaming devices had seemingly given way to smartphones, and the PS4 and Xbox One era was in full swing, here came Nintendo with an underpowered tablet that doubled as a home console in a way that was simple and intuitive. It proved to be such a success that it revitalized the company into a growing entertainment powerhouse.</p><p>But eight years later, there’s a lot like the Nintendo Switch 2. The original spearheaded a resurgence in portable gaming thanks to the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">Valve</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24012547/sony-playstation-portal-handheld-remote-player-ps5-chiaki-review">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/684247/xbox-ally-x-hands-on-gears-of-war-reloaded">Xbox</a>, and even upstarts like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025390/playdate-handheld-portable-gaming-console-review">Panic</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025390/playdate-handheld-portable-gaming-console-review">Analogue</a>. The Switch 2 not only has to compete with its predecessor, but also a maturing market of modern handhelds.</p><p>The Switch 2 doesn’t feel like the kind of generational leap typically associated with a new platform. When you put all of its features together — the larger display, more powerful internals, better social and sharing features, and more flexible control options — you are left with a device that is markedly better than its predecessor, but is still a step behind the latest PC handhelds in terms of pure horsepower and available games.</p><p>But even with real competition this time around, Nintendo is still operating largely in its own sphere. And it turns out good enough is more than good enough when you also have the biggest <em>Mario Kart</em> to date.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
