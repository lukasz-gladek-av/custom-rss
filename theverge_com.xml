            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/17/24323220/delta-emulator-ios-apple-triple-price-patreon-membership<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Delta gaming emulator is now providing a link to sign up for <a href="https://www.patreon.com/rileyshane">Patreon-exclusive membership perks</a> directly within the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24132984/delta-free-emulator-nintendo-gba-n64-iphone-app-store-us">iOS app in Apple’s US App Store</a>. Developer Riley Testut is heavily encouraging users to click that external link by tripling the price you’d otherwise pay to Apple for In-App Purchase versions of those same Patreon tiers.&nbsp;Testut calls it the “do not buy sale.”</p><p>The update both embraces and protests <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/16/24040881/apple-outside-payments-app-store-policies-iphone-ipad">the External Purchase Link Entitlement</a> that Apple introduced in January, which allows developers to link to outside payment platforms in exchange for giving Apple a slightly reduced 27 percent cut of sales. The App Store policy change was made following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/16/24039983/supreme-court-epic-apple-antitrust-case-rejected">rulings in the Epic vs Apple lawsuit</a> that found Apple had acted anticompetitively by preventing developers from telling users about payment methods that bypassed its own payment system.</p><div><figcaption><em>Clicking this link within the Delta app settings will take you to the Patreon page to sign up directly.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Delta</cite></p></div><p>Testut says Delta is likely the first app to use the entitlement. The $3, $5, and $10 monthly memberships on Patreon — which provide additional benefits like iPad and SEGA Genesis support, and private Discord access depending on the subscription tier — are listed in the iOS app at $10, $15, and $30, respectively.</p><p>“We <em>really</em> don’t want people to use in-app purchase,” Testut told <em>The Verge</em>. “We’ve been using Patreon for years, and it allows us to do things Apple’s IAP system can’t — such as issuing refunds and handling customer support — making it much more convenient for creators like us.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/17/24323309/walmart-restart-run-game-informer-ziff-davis-buyouts<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The ever-dwindling field of games media has a new player: Walmart. <a href="https://www.restart.run/"><em>Restart</em></a> is new website run by Moonrock — a marketing company specializing in bringing brands to video games — and sponsored by the largest retailer in the United States.</p><p>A new games site sponsored by Walmart doesn’t seem inherently bad, especially as the games media landscape continues to shrink. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/washington-post-is-closing-launcher-its-highly-regarded-video-game-website">Publications are shutting down</a>, ad revenues are drying up, and existing sites now operate with fewer and fewer employees. Earlier this year, Ziff Davis, <em>IGN</em>’s parent company, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/21/24161718/ign-gamer-network-acquisition">acquired a handful of media sites</a> including <em>Eurogamer;</em> <em>Rock, Paper, Shotgun;</em> and <em>VG247</em>. In the time since, there have been staff departures and layoffs <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gamesindusty-biz-ign-and-humble-losing-talent-due-to-soft-layoffs">including buyouts offered to employees earlier this month</a>. According to <a href="https://aftermath.site/ziff-davis-ign-gamesindustrybiz-humble-buyouts">a report in <em>Aftermath</em></a>, this latest round of buyouts has apparently left <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>, a site that’s been around for over 20 years, with only one full-time employee.</p><p><em>Restart</em>’s business model isn’t wholly unique. Before it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24212016/game-informer-shutting-down-layoffs-gamestop">unceremoniously shut down earlier this year</a>, <em>Game Informer</em> magazine was owned and operated by GameStop, and for decades <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/24/3800928/nintendo-powers-final-cover">Nintendo ran its own magazine</a>. Other websites like <em>IGN</em>, <em>Polygon</em>, and <em>The Verge</em> also run sponsored content and include affiliate links in articles. To survive in the current digital media landscape, the support of deep-pocketed individuals or corporations is all but required. In this regard, <em>Restart</em> is just like any other publication.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.restart.run/editorial-mission">its editorial mission</a>, “<em>Restart</em> is sponsored by Walmart, but we operate as an independent site.” The mission statement explains that while its articles will feature affiliate links to Walmart products, the site itself will receive no portion of the sale. “We hope you can see this gives us zero incentive to provide biased review scores or other information about a game.”</p><div><p><em>“Restart</em> is sponsored by Walmart, but we operate as an independent site.”</p></div><p>But <em>Restart</em> is also entering a media landscape where the wall between corporate interests and editorial independence has become perilously thin, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23949269/aftermath-video-games-kotaku-defector">with a few rare exceptions</a>, games media has slowly shifted away from providing readers thoughtful discussion and critique to providing a product that can be monetized to hell and back.  That driving ethos is clearly outlined <a href="https://moonrockbiz.substack.com/p/november-2024-exciting-partnerships">in a post by Moonrock on its Substack</a>. “Restart.run serves as a dynamic hub where gaming content meets retail opportunities, allowing gamers to transition effortlessly from discovering new games to purchasing them on Walmart’s platform.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
