            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p><em><strong>Editor’s note: </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/782478/october-amazon-prime-day-deals-guide">Amazon’s fall Prime Day event</a> kicks off on October 7th; however, if you want to shop ahead of the two-day sale, we’ve rounded up the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/783008/amazon-october-prime-day-sale-best-early-deals-2025">best early Prime Day deals</a> you can already get.</em></p></div><p>If you choose to get an extra controller for your Nintendo Switch 2, you can spend a lot — and get a lot in return. Buying Nintendo’s own <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-SwitchTM-2-Pro-Controller-Switch/dp/B0F3VTFD6J/ref=ast_sto_dp_puis?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$89.99 Switch 2 Pro Controller</a>, for instance, will net you the console’s only wireless controller with a 3.5mm headphone jack, not to mention great rumble and a slick design. It’s not perfect, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">it’s the total package</a>.</p><p>But it’d be a disservice to you to call it a day there. There are several third-party offerings that are significantly cheaper, yet don’t make too many compromises in terms of features. I’ve spent time testing a handful of them, and there’s a small batch of models that I think will satisfy most people, with a range of styles, prices, and features.</p><p>Every controller I’ve included in this guide is compatible with both the Switch 2 and original Switch (some can even remotely wake the Switch 2), as well as platforms like PC and mobile. Each offering also includes better, longer-lasting joystick technology than you’ll get with Nintendo’s flagship controller; the Switch 2 Pro Controller’s potentiometer-based joysticks are prone to degradation over time, after all, but our picks include either Hall effect or TMR joysticks.</p><div><h2>What I’m looking for</h2><section><p>I put my pricey Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller away and cycle in each of these candidates for multi-session tests with a mix of games for the Switch 2. I spend time assessing their ergonomics, button location, and the quality of each button press and trigger pull. I also strive to test each controller’s unique functions. </p></section><section><p>Most people would rather spend $89.99 on a game or two, not a single controller. We sought cheaper alternatives to Nintendo’s fantastic Switch 2 Pro Controller, but we hate compromising on features and quality as much as anyone. We aim to include wireless gamepads that can remotely wake the Switch 2, as well as offerings that feature good-feeling rumble and controllers that sport a few extras, such as amiibo support.</p></section><section><p>Our top picks are just as comfortable to use as Nintendo’s flagship gamepad — perhaps more comfortable, depending on your taste. We’ve included picks with Xbox- and PlayStation-style stick layouts, as well as one that feels similar to the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller.</p></section><section><p>Nintendo opted for potentiometer-based joysticks with its pricey Switch 2 controller, which may result in “stick drift” later on, if its last-gen controller tech is anything to go by. Every pick in this guide builds upon that technology with either Hall effect or tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks, which are drift-resistant by design.</p></section></div><div><p id="the-best-switch-2-controller-for-most-people"><h2>The best Switch 2 controller for most people</h2></p></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6Nzg2NTg5"><p><span>$<!-- -->50</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>TMR joysticks</li><li>amiibo support</li><li>Great rumble</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Clicky buttons are divisive</li><li>The grips might be too grating for some</li></ul></div></div></div><p><strong>Supported platforms:</strong> Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes, two / <strong>Software customization:</strong> No / <strong>Rumble:</strong> Yes, HD / <strong>NFC:</strong> Yes / <strong>Motion:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable 1,200mAh battery / <strong>Console wake-up:</strong> Yes</p><p>The EasySMX S10 is nearly as capable and comfortable as the Switch 2 Pro Controller, yet it’s $30 cheaper at $59.99. It’s full of surprises, too, including the best adaptation of Nintendo’s HD rumble that I’ve felt in a third-party controller. It’s also one of the few options that can remotely wake the Switch 2 from sleep mode via Bluetooth. Lastly, it includes amiibo support — another rare feature to find in a third-party gamepad.</p><p>However, the S10 isn’t a Switch 2 Pro copycat; it’s a lot grippier, both around the grips themselves and on its stick caps. Button presses and trigger pulls feel different from most other controllers, too, yielding a softer press and shorter travel, which is likely to be the most divisive aspect of the S10. One of my favorite aspects of the S10’s design is its swappable eight-way (circular) D-pad, making diagonal attacks in <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> considerably easier to execute than with a four-way D-pad.</p><p>If I could change one thing about the S10, it’d be the system-level buttons (screenshot, GameChat, and home). They’re crammed awkwardly just below the D-pad and right stick.</p><div><p id="honorable-mentions"><h2>Honorable mentions</h2></p></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6NzkxNjEw"><p><span>$<!-- -->30</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Incredible value in terms of specs and comfort</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Lousy rumble</li><li>Lacks a C button</li></ul></div></div></div><p><strong>Supported platforms:</strong> Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, mobile / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons: </strong>No / <strong>Software customization:</strong> No / <strong>Rumble:</strong> Yes / <strong>NFC:</strong> No / <strong>Motion:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable 950mAh battery / <strong>Console wake-up:</strong> Yes</p><p>Gulikit’s ES Pro is a love letter to the Xbox controller, but for Switch 2. It’s just $29.99, which is a steal considering this gamepad features an eight-way D-pad that’s great for fighting games, Metroidvanias, and retro titles where it’s an advantage to easily be able to aim diagonally (a setting can make it so that it only registers inputs for the cardinal directions, if you prefer).</p><p>The ES Pro doesn’t need to do much to justify its price, but it does so anyway. It features tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks that are resistant to drifting and offer improved power efficiency compared to Hall effect tech, just like the EasySMX S10. Similarly, it can be set up to remotely wake your Switch 2 or OG Switch console from across the room using its own set of strange, one-time-only instructions that you can view in its instruction manual.</p><p>I’ve got almost no qualms with this controller, except for its bad rumble. It just has no subtlety, rumbling in an all-or-nothing manner. I was happier using the ES Pro with the vibrations off, which isn’t any fun. Additionally, it’s far less complete than the S10, as it lacks built-in amiibo support and a C button for GameChat; however, depending on your needs, those omissions might not matter to you.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6NzU1MzE4"><p><span>$<!-- -->63</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Includes dock and 2.4GHz dongle</li><li>Highly customizable</li><li>Comfortable for small hands</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Bad rumble</li><li>Can’t wake Switch 2</li></ul></div></div></div><p><strong>Supported platforms:</strong> Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, 2.4GHz, wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes, two / <strong>Software customization:</strong> Yes / <strong>Rumble:</strong> Yes / <strong>NFC:</strong> No / <strong>Motion:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable 1,000mAh battery / <strong>Console wake-up:</strong> Yes (but only original Switch)</p><p>8BitDo’s Pro 3 is a great yet pricey Switch 2 Pro alternative with a PlayStation-style stick layout. At $69.99, it’s not as affordable (nor as value-packed) as the top contenders. However, the Pro 3 offers a lot of customization, some being cosmetic, while other aspects can impact gameplay.</p><p>It has a lot going for it, with TMR joysticks, two back paddles, and a total of three shoulder buttons per side thanks to new custom M buttons. Its analog stick caps can be popped off in favor of glossy arcade stick-style nubs, which were my preferred choice in fighting games (plus, they just look cool). Its ABXY buttons can be suctioned off with an included tool to swap the layout as needed, and for visual flair, each controller includes colored buttons to evoke a retro Nintendo console. Also, it has trigger locks, letting you set triggers to have a short, clicky pull or the default travel distance.</p><p>However, I’d skip the Pro 3 if you want good rumble feedback. It’s pretty lousy on that front, to the point that I preferred to turn off rumble entirely in games. Also — and this is a small nitpick — but the Pro 3 can’t remotely wake up the Switch 2, so you’ll need to walk over to press the console’s power button before jumping on the couch.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6NzkxNDMz"><p><span>$<!-- -->42</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Comfortable, sleek design</li><li>Buttons are easy to swap</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Buttons don’t feel good to press</li><li>Can’t wake Switch 2</li></ul></div></div></div><p><strong>Supported platforms:</strong> Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, mobile / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, 2.4GHz, wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes, two/ <strong>Software customization:</strong> Yes / <strong>Rumble:</strong> Yes / <strong>NFC:</strong> No / <strong>Motion:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable 1,000mAh battery / <strong>Console wake-up:</strong> No</p><p>GameSir’s Super Nova is a passable Switch Pro copy that I had a tough time warming up to, even if there’s a lot about it that sounds great on paper. It’s comfortable, with rubbery grips and decent rumble, and it uses Hall effect joysticks. However, it has, by a wide margin, my least favorite D-pad and buttons to press out of all the controllers on our list. The underlying tech is responsive, but it feels cheap to hammer on.</p><p>That’s a shame, as it’s a slick-looking controller with a magnetic faceplate that pops off, allowing you to easily swap the buttons around without the need for an extra tool. The rear triggers also have trigger stops, which can reduce the travel of each pull, and the two back paddles are easy to press. It even includes a charging dock — as well as a dazzling set of RGB LEDs, which you can turn off — along with a USB-A 2.4GHz transmitter that lets you easily connect the gamepad with your PC.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6NzkxNjMz"><p><span>$<!-- -->30</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Cute, compact design</li><li>Can wake Switch 2</li><li>Hall effect sticks</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Sticks and triggers have limited range Lacks features from the ES Pro</li></ul></div></div></div><p><strong>Supported platforms:</strong> Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> No/ <strong>Software customization:</strong> No / <strong>Rumble:</strong> Yes / <strong>NFC:</strong> No / <strong>Motion:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable 800mAh battery / <strong>Console wake-up:</strong> Yes</p><p>Gulikit Elves 2 is a compact, Sega Saturn-inspired controller I wanted to love a little more than I do. The affordable gamepad shares some of the same benefits as the identically priced ES Pro — including Switch 2 wake-up and multiplatform support — but it’s smaller, which could make it a great pick for kids or small-handed folks who have a difficult time wrapping their digits around larger gamepads.</p><p>There isn’t much wasted space in this controller, either, as it comes with a rechargeable battery, rumble motors, a gyroscope, and an eight-way D-pad that feels nice to use. Even for my medium-sized hands, its grips turn the small gamepad into something that’s satisfying to hold. I don’t like it as much for a handful of minor reasons relating to long-term comfort, button and trigger feel preferences, and some missing functionality. Compared to the ES Pro, it lacks TMR sticks (it has Hall effect), the Pro’s better triggers, and swappable buttons.</p><div><p id="whats-next"><h2>What’s next?</h2></p></div><p>A company called GG-Gear (Good Game Gear) is sending us its GG wireless Switch 2 controller, and it seems like it might give the EasySMX S10 a run for its money. It’ll cost $44.99 and will feature TMR joysticks, a 1,000Hz polling rate, amiibo support, gyroscope support, a C button for GameChat, and what the company calls “HD” vibration, among other competitive features. It also comes in an array of fun colors, to boot.</p><p>The hunt continues for gamepad contenders that pack in a bunch of features without breaking the bank. They’re rarer than you might think they are! For instance, PowerA recently launched <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Advantage-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Gaming-Console/dp/B0FS147SDG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">a $69.99 Switch 2 controller</a> called the Advantage Wireless Controller. It features Hall effect joysticks, but seemingly lacks rumble and the ability to wake the Switch 2. Hori also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/791438/hori-wireless-horipad-turbo-nintendo-switch-2-controller">recently launched the Turbo Switch 2</a> in some nice colors, each with TMR joysticks. Its highlight feature is a button that can disable the screenshot, home, and plus / minus buttons.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/791574/best-switch-2-controllers]]></content:encoded>
