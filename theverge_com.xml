Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/12/12454434/no-mans-sky-diaries"><em>No Man’s Sky</em> has always been big</a>, but the game’s newest update sounds like it will expand things considerably. According to developer Hello Games, the update will introduce “billions of new solar systems and trillions of new planets.”</p><p>The update is called <em>Worlds Part II</em>; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/17/24200072/no-mans-sky-next-update-worlds-part-1">it follows <em>Worlds Part I </em>from last year</a>, which made the game’s planets more detailed and realistic. In addition to increasing the sheer scale of planets and systems available to explore, the new update also adds more biomes and terrain types. Here are some of the highlights, via Hello Games cofounder Sean Murray:</p><div><ul><li><span>“Terrain is more detailed and far more varied with huge mountains and these massive features.”</span></li><li><span>“Gas giants are truly epic, ten times bigger than our biggest planet. It’s truly end-game stuff to explore them with huge storms that rage across the surface.”</span></li><li><span>“New tech allows oceans that can be several kilometers deep. A new lighting system makes them look so different. New caustics, light shafts and the deeper that you explore the darker it gets.”</span></li></ul></div><p>There are also new alien creatures, about which Murray says, “I think we’ve gone probably weirder than ever before.” <em>Worlds Part II</em> sounds like it would be a huge update for any release, let alone one that’s approaching its 10th anniversary. As with all of <em>No Man’s Sky</em>’s many previous updates, it will be free for all players — and you can download it today. Check out the full patch notes <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-ii-update">right here</a>.</p><p>According to Murray, some of these features come from tech that was created for the studio’s next game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23990841/hello-games-light-no-fire-trailer">the fantasy adventure <em>Light No Fire</em></a>. “The team is extremely busy on <em>Light No Fire</em>,” he explains. “Each time we push our engine to new places though we have this urge to share it with the community, with <em>No Man’s Sky</em>.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As part of <em>Destiny 2: Heresy, Act I</em>, which launches next week, you’ll be able to access outfits, accessories, and emotes that come straight out of the <em>Star Wars</em> universe into the Eververse. The news came as a “one more thing” surprise during the <em>Destiny 2: Heresy Act I</em> <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2366062106">developer livestream on Twitch</a> yesterday.</p><p>The <em>Star Wars</em> armor sets will include a death trooper-inspired Covert Rangers set for Hunters, a Royal Protector set for Warlocks, inspired by the red-cloaked Imperial Guards, and a classic stormtrooper Shock Enforcer set for Titans. There’s also a new Ghost shell that looks like the second Death Star. Sadly, there isn’t any mention of lightsabers in this announcement. However, Bungie does promise a new <a href="https://destiny.fandom.com/wiki/Sparrow">Sparrow</a>, ship, and a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-shadowkeep-guide/2019/10/2/20895458/how-to-use-destiny-2-finishers-shadowkeep-unlocks">finisher</a>.</p><p><em>Star Wars</em> items will launch day one with <em>Heresy</em> on February 2nd.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/601473/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-gpu-preorder-buy-price-release-date-availability-founders-edition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>While Nvidia’s RTX 50-series graphics cards weren’t the zaniest devices at CES 2025, they stole the show with their promised groundbreaking performance breakthroughs. The RTX 5070, in particular, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338999/nvidia-rtx-5070-vs-rtx4090-performance-price">made headlines as a card that can supposedly rival an RTX 4090 for just $549</a>. We later learned it uses <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">DLSS 4’s AI-powered multi frame generation</a> to achieve that in supported titles, but that’s a welcome compromise for those who can’t find room in their budget for the beefier 4K-ready GPUs that are going up for sale at 9AM ET on January 30th — including the $999.99 RTX 5080 and the $1,999.99 RTX 5090.</p><p>Those premium cards are capable of greater raw performance, however. In our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/598045/nvidia-rtx-5080-review-test-benchmark">RTX 5080 review</a>, we found it’s only about 15 percent faster than the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23457556/nvidia-rtx-4080-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test-review">RTX 4080</a> it’s replacing. Meanwhile, the benchmarks we ran for our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">RTX 5090 review</a> averaged 28 percent better frame rates compared to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23398201/nvidia-rtx-4090-review-test-benchmark">RTX 4090</a> for 4K games running at their highest settings with no frame generation help. That’s still impressive given the Founder’s Edition is small enough that it will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349976/nvidia-rtx-5090-fe-small-form-factor-sff-hands-on">fit inside a small form factor PC case</a>. No matter which you’re after, you’ll be exceedingly satisfied if you’re upgrading from an RTX 30-series card or older.</p><p>Between resellers and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/598793/nvidia-rtx-5090-5080-low-stock-warning">forewarned scarcity</a> that’s soured past launches, you’ll likely need a good game plan to secure a 50-series GPU early on. If you aren’t already in line at a brick-and-mortar location, it might be a little too late to find day one stock based on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Microcenter/comments/1iaunns/campers_already_appeared/">encampments that have spawned</a> over the past several days, but we’ll show you where to preorder one online when they become available tomorrow morning.</p><div><h2>Tips to increase your chances</h2><section><p>It’s typically faster to use a desktop or a laptop to click around and input whatever information you need. If you can, use a computer with an ethernet connection to ensure nothing interferes with your network. Bonus points if you use an ultrawide or multiple monitors to view several browser windows at once.</p></section><section><p>Some retailers may implement a wait queue. You can use your smartphone, tablet, or another secondary device to try and get a faster queue time. It can also serve as a failsafe between refreshes if one of the sites slows to a crawl on your desktop. That said, your smartphone should only be a last result to using a PC, as you don’t want to waste time juggling multiple tabs and apps or tapping away at tiny input fields.</p></section><section><p>The last thing you’ll want to be doing when the floodgates open on January 30th is fiddling with passwords and a deluge of confirmation emails. Make sure you have an account with each retailer that’s expected to carry the graphics cards, and do so ahead of launch.</p></section><section><p>If possible, you’ll also want to add your shipping and billing details in advance. This way, you’ll only have to worry about adding the GPU to your cart and completing the final checkout steps.</p></section><section><p>Both Best Buy and Nvidia allow you to sign up to be notified when the GPUs become available. B&amp;H Photo actually requires you to sign up in advance if you want to order one. Be sure to sign up for alerts on each variant of the 5080 or 5090 that you’re planning to buy.</p></section><section><p>You don’t want to rely solely on email notifications for stock alerts, as they’re often delayed and you risk missing your chance. Be sure to load up tabs for each retailer shortly before their listings go live, and then practice hitting that refresh button as fast as humanely possible.</p></section></div><div><p id="where-to-preorder-the-nvidia-rtx-5080-and-rtx-5090"><h2>Where to preorder the Nvidia RTX 5080 and RTX 5090</h2></p></div><p>As of writing, we’re only seeing retail listings for the Founders Editions of the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 at Best Buy, and you can expect Nvidia to sell them, too. That said, there are multiple options from a variety of manufacturers across all retailers, including MSI, Asus, Gigabyte, Zotac, and more. Keep reading for details on each retailer’s current plans.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->1000</span></p><div><p>Nvidia’s RTX 5080 is the successor to the RTX 4080.

Eventually, a range of laptops and pre-built desktop PCs with the GPUs will become available. The retailer currently allows you to sign up to be notified about their arrival, but you’ll want to be proactive and check the site listings early and often on the morning of January 30th.</p><p>Purchasing a 50-series graphics card from Best Buy requires creating an account. If you’re lucky enough to add one to cart, you’ll be added to a queue while the system verifies your account and confirms your unit. If successful, you’ll have 10 minutes to complete the checkout process.</p><div><p id="newegg"><h3>Newegg</h3></p></div><p><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=44583&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2FRTX-50-Series%2FEventSaleStore%2FID-1473" rel="sponsored">Newegg is teasing a comprehensive stock</a> of 50-series graphics cards.
