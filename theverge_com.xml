            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>My first thought upon starting up <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> was, “Why yes, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/are-you-tired-of-being-nice">I actually <em>would</em> like to go ape shit</a>.” The game starts by having Donkey Kong smash through a wall to reveal a glittering gem waiting to be liberated from the rock. But instead of punching the bright yellow gem into bite-size pieces, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642699/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-preview-switch-2">I kept punching through the walls and floors, digging tunnels into the landscape</a>.</p></div><p>With the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2 finally out in consumers’ hands</a> for more than a month now and the luster of the console’s newness fading, we’re left asking, “What’s this thing actually capable of?” The first big exclusive, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, was a nice aperitif, giving players a bit of the new — processing power and graphics — firmly enmeshed in the old familiarity of <em>Mario Kart</em>.<em> Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, now the console’s second major exclusive, represents the Switch 2’s first real course, and it’s a fantastic feast.</p><p>In <em>Bananza</em>, Donkey Kong has given up the lush comfort of his island to become a working monkey (or ape, as it were). He’s added a pair of overalls and a hard hat to his look and has ventured to Ingot Isle to dig up banadium gems — precious stones in the shape of banana bunches — with religious zeal. However, a gang of ruthless capitalists comes along and steals all the banana gems, forcing DK and his new friend Pauline to venture to the planet’s core to stop them.</p><p>There’s one rule to keep in mind playing <em>Bananza</em>: ABP. Always Be Punching. There’s an enemy ahead? Punch it. An obstacle? Punch through it. A friendly rock offering you some health-restoring apple juice? Ah, what the hell, punch him too. The punch action is extremely satisfying, enhanced by all the sounds of the different materials. Sand has a powdery quality to its sound as it crunches under DK’s feet. So does gravel, but the sound it makes is perceptibly different in the same way real sand is different from real gravel.</p><p>The variety of punchable materials definitely makes the case for<em> Bananza</em> being a Switch 2 game. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/703468/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-interview-switch-2"><em>Bananza</em>’s developers told me that</a> this was originally meant to be an original Switch title before the prospect of the Switch 2’s enhanced graphical and processing power changed the calculus of development. I can see what all that extra power was for when I spot detail in the environment at a distance. When DK punches through snow, snowflakes sprinkle around. Speaking of sprinkles, I love that the frozen layer is actually a huge dessert factory and that what I thought was mud was actually textured chocolate sprinkles. I hate that DK can eat apples for health but not the chocolate dirt.</p><p>It’s not perfect. There are rare moments when there’s a lot of graphical noise that the game chugs a bit. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/donkey-kong/donkey-kong-bananza-will-have-some-framerate-drops-director-admits-but-hes-fine-with-that-we-prioritized-fun-and-playability/">Nintendo says it is aware of the issue</a>, though I only encountered slowdown once and during the exceedingly badass end boss fight.</p><p>With <em>Bananza</em>, I could tell that the <em>Breath of the Wild</em> duology still has a chokehold over Nintendo’s designers. Not only does <em>Bananza</em> present <em>BOTW</em>-style openness emphasizing exploration, but every level starts with a slow, cinematic reveal as DK free-falls from the sky. Despite the fact that there are 17 distinct levels, dropping in from the air <em>BOTW</em>-style never got old. Each level was crafted with a creativity that was fun to peel apart — in some cases literally.</p><p>One of the later levels, deep within the mantle, was a beach resort strewn with colossal fruits that were fun to tunnel through. The fleshy fruits weren’t exactly rendered true to life, but I still had a moment of discomfort imagining DK and Pauline getting all sticky tunneling through a giant strawberry. I could also see the DNA of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> in the general cadence of gameplay. There are bananas (like moons) to uncover either in the world itself or contained within special challenges.</p><p>The damage DK does to the environment persists, permanently altering the landscape, and I can see those changes reflected in the game’s map for all time. (Unless I want to revert everything back to the way it was, which is a menu option.) There’s also a vastness that’s made approachable by exploration. More often than not, if I see a distant area on the map or from a high-up vantage point, I can go there, and, even better, there’s probably something hidden for me to find. The prospect of discovery through destruction, more than finishing the story, was what propelled me forward.</p><p>Not that the story itself <em>isn’t</em> fun. Nintendo has inadvertently made a game for the current political moment. A gross and scrungly (my words) president (game’s words) who has more bananas than he could ever need has decided to steal even more while destroying the world with the byproducts of his manufacturing company. He can do almost nothing by himself, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/09/politics/fema-texas-flood-noem">relying on the intelligence of a pretty but evil woman</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618233/dan-bongino-fbi-deputy-director-conservative-podcaster">the enforcement of a big, mean muscle dude</a>. Coincidence? Definitely. But it’s still fun to punch them and imagine you’re working out your feelings.</p><p>Then there’s DK himself: a big, simple guy who has decided to use his massive power to stop the bad guys while helping a cute little girl find her confidence. I love Pauline as a sidekick, and I typically hate mouthy audience surrogates. Pauline hangs off DK’s back but rarely chirps about where to go next. In fact, she’s quiet for most of the game, only talking at length whenever the pair checks into a hideaway for a rest. Then, as you drift off to health-restoring sleep, she’ll remark on your adventures or share her own thoughts. It’s a cute, natural way to see her character develop while not being an intrusive Navi type.</p><div><div><p id="bananza-with-a-buddy"><h2>Bananza with a buddy.</h2></p></div><p>I tried <em>Bananza</em>’s co-op with my husband on his original Switch. It was a breeze to start, but just make sure your <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/658511/nintendo-switch-20-0-0-update-virtual-game-card-gameshare-switch-2">OG Switch has been updated for the GameShare function</a>. Player 2 controls Pauline and is able to use her voice to blast objects and enemies. That’s it. It’s in fact so simple that my player 2 quit after five minutes because he saw essentially all the multiplayer had to offer. However, you can see the performance issues the original Switch would have had with this game, as there were lots of pop-in and frame rate issues. Also, unless you’re an artist or really nostalgic for squishing Mario’s face on the <em>Super Mario 64</em> title screen, you’re not gonna get much out of <em>Bananza</em>’s <a href="https://youtu.be/nAw5_PA_VB0?si=cgarfRGMG0qIqafj">rock sculpting mode</a>.</p></div><p><em>Bananza</em> also does a thing I love where its narrative is reinforced in the game’s mechanics. Pauline is a girl who loves to sing but is afraid of performing in front of big crowds. She works that out over the course of the game because it’s her voice that powers up DK’s transformations, known as Bananzas. There’s a zebra form that lets him run fast over disintegrating blocks, an ostrich that lets him fly, and more. (The game very cleverly shuts down the “but ostriches can’t fly” pedants by essentially saying, “Yes, we know. It’s a video game, don’t think too hard.”) With every new Bananza performance, DK gets more powerful and Pauline gets more confident.</p><p><em>Bananza</em> is a dad game the same way <em>The Last of Us</em> is a dad game. Same world-trekking adventure with a big strong dude protecting a powerful little girl. But where <em>TLOU</em> makes you have big sad feelings about all the people the game forces you to kill, <em>Bananza</em> presents you with a slight alternative — what if you could use your powers to fuck shit up and <em>not</em> be a dick about it? DK smiles often. People are happy to see him. That friendly rock I mentioned earlier? When you punch him or any NPC, it turns into a high five. All that destruction is welcome because it’s helping restore the world.</p><p><sub>Donkey Kong Bananza<em> launches on July 17th on the Nintendo Switch 2.</em></sub></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="https://x.com/nintendo/status/1945433161124688335?s=46">an X post about the casting</a>, Shigeru Miyamoto — who is producing the film — expressed that he is “very much looking forward to seeing” Bragason and Ainsworth on the big screen together.</p><p>Aside from the fact that <em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em>’ Wes Ball is directing the <em>Zelda </em>movie, we still don’t know all that much about the project.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707106/cyberpunk-2077-mac-release-date">launching on macOS tomorrow</a>, and CD Projekt Red is now <a href="https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/mac/sp-technical/issue/2891/cyberpunk-2077-mac-system-requirements">sharing details</a> on exactly what Mac you’ll need to get the most out of the game. While <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> has been optimized for a variety of Macs, from early M1 models up, if you want the top “very high fidelity” config then you’ll need an M3 Ultra or M4 Max machine with 36GB of unified memory.</p><p>CD Projekt Red is using dynamic “for this Mac” presets that will assign settings and resolutions based on your Mac’s hardware. M1 Macs will be able to run <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, as long as you have 16GB of unified memory. That gives you the “minimum” config, which runs at 1440 x 900 resolution or 1600 x 900 (using MetalFX dynamic resolution scaling) with a target performance of 30fps.</p><p>If you want 60fps then CD Projekt Red is recommending an M3 Pro or higher with 18GB of unified memory, which will run at 1080p resolution (using MetalFX DRS) with a target of 60fps. You’ll likely be able to achieve 60fps by dropping the resolution below 1080p on some older Apple silicon hardware, though.</p><p>The remaining “high fidelity” and “very high fidelity” configs will be reserved for some of the most powerful Apple silicon chips. High fidelity requires an M2 Ultra or M3 Max chip with 36GB of unified memory, and will enable 60fps gameplay at 1440p with MetalFX DRS. Very high fidelity is reserved for M3 Ultra or M4 Max chips with 36GB of unified memory, and will also deliver 60fps gameplay at 1440p with MetalFX DRS enabled.</p><p>None of the “for this Mac” presets enable ray tracing by default, though. If you want to play around with ray tracing then <a href="https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/mac/sp-technical/issue/2897/ray-tracing-on-mac">CD Projekt Red recommends</a> an M3 or newer chip. An Apple M3 Pro device with 18GB of unified memory will be able to handle the medium ray tracing preset at 1080p (with MetalFX DRS) and 30fps. If you want <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> ray-traced at 60fps on Mac then you’ll need an M3 Max or higher chip with 36GB of unified memory, which will run the medium ray tracing preset at 60fps at 1080p with MetalFX DRS.</p><p>AMD’s FSR upscaling and frame generation will also be available in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on Mac, so it’s possible with a mixture of settings you’ll be able to find an even sweeter spot for playing this game on a Mac than the presets provide. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> will be available from Apple’s own Mac App Store, Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG.com on July 17th, and the game supports cross progression across all platforms.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/708100/cyberpunk-2077-mac-system-requirements-modes-ray-tracing]]></content:encoded>
