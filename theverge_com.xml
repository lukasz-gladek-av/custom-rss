The AMD-powered Claw A8 will also come in two colors: white and lime green.</p><div><p>MSI had a bit of a rough start with the release of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review">original Claw handheld in March 2024</a>, but it seemed to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338654/i-finally-touched-the-msi-claw-8-ai-plus">redeem itself</a> with the launch of the MSI Claw 8 AI Plus.

It also has what MSI calls a “glittering” white coating.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/669323/elgato-stream-deck-modules-vsd-scissor-switches<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Elgato announced a new “Stream Deck Everywhere” strategy at Computex, which includes a software-based virtual Stream Deck for PCs, an ethernet dock accessory, unbranded Stream Deck modules that can bring its keys into other products, and even new scissor-switch keys for a more precise, keyboard-like feel. “With these launches, we’re opening up Stream Deck to a world of new users, from developers and DIY builders to manufacturers seeking a field-proven interface for their products,” said Elgato general manager Julian Fest. “Because Stream Deck isn’t just a device—it’s a platform.</p><p>Stream Deck Modules are designed for hobbyists and manufacturers to easily integrate into hardware projects instead of ripping apart the consumer version or developing their own custom macropad solutions. The modules are available in 6-, 15-, and 32-key variants and are housed in an aluminum chassis that can be built into custom bases, machines, and furniture, making it possible to actually create <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640725/april-fools-2025-elgatos-stream-deck-desk">Elgato’s ridiculous 1,262-key April Fools’ desk</a>.</p><p>The Stream Deck Modules are available now starting at $49.99 for the six-key version, $129.99 for the 15-key, and $199.99 for the 32-key. Elgato technical marketing manager Philipp Eggebrecht told <em>The Verge</em> that discounts will be offered for bulk purchases.</p><p>A new variant of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22579144/elgato-stream-deck-mk-2-stand-faceplates-usb-c-valve">MK.2 Stream Deck</a> has been introduced that replaces the membrane keys with scissor-style switches that provide “enhanced speed and precision,” according to Elgato. Eggebrecht says the scissor keys variant costs $149.99 and will be available in “around two weeks.” </p><p>Stream Deck buttons that feel more like keyboard keys would make it easier for users to tell they’ve clicked something without having to look at the device. Elgato describes the scissor switch variant as something that “lends itself to typing-style interactions, paving the way for new use cases that benefit from rapid, multi-layered input and control,” which could be testing the waters for a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/features/24191410/elgato-stream-deck-art-lebedev-optimus-maximus-keyboard-retrospective">Stream Deck keyboard</a> or any other application requiring precise controls.</p><p>“The idea of a full LCD-key based keyboard is interesting. We’ve explored it in the past and so far, what we’ve found is that the experience hasn’t been great, and there’s the cost question,” Eggebrecht told <em>The Verge</em>. “We’re getting closer to a keyboard feeling with Stream Deck Scissor Keys, and always looking at the technology and what is becoming possible. Stream Deck and keyboards are a natural fit.”</p><p>Elgato is also rolling out a software-only Stream Deck for desktop devices, akin to the <a rel="sponsored" href="https://elgato.sjv.io/c/482924/2029077/13666?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elgato.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fs%2Fstream-deck-mobile">existing Stream Deck mobile app</a>. The Virtual Stream Deck (VSD) can provide a permanent macro menu on computer screens or be summoned at will when users hit allocated hotkeys and mouse buttons. The VSD software will initially be available for people who own a Corsair Scimitar Elite Wireless SE mouse, Xenon Edge touchscreen, or any Stream Deck model, before later rolling out to “more devices.”</p><p>Custom layouts, virtual faceplates, and support for beyond six buttons require iPhone and Android Stream Deck users to pay for Pro access, which starts at $2.99 monthly or $49.99 as a one-time purchase. Eggebrecht says Elgato’s desktop VSD isn’t locked behind a subscription, but does require users to install the Stream Deck 7.0 beta.</p><p>A new $79.99 Stream Deck network dock accessory was also announced that includes support for power over Ethernet (PoE), which lets you place its buttons anywhere there’s a network jack, and with more flexibility than USB-C affords by itself. Eggebrecht says the Stream Deck network dock will start shipping in August.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
