In it, host Steve Burke says the company is still misleading customers, despite adjustments made in response to his previous video in which he <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/1/24310181/nzxt-pc-rental-program-gamers-nexus-investigation">called the program</a> “a scam.”</p><p>NZXT <a href="https://nzxt.com/news/nzxt-update-addressing-your-concerns-about-the-flex-subscription-program">said in its response</a> this week that it would clarify details about its Flex program, which Gamers Nexus had criticized for having specs that would change sometimes “day-to-day.” The company has appeared to update specs and performance numbers for its purchase builds. But Gamers Nexus reports it still spotted issues like inconsistent FPS numbers and a FAQ that implied NZXT’s for-sale Player: Three Prime build uses an RTX 4090 graphics card, despite its specs saying otherwise. </p><p>The FAQ entry Burke mentions seems to be gone now, but as of this writing, there’s still an entry titled “What GPU is right for me?” that lists the RTX 4090 and its benefits. Such inconsistencies are a problem for potential customers, Burke says.</p><div><blockquote><p>The fact that NZXT misrepresented its product, even after its statement, as having a 4090 when it still had a 4080 Super ... seemingly indicates that even NZXT can’t keep up with its own specs changes. If NZXT can’t keep up with it ... how are they expecting the customer to keep up with it?</p></blockquote></div><p>Gamers Nexus offers other criticisms of the company’s rental program, from “improper packaging” damage fees with upper bounds that exceed the cost of equivalent non-rental versions of the PCs to the creator-based ad videos that continue to exist, despite the company saying it had “pulled all influencer-led Flex advertising.” NZXT did not immediately respond to our request for comment on the new video.</p><p>Gamers Nexus said Thursday that it’s working on a deeper investigation, and its video today ends with Burke saying he’s received “a number of very concerning tips” from former employees and customers. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24315134/fortnite-ballistic-counter-strike-first-person-shooter-fps<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Epic Games is about to let <em>Fortnite</em> creators publish experiences with first-person modes, and to help show what’s possible, Epic itself is introducing a tactical FPS shooter that seems like it will play a lot like <em>Counter-Strike </em>or <em>Valorant.</em></p><p>The new mode, called “Ballistic,” is “an adrenaline-filled, round-based 5v5 competitive game mode where strategy, tactical teamwork, and individual prowess are essential for victory,” <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-goes-first-person-with-ballistic-a-tactical-5v5-shooter-launching-in-early-access-dec-11">according to an Epic blog post</a>. Players will be split into two teams, with one that has to plant the bomb — sorry, I mean the “Rift Point Device” — and another that has to defend against that. Between rounds, you’ll be able to buy gear for the next one. Teams will switch sides after six rounds, and the first to win seven rounds will be crowned the victor.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Epic has cribbed a game idea for <em>Fortnite: </em>its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23993046/fortnite-is-going-full-speed-ahead">racing</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23992574/fortnite-festival-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band">festival</a> modes both borrow a lot from Psyonix’s <em>Rocket League</em> and Harmonix’s <em>Rock Band</em> (Epic owns both studios), the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic"><em>Lego</em> survival mode</a> has a lot of similarities to <em>Minecraft</em>, and Epic even admitted that the (now-gone) Impostors mode <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722606/epic-games-fortnite-imposters-mode-copy-among-us-credit">was inspired by <em>Among Us</em></a>. Heck, the game’s main battle royale mode was actually a spinoff that followed the success of <em>PUBG</em>.</p><p>But now that Epic is trying to make <em>Fortnite</em> into something more akin to <em>Roblox</em> (another inspiration!), where players are encouraged to sample lots of experiences instead of just one, modes like Ballistic and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/21/24183255/its-going-to-be-a-busy-weekend-in-fortnite">Reload</a><em> </em>let Epic experiment with different ideas without changing the core battle royale experience. And since your purchased <em>Fortnite</em> outfits and gear generally work across all of the modes, there’s a financial incentive for Epic to add more experiences, too.</p><p>Ballistic launches in early access on December 11th. <em>Fortnite</em> creators will be able to publish their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24258447/fortnite-creators-first-person-shooters-fps-unreal-editor">own experiences</a> with first-person modes <a href="https://x.com/FNCreate/status/1864747437384176063">that same day</a>.</p><div><p><em>Ballistic</em> is arriving during an already busy time for <em>Fortnite</em>. The game’s Japanese-themed season kicked off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/30/24309607/new-chapter-new-island">at the beginning of the week</a>, and on Friday, Epic launched the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294616/fortnite-og-permanent-december-release-date">permanent version of its throwback OG mode</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
