The Gamestation Go is not only an accessible way for nostalgic gamers to enjoy retro titles, it also provides several ways to accurately play those older games with an unusual assortment of control options.</p><p>In addition to a standard D-pad and buttons, the Gamestation Go features a paddle controller, a trackball, and a numeric keypad, mirroring the unique controllers that were available for the earliest Atari consoles. The various controls even light up so you know which one you should be using for the game you’re playing. And although the handheld features a generous 7-inch screen, battery life is still estimated to be up to four or five hours.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/774305/atari-gamestation-go-retro-handheld-trackball-paddle#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/774305/atari-gamestation-go-retro-handheld-trackball-paddle]]></content:encoded>
