Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony launched an updated PlayStation 5 digital console in Europe, but instead of offering 1TB of storage for €499, it now comes with just an 825GB Solid-State Drive (SSD) at the same price, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-digital-only-ps5-now-comes-with-less-storage-in-europe-and-isnt-any-cheaper-to-buy">reported earlier by <em>Eurogamer</em></a>. YouTuber Austin Evans discovered the change in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrxVnRxLo&amp;t=11s">a teardown video</a> posted earlier this week, confirming an earlier <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770271/sony-rumor-says-it-will-reduce-ps5-slim-digital-edition-storage-space">report from gaming bargain hunter billbil-kun</a>.</p><p>Sony originally launched the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/10/23955005/sony-playstation-5-ps5-slim-size-comparison-photo-gallery-hands-on-impressions">slimmed-down version of the PS5</a> in 2023, coming with an upgraded 1TB SSD, as opposed to the original PS5’s 825GB of internal storage. At launch, the digital-only console cost $449.99 before Sony <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/647869/sony-ps5-price-rise-uk-europe-australia-new-zealand">raised the price</a> across the globe, bringing it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762410/sony-ps5-price-hike-raise-digital-pro">to $499.99 in the US</a> and €499.99 in Europe.</p><p>Though the refreshed PS5 says it comes with 825GB on the box, Evan found that the console only has 667.2GB of usable storage due to the operating system and other apps included with the console. Meanwhile, the older, digital-only version of the console with a 1TB SSD has 848GB of usable storage.</p><p>Aside from the storage change, the updated PS5 comes with a new matte finish, along with smaller components that make it about 100 grams lighter than its predecessor. Sony hasn’t provided a reason for the change, but its <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s/">recent post</a> about raising prices cites a “challenging economic environment.” There’s still no word on whether this updated console will launch outside Europe.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/789686/sony-digital-ps5-slim-less-storage-europe]]></content:encoded>

Amazon Luna head Jeff Gattis <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/new-amazon-luna">announced in a blog post</a> on Wednesday that a “completely redesigned and reimagined Amazon Luna” service will be relaunched later this year, introducing a Jackbox-like “GameNight” social category that allows Prime subscribers to play together with family and friends.</p><p>Like Jackbox, GameNight players can join games by scanning a QR code using their phone, which will then serve as the game controller. The feature will launch with more than 25 multiplayer titles, including <em>Angry Birds</em>, Draw &amp; Guess, Exploding Kittens, and adaptations of board games such as Taboo, Ticket to Ride, and Clue. Amazon is also developing exclusive games for the GameNight feature, starting with <em>Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg</em>. This is a “human‑built, AI‑powered improv courtroom game,” according to Gattis, which requires players to defend themselves in court before Judge Snoop Dogg.</p><p>GameNight will be available to Prime subscribers at no additional cost, with additional games being added to the feature over time. Amazon hasn’t specified when this future Luna relaunch will roll out, but given we’re already in October, it should be sometime in the coming weeks.</p><p>Aside from gaining a new social gaming category, it’s difficult to tell how significant the upcoming Luna redesign will be. Gattis says that bringing Snoop Dogg to GameNight is “just the beginning,” and mentions vague plans around Amazon using AI to help reimagine cloud gaming. It’s unclear if these developments would be exclusive to Luna’s GameNight feature.</p><p>“With advances in AI and cloud technology, we see opportunities to create entirely new kinds of games – experiences that were never possible before,” said Gattis. “We have an incredible pipeline of games in the works and can’t wait for you to play and experience the all-new Luna for yourself later this year.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/789658/amazon-luna-cloud-relaunch-gamenight-social-gaming]]></content:encoded>
