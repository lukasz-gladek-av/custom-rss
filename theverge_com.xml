It was also given the “Best Game You Suck At” award, which, I’m not sure if that’s a good thing or not. Given the relentless fawning over <em>Silksong</em> since its release in September, an event that nearly brought the entire <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/771461/silksong-release-steam-nintendo-eshop-crash">digital video game distribution system</a> to its knees, that it would win Game of the Year felt like something of a forgone conclusion.</p><p>The Best Game on Steam Deck was awarded to <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/783718/hades-ii-2-1-0-update-review-pc-nintendo-switch">Hades II</a></em> (an award we’d already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152085/hades-2-steam-deck-performance">unofficially</a> granted it). The mechanics of <em>Hades</em> lend it to being played in short bursts, and the stylized graphics scale down well. <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/782012/silent-hill-f-review-ps5-xbox-steam">Silent Hill f</a></em> won the Outstanding Visual Style award and, while there’s no denying it’s a gorgeous title, I can’t help but feel like <em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2134320%2FENA_Dream_BBQ%2F" rel="sponsored">Dream BBQ</a></em>, with its uniquely hallucinatory visuals, got robbed.
