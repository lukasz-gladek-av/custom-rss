Originally released back in 1992, <em>Mario Paint</em> was a unique SNES title, because although it included a handful of mini games, it was first and foremost a creative tool letting players draw, paint, animate, and even compose music using the 16-bit console.</p><p>What also set <em>Mario Paint</em> apart from other SNES games was that it didn’t rely on the console’s standard gamepad. It came bundled with a two-button mouse and a plastic mouse pad that made drawing and navigating the game’s on-screen menus and drag-and-drop interface much easier.</p><div><p>In 1992, creative apps like Photoshop were still in their relative infancy —- Photoshop didn’t even have its useful layers feature yet — and for many kids, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/i-miss-mario-paint-when-nintendo-gamified-art-class-1847664087"><em>Mario Paint</em> was their first exposure to using a digital creative tool</a> (and perhaps even a mouse).</p></div><p>Alongside <em>Mario Paint</em> being added to the Switch’s SNES catalog, Nintendo has enabled mouse support for the Switch’s SNES app, which is compatible with games like <em>Mario’s Super Picross</em> and <em>Nobunaga’s Ambition. </em>On the original Switch, players can connect a compatible USB mouse to play <em>Mario Paint</em>, while on the Switch 2 the Joy-Con 2 controller’s mouse functionality can be used.</p><p>The company also recently added 19 tracks from <em>Mario Paint</em> to the Nintendo Music mobile app, including the three sample compositions available in the game’s music sequencer.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/715104/nintendo-mario-paint-super-nintendo-switch-2-online-mouse-mode]]></content:encoded>
