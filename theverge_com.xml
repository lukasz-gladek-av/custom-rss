According <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-20/take-two-guts-bioshock-studio-after-a-decade-of-development">to <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, Take-Two is laying off more than 80 people at Cloud Chamber, which has been working on a new <em>BioShock</em> title, and the game has been delayed from a planned launch in late 2026 or early 2027.</p><p>The game has already had a rocky development, and the changes likely mean that the new title may still be years away. The last game in the series, <em>BioShock Infinite</em>, was released in 2013.</p><p>To help get this new entry back on track, 2K Games, the division of Take-Two that oversees Cloud Chamber, has hired Rod Fergusson, formerly the head of the <em>Diablo</em> team at Blizzard and helped get <em>BioShock Infinite</em> over the finish line, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:7stk6kdxhyemi6fdsk23q3ta/post/3lwr7mrw2gc2e?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.theverge.com%252Fnews%252F761490%252Fthe-bioshock-franchise-has-a-new-boss">to lead the Cloud Chamber team</a>. “I’m deeply grateful for the work the studio has done so far, and I’m committed to building a BioShock game we’ll be proud of and that our players will love,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rodfergusson.bsky.social/post/3lwr7mrw2gc2e">Fergusson wrote yesterday</a>.</p><p>In an internal memo announcing the Cloud Chamber layoffs, 2K Games president David Ismailer said that “while we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a <em>BioShock</em> game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development,” per a memo published <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/bioshock-layoffs-2k-rod-fergusson-head-cloud-chamber-1236492902/">by <em>Variety</em></a>.</p><p>Take-Two didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from <em>The Verge</em>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/762933/bioshock-cloud-chamber-take-two-2k-layoffs]]></content:encoded>

The announcement comes a little over a month <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707586/analogue-3d-4k-n64-delay-august-2025">after the console’s previous delay</a>, which would’ve seen it ship at the end of August.</p><p>While the July announcement cited the ongoing mess around tariffs as the reason for that delay, the cause for the current delay is less clear.</p><p>“Analogue has been moving at maximum pace, processing shipping to everyone who has been patiently waiting,” the company wrote in a statement. “Unexpected, uncommon issues are rare. Especially in a negligible degree under esoteric circumstances. We’re ensuring every detail meets our standard.” The statement added that the launch is “at 99% percent. Hardware, system, packaging — the full kit — been set for months. The last one percent is where we’re focused.”</p><p>The company also says that the currently vague Q4 timing is “intentionally set conservatively,” presumably to avoid having to announce another delay. Full refunds <a href="https://x.com/analogue/status/1958247804884677035">are available</a> for those who pre-ordered.</p><div><p>The Analogue 3D was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23915941/analogue-3d-nintendo-64">first announced in 2023 with plans to launch the following year</a>, and was delayed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24265587/analogue-3d-nintendo-64-price-preorder-date">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631816/analogue-3d-delay-nintendo-64-modretro-teaser">times</a> since then. The 3D — which promises to render N64 games in 4K and boasts 100 percent compatibility with the console’s library — is the latest project from the company, which has previously made high-end versions of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/31/14451542/analogue-nt-mini-nes-review">NES</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/7/16981722/analogue-super-nt-snes-nintendo-review">SNES</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18513025/analogue-console-clones-gaming-history-preservation-code-hardware">Sega Genesis</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22831589/analogue-pocket-review">Game Boy</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/762883/analogue-3d-delay-q4-2025]]></content:encoded>
