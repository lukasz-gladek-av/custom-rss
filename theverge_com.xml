Its latest first, announced at Gamescom 2025 in Germany, is a pair of controllers with the ability to infinitely adjust the tension and stiffness of their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">TMR joysticks</a>.</p><p>Originally shown off as a prototype PlayStation-style controller called the Libra Max a year ago, GuliKit redesigned it with an asymmetrical stick layout and is releasing it as two new controllers in October 2025 called the TT Pro and the TT Max for $49.99 and $69.99, respectively.</p><p>Controllers with adjustable joystick tension aren’t a new idea. The $199.99 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23340603/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-core-white-controller-release-date-price">Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2</a> offers that functionality, but with only three different resistance settings. GuliKit says the sticks on its new TT Pro and Max controllers are infinitely adjustable, but hasn’t yet specified how the highest and lowest resistance settings compare to other controllers. Will it get as loose as the N64’s joystick that sometimes felt like it could fall over all on its own?</p><p>The TT Pro and TT Max feature similar functionality to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/758728/gulikit-nintendo-switch-2-wake-es-pro-wireless-controller">recently-announced GuliKit ES and ES Pro controllers</a> including the company’s Hyperlink 2 Bluetooth technology and support for PCs, Android, iOS, and the Switch including Switch 2 waking capabilities. Both versions of the new controllers include the adjustable TMR joysticks with ring lighting, switchable Hall effect triggers, swappable floating-style D-pads, and four buttons on the back with swappable paddles.</p><p>The TT Max adds alternate height joystick caps, motion controls, and a D-pad whose movement can be toggled between four and eight-directions.</p><p>GuliKit also plans to release its new tension adjustable TMR joysticks as upgrade kits for the PS5’s DualSense and DualSense Edge, the PS4’s DualShock, the Xbox Series X|S controller, and the original Switch Pro controller. (Opening <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/705383/ifixit-teardown-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-repairability">Nintendo’s Switch 2 Pro controller</a> to do upgrades or repairs is a huge challenge.) The kits will be available sometime next month but pricing hasn’t been announced yet.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/763341/gulikit-tt-pro-max-wireless-switch-2-wake-controllers-adjustable-tension]]></content:encoded>
