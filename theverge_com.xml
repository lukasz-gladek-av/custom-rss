            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342650/8bitdo-ultimate-mobile-gaming-controller-samsung-m80d-smart-monitor-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>While the cradle-style <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review">Backbone One</a> is a great mobile controller we often recommend, it’s not the right choice for everyone. Thankfully, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279435/8bitdo-ultimate-mobile-gaming-controller-android-hall-effect"><strong>8BitDo’s Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller</strong></a> is a cheaper alternative for Android users, one that’s available at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Joysticks-Console/dp/B0DK36N98Q?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> in black for $39.99 ($10 off) for the first time. That’s well below the Backbone One’s $100 MSRP and its typical sale price of $69.99.</p><p>The 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile doesn’t connect via a USB-C or Lightning port like other mobile options. Instead, it uses Bluetooth for wireless compatibility with most smartphones running Android 9.0 or later. (Sorry, iPhone users!) That does mean you’ll need to recharge it occasionally, but 8BitDo says it only requires a 1.5-hour charge for 15 hours of gameplay. It can also accommodate any phone measuring between 100mm and 170mm in length.</p><p>In terms of hardware, 8BitDo’s mobile gamepad offers an Xbox-style button layout and ergonomics, with four face buttons, a clicky D-pad, dual bumpers, and drift-free Hall effect sticks and triggers that should be less prone to failure over time. It also features two rear buttons, a dedicated profile button, and turbo functionality, all of which are customizable with 8BitDo’s excellent Ultimate Software.</p><div><p>8BitDo’s mobile gamepad offers an Xbox-style grip and compatibility with phones running Android 9.0 or later.

It’s on sale for an all-time low of $399.99 ($300 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1DBQRRS?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/jb9u2szc3zt1p">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-32-Smart-Monitor-M8-M80D-4K-UHD-with-Streaming-TV-Speakers-USB-C-Ergonomic-Stand-and-SlimFit-Camera%2F5463194341">Walmart</a>. The newer 4K monitor supports HDR10 Plus with AI upscaling and a dialogue amplifier, and it runs Samsung’s Tizen-based OS, which lets you access video, music, and gaming apps without a separate device. It also has an integrated webcam, plus the ability to seamlessly use one keyboard and mouse between the monitor and select devices. That includes 2021 or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337167/samsung-galaxy-book-5-pro-360-laptop-intel-arrow-lake-ces">newer Galaxy Books</a>, and Galaxy smartphones and tablets running One UI 5.1 or later. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23180741/samsung-m8-smart-monitor-review-32-inch-4k-smart-tv-usb-c-hdr">Read our review of the 2022 model</a>.</li><li>You can get the latest <strong>Amazon Echo</strong> in blue for $64.99 ($35 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-4th-Gen-With-premium-sound-smart-home-hub-and-Alexa/dp/B085HK4KL6?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/l0b991fqvboc5">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.homedepot.com%2Fpep%2FAmazon-Echo-4th-Gen-with-Premium-Sound-Smart-Home-Hub-and-Alexa-Twilight-Blue-B085HK4KL6%2F315097140">The Home Depot</a>, which is only $15 more than its lowest price to date. The newest Echo is over four years old now, but it’s still a very capable smart speaker that sounds better than the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23426830/echo-dot-with-clock-2022-fifth-gen-review">fifth-gen Echo Dot</a>.&nbsp;You can use it to control a wealth of compatible smart home gadgets, including both lights and smart plugs, and it can act as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/28/23375027/amazon-echo-dot-speaker-eero-mesh-wifi-extender">a range extender if you’re on an Eero mesh Wi-Fi network</a>. It even doubles as a Zigbee hub with Matter support.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review">Read our review</a>.</li><li>The first-gen <strong>Logitech G Pro X Superlight</strong> is currently on sale at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-SUPERLIGHT-Ultra-Lightweight-Programmable-Compatible/dp/B087LXCTFJ?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> for $87.38 (about $73 off), which is about $6 more than the record low. The newer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23043644/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-2-gaming-mouse-price-release-date-specs">Superlight 2</a> offers USB-C charging and a higher resolution 32K optical sensor, but if you don’t have upwards of $150 to spend, the original is still a great mouse with slight concessions. Its 25K Hero sensor still offers more DPI range than most need, and you can keep your micro-USB cables buried in your tech drawer if you pair it with Logitech’s optional <a href="https://sfcc-dev.gamestop.com/graded-trading-cards/graded-cards/products/logitech-powerplay-wireless-charging-system/259251.html">Powerplay wireless charging mat</a>. The slightly ambidextrous gaming mouse doesn’t have a ton of bells and whistles (not even RGB!), but it’s comfortable to push around as it weighs just 63 grams.</li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
