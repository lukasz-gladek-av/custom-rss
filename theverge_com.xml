            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia launched its first RTX 50-series graphics cards earlier this year <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615768/nvidia-rtx-5090-5080-5070-drop-physx-support-32-bit">without support for PhysX</a>, the GPU-accelerated technology that let games realistically simulate shattering glass, moving liquids, smoke, fog, and more. Now, Nvidia is bringing back PhysX support for the RTX 50-series GPUs for top-played games like <em>Borderlands 2</em>, <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>, and <em>Batman: Arkham City</em>.</p><p>“We heard the feedback from the community, and with the launch of our new driver today, we are adding custom support for GeForce gamers’ most played PhysX-accelerated games, enabling full performance on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, in line with our existing PhysX support on prior-generation GPUs,” <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/battlefield-6-winter-offensive-geforce-game-ready-driver/">says Nvidia</a>.</p><p>PhysX was a big part of games like <em>Borderlands 2</em> and <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>, and it originally didn’t ship with Nvidia’s latest GPUs because the RTX 50-series dropped support for 32-bit CUDA support. That prevented these older games using PhysX from being GPU-accelerated on the latest Nvidia GPUs. Some titles like <em>Borderlands 2</em> dropped below 60fps, because the games were relying on a CPU to deliver PhysX effects.</p><p>Nvidia has now created “custom support” for top-played PhysX-accelerated games, but not all games are supported yet. Here’s the current list:</p><p><em>Alice: Madness Returns<br>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag<br>Batman: Arkham City<br>Batman: Arkham Origins<br>Borderlands 2<br>Mafia II<br>Metro 2033<br>Metro: Last Light<br>Mirror’s Edge</em></p><p>Nvidia says it’s also planning to support <em>Batman: Arkham Asylum</em> “in the first part of 2026,” but there’s no word on any additional games. PhysX was always limited to a handful of titles anyway, but <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rtx-50-series-gpus-have-dropped-support-for-32-bit-physx-many-older-pc-games-are-impacted-mirrors-edge-borderlands-etc.1111698/">Resetera forum</a> members have been tracking more than 40 games that have been affected by the removal of PhysX support on RTX 50-series GPUs. Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that Nvidia will fully support all of these older PhysX games.</p><p>You can download Nvidia’s new Game Ready driver (591.44) over at <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/drivers/">Nvidia’s website</a> or through the Nvidia app.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/838043/nvidia-rtx-50-series-physx-support-driver]]></content:encoded>
