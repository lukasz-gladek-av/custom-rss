The <em>Tetris</em>: My Play Watch is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FM9TYLT7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">now available for preorder through Amazon</a> for $79.99, and is expected to ship sometime in October 2025 with an alternate interchangeable band.</p><p>Developed in collaboration with The Tetris Company, the <em>Tetris</em>: My Play Watch looks like an Apple Watch with its square design and rounded corners, functional crown dial, and 1.91-inch color touchscreen. But without connectivity to a smartphone, it’s really only a smartwatch in that it offers more than basic time and calendar functionality. You can think of it more as a wearable console that plays <em>Tetris</em> (including marathon and puzzle modes) that also happens to display the time using a series of customizable <em>Tetris</em>-themed watch faces.</p><p>The crown dial on other My Play Watch models can be used to play games like <em>Space Invaders</em> and <em>Breakout</em>, but it’s only used to navigate the watch’s UI on this version. <em>Tetris</em> can be played through by swiping to move pieces while taps rotate them – similar to how the smartphone versions of the game are played. That could prove challenging on a small screen for those chasing high scores.</p><p><strong><em>Correction, September 26th: </em></strong><em>An earlier version of this article said the </em>Tetris<em>: My Play Watch was available for preorder through the company’s online store. Preorders are being offered through Amazon.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/785725/tetris-my-play-watch-smartwatch]]></content:encoded>
