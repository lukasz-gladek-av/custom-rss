The studio is planning yet another quality-of-life update for the game with Patch 8.</p><p>“Arriving next year, this update will introduce some of the most eagerly awaited features to <em>BG3</em>: cross-play, and photo mode, along with 12 new subclasses,” <a rel="sponsored" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1086940%2Fview%2F4461474037375172735">Larian wrote on its Steam Community page</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24307746/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-cross-play-photo-mode">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTcxMzk=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24236649/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-now-live-evil-endings-mod-support">Baldur’s Gate 3 patch adds official in-game mod support</a></h2><div><p>The long-awaited <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/16/24199957/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-coming-soon">Patch 7 for <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a> is now live. The update adds new, gruesome cinematics for some of the game’s evil endings, new legendary actions for Honor Mode encounters, and official in-game mod support.</p><p>However, with Patch 7 comes a big ole asterisk from the game’s maker, Larian Studios. The patch is currently only available for PC, meaning that players will be unable to load cross-platform save files from PC on their console versions. PC / Mac multiplayer is also disabled. Larian says that it intends to launch Patch 7 on consoles and Mac sometime in October, so <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/10/23827343/baldurs-gate-3-reactivates-ps5-cross-saves">if you like to hop between desktop and console to play <em>BG3</em></a>, you’ll have to wait about a month. The compatibility issues can be avoided by simply declining to update the game on PC, but with all the other Patch 7 improvements, that might prove a difficult choice.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24236649/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-now-live-evil-endings-mod-support">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MjEyMDY=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/16/24199957/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-coming-soon">Larian Studios teases all the new features coming in the next Baldur’s Gate 3 patch</a></h2><div><p>In a new community update, Larian Studios <a rel="sponsored" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1086940%2Fview%2F4240783699885624491">has shared a brief overview</a> of all the things it’s working on for the next <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> patch.</p><p>Larian has previously announced that patch 7, due out in September, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170409/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-pc-consoles">will include the release of official mod support</a> and the introduction of a toolkit that will allow players the ability to create their own mods. According to Larian, the toolkit supports the creation of new items, classes and subclasses, races, and more.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/16/24199957/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-coming-soon">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MjU4ODk=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170409/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-pc-consoles">Baldur’s Gate 3 mod support is coming in September</a></h2><div><p>It’s gonna get pretty funky in Faerûn with official mod support coming to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23860060/baldurs-gate-3-news-reviews-updates"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>. Larian Studios announced that official mod support will roll out in phases, starting today with a closed alpha, before a closed beta test in July, culminating with the official release of Patch 7 in September. According to Larian, the staggered testing phases will give the community ample time to test the new mod tools before making them available across PC and consoles.</p><p>If you have experience with official mod support in games like <em>Skyrim</em> or <em>Fallout</em>, Larian’s approach will sound similar. On PC, mods will be tested to ensure terms of service compatibility and overall stability before approval. Those mods will then undergo additional approvals before coming to console. While PC players will have access to the full suite of mod creation tools, and mods can still be made, downloaded, and played without using the official mod browser, console players will only be able to browse and install mods officially approved by Larian.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170409/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-pc-consoles">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MzIzMDU=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/22/24108773/baldurs-gate-3-larian-dungeons-and-dragons">Baldur’s Gate 3 developer is moving on from Dungeons and Dragons</a></h2><div><p>With the sheer popularity surrounding <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, the game is ripe for an expansion — but if it ever happens, it won’t be made by its developer Larian Studios. During a panel at the Game Developers Conference on Thursday, Larian founder Swen Vincke revealed that the studio plans on moving away from <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>games, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-studios-wont-make-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-expansions-or-baldurs-gate-4">as first reported by <em>IGN</em></a>.</p><p>“We’re not going to make new expansions, which everybody is expecting us to do. We’re not going to make <em>Baldur’s Gate 4</em>, which everybody is expecting us to do. We’re going to move on,” Vincke said. He added that Larian is also going to “move away from <em>D&amp;D</em>” and start a new project.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/22/24108773/baldurs-gate-3-larian-dungeons-and-dragons">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Cross-saves for Baldur’s Gate 3 on Xbox are working again.</p><p>Xbox didn’t get <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s most recent updates due to a bug that caused the game to crash on the Series X / S. This <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1765680398414041480?s=20">prevented players</a> from loading cross-saves on platforms with the update.</p><p>But now, <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1769730558878163264?s=20">Larian has announced</a> that hotfixes #20, #21, <em>and</em> #22 are coming to Xbox, which should fix any issues with syncing game saves. The latest update also addresses some crashes and issues with Minthara’s dialogue.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Things are about to get real weird in Faerun.</p><p>Larian Studios keeps giving the people what they want with each <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> update.

But there’s one ask from the <em>BG3</em> community that Larian’s director of publishing says is coming soon: official mod support.</p><p>With mod support, patches to the game are less likely to break mods and it’ll be easier overall to make mods for the game. Prime opportunity for some freaky, frightening, or just plain fun additions to the game.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Baldur’s Gate 3 just dropped its belated Valentine’s Day gift.</p><p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/baldursgate3/status/1755980870664466761">Larian promised</a>, this latest patch is absolutely <em>crammed</em> full of new content and bug fixes for the game.

The RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 will follow that with their own releases in February, but some are already getting a sneak peek at the GPUs’ software benefits through DLSS 4.</p><p>Tom Warren’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark"><em>Verge</em> review</a> of the $1,999 RTX 5090 indicates it’s expectedly a powerhouse, but not quite the generational leap that the RTX 4090 was over its own predecessor.

This latest version of DLSS uses AI to predictively generate frames, making it possible to run games at higher resolutions without taking the same framerate hit they would without DLSS 4 turned on.

Nvidia has switched to housing the RTX 5090 inside a smaller bone-shaped gray cardboard shell that sits inside a much larger brown cardboard box.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24347693/nvidia-rtx-5090-vs-rtx-4090-design-fans-hardware">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTk0NA==" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24339760/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-photos">Up close with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 FE, an incredibly compact flagship video card</a></h2><div><p><cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p>We might be skeptical of some of Nvidia’s claims, like whether a $549 RTX 5070 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338999/nvidia-rtx-5070-vs-rtx4090-performance-price">will truly deliver the performance of a $1599 RTX 4090</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tv-reviews/24350444/mythic-quest-season-4-review-apple-tv-plus<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Mythic Quest</em>’s ability to spin some of the gaming industry’s ugliest aspects into genuinely funny comedy was what made it such <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21128489/mythic-quest-ravens-banquet-review-apple-tv">a surprising delight when it first hit Apple TV Plus back in 2020</a>. Even when it was joking about chaotic streamers or Nazi server takeovers, you could feel the respect <em>Mythic Quest</em>’s creative team <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21177373/ashly-burch-interview-mythic-quest">has for video games as an art form</a>. And by keeping its focus on the lives of people who actually dream up and build games, the series put itself in a position to tell poignant stories about the costs that come with chasing one’s dreams.</p><p><em>Mythic Quest</em>’s new fourth season still gets in its fair share of solid digs at gaming culture. But the show feels like even more of a character-driven narrative that’s trying to show you how every member of the MQ crew is evolving as they move deeper into their careers. <em>Mythic Quest </em>has always had a knack for switching up its relationships and power dynamics just enough to keep its office drama element feeling fresh yet familiar. This time around, though, the shuffling is all in service of giving everyone at Mythic Quest HQ a new (but not necessarily healthier) work-life balance.</p><p>While an unhealthy amount of dysfunction has always been part of Ian Grimm’s (Rob McElhenney) creative process, <em>Mythic Quest</em>’s fourth season finds him trying to be a better colleague and friend to all of the people who have helped bring his ideas to life. It’s still a little hard for Ian to remember that Poppy Li’s (Charlotte Nicdao) return to Mythic Quest Studios with him hinged on his respecting her personal boundaries and acknowledging her as an equal in their professional relationship. Ian also can’t stand how much time Poppy wants to spend with her new artist boyfriend Storm (Chase Yi). But everyone working on Mythic Quest (the fictional game) can feel how, after years of blowing up at one another, Poppy and Ian are in a new headspace where they can genuinely appreciate how they make each other stronger. </p><p>With Mythic Quest gearing up to launch a new Playpen update giving players the ability to create their own in-game content, executive producer David Hornsby (David Brittlesbee) and monetization head Rachel Meyee (Ashly Burch) are all too happy to have Ian and Poppy onboard cooking up ideas to make the feature shine. As the creator of <em>Cozy Galaxy</em>, the most popular game on the Playpen platform, former-tester-turned-developer Dana Bryant (Imani Hakim) can’t help feeling ticked at the way she’s being cut out of all the revenue Mythic Quest is raking in. But to money shark Brad Bakshi (Danny Pudi) and cutthroat assistant Jo (Jessie Ennis), Dana’s feelings about working at Mythic Quest Studios are a sign that it’s time for them to reconsider whose team they want to play for.</p><p>Like previous seasons, <em>Mythic Quest</em>’s new episodes use the fictional in-show game to dunk on uglier aspects of the real-world gaming industry with a specificity that makes it feel like the writers room has been keeping up with the news. Playpen’s popularity is a financial boon to the Mythic Quest team because of how it presents an opportunity to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/18/24346862/genshin-impact-developer-20-million-fine-ftc-data-lootboxes">roll out more in-game currencies</a>. It also raises serious questions about whether platforms like Playpen are built with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/4/24121420/roblox-child-exploitation-robux-child-labor">the intention of capitalizing on child labor</a>.</p><p>Those questions become even thornier as players start coming up with ways to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-director-thinks-mods-breathe-l%5B%E2%80%A6%5Dus-request-to-please-not-give-cait-sith-a-dump-truck-ass">bring sex into their Playpen creations</a>. But even though this season of <em>Mythic Quest </em>gets its dunks in on the larger gaming industry, the show spends more time focusing on the growing pains that come when interpersonal relationships start to change for the better.</p><p>You can see it most clearly in Ian and Poppy’s arc this season as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339070/mythic-quest-season-4-trailer">the two turn to AI assistants</a> to help work through their complicated feelings about one another, but it’s also highlighted in some of the season’s episodes — one of which is an excellent <em>Clue </em>riff — that take you outside of the Mythic Quest office. We see more of what David gets up to in his free time and how the evolution of Dana and Rachel’s careers has brought new tensions into their romance. And with so many of his colleagues (who are really his only friends) pairing off, this season underscores how Ian’s prickliness with other people stems from the fact that he doesn’t have anyone to come home to.</p><p>Though digging deeper into everyone’s personal lives and easing up on the workplace shenanigans doesn’t quite move <em>Mythic Quest </em>into straight dramatic territory, it does make this season feel like you’re meant to appreciate how far these characters (and a few other surprise cameos) have come since we first met them. This season’s video game jokes aren’t <em>quite </em>as scathing as some viewers might like, but they reinforce how Mythic Quest (the game) has become something much more than another fantasy MMORPG for both its players and creators — just as Apple seems intent on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296445/mythic-quest-season-4-premiere-date-side-quest">growing the show in similar ways</a>.</p><p><em>Mythic Quest </em>also stars Naomi Ekperigin, Andrew Friedman, and Michael Naughton. Season 4 hits Apple TV Plus on January 29th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
