            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/31/23433526/netflix-spry-fox-cozy-gaming-studio-acquisition">Netflix first acquired cozy game developer Spry Fox in 2022</a>, it made a lot of sense. The studio had been around for over a decade and had several hits with mobile games like <em>Triple Town</em> and <em>Alphabear.</em> That approachable style of puzzle game seemed like a good fit for Netflix’s mobile-first strategy, and, as Spry Fox cofounder David Edery tells me, the partnership also meant that the team could focus on making the experiences they wanted to build without having to worry about monetization. “We just never were that good at making money from our games,” Edery explains.</p><p>Now, three years later, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837632/another-change-for-netflixs-games">Spry Fox is once again independent</a> after buying itself out from Netflix. The news comes as the streaming service’s fledgling gaming efforts are shifting, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/820289/netflix-casual-party-game-multiplayer-tetris-pictionary">a focus on TV-based games</a> as opposed to mobile titles. Even studios behind successful games, like <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/806303/netflix-squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-entertainment-studio-shut-down">have been shuttered</a> as part of the changes. But for Spry Fox, the decision to separate from Netflix was done for a different reason: to reach as large an audience as possible with the studio’s upcoming MMO <a href="https://playspiritcrossing.com/"><em>Spirit Crossing</em></a>.</p><p>“At some point, I increasingly became concerned about the fact that being a Netflix member-only game was a real issue for it,” Edery explains. “It’s a highly social game. People want to be able to play with their friends. If their friends are not Netflix members, that’s kind of a problem.”</p><p><em>Spirit Crossing</em> is a large-scale multiplayer game about fostering friendship and community in a fantastical and adorable world. It’s the biggest experience the studio has ever made, but also feels like a natural progression; after achieving success with those early mobile titles, Spry Fox pushed further into the so-called “cozy” genre with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22352488/cozy-grove-review-apple-arcade-switch-ps4-xbox-steam">the <em>Animal Crossing</em>-style series <em>Cozy Grove</em></a>. While those games are single-player, <em>Spirit Crossing</em> aims to do something similar but in a virtual world filled with lots of players. The goal is ambitious. “We genuinely believe this is our chance to reduce loneliness in the world,” says Edery. “That’s the sum total of everything that we care about.”</p><p>Development on <em>Spirit Crossing</em> predates the Netflix deal, and in fact represents something of a brief history of indie game funding over the last few years. The game’s initial prototype began life as an exclusive for Google’s Stadia streaming service. After <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond">Stadia’s high-profile implosion</a>, Spry Fox retained ownership of the project, and eventually <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epicgames.com%2Fsite%2Fen-US%2Fnews%2Fepic-games-announces-publishing-partnerships-with-eyes-out-and-spry-fox" rel="sponsored">Epic picked up the game</a> as part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195152/epic-games-publishing-label-control-last-guardian-inside">its relatively new publishing initiative</a>.</p><div><p>“We genuinely believe this is our chance to reduce loneliness in the world.”</p></div><p>“That was great because they were very supportive and they gave us a big budget,” Edery says of working with Epic. “And then the Netflix thing kind of came out of nowhere. I wasn’t looking to be acquired at the time, and I certainly didn’t think it would be Netflix of all companies, but they came by and it seemed like a good idea for a few different reasons.”</p><div><p>From the outside, Netflix’s efforts in gaming have seemed chaotic. The company has tried everything from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645952/black-mirror-game-thronglets-season-7-netflix">games based on its shows</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276700/netflix-gaming-studio-closure-blue">building a AAA studio</a> without much success. Last year at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview">Netflix’s president of games, Alain Tascan, outlined a new plan</a> focused on specific types of games, including what he called “mainstream” titles aimed at large audiences, of which <em>Spirit Crossing</em> was shown as an example. Of late, however, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/845965/netflix-fifa-soccer-football-game-tv-delphi-interactive-world-cup">Netflix seems mostly focused on cloud-based games played on TVs instead of phones</a>.</p></div><p>Despite all of that, Edery says the team at Spry Fox wasn’t impacted much by Netflix’s changing priorities. “We were essentially brought in to make and launch <em>Spirit Crossing</em>,” he says. “We just kept doing what we were doing, so I think we were less affected by changes than maybe other folks internally would have been. We had a pretty clear vision and, for better or worse, we weren’t going to be steered off of that.”</p><p>Edery says that at each stage, from Stadia to Netflix, <em>Spirit Crossing</em> grew in scope and ambition. And eventually it became clear that a game built around connecting as many people as possible didn’t fit so snugly in Netflix’s plans, which limit the platforms a game can launch on. Edery notes that <em>Cozy Grove</em>, for example, was most successful on the Nintendo Switch, where cozy games are very popular. “Not being able to be on the Switch is a real limitation, possibly a really problematic limitation,” he says of <em>Spirit Crossing</em>.</p><div><p>“Not being able to be on the Switch is a real limitation”</p></div><p>So the split from Netflix was done in the best interest of the game; while a Switch version has yet to be announced, <em>Spirit Crossing</em> will be coming to PC in addition to the iPhone and Android. And there’s still a partnership with Netflix in place, as the mobile version will still be free and exclusive to subscribers. “It still has to make sense for Netflix,” Edery notes. But there are obvious risks involved in going independent, and already the team is making sacrifices. <a href="https://spryfox.com/a-16-year-old-baby-is-born-miracles-do-happen/">Edery says that he and fellow cofounder Daniel Cook have reduced their salaries to $20,000 a year</a>.</p><p>The majority of development on <em>Spirit Crossing</em> was finished during the three years Spry Fox was under the Netflix umbrella, and the team expects to launch the game this year. (<a href="https://playspiritcrossing.com/">You can currently sign up to play an alpha of the game</a>.) Even before <em>Spirit Crossing</em> launches, Spry Fox’s long journey back to independence represents a rare positive story in an industry plagued with layoffs, cancellations, and studio closures. But there’s one big thing the team still has left to do, and it’s not something Edery is looking forward to: “We have to figure out how to make money now.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/868711/spry-fox-netflix-game-studio-indie-spirit-crossing]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[The promise and peril of a new online shooter]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/868558/highguard-online-shooters</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The routine is familiar by now. A new online shooter with bright, colorful graphics launches and rockets up the charts despite the fact that you maybe haven’t even heard of it. Or maybe it just has a really forgettable name. But everyone seems to be talking about it, and it’s free, so you figure you may as well jump in. This moment of promise and anticipation may end up being the best this game will ever be — and there’s a good chance that feeling won’t last long.</p><p>I could be describing any number of games, but the most recent example is <em>Highguard</em>, which just launched on the PS5, Xbox, and Steam. The 3v3 shooter is the first release from Wildlight Entertainment, a new studio made up of veterans from <em>Apex Legends</em>, <em>Titanfall</em>, and <em>Call of Duty</em>. That pedigree is enough to pay some attention to the game, which was originally revealed as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/841973/the-game-awards-2025-annoucements-news-trailers/archives/2">the final announcement at The Game Awards last month</a>. But it’s also doing some interesting things. The developers call it a “raid shooter,” but I’ve found it easiest to understand as a sort of first-person shooter take on a MOBA like <em>League of Legends</em>; each team has a base, and your job is to balance getting improved gear, protecting your own base, and completing various objectives to take down your enemies’ HQ. Also, you can ride a bear.</p><p>It’s a complicated setup, and after a few matches I’m not entirely convinced I fully understand the flow of matches, which could be a problem for wider adoption. It’s certainly not as pick-up-and-play as something like <em>Fortnite</em>. Though as you’d expect from people who worked on <em>Titanfall</em>, the action feels great, with excellent gunplay and smooth movement. It’s also a hero shooter, so you pick from characters with <em>Overwatch</em>-style ultimate powers that can let you quickly turn a battle in your favor, or smash through your opponents’ defenses. They can be a lot of fun when you pull them off properly.</p><p>When you’re in the midst of a tight skirmish, defending your teammates while they try to defuse a bomb, the appeal of <em>Highguard</em> is apparent. At its best it’s fast and tense and forces you to be decisive. But its complex nature also means that things can feel a little strange and messy. For one thing, the team sizes are small yet the maps are large, and so you spend a good chunk of each match wandering around a mostly empty level searching for chests to improve your armor or find a better gun. You do have a mount to speed this up, but even still, I’ve found the early portions of matches to be incredibly slow and not very exciting.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">As the ill-fated <em>Concord</em> showed</a>, the most important thing for a new online shooter is what it does differently, although even that isn’t a guarantee of success. But you need a hook to compete in a space with such established players as <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Counter-Strike</em>, and the annualized behemoth that is <em>Call of Duty</em>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/795232/ea-battlefield-6-hit-launch-deal"><em>Battlefield 6</em> managed to break through with sheer force of will</a>, while the likes of <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Helldivers 2</em>, and <em>Apex Legends</em> have settled into a seemingly steady place where they aren’t the biggest games, but they have a strong, healthy player base. But the list of failures is also large: <em>Anthem</em>, <em>Spectre Divide</em>, <em>XDefiant</em>, <em>Spellbreak</em>, just to name a few. Many had interesting hooks — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/29/23187883/activision-blizzard-spellbreak-acquisition-battle-royale-world-of-warcraft">It’s <em>Fortnite </em>but fantasy!</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24211078/spectre-divide-preview-mountaintop-fps-game">You can control two bodies at once!</a> — but it wasn’t enough.</p><p>As much fun as I’m having with <em>Highguard </em>during the launch week, I’m also not convinced that its strategic matches, slick gunplay, and oddball fantasy setting are enough for lasting success in such a competitive space. It’s different, but not <em>that</em> different, and it can be hard to explain what it really is. The odds are certainly against it. So for now I’ll just enjoy the experience while it lasts — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/864146/bungie-marathon-release-date-march-5th-price">and be ready to do this all over again in March</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/868558/highguard-online-shooters]]></content:encoded>
