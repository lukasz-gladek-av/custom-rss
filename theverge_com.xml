            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350223/pokemon-tcg-pocket-time-space-smackdown-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The latest batch of new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248306/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hands-on"><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em></a><em> </em>cards finally has a concrete release date, but it seems like you won’t be able to trade them right off the bat.</p><p>The Pokémon Company <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/New-Pokemon-Trading-Card-Game-Pocket-Trade-Feature-and-Space-Time-Smac">announced today</a> that Space-Time Smackdown, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s latest expansion, is set to debut at the end of the month right after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345484/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-january-launch">the game’s trading feature launches</a> on January 29th. While <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319498/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-release-date">cards from the last set</a> could all be obtained from a single type of pack, Space-Time Smackdown — which includes a number of monsters from <em>Pokémon Diamond </em>/ <em>Pearl </em>/ <em>Platinum </em>— will come from packs featuring the legendary Pokémon Dialga and Palkia.</p><p>Along with Space-Time Smackdown’s announcement, TCPi also revealed a bit more about how the trading mechanic will involve two new types of in-game currencies — trade houseglasses and trade tokens. It seems as if there will be cooldown periods as well as a cost if you want to swap cards from Pocket’s Genetic Apex and Mythical Island sets with other players. But there will <em>definitely </em>be some waiting involved for people hoping to trade Space-Time Smackdown, which will not be tradeable until a later date after it drops on January 30th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
