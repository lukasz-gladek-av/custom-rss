But in Australia, one woman has <em>already</em> created a more amazing version. <a href="https://nataliethenerd.com/">Natalie the Nerd</a>, the self-taught circuit board designer and Game Boy modder <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/757662/natalie-the-nerd-transparent-translucent-game-boy-pcb">whose gorgeous transparent Game Boy</a> we featured in August, is doing what Nintendo and Lego didn’t: make it playable.</p><p>Let me be clear: this is <em>not </em>an emulator. Natalie did <em>not</em> stuff a Raspberry Pi in here. It’s far more impressive than that. What you’re seeing are real Game Boy cartridges, running on real Game Boy chips, soldered to a real circuit board of Natalie’s own creation. Working buttons, too.</p><p>To fit it into the Lego Game Boy, she had to create a complete Game Boy board smaller than a Game Boy cartridge itself — so she did. Adding “the smallest screen kit on the market” did require removing a few bricks, though, she tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>It’s not complete — not just yet. The working buttons, for instance, aren’t yet mounted on a PCB; she tells <em>The Verge</em> they’ll fit on a custom 3D-printed Lego piece.</p><p>She’s already wired up USB-C for power:</p><p>And here’s a look at the insides and where they live:</p><p>Now, to answer your obvious question: is this a one-off, or something you might be able to do yourself? The chances are good that you might if you’re skilled! <a href="https://nataliethenerd.com/collections/all">Natalie sells</a> aftermarket components for Game Boy modding, <a href="https://wiki.nataliethenerd.com/">shares circuit board designs</a>, and is planning to share this too. “I am going to release it once I am happy with it,” <a href="https://x.com/natalie_thenerd/status/1973447754170118279">she writes</a> on X.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/790093/lego-game-boy-natalie-the-nerd]]></content:encoded>
