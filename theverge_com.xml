            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve just announced the Steam Frame, a new standalone VR headset that can both stream games from a PC and play games locally thanks to an onboard Arm chip. The headset is quite a bit different from Valve’s previous model, the Index, which had to be tethered to a gaming computer with a physical wire. But it also stands out from a lot of other major VR headsets on the market right now, like the Meta Quest 3, Samsung Galaxy XR, and Apple Vision Pro.</p><p>A big way the Frame separates itself from the pack is its focus on streaming your games. That’s all made possible thanks to a wireless dongle that comes with every Frame: plug it into your PC, and you can stream both your flat and VR games to the headset over a low-latency connection. I got to try the streaming for myself at Valve’s headquarters while playing <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>, and I didn’t notice any discernible lag.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Category</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Frame</h3></th><th><h3>Meta Quest 3</h3></th><th><h3>Apple Vision Pro</h3></th><th><h3>Samsung Galaxy XR</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Colors</td><td>Black</td><td>White</td><td>Silver</td><td>Silver</td></tr><tr><td>Weight (grams)</td><td>185g (core unit), 440g (with head strap that adds audio and rear battery)</td><td>515g</td><td>750–800g (depending on light seal and headband configuration)</td><td>545g, though weight may vary if you wear the light shield or not</td></tr><tr><td>OS</td><td>SteamOS</td><td>Meta Horizon OS</td><td>visionOS</td><td>Android XR</td></tr><tr><td>Lenses</td><td>Pancake</td><td>Pancake</td><td>Pancake</td><td>Pancake</td></tr><tr><td>Screen type</td><td>LCD</td><td>LCD</td><td>micro-OLED</td><td>micro-OLED</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution</td><td>2160 x 2160 per eye</td><td>2064 x 2208 per eye</td><td>3660 x 3200 per eye</td><td>4K per eye</td></tr><tr><td>Refresh rate</td><td>72-144Hz refresh rate (144Hz experimental)</td><td>72Hz, 90Hz, 120Hz</td><td>90Hz, 96Hz, 100Hz, 120Hz</td><td>60Hz, 72Hz (default), up to 90Hz</td></tr><tr><td>Processor</td><td>Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</td><td>Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2</td><td>Apple M5 chip</td><td>Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2</td></tr><tr><td>FOV</td><td>Up to 110 degrees</td><td>Up to 100 degrees horizontal and 96 degrees vertical</td><td>Estimated to be about 100 degrees</td><td>109 degrees horizontal and 100 degrees vertical</td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>16GB unified LPDDR5 RAM</td><td>8GB</td><td>16GB, reportedly</td><td>16GB</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>256GB / 1TB UFS storage options, microSD card slot</td><td>512GB</td><td>256GB, 512GB, 1TB</td><td>256GB</td></tr><tr><td>Connectivity</td><td>Wi-Fi 7, includes dedicated Wi-Fi 6E adapter for low-latency streaming games</td><td>Wi-Fi 6E</td><td>Wi‑Fi 6</td><td>Wi-Fi 7</td></tr><tr><td>Tracking, passthrough, and sensors</td><td>4 outward-facing monochrome cameras forcontroller and headset tracking, 2 interior cameras for eye tracking, outward IR illuminator</td><td>2 RGB cameras with 18 PPD for full-color passthrough</td><td>2 high‑resolution main cameras, 6 world‑facing tracking cameras, 4 eye‑tracking cameras, TrueDepth camera, LiDAR Scanner, 4 inertial measurement units (IMUs), flicker sensor, ambient light sensor</td><td>2 high-resolution passthrough cameras, 6 world-facing tracking cameras, 4 eye-tracking cameras, 5 Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), depth sensor, flicker sensor</td></tr><tr><td>Eye tracking</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Battery capacity</td><td>21.6Wh</td><td>19.44Wh</td><td>Up to 2.5 hours of “general use”</td><td>Up to 2 hours of “general usage”</td></tr><tr><td>Starting price</td><td>TBA</td><td>$499.99</td><td>$3,499.00</td><td>$1,799.99</td></tr><tr><td>Availability</td><td>Early 2026</td><td>October 2023</td><td>October 2025</td><td>October 2025</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>You can also play games right on the Frame itself because Valve has gotten SteamOS working on Arm; the headset is equipped with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip. Other headsets can play games locally, too — typically games built specifically for their respective platforms. But the Frame is actually able to run Windows x86 code and recompile it in real time using an emulator, meaning that a vast amount of the Steam library will be playable directly on the headset without you or any developers having to do anything.</p><p>That said, you shouldn’t expect to be able to play high-end games locally on the Frame. Valve designer Lawrence Yang tells <em>The Verge</em> that developers should target lower performance than they would for a game on Steam Deck. The Frame’s real-time emulation could affect performance; while playing <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> and <em>Hades II</em> on the headset, both of which are relatively lower-end games, I saw some stutters that I never see on my Steam Deck. (According to Valve hardware engineer Jeremy Selan, this was a bug and the company expects to make improvements leading up to and after launch.)</p><div><div><p id="got-any-burning-questions-about-valves-new-hardware"><h2>Got any burning questions about Valve’s new hardware?</h2></p></div><div><blockquote><p>We’re holding a subscriber-exclusive AMA today, November 12th, at 3PM ET.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Valve won’t talk <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818313/valve-has-no-news-about-a-steam-deck-2">about a Steam Deck 2</a>. It probably wants to keep the attention on its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">just-announced living room console</a>, comfy new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">controller</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">Arm-based headset</a> instead. But now that the company is preparing to sell an Arm headset, one that can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818672/valve-android-apps-steam-frame">even run Android apps</a>, there’s an obvious question. Is Arm a one-off experiment for Valve, or might it power future SteamOS hardware?</p></div><p>Valve software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais makes it sound like the sky’s the limit. I don’t want to oversell what he said — he was excited about the <em>potential</em>, not any specific devices, and you’ll see that in more context when we publish the interview later this week.</p><p>But when I ask whether he thinks there’ll be other SteamOS devices with Arm chips, he says the answer is yes, and that he’s excited about it.</p><p>“I think that it paves the way for a bunch of different, maybe ultraportables, maybe more powerful laptops being Arm-based,” he begins. “Handhelds, there’s a lot of potential for Arm, of course, and one might see desktop chips as well at some point in the Arm world.” I immediately think about how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678000/nvidia-arm-gaming-laptop-mediatek-alienware">Nvidia reportedly has an Arm-powered gaming laptop coming</a>, and how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/785068/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-x2-elite-and-extreme-for-windows-pcs#:~:text=Razer%E2%80%99s%20Min%2DLiang%20Tan">Razer showed up</a> at Qualcomm’s last coming-out party for laptop chips.</p><p>“We’ll keep greasing the wheels, so to speak, so that SteamOS can work on a wider variety of Arm devices, but also so that the catalog becomes more reliable there in terms of compatibility and performance,” says Griffais.</p><div><div><p id="got-any-burning-questions-about-valves-new-hardware"><h2>Got any burning questions about Valve’s new hardware?</h2></p></div><div><blockquote><p>We’re holding a subscriber-exclusive AMA today, November 12th, at 3PM ET.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve has just announced the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">Steam Frame</a>, its new VR headset that can play games streamed directly from your PC using a dedicated streaming stick <em>and</em> run Windows games locally thanks to an Arm chip in the headset itself. At the same time, Valve is also moving on from its previous VR headset, the Valve Index, which it’s “no longer manufacturing,” designer Lawrence Yang tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>The Index, a high-end headset that had to be tethered to your PC to work and used external “lighthouse” base stations for tracking, was released in 2019. In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19102584/valve-index-steamvr-headset-review-shipping-today">her review</a>, my colleague Adi Robertson praised its visuals and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/28/18639084/valve-index-steamvr-headset-knuckles-controllers-preview">its controllers</a>, though dinged it for its $999 cost.</p><p>But corded headsets have also fallen out of favor since then. Meta has sold <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/28/23619730/meta-vr-oculus-ar-glasses-smartwatch-plans">tens of millions</a> of its standalone Quest VR headsets that can play games without a PC connection and track your position without extra base stations. Even more expensive headsets like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/807963/apple-vision-pro-m5-review-specs-release-date">Apple Vision Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/802299/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-price-release-date">Samsung’s Galaxy XR</a> have taken the standalone approach.</p><p>The Frame isn’t exactly a sequel to the Index. But it does improve upon the older headset with some of its specs; the Index’s LCD screens have 1440 x 1600 per-eye resolution, while the Frame offers 2160 x 2160 per eye, for example. If you like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/28/18639084/valve-index-steamvr-headset-knuckles-controllers-preview">Index’s “Knuckles” controllers</a> and how you can strap them right onto your hand, you’ll be able to buy optional straps for the Frame’s controllers so you can do the same thing.</p><p>And Valve is extremely confident in the Frame’s 6GHz wireless streaming adapter as a replacement for a physical cord. In our brief demos at Valve HQ, the streaming worked extremely well.</p><p>This may be the end for Valve’s lighthouse base stations, which were actually first released in 2016 with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/5/11358618/htc-vive-vr-review">the HTC Vive</a>. If you’ve got lighthouse base stations set up in your home already, don’t expect to use them with the Frame anytime soon, if ever.</p><p>“With Steam Frame, we’re not working on lighthouse support for it,” Yang says. Instead of sweeping a room with lasers like the lighthouses, the Frame currently uses four monochrome cameras and IR illuminators to determine its position in 3D space, though it also has a modular accessory port that could support additional cameras.</p><div><div><p id="got-any-burning-questions-about-valves-new-hardware"><h2>Got any burning questions about Valve’s new hardware?</h2></p></div><div><blockquote><p>We’re holding a subscriber-exclusive AMA today, November 12th, at 3PM ET.

Since 2022, Griffais <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499215/valve-steam-deck-interview-late-2022">has consistently</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884863/valve-steam-deck-2-refresh-upgrade-cpu-2025">told us</a> that Valve wants to see a significant leap in performance and efficiency before it takes the plunge. “We really do want to wait for a generational leap in compute without sacrificing battery life before we ship the real second generation of Steam Deck,” is how Valve’s Lawrence Yang concisely <a href="https://www.reviews.org/au/games/valve-steam-deck-australia-interview/">reiterated it to <em>Reviews.org</em></a> in 2024.</p><p>The question now is: Will Valve find that leap in performance and efficiency from x86?

Griffais tells me he thinks Arm has “a lot of potential” in future handhelds someday.</p><p>Valve tells us the Frame has a lower performance target than the nearly four-year-old Steam Deck, so it would need a far more potent Arm chip to power such a handheld.
