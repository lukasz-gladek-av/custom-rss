            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo just announced the two leads of its live-action <em>Legend of Zelda</em> film, and unlike the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690607/chris-pratt-mario-nintendo-illumination-animated-movie-december-2022-release-date-cast">celebrity-packed <em>Mario</em> movie cast</a>, <em>Zelda</em> will star <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/708143/nintendo-zelda-movie-casting-bo-bragason-benjamin-evan-ainsworth">two young, lesser-known actors</a>: Bo Bragason as Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link. You may not have heard of them, but there’s a good chance they’re going to be a part of the franchise for a while.</p><p>Choosing stars who are in their teens (Ainsworth) and early 20s (Bragason) makes a lot of sense. In the games, even the “older” Links and Zeldas are still typically young adults, so Bragason and Ainsworth seem like they’ll fit the mold. (Yes, I know Link and Zelda are technically older than 100 in <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom,</em> but they look good for their age.) The choice of younger actors gives them both room to grow into the roles in any potential sequels — which, given Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/671949/nintendo-switch-2-era-risks">growing ambitions beyond video games</a>, the company must already be starting to consider.</p><p>We can look at Nintendo’s recent expansion of Mario beyond games as an example of what might be in store for <em>Zelda</em>. <em>The Super Mario Bros. </em>movie, which was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review">surprisingly good</a>, quickly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/1/23695720/nintendo-mario-movie-billion-box-office">surpassed $1 billion at the box office</a>, and a sequel is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/10/24096213/super-mario-bros-movie-2-sequel-2026">set to debut in 2026</a>. A <em>Donkey Kong</em> spinoff <a href="https://www.theverge.com/analysis/706610/donkey-kong-movie-copyright-notice-nintendo-strategy">might also be in the works</a>. Both franchises are featured in Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan">theme</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24293604/super-nintendo-world-theme-park-donkey-kong-country-osaka-date">parks</a>, too. It’s not hard to imagine Nintendo applying the same blueprint for the Zelda franchise.</p><p>The <em>Zelda</em> movie has the potential to be a similarly huge hit. The franchise is arguably as popular as it has ever been; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a> was the fourth-best-selling game on the original Switch, after all, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a> was an excellent followup. If this first <em>Zelda</em> film is even halfway decent, Bragason and Ainsworth might be representative of Zelda and Link for an entire generation of fans.</p><p>The two aren’t complete unknowns – Ainsworth voiced Pinocchio in Disney’s 2022 version of the film and played a major role in Netflix’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21508362/haunting-of-bly-manor-review-netflix"><em>The Haunting of Bly Manor</em></a> – but Nintendo is still taking a gamble by hinging a potentially risky adaptation on them. They’ll likely be in good hands with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23951339/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-live-action-nintendo">Wes Ball as director</a>, though, who is known for his work directing the <em>Maze Runner</em> trilogy and <em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em>.</p><p>Nintendo is borrowing from a proven strategy here. Warner Bros. recently introduced its <em>second</em> trio of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/674752/hbo-harry-potter-cast-dominic-mclaughlin-arabella-stanton-alastair-stout">young leads for <em>Harry Potter</em></a>, and they’ll be the faces of a new decade-long series for HBO, much like Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint were before them for the <em>Harry Potter</em> films. Netflix has similarly stuck with the <em>Stranger Things</em> kids <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707540/stranger-things-5-teaser-trailer-netflix">all the way through the end</a>, even though the first season debuted nearly 10 years ago.</p><p><em>The Legend of Zelda</em> film could be Nintendo’s next breakout cultural moment when it debuts <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682751/legend-of-zelda-live-action-movie-date-delay">in May 2027</a>. If it is, we’ll probably be seeing a lot more adventures starring Zelda and Link.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/708494/nintendo-the-legend-of-zelda-movie-leads-stars-long-time]]></content:encoded>
