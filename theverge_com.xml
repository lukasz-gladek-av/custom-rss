            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/675808/nintendo-switch-2-hori-accessory-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/cameron-faulkner">Cameron Faulkner</a> <span>is an editor covering deals and commerce. He joined in 2018, and served as commerce editor at Polygon until May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you, like me, have begun to pick out accessories for your Switch 2 before it arrives on June 5th, here’s a money-saving tip: a handful of Hori’s upcoming accessories are at least 30 percent off at Amazon. My favorite (and arguably the most stylish) among the bunch is the Puff Pouch carrying case. Its design evokes the look of a puffy jacket, if not quite to the level of premium puffiness of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FmppnElGjvk">Apple’s zip-up case for the Vision Pro headset</a>.</p><p>The Puff Pouch zips open and shut, with a handle on one of its long sides. It boasts room for the console, up to six game cartridges, and extra accessories, like a small battery, the power brick, or a webcam. Even though there’s a Switch 2 logo patch embroidered into the pouch’s fabric, there’s nothing stopping you from using it with an original Switch instead. That’ll be our little secret. Originally priced at $44.99, this case is $29.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pouch-Black-Carrying-Nintendo-Switch-2/dp/B0F63YT3C9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and comes out June 16th.</p><p>For an extra $5 (totaling to $34.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HORI-Adventure-Pack-Black-Shoulder-Officially/dp/B0F63VZ6N2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>), you might prefer Hori’s Switch 2 crossbody shoulder bag. It offers a similar amount of storage capacity to the Puff Pouch, and can also be used to tote the Switch 2, or any of the original Switch models. As an alternative to wearing the bag, you can also carry it by hand with its strap. This one comes out June 30th.</p><p>The last (for now) discounted Hori product is its Dual USB PlayStand, a small USB hub that gives your console more ports for accessories, much like the TV dock does. It has two USB-A ports for controllers, plus a USB-C port in case you want to keep your Switch 2 charged as you play. Normally $69.99 (whew, that’s costly), it’s selling at a more reasonable (but still pretty steep) $39.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HORI-Dual-PlayStand-Nintendo-Switch-2/dp/B0F63VJ13M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. This product also releases on June 30th.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/675923/black-panther-cancelled-cliffhanger-studios-shut-down-ea<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>EA’s Black Panther game has been canceled. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-studios">According to reporting from <em>IGN</em></a>, EA announced the news via an email to employees. IGN also reports that as a result of the cancellation, Cliffhanger Games has been shut down.</p><p>Cliffhanger Games <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/meet-cliffhanger-games">was a new game studio</a> created to develop <em>Black Panther</em> and run by Kevin Stephens, who was the studio head for the now shuttered<em> Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</em> developer Monolith Productions. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/10/23787287/ea-black-panther-game-single-player">Beyond an initial announcement in 2023</a>, all that was known of <em>Black Panther</em> was that it was a single-player game with an original narrative and developed in collaboration with Marvel Games. EA and Marvel announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/31/23432986/ea-disney-marvel-iron-man-three-new-games-collaboration">a three-game partnership deal in 2022</a>. In addition to <em>Black Panther</em>, the other two games in the deal were an Iron Man title <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/20/23363085/ea-marvel-iron-man-game-motive-studio">currently in production at Motive Studio</a> and an unannounced action game.</p><p>According to IGN, the cancellation comes with layoffs in other sectors of EA’s business. The publisher recently announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/667441/ea-return-to-office-work-hybrid">an RTO mandate</a> requiring employees come in at least three days a week, and a round of layoffs occurred earlier this year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/658468/ea-layoffs-respawn-entertainment-titanfall-canceled">impacting between 300 and 400 employees</a>. <em>The Verge</em> has reached out to EA for comment.</p><p>The game’s cancellation does not spell the end for the hope of a Black Panther-led title. Over at Skydance New Media, Amy Hennig and team are working on <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/666270/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-2026">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a></em>, which features Captain America and Black Panther as playable characters.</p><p><em><strong>Correction, May 28th: </strong>An earlier version of this story misstated the names of the developers involved. It has been corrected.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
