            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/24/24302297/nintendo-switch-pro-controller-black-friday-2024-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo recently announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294698/nintendo-switch-black-friday-discounts-games-controllers-holiday-sale">a batch of Black Friday deals</a>, all of which run through November 30th. This includes a steep discount on the <strong>Nintendo Switch Pro Controller</strong>, which drops it to an all-time low of $49.99 ($20 off) at <a href="https://howl.link/omm6z5optv67g">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fgaming-accessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-wireless-pro-controller---black%2F349481.html">GameStop</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-pro-controller%2F-%2FA-52180631%23lnk%3Dsametab">Target</a>. This is one of the more notable Black Friday discounts from Nintendo this year — that is, aside from the current promo on <a href="https://howl.link/8sph2j3w4vl68"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a> and <a href="https://howl.link/anfm53kkpq2qk">Nintendo’s latest Switch OLED bundle</a> — namely because the Pro Controller rarely goes on sale, even today.</p><p>Although there are many great third-party gamepads available, the Switch Pro Controller remains the best all-around controller for Nintendo’s aging console. It’s much more comfortable to use a full-size controller than a pair of Joy-Cons for extended hours, and its larger sticks are far more accurate. It also features a proper D-pad instead of four individual buttons and parity with Nintendo’s Joy-Con controllers, meaning you get gyro controls, HD rumble, and Amiibo support.</p><div><p>The Switch Pro released alongside the Switch console in 2017, and it’s a tough controller to beat. It offers an unmatched set of features (HD rumble, motion controls, NFC), and it’s one of the most comfortable Switch controllers out there.</p></div><p>Other controllers, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23350899/nintendo-switch-controllers-best-wireless-joy-con-gamepad#:~:text=AT%20BEST%20BUY-,The%20best%20Xbox%2Dstyle%20controller%20for%20the%20Switch,-GuliKit%20KingKong%202">Gulikit’s King Kong series</a>, have some of these features and one-up the Pro Controller with drift-free Hall effect sticks and some customizability. However, they don’t provide <em>quite</em> the same foolproof, plug-and-play experience as Nintendo’s gamepad, which you can hand to a child and know everything will work.</p><p>While Nintendo recently came out to announce that its next console will be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation">backward-compatible with Switch games</a>, it hasn’t said what that means for accessories like the Pro Controller. There’s a chance that it will not be 100 percent compatible with the successor to the Switch, but since it uses an open protocol like Bluetooth, there’s really no reason it shouldn’t. That is, unless Nintendo drastically changes something with its wireless controller setup or really wants us to purchase new controllers. (Fingers crossed it doesn’t come to that.)</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The company made the move after complaints that <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> and games in the <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>series were crashing after installing the new Windows update.</p><p>Microsoft confirmed the “compatibility hold” in a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24h2#3448msgdesc">status update</a> yesterday evening, and says it’s working with Ubisoft to find a fix. In the meantime, the company recommends against installing the Windows 11 24H2 update manually. </p><p>Here is Microsoft’s description of the issue and games affected:</p><div><blockquote><p>After installing Windows 11, version 24H2, you might encounter issues with some Ubisoft games. These games might become unresponsive while starting, loading or during active gameplay. In some cases, users might receive a black screen. The affected games are:&nbsp;</p><p>• Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</p><p>• Assassin’s Creed Origins</p><p>• Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</p><p>• Star Wars Outlaws</p><p>• Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</p></blockquote></div><p>Microsoft writes that Ubisoft has released a temporary hotfix to address crashing issues in <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, but says that players “might still experience some performance issues.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
