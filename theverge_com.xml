            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Valve has just announced its biggest hardware push that it’s arguably ever made — a living room game console called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">the Steam Machine</a>, a headset called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">the Steam Frame</a>, and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">long-awaited sequel</a> to its Steam Controller <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499215/valve-steam-deck-interview-late-2022">it hinted about three years back</a>.</p></div><p>But Valve won’t say the first word about its next gaming handheld, the Steam Deck 2.</p><p>“Steam Deck is not what we’re here to talk about today,” Valve software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais told us at the very beginning of our briefing. “It’s sort of related but not really,” he said, before launching into a discussion of how the Steam Deck’s learnings underpinned every new product that it’s announcing today.</p><p>The company wouldn’t tell us if the new drift-resistant TMR joysticks it’s introducing in the Steam Controller and Steam Frame’s wands will make it into a future Steam Deck, either. “We’re always thinking about Steam Deck and ways to improve it in the future,” says Valve hardware engineer Steve Cardinali when I ask. (He also says Valve currently has no plans to offer the TMR joysticks as a drop-in module for the original Deck.)</p><div><div><p id="got-any-burning-questions-about-valves-new-hardware"><h2>Got any burning questions about Valve’s new hardware?</h2></p></div><div><blockquote><p>We’re holding a subscriber-exclusive AMA today, November 12th, at 3PM ET. Drop your questions <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818113/valve-steam-frame-machine-controller-vr-headset-pc-ask-us-anything-ama">here</a> and we’ll do our best to answer them.</p></blockquote></div></div><p>While Valve has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/25/23322516/valve-steam-deck-long-term-vision-digital-book-ebook-booklet">repeatedly confirmed</a> that the Steam Deck will have sequels, the company’s also repeatedly been clear that it’s in no hurry to bring them to market. Since 2022, Griffais <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499215/valve-steam-deck-interview-late-2022">has consistently</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884863/valve-steam-deck-2-refresh-upgrade-cpu-2025">told us</a> that Valve wants to see a significant leap in performance and efficiency before it takes the plunge. “We really do want to wait for a generational leap in compute without sacrificing battery life before we ship the real second generation of Steam Deck,” is how Valve’s Lawrence Yang concisely <a href="https://www.reviews.org/au/games/valve-steam-deck-australia-interview/">reiterated it to <em>Reviews.org</em></a> in 2024.</p><p>The question now is: Will Valve find that leap in performance and efficiency from x86? Because while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview#:~:text=But%20Coomer%20did%20light%20up">Valve initially thought</a> its standalone VR headset might run on the existing Steam Deck’s chip, the company just announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">the Steam Frame</a> with an Arm processor instead — using emulation to let it play some Windows games locally on the headset. Griffais tells me he thinks Arm has “a lot of potential” in future handhelds someday.</p><p>Valve tells us the Frame has a lower performance target than the nearly four-year-old Steam Deck, so it would need a far more potent Arm chip to power such a handheld. Qualcomm, in particular, has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631005/qualcomm-snapdragon-g3-gen-3-onexsugar-handheld-ayaneo-pocket">working on Arm chips for handhelds</a>, though, and one of its customers for the latest was even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/711116/onexsugar-sugar-1-hands-on-preview-transforming-dual-screen#:~:text=%E2%80%9Cvery%20interesting%E2%80%9D%20to%20discuss%20a%20potential%20SteamOS%20handheld.">interested in discussing a possible SteamOS handheld</a> with Valve.</p><p>It’s also possible Valve already found its next Steam Deck chip in AMD’s future roadmaps — like it did with the original Steam Deck — and is simply waiting for it to arrive.</p><div><p>None of that necessarily means you should expect <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818313/valve-has-no-news-about-a-steam-deck-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an Arm-based Steam Deck 2 just yet</a>, though.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/818313/valve-has-no-news-about-a-steam-deck-2]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve is about to launch a new virtual reality headset, and with it, a comprehensive new approach to what a VR device should be. Most VR headsets I’ve tried have ended up collecting dust after the novelty wore off, and I thought I had sworn off VR for good. But after trying Valve’s new headset for myself at the company’s headquarters, I was nearly ready to put down my credit card before I walked out the door.</p><p>The new headset is called the Steam Frame, and it’s trying to do several things at once. It’s a standalone VR headset with a smartphone-caliber Arm chip inside that lets you play flat-screen Windows games locally off the onboard storage or a microSD card. But the Frame’s arguably bigger trick is that it can <em>stream</em> games directly to the headset, bypassing your unreliable home Wi-Fi by using a short-range, high-bandwidth wireless dongle that plugs into your gaming PC. And its new controllers are packed with all the buttons and inputs you need for both flat-screen games <em>and</em> VR games.</p><p>The pitch: Either locally or over streaming, you can play every game in your Steam library on this lightweight headset, no cord required. I think Valve may be on to something.</p><p>As I explored an industrial level in <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>, jumping from floor to floor and blasting headcrabs, I couldn’t tell at all that the game was being streamed to me from a nearby PC. I felt like I was playing it through a hardwired connection or natively on the headset itself.</p><p>The dongle, which comes in the box with the headset, streams your games over 6GHz spectrum — that’s its only job. It means that the experience has “low latency, high bandwidth, and lots of robustness,” Valve hardware engineer Jeremy Selan tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>When you’re streaming, to make what you’re looking at appear sharp and with low latency, the Frame uses a technique Valve calls “foveated streaming.”</p><p>You might be familiar with foveated <em>rendering</em>, which, in VR, enhances what’s directly in front of your eyes and lowers the resolution in your peripheral vision to optimize the performance of a headset. With foveated <em>streaming</em>, the Frame instead uses its two eye-tracking cameras to make it easier to sling compressed images from your PC. “Anywhere the user is looking, we spend as many bits as possible to give them a very high-fidelity, super-high-quality representation of where they’re looking, and we’ve borrowed those bits from everywhere else in the image,” Selan says.</p><p>It’s “always on and always active,” so game developers don’t have to do anything to make it work. The headset checks the position of your eyes more than 80 times a second.</p><p>At one point, Valve staffers entered a special command that placed a square in front of wherever my eyes were focused. While it was on, I couldn’t tell that the bits around the square were lower-fidelity, and as I whipped my eyes all over the virtual room, the square kept up without any discernible lag.</p><p>It was extremely impressive, and it means that, depending on your PC, the Frame could let you play high-end VR games on a light headset. The Frame weighs 440 grams with the headset and battery strap, roughly half as much as the approximately 809-gram Valve Index, which, unlike the Frame, also needed to be physically wired to a PC. Valve’s headset is also lighter than the 560-gram PSVR 2 and the 515-gram Meta Quest 3.</p><p>It’s nice to wear right out of the box, too, with an especially plush and silky face cushion and well-balanced counterweight thanks to the battery being placed on the back of the head strap. The strap also contains speakers — two per side, Valve says, spaced apart so they can cancel out their own vibrations before they affect the headset’s positioning sensors.</p><p>The comfort might come at the cost of performance, though. While it might seem like a Steam Deck for your face, the Frame won’t hit Steam Deck-levels of performance and battery when you’re playing on its own lightweight Arm system.</p><p>The Frame runs SteamOS on a last-generation phone chip, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and it has to recompile Windows x86 game code on the fly using an emulator, named Fex, to let titles run on Arm. And at 21.6 watt-hours, the Frame’s battery is about half the capacity of an original Steam Deck, though you can plug any sufficiently powerful USB-C battery (45W) into the headset to extend its life. Valve is working to make streaming battery life “as efficient as possible,” Selan says, though playing six hours of <em>Hades II</em> over streaming would be “unlikely.”</p><p>In one demo, I played the standard x86 version of <em>Hades II</em> installed on the Frame on a big, 2D virtual theater screen, and I noticed a couple small gameplay stutters I never see on my Steam Deck or my Nintendo Switch 2. In a later demo of <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, I noticed more stutters right away — and to my surprise, a Valve employee brought them up proactively, calling them “hitches.”</p><p>According to Valve hardware engineer Gabe Rowe, the company plans to let you download preconverted versions of the code when you start up a game to help get rid of those hitches, similar to how the Steam Deck downloads precompiled shaders for many games before you even launch them.</p><p>Right now, the performance in those games felt a little worrying, and I didn’t get to try anything that might tax the headset even further. However, Selan told us after our visit that the choppiness we saw was actually a bug and that Valve expects performance and stability to improve leading up to and after launch.</p><p>Valve is also planning a Steam Frame Verified program, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22947274/steam-deck-verified-playable-compatibility-games-feature">the Steam Deck Verified program</a> that adds green checkmark on the Steam store pages of games that play well on the Steam Deck with no modifications, so you can know which games run well locally.</p><p>But playing games locally isn’t the main point of the device — it’s mostly designed for streaming.</p><p>“Steam Frame is a wireless streaming headset, first and foremost,” designer Lawrence Yang tells <em>The Verge</em>. “That is what we’ve optimized a lot of things and a lot of decisions around, not only for hardware, but also in terms of software.”</p><p>Assuming Valve gets the issues worked out, the Frame could be a decent place to locally play lower-end games. Most of the time, it seems like you’re going to want to stream your games from a PC to the headset instead.</p><p>Regardless of how you boot up your games on the Frame, its two new included controllers should give you everything you need to actually play them. Between the controllers, you have access to two drift-resistant TMR joysticks, a D-pad, four face buttons, two bumpers, and two shoulder triggers, all of which should serve you well for flat-screen games. For more immersive VR games, the controllers also have two triggers on the grips and enough sensors to enable five-finger capacitive sensing. The controllers run off of AA batteries, and Valve says they can get up to 40 hours of battery life. (The headset supports Valve’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">new Steam Controller</a>, too.)</p><p>Valve isn’t sharing a price for the Frame yet. The company plans to reveal that in early 2026, and it’s only telling us that it’s targeting a price that’s less than an Index — Valve’s previous headset, which cost $999. But there are other hints that Valve’s new headset won’t be as expensive as competitors.</p><p>While the Frame does have pancake lenses with an up-to-110-degree field of view and LCD screens with a 2160 x 2160 per eye resolution, that’s no longer class-leading. The Frame offers monochrome passthrough, but Apple’s and Samsung’s expensive headsets have more impressive micro-OLED displays and <em>color</em> passthrough, which can help with more immersive mixed reality experiences. Even the $299.99 Meta Quest 3S has color passthrough and outward IR illuminators so it can track in dark rooms.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>A Steam Frame prototype with a clear case. Valve isn’t selling this version, unfortunately.</em></figcaption> <cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The Frame’s four outward-facing monochrome cameras and IR illuminator seem to provide excellent tracking, though in a brief demo, the black-and-white passthrough view wasn’t useful for much except getting a general idea of my surroundings. Rowe says sticking with monochrome passthrough was an intentional choice because color passthrough would have added to the Frame’s price. “The core focus of the device is the gaming,” Rowe says.</p><p>For those who want color passthrough and other changes to the headset, Valve has made its headset modular, including a dedicated expansion port in the nose piece designed to support extra cameras. The expansion port offers 2.5Gbps of bandwidth via MIPI and one lane of PCIe data.</p><div><div><p id="got-any-burning-questions-about-valves-new-hardware"><h2>Got any burning questions about Valve’s new hardware?</h2></p></div><div><blockquote><p>We’re holding a subscriber-exclusive AMA today, November 12th, at 3PM ET. Drop your questions <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818113/valve-steam-frame-machine-controller-vr-headset-pc-ask-us-anything-ama">here</a> and we’ll do our best to answer them.</p></blockquote></div></div><p>The entire core compute module is modular as well. While Valve has nothing to announce right now, Selan suggests that people might want to have things like a hot-swappable battery, a battery in a different location, or different styles of audio, and says it’s “very easy to imagine” that with the Frame’s modular design, “we would be able to accommodate those different needs in the future.”</p><p>Valve plans to share specs and external CAD files so that people can make accessories for the port and alternate head straps. There will also be a partner program for companies that want to sell official accessories.</p><p>But right now, that modularity is just a footnote about the Frame. This device, at least from what we’ve seen, is much more a flexible vehicle to play your existing library of Steam games.</p><p>I said at the top of this piece that I was <em>nearly</em> ready to put down my credit card for the Steam Frame. I’m still not sure if I’d prefer kicking back at home with <em>Hades II</em> on the Frame’s screen instead of on my Steam Deck or on a TV. But the Frame seems like a winning combination of ingredients that just make it a nice place to play Steam games — <em>and</em> it won’t require a physical tether. That might be enough to make it my first VR headset that doesn’t just gather dust.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve is about to challenge the Xbox and PlayStation on their home turf. Ten years to the month after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/10/9705234/valve-steam-machines-controller-link-launch">Valve’s original Steam Machines</a> went on sale, the company is announcing… the Steam Machine.</p><p>I flew to Valve’s headquarters to try the company’s new PC-based game console, alongside a brand-new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">Steam Controller</a> and the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">Steam Frame</a> gaming headset. It’s the culmination of Valve’s hardware and software efforts over the last decade, and it looks a lot like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr">leaks that have been coming out over the past year</a>.</p><p>Here’s what the new Steam Machine is all about.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="the-promise"><h2>The promise</h2></p></div><p>Shipping early 2026 in every region where the Steam Deck is sold today, Valve’s new living room box is best thought of as a far more powerful, stationary version of the same technology. It’s a 6-inch cube that runs Windows games, but without Windows at the helm. Like the Steam Deck, it runs Valve’s Linux-based SteamOS operating system, using a compatibility layer called Proton to make games <em>think</em> they’re running on Windows and translate their API calls.</p><div><p>If that sounds like a huge compromise, you should know that countless happy Steam Deck users disagree. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/618709/steam-deck-3-year-anniversary-handheld-gaming-shipments-idc">The Steam Deck has dramatically outsold Windows handhelds</a> through word of mouth alone, because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/807711/xbox-ally-sleep-fail-bazzite-fix-performance">Linux now runs Windows games better than Windows</a>, and because Windows is <em>far</em> from the Steam Deck’s pick-up-and-play console experience. I’ve heard many lapsed gamers say the Steam Deck brought them back.</p></div><p>But the Steam Machine has two things the Steam Deck does not: raw power, and the promise that you’ll never be waiting around for a game to update. “The Steam Machine has the ability to keep all your software, your OS, your games, and your cloud saves updated in the background … so the games are always ready for you to play,” says Valve hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat.</p><p>While the Steam Deck is more powerful than a Nintendo Switch, it’s nowhere near a PS5. Big-budget games are beginning to leave it behind, and even the Nintendo Switch 2 can provide better 4K-upscaled TV graphics <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/703058/steam-deck-vs-switch-2-power-performance">in its docked mode</a>.</p><p>The Steam Machine is Valve’s answer, bringing the Deck experience to your TV with far more powerful guts. Valve says it offers six times the power of a Steam Deck, and it looks like it’ll offer at least PS5-level performance and possibly beat the PS5 Pro.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="two-chips-for-ps5-plus-performance"><h2>Two chips for PS5-plus performance</h2></p></div><p>Under the hood, you get not one but two AMD chips along with 16GB of DDR5 RAM: The CPU is a six-core AMD Zen 4 chip with up to 30 watts of headroom and 4.8GHz boost, while the graphics are a semi-custom discrete AMD RDNA 3 “Navi 33” GPU, with 28 compute units, up to 130-watt TDP, and 8GB of GDDR6 memory. These are unusual components for a gaming PC, but they might work well together!</p><div><p>While the former sounds a lot like <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/laptop/ryzen/8000-series/amd-ryzen-5-8540u.html">the entry-level AMD Ryzen 5 8540U laptop chip</a>, right down to its two big cores and four small ones, there’s no direct equivalent to that GPU: the closest are AMD’s <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Radeon-RX-7600M-XT-vs-Radeon-RX-7700S-vs-Radeon-RX-7600M_11550_11554_11552.247598.0.html">Radeon RX 7700 and 7600 mobile parts</a>, which have almost exclusively appeared <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152087/ayaneo-plans-ornate-ag01-graphics-starship-egpu-dock">in <em>external</em> graphics cards</a> (with two <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24047424/framework-laptop-16-review">notable</a> <a href="https://www.minisforum.com/products/atomman-g7-pt">exceptions</a>) and offer similar or better theoretical performance to the PS5 Pro’s graphics.</p></div><p>While I didn’t have time for robust testing at Valve’s headquarters, my first impressions were promising. On a 4K TV, the demanding <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> benchmark averaged a smooth 65fps at medium settings with basic ray tracing turned on, while being upscaled to 4K from a native 1080p output using AMD’s FSR 3.0. The benchmark never dipped below 58 frames per second, and when I took the controls for a spin in one of the more demanding regions of the game, the lowest I saw was 55fps in a quick firefight. It looked nice and crisp from about 9 feet away.</p><p>The prototype didn’t do nearly as well at native 4K — just 24fps average — but consoles generally don’t play the most demanding games at native 4K, either. I also benched with the same 720p settings I use to test every handheld and saw a solid 131fps, though the low resolution looked pretty ugly on a 4K TV!</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="compressed-steam"><h2>Compressed steam</h2></p></div><p>How did Valve fit PS5 power into a box around <em>half</em> the size of a PS5 at just 3.8 liters, including an internal power supply so you don’t need a separate brick? When Valve hands me a peeled-apart Steam Machine to let me peek inside, the answer is: there’s almost no wasted space within.</p><p>Aldehayyat says the team designed the entire Steam Machine around its cooling system — starting with a whisper-quiet 120mm PC fan with custom blade geometry. “We probably have more computational fluid dynamics time on this than an F1 team in a calendar year,” he jokes. “We have a lot of wind tunnel time on it as well.”</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->10</strong><span><figcaption><em>Gallery: Peek inside Valve’s new Steam Machine with our photos.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>Then, Valve and component partners built a massive finned heatsink just as tall as that fan, with embedded heat pipes — and made it pull double duty as the RF shielding between the motherboard and its <em>four</em> dedicated antennas, including two for Wi-Fi 6E, one for Bluetooth, and one just for connecting to its new Steam Controllers. Below the custom motherboard is a custom Chicony power supply that <em>also</em> doubles as RF shielding for the Steam Machine’s bottom components, including a full-size M.2 2280 SSD bay that also accepts the smaller M.2 2230 drives the Steam Deck uses.</p><p>It’s all sandwiched together into an incredibly dense, weighty package where the main gaps are all dedicated to airflow: the space around the massive heatsink’s fins, the vents on the bottom, and the multiple vents in front. Aldehayyat says Valve knew it couldn’t count on a lot of airflow in the living room, so it designed a lot of redundancy. “It’s really hard to block every single one of those vents.”</p><p>Plus, those vents on the front are where the Steam Machine’s swappable magnetic front panel lives. While the basic design is plain black, Valve shows me a wood panel that gives the Steam Machine <a href="https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/terra/terra/terra-graphite/">a Fractal vibe</a> and a <em>Team Fortress 2</em>-themed panel, and I even spot a panel with an embedded e-paper display which reveals that the Steam Machine is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr#:~:text=a%20codename%20Fremont%20living%20room%20console%20too">codenamed “Fremont” after all</a>.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="expandability"><h2>Expandability</h2></p></div><p>Valve won’t necessarily sell any of those extra panels, but says it’ll release the CAD files so you can design and 3D print your own. “I’m sure someone will make a [<em>Portal</em>] Companion Cube out of this, but we did not,” Valve engineer Steve Cardinali tells us when we ask. Below the panel, Valve also has a customizable RGB light bar that it plans to turn into a progress indicator for downloads and updates.</p><p>And this Steam Machine will finally be (optionally) sold with a gamepad that’s both familiar <em>and</em> worthy of playing PC games from the couch. The new Steam Controller is no longer a bulbous experiment in precision but now a comfortable, familiar, and powerful twist on a traditional gamepad (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">read my colleague Jay Peters’ story</a> for more).</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The downside of Valve’s impressive sandwich is that the Steam Machine isn’t really upgradable beyond the SSD and — if you dig deep — the 16GB of memory, which does come on standard laptop memory sticks. But the upside is an incredibly tiny game console that can alternatively double as a full desktop PC.</p><p>The Steam Machine has twin display outputs (HDMI 2.0, DisplayPort 1.4) so you can hook up two desktop monitors at a time or daisy-chain DisplayPort for a third. Across the front and back are four USB-A ports (two USB 2, two USB 3) for peripherals, with both a 10Gbps USB-C port and Gigabit Ethernet around back.</p><p>You should be able to plug in just about anything — including Valve’s new 6GHz dongle that gives the console a direct wireless connection to the Steam Frame headset — and you can install Windows if you really want.</p><div><div><p id="got-any-burning-questions-about-valves-new-hardware"><h2>Got any burning questions about Valve’s new hardware?</h2></p></div><div><blockquote><p>We’re holding a subscriber-exclusive AMA today, November 12th, at 3PM ET.

While Valve won’t repeat history, letting companies go wild and create a ragtag band of various kinds of Steam Box like it did a decade ago, Valve says it’s willing to let end users try desktop SteamOS on their own PCs — and selectively work with companies, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">like it did with Lenovo</a>, to bring future Steam Machines to market.</p><p>But partners probably will want to see how Valve’s own Steam Machine fares first, designer Pierre-Loup Griffais suggests to me.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="the-burning-question"><h2>The burning question</h2></p></div><p>In the two weeks since I set foot in Valve’s headquarters, there’s only been one big question on my mind: What will this cost? Will Valve price it like a console, putting the Steam Machine toe-to-toe with PS5 Pro? Or will it be priced like a PC, making buyers weigh a heftier price against the opportunity to tap the PC’s wider library of games?</p><p>Valve says it hasn’t finalized pricing yet. But when I explicitly ask if the console will cost more than a PS5 Pro, the answer is: “Steam Machine’s pricing is comparable to a PC with similar specs.” When I listen to my interview audio, I find an additional hint from Griffais: “We intend for it to be positioned closer to the entry level of the PC space, but to be very competitive with a PC you could build yourself from parts.”</p><p>Poking around the web, I find I could probably assemble a computer with this performance for $800, not including labor. But it could easily consume half the room under my TV. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-pcs/minisforum-atomman-g7-pt-mini-pc-review/">A compact system with a similar GPU</a> can cost $1,000 <em>without</em> storage, memory, operating system, or a gamepad.</p><p>But hey, everything about buying video games is getting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/789734/game-consoles-too-expensive">more confusing and expensive these days</a>. If Valve can deliver a pick-up-and-play console that supports decades of inexpensive PC games, I know people who’ll put down PC amounts of money to get it.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement]]></content:encoded>

But another way to think about it is that Valve is finally entering the mobile realm. The Frame doesn’t just run Windows games on its Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon chip — Valve will now support and encourage developers to bring their Android apps to Steam as well.</p><p>It’ll try to make some of them first-class citizens, too, Valve engineer Jeremy Selan tells <em>The Verge</em>. “From the user’s perspective, our preference is that they don’t even have to think about it, they just have their titles on Steam, they download them and hit play.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/818672/valve-android-apps-steam-frame">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODE4MzEz" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/818313/valve-has-no-news-about-a-steam-deck-2">Valve has no news about Steam Deck 2</a></h2><div><p><cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODE4NjIy" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818622/valve-console-wars-price-sony-microsoft-nintendo-windows">Valve enters the console wars</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: Kristen Radtke / The Verge, Valve</cite></p></div><div><p>On the 15th floor of an upscale office building in Bellevue, Washington, security guards line the halls. They’re here to make sure we don’t stray — because I’m visiting Valve’s headquarters, a place few journalists ever get to go. The guards help escort me to a tiny demo room, where a pair of Valve engineers show me their pride and joy: a glowing 6-inch cube, barely bigger than a box of Kleenex, that they hope might be the future of video game consoles.</p><p>For a moment, I feel like I’m watching history repeat itself. Twelve years ago, in a different Valve office half a mile away, the maker of <em>Half-Life</em> and <em>Portal</em> showed me what ultimately became one of the biggest <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21029499/decade-fails-flops-tech-science-culture-apple-google-data-kickstarter-2010-2019">technology flops of the decade</a>, a new gaming system called the Steam Machine.

Most VR headsets I’ve tried have ended up collecting dust after the novelty wore off, and I thought I had sworn off VR for good. But after trying Valve’s new headset for myself at the company’s headquarters, I was nearly ready to put down my credit card before I walked out the door.</p><p>The new headset is called the Steam Frame, and it’s trying to do several things at once. It’s a standalone VR headset with a smartphone-caliber Arm chip inside that lets you play flat-screen Windows games locally off the onboard storage or a microSD card. But the Frame’s arguably bigger trick is that it can <em>stream</em> games directly to the headset, bypassing your unreliable home Wi-Fi by using a short-range, high-bandwidth wireless dongle that plugs into your gaming PC. And its new controllers are packed with all the buttons and inputs you need for both flat-screen games <em>and</em> VR games.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODE1MDYx" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">Valve’s new Steam Controller might be my dream controller</a></h2><div><p>One of the best parts of the Steam Deck is its many different controls, and how you can customize them to let you do whatever you want with every single one of your games. Now, Valve is bringing that same level of flexibility into a new gamepad. I recently got to try it at Valve’s headquarters, and it feels like the controller I’ve always wanted.</p><p>Today, Valve announced the second-generation Steam Controller. It’s a Bluetooth controller that works with any device that runs Steam, including Valve’s new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">Steam Machine PC</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">Steam Frame VR headset</a>, and comes with a puck that serves as a low-latency wireless connector and doubles as a charging station. It will launch in early 2026 for a price that’s yet to be announced, though Valve is aiming to make the price competitive with other controllers with “advanced inputs,” according to hardware engineer Steve Cardinali.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Here’s the secret Steam Machine that Valve probably used to test headsets.</p><p>Jon Bringus isn’t saying how he obtained this unicorn, but it looks completely legit!</p><p>It self-IDs as a “Valve Steambox,” fires up a Steam screen, makes Steam hardware sounds, and natively pairs with Steam Controllers!

An <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/11/ars-benchmarks-show-significant-performance-hit-for-steamos-gaming/"><em>Ars Technica</em> analysis</a> published Friday morning highlighted considerable performance gaps between SteamOS and Windows on a computer running both operating systems, gaps that persisted across both AAA ports and games built on Valve’s own Source engine. The operating systems performed similarly in benchmark tool Geekbench 3, but tests involving <em>Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor</em> and <em>Metro: Last Light Redux</em> yielded frames per second gaps that ranged from 21 to 58 percent.</p><p>The timing of the analysis isn’t ideal for Valve.

The confusion is partly because “Steam Machine” is more a label for console-like gaming PCs than a discrete product. Along with the controller, Steam Machines are largely defined by Steam OS, a Linux-based operating system that any manufacturer can adopt, whether it’s making a super-cheap machine or a top-of-the-line gaming powerhouse. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/4/8728813/valve-steam-machine-preorder-release-date">Preorders finally opened</a> this summer, with a limited number of customers getting their devices in mid-October before the official release.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/10/9705234/valve-steam-machines-controller-link-launch">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6Mzg0NTY4" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/12/5992547/alienware-alpha-console-will-steam-to-your-living-room-this-november">Alienware’s Alpha console will bring Steam to your living room this November</a></h2><div><p>If you’ve been wanting to get Steam games into your living room — and don’t want to wait for <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/23/4762370/steam-box-os">Valve’s official Steam OS</a>— Alienware is now ready to take your money.

The touchscreen seen on <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/27/4762318/valve-steam-box-controller">the original model</a> has indeed been scrapped entirely in favor of four separate directional buttons on the left side and four face buttons on the right. They’re labeled X, Y, A, and B — just like Microsoft’s Xbox controller — and Valve’s buttons also share the same arrangement and color scheme. Similar to the Xbox One, Valve’s latest iteration of the Steam Controller features a logo that glows white when powered on. That round button is centered between two smaller ones labeled with icons for stop and play.</p><p>“These analog buttons are offered in addition to the touch pads featured in the original prototypes,” Valve said in a statement. The design of this latest version seems to have been finalized only recently; Valve says it’s in the process of assembling demo units that it will bring to the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco next week. “We’re excited to get some feedback from our customers on these latest changes,” the company said. That suggests that Valve may not be done tweaking the Steam Controller as it prepares for a huge push in the living room with SteamOS.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/14/5509730/valve-shows-off-updated-steam-controller">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NDAyNzEz" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/gaming/2014/2/11/5401824/watch-this-valve-explains-its-steam-box-and-virtual-reality">Valve posts entirety of Steam Dev Days to YouTube, explaining its console and VR strategy</a></h2><div><p><figcaption>steam dev days gabe newell 640</figcaption></p></div><div><p>Valve is a notoriously private game publisher, and in January it hosted a private event.

But what if you don’t want to buy a multiple-hundred dollar handheld game system to play <em>Tomb Raider </em>in bed? Valve is building a game streaming solution right into its free Steam game platform, so you can sling games from your beefy desktop PC to laptops as thin as a MacBook Air. Late last week, Valve invited a host of new users into the Steam In-Home Streaming beta, and we made it in. Read on for our first impressions.</p><p>The first, most striking thing about Steam In-Home Streaming is how little setup it requires. You don’t even need to be in front of both computers to pair them together. As long as both computers are signed into your Steam account and connected to the same network, you’ll automatically have access to any game or program in either computer’s Steam library. That means you can stream Windows games to a Mac or Linux machine, and Valve is planning to add support for the reverse, too. If you’ve got a copy of a game that works on both operating systems, you can pick whether to stream it or run it locally, or even start installing it on the remote computer. You can even launch some non-Steam apps, like Adobe Photoshop and Media Player Classic, if you add them to Steam. They don’t properly display their menu bars, though.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/26/5345364/steam-in-home-streaming-preview-a-short-range-slingbox-for-your">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NDA1Mzc1" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/15/5312452/steam-controller-ditches-the-touchscreen-for-better-backwards">Steam Controller ditches the touchscreen for better backwards compatibility</a></h2><div><p><figcaption>Gallery Photo: Steam Controller and Steam Machine press pictures</figcaption></p></div><div><p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/4/5063760/we-try-the-steam-machine-valves-video-game-console-of-the-future">The Steam Controller</a> is going to change. According to two game developers tweeting from Valve’s Steam Dev Days developer summit, Valve has decided to remove the controller’s central touchscreen. While it sounds like the gamepad’s twin trackpads will remain intact, the touchscreen was deemed redundant and possibly even distracting from games, as Valve wants players looking at the television instead of their hands. That doesn’t mean there won’t be customizable controls in the center of the gamepad, though. Players will simply use a feature that Valve’s calling “ghost mode.”</p><p>We saw an early demo of “ghost mode” at Valve’s headquarters a few months ago, and it’s fairly simple: when you move your thumb on the Steam Controller’s touchpad, you can see a ghostly image of your thumb on your TV screen as well, and you can press virtual buttons placed there.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/15/5312452/steam-controller-ditches-the-touchscreen-for-better-backwards">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NDA1NDY3" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/15/5312224/alienwares-steam-machine-will-arrive-in-september">Alienware’s Steam Machine will arrive in September</a></h2><div><p><figcaption>alienware steam machine stock 1020</figcaption></p></div><div><p>Alienware has <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/6/5281824/steam-machines-are-here-how-alienware-is-realizing-valve-console-dream#">perhaps the most exciting Steam Machine</a> coming to market, and now we know when it will arrive.
