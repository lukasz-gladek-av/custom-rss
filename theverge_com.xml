            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/629949/star-wars-hunters-offline-october<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>So soon after <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24211078/spectre-divide-preview-mountaintop-fps-game">Specter Divide</a></em>, a multiplayer shooter developed by Mountaintop Studios, announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628698/spectre-divide-mountaintop-studios-shutting-down">its pending shut down</a> which will take its studio with it, is yet another live-service game going offline. Today, <em>Star Wars: Hunters</em> developer Zynga announced <a href="https://starwarshunters.com/news/sunset-on-vespaara/">the game will be sunset on October 1st</a>.</p><p><em>Hunters</em> is a class-based arena shooter featuring original characters (or at least they <em>seem</em> original, who knows with folks named Babu Frik running around) from throughout the <em>Star Wars</em> universe. It had a soft launch in select countries in 2021, but didnâ€™t get a global launch on mobile and the Nintendo Switch until June 2024. This means that the game officially lived a scant 16 months before it inevitably goes offline. That short time though is downright luxurious considering <em>Specter Divide</em> lasted roughly six months before it will shut down sometime in the next 30 days.</p><p>The developers do have some parting gifts for players before the galaxy winks out on <em>Star Wars: Hunters</em>, though. The current season will be extended an additional three weeks and the game will still release a new hero April 15th. Then the developers will keep the ranked leaderboards running until the game shuts down in October.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
