We could have mandatory disclosures for what shampoo brand the developer uses,” he wrote in <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993890431462166818">another post</a>. “Customers deserve to know lol.”</p><p>After initially taking a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/1/23781339/valve-steam-ai-artwork-rejecting-banning-pc-games">cautious approach</a> towards AI-generated code and assets, Steam now permits the majority of games that have been developed using generative AI, so long as that use is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/10/24032678/valve-steam-generative-ai-rules-disclosure-pre-generated-live-illegal-content-copyright">disclosed</a>. Sweeney, who also runs the rival Epic Games Store, thinks that sort of disclosure is no longer necessary.</p><p>Earlier this month Junghun Lee, CEO of publisher Nexon, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/">said</a> it was “important to assume that every game company is now using AI,” following criticism of the use of AI-generated voice lines in Nexon-published game <em>Arc Raiders</em>. Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1988055443932135768">weighed in on X</a> then too, arguing that AI “increases human productivity in some areas by integer multiples,” but that this should lead to “building better games rather than employing fewer people.”</p><p>Sweeney may be right that AI use is becoming more prevalent, and not just in games, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/831379/microsoft-developer-ai-usage-stats-notepad">Microsoft claiming</a> that 91 percent of its engineering teams use GitHub Copilot, and AI becoming increasingly embedded in all sorts of development and creativity tools. But that doesn’t mean every developer would support ditching AI labels, with a growing number of indie game developers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/827650/indie-developers-gen-ai-nexon-arc-raiders">using “AI-free” as a sales pitch</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTI1"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Dominic Preston</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/831747/tim-sweeney-epic-ceo-steam-game-stores-made-with-ai]]></content:encoded>
