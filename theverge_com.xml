He previously worked at <em>Android Police</em> and <em>Tech Advisor</em>.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Fortnite</em> maker Epic Games has announced that Apple has blocked the game’s return to iOS. Following the rejection, <em>Fortnite</em> is no longer available on iPhones and iPads even in the European Union, where it had previously been available to download through the Epic Games Store.</p><p>“Apple has blocked our <em>Fortnite</em> submission so we cannot release to the US App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union,” the company posted on the <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1923293522234356169">official <em>Fortnite</em> X account</a>. “Now, sadly, <em>Fortnite</em> on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it.”</p><p><em>The Verge</em> has confirmed that the game is no longer available to download on iOS from the Epic Games Store or the alternative marketplace AltStore PAL in the EU, where it had previously been available. It’s not yet clear if Apple blocked the game’s availability through those stores, or if Epic itself chose to make it unavailable. We’ve reached out to both Apple and Epic for comment.</p><div><p><em>Fortnite </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store">returned to iOS in the EU last year</a>, but only through those two storefronts, and not Apple’s App Store. The return was made possible by the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/6/24091592/eu-dma-competition-compliance-deadline-big-tech-policy-changes">EU’s Digital Markets Act</a>, which required Apple to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050200/apple-third-party-app-stores-allowed-iphone-ios-europe-digital-markets-act">allow third-party app stores</a> on iOS.</p></div><div><p>Epic had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659271/fortnite-ios-apple-app-store-us-return">resubmitted <em>Fortnite </em>to the US App Store</a> this month following a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">recent ruling</a> in Epic’s lawsuit against Apple. That ruling prohibited Apple from restricting developers’ ability to link to external payment systems, one of the issues that had started their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief">long-running legal battle</a>. Epic was forced to use its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661237/epic-games-fortnite-apple-us-ios-app-store-eu-account">EU developer account</a> to resubmit the game, as its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21406013/apple-epic-games-fortnite-developer-account-terminated-no-longer-available">US account was terminated</a> in 2020 when it first broke Apple’s rules by introducing its own in-app payments to the game.</p></div><p>This week Epic CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/667206/epic-submitted-a-new-version-of-fortnite-to-apple">announced</a> that the company had pulled its previous <em>Fortnite </em>submission and submitted a new version that included an update due to release today, noting that “all platforms must update simultaneously.” He’s since taken to X repeatedly to complain that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/668101/apple-epic-games-fortnite-tim-sweeney-app-store-fakes">unofficial <em>Fortnite</em> knock-offs</a> have been allowed into the App Store while <em>Fortnite</em> hasn’t, <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1923214117894029475">claiming</a> that Apple’s app review process has been “weaponized by senior management.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
