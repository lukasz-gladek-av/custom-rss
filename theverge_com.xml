In fact, it should be a priority to stick one onto the console’s screen as soon as possible to avoid accidental scratches. </p><p>I’ve been installing and removing Switch 2 screen protectors to test others on my console at an alarming rate, more than any sane person should, and here are the most important takeaways:</p><div><ul><li><span>Do not buy a flimsy plastic screen protector. They won’t protect your Switch 2 enough.</span></li><li><span>It’s impossible to tell different brands’ protectors apart once they’re on your screen; product packaging and the installation process are the biggest differences (as well as the key factors that increase cost).</span></li><li><span>Some protectors are glossy and some are anti-reflective, each with its own tradeoffs. For my money, glossy is the way to go. The matte finish looks good, but it reduces the screen’s vivid quality and its viewing angles.</span></li></ul></div><p>Of the options below, it’s easiest to recommend <strong>amFilm’s three-pack of glossy screen protectors</strong>. Not only is the pack incredibly affordable ($7.19 from <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Compatible-Installation-Transparent-Accessories-Anti-Scratch-SWTCH2-7-9/dp/B0DS73N83B/ref=sr_1_1?crid=231EBG3UY5Q1Y&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.JMr6OSZhN-me8fKx8Im9R7U5j4AtUW8FmAj8fOrmMVp_kd7IaANV23xirhpm-Nu3u-IW9iIW7MNKWLynDfeCvTM2LeTAqiwbCro0UMaMS5CO4mvnbSCGtxMxuaMqvAZXGtL2vxQlcWcs5Fkgaa1I2ZKVRowy8OLW-Wax7noSoOMqPYLkUO3_7nsVKhEqEfF6M9s17fsV_zGG7C56ySqBsYVn15FHF4z6XBZwn9q2mf4ZfMiNLS2t3-hVQAqp9kyDNUcMHg7duxH_HIS8GqbcYDIlf69VsTAA2fMFoFGokFQ.yZ4lHneAbW6omJP3ynK2hf1RHRN3D5G-yXRBUxDOPHg&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=amfilm%2Bswitch%2B2&amp;qid=1751290880&amp;s=electronics&amp;sprefix=amfilm%2Bswitch%2B2%2Celectronics%2C78&amp;sr=1-1&amp;th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> at the time of publication), but the tray also allows for perfect alignment of the glass protector for easy, bubble-free installation. I’ve used this company’s screen protectors on various gadgets for years, and I particularly like its glossy option over the matte finish, since it lets the Switch 2’s screen fully shine through.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</strong><span><figcaption>Here’s what the Switch 2 looks like with a glossy screen protector.</figcaption> <cite>Image: Cameron Faulkner/The Verge</cite></span></p></section><div><h2>What I’m looking for in a Switch 2 screen protector</h2><section><p>The only way to test a screen protector is to go through the installation process for each option. We use the tools included to ensure a proper installation, analyze the fit and finish, and then remove it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/677944/nintendo-switch-2-screen-protector-anti-scattering-film-cover">very, <em>very </em>carefully</a> to proceed with the next candidate.</p></section><section><p>Every screen protector we mention in this buying guide comes with more than one (sometimes three!), which is good because they can sometimes break in the line of duty. We’ll note how many you get with your purchase, as well as what tools are included to make the installation process simpler.</p></section><section><p>All of the protectors in this buying guide claim to be a 9 on the Mohs hardness scale, meaning they should be tough to crack. I don’t put those particular claims to the test because I’m using my personal Switch 2, paid for with my money. Also, all models included feature an oleophobic coating to resist oils from fingerprints.</p></section><section><p>I’m ensuring that, during installation, screen protectors fit the entirety of the Switch 2’s screen, including its bezel. I haven’t encountered one yet during testing that doesn’t fit.</p></section></div><div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->7</span></p><div><p>My go-to screen protector brand for years has been amFilm. Three glossy tempered glass sheets come in the box, and the tools make installation fairly simple. <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZS0lty">JSAUX’s model</a> is just as good based on my testing, and just as affordable.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->13</span></p><div><p>In keeping up with some brands that offer faster installations, amFilm offers a two-pack of glossy protectors that includes a “OneTouch” tray. Remove the protector’s bottom film, attach the tray to your device, and then press gently on the protector until it’s fully applied.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->35</span></p><div><p>Dbrand’s Prism 2.0 includes two glass protectors for the Switch 2, each nestled into plastic cases that fit perfectly around the edges of the console (with the Joy-Con 2 removed). $34.99 is expensive for two protectors, but if simplicity and elegant packaging trump value, then this is a good option.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->20</span></p><div><p>Genki offers a cheaper alternative to Dbrand with the Aegis Shield. It includes two protectors, and the installation process is nearly identical: just align the plastic frame with the console, pull the tab, and run your finger across the exposed section of the frame. <a href="https://amzn.to/4nsWQ6R">Spigen makes a similar product</a> that costs $24.99 for a two-pack.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->9</span></p><div><p>Let’s start with one of the most affordable options if you want to go the matte-textured route. AmFilm sells a two-pack of protectors at Amazon for $8.99. The set includes a plastic frame that serves as a guide to align the protector just right. <a href="https://amzn.to/3G1DtBa">JSAUX</a> makes a similar product that’s the same price.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->13</span></p><div><p>AmFilm also sells a two-pack with a OneTouch frame for easier installation. Again, keep in mind that opting for matte over glossy will reduce glare, but at the cost of viewing angles as well as the full vivid quality of the Switch 2’s screen. That’ll be an acceptable tradeoff for some, but not all people.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/reviews/694948/best-switch-2-glass-screen-protector-glossy-matte]]></content:encoded>

For instance, you can plug in a projector, speakers, or a space heater. In other words, it’s great for entertainment and for maintaining a certain quality of life you may not be willing to give up while camping. This charging station, which also includes a SolarSaga 200W Portable Solar Panel, costs $698.99 ($601 off), its lowest price ever at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jackery-Generator-Portable-Off-Grid-Emergency/dp/B0D2L1G66J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. </p><p>The Explorer 1000 v2 will typically output 1,500 watts, which is enough juice to run a mini fridge, coffee maker, and other small appliances, or recharge a smartphone dozens of times. It can handle 3,000 watt power surges if a gadget draws a lot more energy briefly. The Explorer 1000 has three AC Outlets, two USB-C ports, one USB-A port, and a DC power port, and can power or charge multiple gadgets at the same time. A small screen shows its battery percentage and how much power is being drawn. You can also view that information on your smartphone using the Jackery app. </p><p>The Explorer 1000 recharges in under two hours when plugged into an outlet, but you can reduce that time to one hour by enabling its Emergency Charging setting using the Jackery app. Fast charging will sacrifice battery health, which is something to consider. Jackery says the Explorer 1000 can retain up to 70% of its original capacity after 4,000 charges. </p><p>The SolarSaga Portable Solar Panel that’s included can refill the generator’s battery in about seven and a half hours with direct sunlight, and you can cut that time in half by connecting a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jackery-SolarSaga-Portable-Compatible-Generator/dp/B00GCMUUPA?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">second one</a>. The panel is waterproof, and can be folded up to protect the panels from damage. The panel uses a sensor in the upper-right corner to automatically adjust its positioning to ensure the sun is hitting it at the optimal angle. </p><div><p id="four-more-deals-worth-a-look"><h2><strong>Four more deals worth a look</strong></h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Thousands of games are heavily discounted during the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2F" rel="sponsored">Steam Summer Sale</a>, which is running through July 10th.
