            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>It’s been a little over a month <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">since the Switch 2 launched</a>, and Nintendo’s ready to share more of the games coming to the console. Today’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZoLrfLcIVg">Nintendo Direct presentation</a> will be a short one at only 25 minutes long, and focused exclusively on third-party games.</p><p>It’s likely that <em>Hades 2</em> will make an appearance. The game, out on PC in early access, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688554/i-see-a-new-hades-ii-update">got a huge update recently</a>, and it seems like a formal launch date announcement is imminent. We may also see some more of FromSoftware’s contributions to the platform, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641335/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-announcement">the multiplayer game <em>Duskbloods</em></a>. And of course, the eternally patient <em>Hollow Knight</em> fans are once again pinning their hopes on this Direct finally being The One to reveal more <em>Silksong</em>.</p><p>With the Switch 2’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/667094/nintendo-switch-2-specs-digital-foundry">improved graphics and processing power</a>, this third-party showcase might also contain some surprising technical additions to the console’s catalog, like <em>Call of Duty</em>. We’ll find out more when the Nintendo Partner Direct starts at 9 AM ET.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article"><div><p>The octopath less traveled.</p><p>Square Enix’s gorgeous throwback RPG series is making its way to the Switch 2 with <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em>. The title makes it sound like a prequel of sorts, and the publisher says players will “experience a story of restoration and retribution over the divine rings — an epic saga that unfolds across the realm of Orsterra.” It’s launching on December 4th.</p></div></li><li role="article"></li><li role="article"><div><p>Let’s get tactical.</p><p>We got another look at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/679880/final-fantasy-tactics-remake-square-enix-ps5">the upcoming remaster of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>,</a> this one focused on the strategy game’s sweeping story. It won’t be long now before you can play it, as the game launches on September 30th. (It’ll be on both the Switch and Switch 2.)</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>It’s almost time for Princess Zelda’s summer vacation.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/638770/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a></em>, the hack-and-slash style spinoff of <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> series, covers the canonical events that led to <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. Most importantly, the game covers what Princess Zelda was up to in the past hanging out in the past with the very handsome Goat King of Hyrule.</p><p>Frustratingly, there’s still no release date with Nintendo sharing that the game will release some time “this winter.” Regardless, I’m looking forward to beating the bacon off an army of bokoblins.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Apex Legends’ new season, Showdown, is optimized for Switch 2.</p><p>EA’s battle royale shooter got a performance bump once the Switch 2 launched, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/716586/nintendo-partner-direct-july-2025-news-trailers">during the Partner Direct showcase</a>, they announced the August 5th update for <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/7/18216116/apex-legends-titanfall-battle-royale-ps4-xbox-pc">Apex Legends</a> </em>will include a Switch 2-native edition, with enhanced resolution and framerate.</p><p>The new season <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/seasons/showdown">also brings Wildcard</a>, a new permanently added game mode on all platforms that has tweaks to speed up gameplay, lets teams have more than one of a particular hero, and includes second chance respawns once your team is eliminated.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Persona 3, reloaded.</p><p><em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, the remake of Atlus Games’ <em>Persona 3</em>, is coming to the Switch 2 October 23rd. The game released last year <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/2/24058364/persona-3-reload-review-xbox-ps5-steam">to rave reviews on PC, PS5, and Xbox</a>. Now, Atlus is finally ready to release the game on the Switch 2 because why should the other consoles get all the devil summoning fun?</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Plants vs. Zombies gets a facelift.</p><p>The classic strategy game is getting remastered with a new edition called <em>Replanted</em>. In addition to enhanced visuals, it will add both co-op and PvP play when it launches on the Switch 2 on October 23rd.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Katamari rolls onto the Switch.</p><p>The next game in the iconic series, called <em>Once Upon a Katamari</em>, has a time-traveling theme, so you ‘ll be rolling stuff through different time periods. It’ll launch on the original Switch on October 24th.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Monhun gets a little twisted.</p><p>To start off today’s Nintendo Direct partner showcase, Capcom showed off the latest entry in the <em>Monster Hunter Stories </em>series. <em>Monster Hunter Stories 3 Twisted Reflection</em> is coming to the Switch 2 next year.</p><p>Try as I might, I can’t get into the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/617587/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-xbox-steam">mainline <em>Monster Hunter</em> games</a>. Since <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> are more structured, turn-based RPGs where I’m riding the monsters instead of trying to fight them all the time, I might have to give this one a try when it comes out in 2026 and see if it finally sticks.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Nintendo is ready to show off its partners.</p><p>At 9AM ET, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/716586/nintendo-partner-direct-july-2025-news-trailers">Nintendo is airing its next Direct showcase</a>, but this time the focus will be on titles from third-party developers.
