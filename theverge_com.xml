He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Epic Games plans to use its Sweden developer account to submit Fortnite to Apple’s US iOS App Store, according <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1918694390677065882">to CEO Tim Sweeney</a>.</p><p>On Wednesday, following the major ruling in <em>Epic Games v. Apple</em> that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">blocked Apple</a> from collecting fees on purchases outside of apps, Sweeney said that <em>Fortnite</em> would return to the US App Store <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659271/fortnite-ios-apple-app-store-us-return">“next week.”</a> (Apple has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661032/apple-epic-games-app-store-antitrust-ninth-circuit">appealed the ruling</a>.) But Apple terminated Epic’s App Store developer account <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21406013/apple-epic-games-fortnite-developer-account-terminated-no-longer-available">in 2020</a> after Epic introduced an in-app payment system <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android">into <em>Fortnite</em></a> that ultimately led to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief">the whole legal battle</a>, so it was unclear how Epic might bring the game back to the US App Store until Sweeney’s post.</p><p>“We have conversed with Apple on the topic,” Sweeney said in an X post over the weekend. He noted that Epic created its Sweden account last year so it could launch the Epic Games Store and <em>Fortnite</em> in the EU. (That account was banned and reinstated in 2024 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094543/epic-games-ios-developer-license-apple-dma">over another dispute</a>.)</p><p><em>Fortnite</em> won’t be back on iOS on Monday or Tuesday, <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1919111157249458650">Sweeney said</a>. “Beyond that, we’re working as hard as possible and aren’t certain what day it will be ready.” Epic Games didn’t immediately reply to a request for more details about when the game might return.</p><div><p><em>Fortnite’s</em> latest season, which is <em>Star Wars</em>-themed, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659347/fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle-season-battle-pass">kicked off last week</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And if you owned <em>Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</em> ahead of Monday’s announcement at 12PM ET, you’ll get <em>Reloaded</em> as a free upgrade.</p><p>Last year, Microsoft announced a new game in the series, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172052/gears-6-xbox-summer-game-fest-trailer"><em>Gears of War: E-Day</em></a>, which doesn’t yet have a release date. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
