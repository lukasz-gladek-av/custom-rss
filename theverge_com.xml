Not only is Nintendo’s powerful handheld readily available online and in stores, it’s still $50 off for the best console bundle you can buy. The set that includes a <strong>Switch 2 and <em>Mario Kart World</em></strong> is typically $499.99 (saving you $29 compared to buying the $79 game separately), but you have another — perhaps final! — chance to get it for $449.99. Currently, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fswitch-2-mario-kart-world-bundle-nintendo-switch-2%2FJ7GSL57HFZ" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-2-console---mario-kart-world-bundle--digital-download-in-console---no-aasa%2F-%2FA-94739186" rel="sponsored">Target</a> are honoring this limited-time price.</p><p>We’ve written about this deal a lot over the past couple of weeks at <em>The Verge</em>, mostly because it was the most unexpected thing to happen in the same year when Nintendo hiked prices on Switch 2 accessories <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717610/nintendo-switch-original-price-increase">as well as the original Switch</a>. The company made it clear back when the console launched in June that the bundle wouldn’t be around forever, and it <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2003133433883644115">shared yesterday on X</a> that quantities are now limited.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODM2MTMz"><p><span>$<!-- -->449</span></p><div><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has a 7.9-inch LCD display, magnetically attached Joy-Con 2 controllers, backwards compatibility with most original Switch games, and exclusive titles including <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>and <em>Kirby Air Riders.</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div><p id="other-verge-approved-holiday-deals"><h2>Other Verge-approved holiday deals</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Wireless lav microphones are a great option if you record a lot of videos for social media, or if you do multi-person interviews. Since they clip onto clothes, you don’t need to hold a mic, letting you be more expressive or interactive with your hands. They’re easy to set up, and they ensure that every person’s voice will be heard in the recording. <strong>DJI’s Mic Mini bundle</strong> is a great stocking stuffer under $100 that includes two mics and one receiver, plus a charging case. The set originally sold for $169 and for about $100 or so during Black Friday. But now it’s about $79 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DJI-Microphone-Ultralight-Detail-Rich-Cancelling/dp/B0DDL8WGH5/ref=ast_sto_dp_puis?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fdji-mic-mini-wireless-omnidirectional-microphone-system-black%2FJJ82LXJS9Y" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24305428/dji-mic-mini-osmo-audio-microphone-wireless">Read more about them here.</a></span></li><li><span>Sony’s PlayStation 5 console was one of the most popular products during Black Friday and through Cyber Week thanks to solid discounts. Sony finally pulled the plug for holiday sales last week, but <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fpromo%2Fsave-on-select-playstation-5-consoles" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> switched them back on, and they’ll last until Christmas. The most affordable option is the <strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fplaystation-5-slim-console-digital-edition-playstation-5%2FJXHQ3CCTY4" rel="sponsored">digital PS5 Slim</a></strong> that’s $399.99 (was $499.99) at Best Buy, while the <strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fplaystation-5-pro-console-playstation-5%2FJXHQ37TR86" rel="sponsored">PS5 Pro</a></strong> is $649.99 (was $749.99). These discounts drop console prices just below what they previously sold for before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762410/sony-ps5-price-hike-raise-digital-pro">Sony increased them</a> in August due to tariffs.</span></li><li><span>We recommended the <strong>Helinox Chair One</strong> in a previous gift guide because it’s a lightweight, compact chair that’s great for camping, backpacking trips, or just for casual picnics. It’s two pounds and two ounces, and it can hold up to 320 pounds while offering what seems like some nice back support. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007ZGOWZQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">black and blue model</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YX53V1S/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">tan-colored</a> models are both steeply discounted at Amazon (as well as directly through <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhelinox.com%2Fproducts%2Fchair-one%3Fvariant%3D44500525875374" rel="sponsored">Helinox</a>), selling for $64.97 (originally $99.95). It won’t arrive by Christmas if you order now, but it should arrive on time for your recipient’s next outdoor adventures once winter’s over.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/849552/switch-2-bundle-gaming-ps5-holiday-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
