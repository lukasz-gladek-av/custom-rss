            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span id="follow-author-standard_article_details-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzIw"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span></span><span>Brandt Ranj</span></span></span></p> <p><span>is a commerce reporter for <em>The Verge </em>writing about the best deals and gadgets. He previously wrote for <em>Business Insider, Rolling Stone, </em><em>Futurism, </em>and <em>Popular Science.</em></span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There haven’t been a lot of opportunities to catch Switch 2 games on sale since the console launched in early June, but that’s changing thanks to Woot. The store is having <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/plus/hot-deals-on-video-games" rel="sponsored">a sale on new video games and game accessories</a> that’s live now, and runs through November 8th at 11:59PM CT. Dozens of games for all three current-generation systems are on sale, but the Switch 2 titles caught our eye because of how new they are. Woot’s deals are especially enticing because first-party Nintendo games don’t go on sale very often.</p><p>Woot’s sale also includes discounts on Switch 2 exclusives, including <em>Donkey Kong Banaza </em>and<em> Mario Kart World, </em>and Switch 2 Edition versions of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>and<em> Kirby and the Forgotten Land Plus Star-Crossed World</em>. The latter are enhanced versions of games released for the original Switch that have new exclusive content, a boost in performance, or both. If you already own the original versions of these games, Nintendo allows you to download a paid upgrade pack to get the enhancements instead of paying full price for the entire game.</p><p>There are also some respectable discounts on games released for the original Nintendo Switch, which can be played on the Switch 2, so we’ve included them here. In some cases games are listed as being an “international version” of the title, which is fine because the Nintendo Switch 2 is a region free console that’s able to play them.</p><div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjUy"><p><span>$<!-- -->62</span></p><div><p><em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>is one of the Switch 2’s first exclusive must-have titles. Its destructible environment allows you to smash your way through each of its 17 levels, and the paths you make will remain intact unless you specifically choose to reset the world. Your companion Paulene’s singing allows you to transform into animals that have abilities that allow you to reach previously inaccessible parts of levels. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjgx"><p><span>$<!-- -->70</span></p><div><p><em>Mario Kart World</em> mixes up the formula that’s remained more or less the same since 1992. You still progress by out-racing your competitors across several cups, but there’s a new Knockout Tour mode in which you actually drive from stage to stage in an interconnected world. There’re new weapons to collect, an item that allows you to change costumes mid-race, and a single player mode loaded with challenges. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjc0"><p><span>$<!-- -->63</span></p><div><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>is one of the most highly-regarded games of all time thanks to its massive open world. The game gives you little direction after a brief tutorial, so you’re free to examine every nook and cranny at your leisure without hitting a single story beat. The Switch 2 Edition runs in 4K at 60 frames per second, so you can appreciate Hyrule even more. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/681361/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-edition">Read our hands-on</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjcx"><p><span>$<!-- -->70</span></p><div><p>The Switch 2 Edition of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom </em>has the same technical enhancements as <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, but they’re more welcome here because the game struggled to run a bit on the original Switch. The game is set in the same environment as its predecessor, but Hyrule is more dense, so there’s even more to explore. Your physics-based powers help a lot with traversal. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjYy"><p><span>$<!-- -->70</span></p><div><p>At its heart, <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em> Plus Jamboree TV is a game based around playing a board game with friends. However, optional modes that allow you to play the mini games in rapid succession, or take down Imitation Bowser with bombs shot through a cannon keep it feeling fresh. The Switch 2-exclusive Jamboree TV mode introduces mini games that utilize the system’s Joy-Con 2 mouse controls and optional USB-C Camera. </p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjY2"><p><span>$<!-- -->70</span></p><div><p><em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land Plus Star-Crossed World </em>includes the original Switch title, plus 12 levels whose environments have been reshaped by a meteorite. Traversing the new worlds requires finding alternate routes and completing new platforming challenges. There’s also a new final boss if you complete the Ultimate Cup Z EX cup in its Colosseum boss rush mode, which requires you to face off against bosses one after another. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/767427/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-review-switch-2">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjg3"><p><span>$<!-- -->45</span></p><div><p><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder </em>is the first new side-scrolling <em>Mario </em>game in a long time, and combines the gameplay of previous titles with a neat twist. You still stomp goombas, collect coins, and transform by using mushrooms and other power-ups. However, each level contains “Wonder Seeds,” which turn the stage into a challenging, psychedelic stage when collected. The collectible makes stages even more eye-catching and challenging to clear. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjkw"><p><span>$<!-- -->46</span></p><div><p><em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> feels like the series capstone title. It contains every character and level from previous <em>Super Smash Bros. </em>games, and the ability to expand the roster through paid downloadable content. The gameplay is largely the same (choose a fighter and play against people in the same room or online), but its single player “Spirit Mode” lets you progress through a story through matches with set objectives. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18128015/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review-nintendo-switch">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjk3"><p><span>$<!-- -->46</span></p><div><p><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>is the ultimate cozy game. The life sim allows you to build an entirely new town from scratch on a deserted island. The game starts slowly, but you’ll continually improve your living space, craft tools, gather resources, and make the town attractive enough for other characters to move in. <em>New Horizons </em>runs on a real-world clock, a mechanic that incentivizes you to play in short bursts every day. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMzAx"><p><span>$<!-- -->45</span></p><div><p><em>Splatoon 3</em> is proof that Nintendo isn’t done showing off its take on an online shooter—with paint instead of bullets, of course. The game looks great, and has a single player mode that fills out the series’ lore through scrapbook pages you find while navigating and shooting your way through each level. Online multiplayer remains Splatoon’s 3’s big draw, so be prepared to square off against fellow squid kids. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23339801/splatoon-3-review-nintendo-switch">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMzA0"><p><span>$<!-- -->47</span></p><div><p><em>Pokémon Scarlet</em> is one of the latest entries in the series, and it’s the most open world mainline <em>Pokémon</em> game to date. The goal is still to catch and train pokémon to take on gym leaders, but there are also unexpectedly poignant side stories that may surprise lapsed players. The game launched with technical issues, but some of them have patched. The game also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/679031/pokemon-violet-scarlet-switch-2-update-hands-on">runs at a higher frame rate</a> and has faster load times when played on Switch 2. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23462858/pokemon-violet-scarlet-review-nintendo-switch">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMzA3"><p><span>$<!-- -->45</span></p><div><p><em>Super Mario Maker 2</em> lets you show off your game designer skills by giving you the tools necessary to construct and share your own <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>levels. You can place enemies, obstacles, power ups, and secrets with very few restrictions. You can to make a <em>Super Mario Bros</em>., <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>, <em>Super Mario World</em>, and <em>New Super Mario Bros., </em>themed level, and string together multiple stages into a single world. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18758773/super-mario-maker-2-review-nintendo-switch">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandt Ranj</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/811251/best-nintendo-switch-2-game-mario-zelda-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
