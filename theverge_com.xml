            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/649025/dune-awakening-delayed-release-date-june<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Players looking to harness desert power will have to wait as <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24112467/dune-awakening-survival-game-preview-xbox-ps5-pc">Dune: Awakening</a></em> has been delayed. Funcom, developers of the MMORPG based on Frank Herbert’s <em>Dune</em> sci-fi series, <a href="https://pr.funcom.com/An-important-update-regarding-Dune-Awakening">announced the news</a> saying the game will be pushed back from its May release date to June 10th. Players who have pre-purchased one of the game’s deluxe editions will get access a few days earlier on June 5th.</p><p><em>Dune: Awakening</em> takes place in an alternate universe where <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24086957/dune-part-two-movie-review">Timothee Chalamet was never born</a> and thus never fought Austin Butler in single combat. Your job, as a new arrival to the desert planet Arrakis, is to investigate the disappearance of the Fremen, the planet’s native inhabitants. To do that you’ll have to combat exhaustion, thirst, the blood thirsty Harkonnens, and the Shai Hulud, Arrakis’ big bad worm dudes.</p><p>The delay of the game is only a few weeks, which according to Funcom, gives developers “more time to cook.” Funcom wrote in its announcement that it intends to use the additional time to respond to feedback from the game’s ongoing closed beta testing.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
