Nintendo <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1917860173722603707">acknowledged the issue</a> and released another update, V20.0.1, this morning, which fixes the problem. But those experiencing the error code will need to perform a few extra steps to get their Switches updated and working again.</p><p>The <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525">release notes for the new V20.0.1 update</a> only address the Switch’s boot-up bug, so it’s not essential for anyone without problems installing V20.0.0. The release says: “Fixed an issue where Error Code: 2206-1015 sometimes occurred when restarting the system after updating to system version 20.0.0.”</p><p>The update needs to be <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/28135">applied while the Switch is in Maintenance Mode</a>, since the 2206-1015 error code prevents some Switch users from successfully booting their consoles and getting the update automatically or manually through the Switch’s System Settings menu. Nintendo has outlined the following steps:</p><div><ol><li><span>Ensure the console is powered off. <br>- If the console does not respond, hold down the POWER Button for twelve seconds to force it to shut down.</span></li><li><span>With the console powered off, hold down the volume up (+) and volume down (-) buttons, then press the POWER Button to turn the system on.<br>- Be sure to keep the volume buttons pressed down until the Maintenance Mode menu is displayed.</span></li><li><span>Once in Maintenance Mode, select Update System and follow the prompts to complete this process.<br>- If a Parental Control PIN has been set for the system, you will be prompted to enter it. The PIN will need to be reset if you’ve forgotten it.</span></li></ol></div><p>Contact Nintendo’s official support channels for additional assistance if you apply the V20.0.1 update using these steps but it doesn’t fix the issue, or if you’re seeing a different error code when the console starts up.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
