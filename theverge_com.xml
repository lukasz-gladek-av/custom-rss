            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/26/24352254/superstation-one-preorder-retro-remake-ps1-fpga<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Retro Remake’s Taki Udon <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/takiudon.bsky.social/post/3lgma3s54rc2h">announced last night</a> that preorders had opened for the SuperStation One, a clone of the PS One variant of the original PlayStation. The $149.99 Founders Edition preorders are sold out already, but you can <a href="https://retroremake.co/products/superstation%E1%B5%92%E2%81%BF%E1%B5%89?variant=41951147884567">still preorder</a> the standard $225 SuperStation One for $179.99 right now, with shipping expected in “Q4 or Earlier.” </p><p>While the SuperStation One looks like a PS One — complete with ports compatible with the original PlayStation controller and memory cards — it plays more than just PlayStation 1 games. It’s a custom MiSTER field-programmable gate array (FPGA) machine, as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/512589/superstation-one-pre-order-playstation-console"><em>Polygon </em>points out</a>. That means rather than emulating game consoles, its hardware can actually function <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323002/mister-fpga-project-retro-computer-console-early-pc">just like those consoles</a>, with cores <a href="https://mister-devel.github.io/MkDocs_MiSTer/cores/console/">ranging</a> from the Atari 5200 and NES to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. </p><p>Retro Remake currently offers the system in black, gray, and translucent blue. It comes with a 64GB Micro SD card and has three USB-A ports, an ethernet port, and an NFC reader that you can use to trigger specific games to load. It uses USB-C for power.</p><p>On the video side of things, the SuperStation One will have an HDMI port, along with VGA, DIN10, composite, and component ports geared for retro gaming setups. You’ll also find a 3.5mm audio jack and a digital audio port. Finally, there’s an expansion slot to support Retro Remake’s planned SuperDock accessory that adds a slot-loading disc drive, a 2280 m.2 SSD bay, and four more USB-A ports. That’s not up for preorder yet, but you <a href="https://retroremake.co/products/superdock-preorder-deposit">can put down a $5 preorder deposit</a> for it with an order of the SuperStation One.</p><p>This is Retro Remake’s first console, though the company plans to make more later, as Udon <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-taki-udon-explains-how-his-fpga-ps1-aims-to-remove-barriers-to-fpga-gaming">told <em>Time Extension</em></a><em> </em>last week. The company has released other products, including a DIY kit for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24253224/nintendo-switch-lite-oled-upgrade-kit">upgrading the Nintendo Switch Lite</a> to an OLED display.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
