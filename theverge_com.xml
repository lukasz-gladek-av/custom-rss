            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/675241/apple-game-center-app-replace-rac7-sneaky-sasquatch-acquisition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Apple plans to announce an app focused on video games for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV at its Worldwide Developer Conference next week, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-27/apple-to-debut-dedicated-gaming-app-within-days-of-switch-2-s-arrival?srnd=homepage-americas">according to <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. The app will let you launch games you’ve installed on your devices and serve as a hub for things like achievements and leaderboards.</p><p>Apple is expected to launch its gaming app alongside the next version of iOS this September, <em>Bloomberg</em> reports. It will apparently replace Apple’s Game Center, feature editorial content, and let you access games also available on the App Store. A <em>9to5Mac</em> report <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/10/22/apple-new-app-store-like-app-games/">from last year</a> described the app as working similarly to the Xbox app for iPhone. </p><p>A Mac version of the new app will let users “tap into games downloaded outside of the App Store,” <em>Bloomberg</em> says.</p><p><em>Bloomberg</em>’s report follows news that Apple bought its first gaming studio. The company confirmed to <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/apple-acquires-rac7-sneaky-sasquatch/"><em>Digital Trends</em></a> that it acquired RAC7, the two-person studio behind <em>Sneaky Sasquatch</em>, one of the first games released on its Apple Arcade games subscription service. RAC7 won’t be folding into any other teams at the company, but will instead continue to operate as a game studio all its own, according to <em>Digital Trends.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
