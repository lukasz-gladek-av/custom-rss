            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/8/24291250/apple-mac-mini-macbook-pro-ps5-pro-vergecast<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Think about how you like to play video games. Are you the type to sink into your couch, controller in hand, TV across the living room, for a few hours of <em>Madden? </em>If so, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">Sony’s new PlayStation 5 Pro is not for you</a>. But if you find yourself leaning forward, creeping ever closer to the screen, looking for every clue hidden in the grass or every tiny twitchy graphical advantage, a $700 console might not be such a silly idea.</p><p>On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a>,<em> The Verge</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister">Sean Hollister</a> joins the show to talk about his experience with the PS5 Pro. We go through what you can expect from this super-powered new gaming machine, which games and which gamers might get the most from it, and why the PS5 Pro might have more in common with a gaming PC than a standard console.</p><p>But before we get to that, there’s some news this week to talk about. After a hotly contested election, and looking ahead to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24287838/donald-trump-wins-2024-presidential-election">the upcoming Trump presidency</a>, we spend a few minutes talking through <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289649/big-tech-leaders-donald-trump-presidential-election">our plans to cover</a> the new administration — and how we’re thinking differently than we did in 2016. Once we’re done with that, we talk about our reviews of the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24289730/apple-mac-mini-m4-review">Mac Mini</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24289831/apple-macbook-pro-m4-review-14-2024-laptop-specs-benchmarks">MacBook Pro</a>, and the way they seem to nicely simplify the process of buying a Mac. For the first time in a long time, the lineup makes a lot of sense.</p><p>Then it’s gaming time. In addition to the PS5 Pro, Sean talks us through the news that Nintendo’s next console <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289674/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-backward-compatibility">will be backwards compatible</a> with Switch games, but cautions that the announcement isn’t necessarily unequivocally good news. Then he gives us an update on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">Nintendo’s fight against emulators</a>, which has taken a bit of a confusing turn.</p><p>Finally, in the lightning round, we talk about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289768/openai-chat-chatgpt-sam-altman-hubspot">the ultra-expensive new domain name</a> for ChatGPT, and why .coms are still so important. We also talk about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24289443/nvidia-geforce-now-monthly-playtime-caps-performance-membership-1440p">the new cap</a> on Nvidia’s GeForce Now cloud gaming service, and the good and bad news <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24289972/matter-smart-home-standard-1-4-spec-new-features-device-types">in the Matter 1.4 standard</a>. Matter: it’ll be great next year. Every year. Forever.</p><p>If you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started, beginning with Apple and gadget news:</p><p>And in gaming news:</p><p>And in the lightning round:</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
