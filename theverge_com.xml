            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/1/24310104/intel-arc-b570-battlemage-gpu-leaked-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Intel is expected to release a pair of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/29/24309086/intel-battlemage-gpu-leak-arc-b580-b570">entry-level Battlemage GPUs this week</a>, and now marketing materials posted <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qicvhaddltmw5jeupfi73dqu?ref_src=embed">by reliable leaker Roland Quandt</a> show what we might see from the lower-specced Arc B570. The leaked materials, which have details for a dual-fan ASRock Arc B570 Challenger OC GPU, suggest that the new chip may feature 18 Xe2 cores and 10GB of GDDR6 VRAM on a 160-bit memory bus.</p><p>The leak also indicates that Intel’s Arc B570 chip could come with the 8-pin PCIe power connector and a 2.6GHz GPU clock, along with support for HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 2.1. </p><p>The rumored specs for the Arc B570’s slightly more powerful counterpart — the Arc B580 — have been floating around as well. An early Amazon listing <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-arc-b570-specs-leaked-18-xe2-cores-10gb-memory-and-pcie-4-0x8">spotted by <em>VideoCardz</em></a> suggests that the Arc B580 could arrive with 20 Xe2 cores, 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM on a 192-bit memory bus, a 2.8GHz GPU clock, and an 8-pin PCIe power connector.</p><p>Judging by these specs, it seems Intel’s Battlemage chips are designed to compete with more affordable graphics cards, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23734022/nvidia-rtx-4060-ti-amd-rx-7600-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test">like the Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti and AMD Radeon RX 7600</a>. Though we still don’t know how much Intel’s new chips will cost, a product listing shared by <a href="https://x.com/momomo_us/status/1861788237456711881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1861788237456711881%7Ctwgr%5E0f3b2be26b93fa4b7b0634731f5fc84a40464720%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F11%2F29%2F24309086%2Fintel-battlemage-gpu-leak-arc-b580-b570">@Momomo_us</a> shows Intel’s “Limited Edition” B580 card priced at $250 — less than the $399 RTX 4060Ti and $269 Radeon RX 7600.</p><p>The reveal of Intel’s new Battlemage GPUs is just days away, as the company confirmed that it will make an Arc-related announcement on December 3rd at 9AM ET from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/intelgaming">its YouTube channel</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
