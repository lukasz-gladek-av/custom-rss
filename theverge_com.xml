The company is acquiring avatar company Ready Player Me and its “cross-game avatar tech” to let players “carry their identities and fandom across games,” according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/timmutoke_netflix-xready-player-me-im-excited-activity-7407832324232458243-7s38/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAEpYG0BEjwzgXtaIiduzMgf2iJBEC75_10">Ready Player Me CEO Timmu Tõke</a>.</p><p>Netflix “doesn’t have an estimate of how long it will be until avatars launch” or which games will get them first, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/netflix-acquires-gaming-avatar-maker-ready-player-me/"><em>TechCrunch</em> reports</a>. Terms of the deal haven’t been disclosed.</p><p>Ready Player Me’s team of about 20 people will join Netflix. The company’s services, which “thousands” of developers used to “power cross-platform avatars,” will “become unavailable” on January 31st, 2026, <a href="https://readyplayer.me/">Ready Player Me says on its website</a>.</p><p>“Our vision has always been to enable avatars and identities to travel across many games and virtual worlds,” Tõke says. “We’ve been on an independent path to make that vision a reality for a long time. I’m now very excited for the Ready Player Me team to join Netflix to scale our tech and expertise to a global audience and contribute to the exciting vision Netflix has for gaming.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/848252/netflix-avatar-company-ready-player-me-acquisition]]></content:encoded>
