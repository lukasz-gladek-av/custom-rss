He previously wrote for <em>Business Insider, Rolling Stone, </em><em>Futurism, </em>and <em>Popular Science.</em></span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s easy to run out of storage on your Xbox Series S or X when a single game can eat up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549814/call-of-duty-cod-black-ops-cold-war-file-size-ps5-xbox-series-x">over 100GB</a>. The best (and pretty much <em>only</em>) solution is to buy an expansion card from Seagate or Western Digital. You can store Xbox games on a USB external hard drive, yes, but you’ll need to re-transfer them to the system’s internal storage to play them. An expansion card allows you to play games from your library without having to move anything around.</p><p>Fortunately, you can pick up a <strong>512GB WD Black C50 expansion card</strong> for $85.99 ($8 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Expansion-Officially-Licensed-Consoles/dp/B0C44B1VSH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, which is its second-lowest price since May. <strong>Western Digital’s 1TB expansion card</strong> is on sale for around $119.99 ($30 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Expansion-Officially-Licensed-Consoles/dp/B0C44XVWCH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fwd-c50-1tb-storage-expansion-card-for-xbox-series-xs-gaming-console-ssd-black%2FJXJ62C6RX8" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, which is its lowest price since July, though it’s $20 shy of beating that price.</p><p><strong>Seagate’s storage expansion card</strong>, meanwhile, starts in a 1TB configuration, and is discounted to around $123.49 ($30.50 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fseagate-1tb-storage-expansion-card-for-xbox-series-xs-internal-nvme-ssd-black%2FJ37C5HZ2W7" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, which is lower than it was last Prime Day. If you need even more space, a 2TB card is on sale for $199.99 ($160 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B09BJYXMDW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fseagate-2tb-storage-expansion-card-for-xbox-series-xs-internal-nvme-ssd-black%2FJ37C5H459S" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, which also bests its previous Prime Day price. Seagate’s 4TB expansion card (the largest size configuration available from either company) is down to $379.99 ($120 off) <strong>— </strong>a new all-time low<strong> — </strong>at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B0CNXZS9C5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fseagate-4tb-storage-expansion-card-for-xbox-series-xs-internal-nvme-ssd-black%2FJ37C5H5HZJ" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>.</p><p>These cards fit into a slot behind the Xbox and match the read and write speed of the console’s internal drive, so games will run without technical compromises. There are no cables to plug in or compatibility issues to worry about. The number of games that’ll fit on the card will depend on which card you get and what games you play; <em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Ffortnite%2FBT5P2X999VH2%2F0001" rel="sponsored">Fortnite</a> </em>requires just over 86GB of space, while <em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fstardew-valley%2Fc3d891z6tnqm" rel="sponsored">Stardew Valley</a></em> takes up 1.53GB.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6Njk4NzM1"><p><span>$<!-- -->123</span></p><div><p>Seagate’s Storage Expansion Card is as fast as the Xbox’s internal storage, comes in 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB sizes, and fits into a proprietary slot without any cables.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6NzkxMzAy"><p><span>$<!-- -->86</span></p><div><p>Western Digital’s C50 is a storage expansion card for the Xbox that let’s you add between 512GB and 2TB of space for digital games without impacting their performance.</p></div></div><p>If you’ve committed to only buying digital games, tripling your total storage will prevent you from having to download, delete, and redownload titles, which can take hours depending on your internet speed.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft is holding off on its Xbox Game Pass Ultimate price hikes for some existing subscribers in select countries. After announcing a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">50 percent price increase to Game Pass Ultimate</a> last week, Microsoft now says this price increase will only currently affect new purchases and not existing subscribers in markets like Germany, Ireland, South Korea, Poland, and India.</p><p>“At this time, these increases will only affect new purchases and will not affect your current subscription for the market in which you reside, as long as you are on an auto-recurring plan,” explains Microsoft in an email that was sent to some Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers overnight. “Should you choose to cancel your plan and repurchase, you will be charged at the new current rate.”</p><p>Microsoft has confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> that the email is genuine, and it’s not impacting subscribers in the US or UK. “Our recent Game Pass update remains unchanged. Current subscribers in certain countries will continue renewing at their existing price for now, in line with local requirements. We’ll provide advance notice before price adjustments take effect in these countries,” says Kari Perez, head of Xbox communications, in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Xbox Game Pass subscribers in Poland, Ireland, Italy, Germany, and <a href="https://x.com/KoreaXboxnews/status/1975431903009513554">South Korea</a> have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/gp_price_hike_doesnt_seem_to_affect_people">all reported</a> that they’ve received the emails today.</p><p>The change in these countries is likely related to local regulations on subscription price changes, and it means in Ireland existing subscribers with auto-renew enabled will still be charged at the €17.99 monthly rate, instead of the new €26.99 pricing. Microsoft notes in its email that existing subscribers in these markets will be notified “at least 60 days in advance” of price changes, meaning the changes won’t go into effect for at least two more months.</p><p>The halt in price increases in select markets is a change to what Microsoft announced last week. “This updated pricing will go into effect on October 1st for new subscribers, and then at the next billing cycle, likely to be November 4th, for current subscribers,” said Dustin Blackwell, director of gaming and platform communications at Microsoft, in a briefing with <em>The Verge</em> last week.</p><p><em><strong>Update, October 7th</strong>: Article updated with comment from Microsoft.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/794032/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-changes-countries]]></content:encoded>
