With <em>Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition</em>, you’ll get the base game, six official expansions, more than 150 pieces of Creation Club content (including new options to switch what breed of dog Dogmeat is), and a Creations hub to access mods.</p><p>The release is happening about a month before the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TsP09cZA7o">December 17th release</a> of the second season of Prime Video’s <em>Fallout</em>, so you’ll have some time to dig into everything if you want to play <em>Fallout 4</em> ahead of watching the show. And sometime next year, the <em>Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition</em> will come to the Nintendo Switch 2, too. (It’s been a big day for news about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805404/switch-into-the-shadows">Switch 2</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/805381/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-nintendo-switch-2-delay">third-party releases</a>.)</p><p>As part of its Fallout Day broadcast today, Bethesda <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/5S63EJI5hmThAU6I8jaiQj/fallout-day-broadcast-2025-news">also announced updates</a> coming to <em>Fallout Shelter</em> and <em>Fallout 76</em>. At the end, Bethesda’s Todd Howard gave an extremely vague hint on what’s potentially next for <em>Fallout</em>: “Just know, we are working on even more. We’re looking forward to the day where we can share that with everybody.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/805612/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-release-date-trailer]]></content:encoded>

Under this new “AI First” strategy, Krafton plans to use agentic AI to help automate work and implement an “AI-centered” management system, <a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ED%81%AC%EB%9E%98%ED%94%84%ED%86%A4-ai-first-%EA%B8%B0%EC%97%85-%EC%A0%84%ED%99%98-%EC%84%A0%EC%96%B8-1000%EC%96%B5-%EC%9B%90-%EC%9D%B4%EC%83%81-%ED%88%AC%EC%9E%90/">according to a translation of a press release</a>.</p><p>The company also plans to spend more than 100 billion Korean won, a figure that equates to nearly $70 million, to build a GPU cluster. Using its infrastructure, Krafton will pursue “AI workflow automation, as well as strengthen AI R&amp;D and in-game AI services,” the translated release says. Krafton aims to complete its AI platform by the second half of next year. The company is also going to invest about ₩30 billion every year to help employees apply AI tools into their work and it will also restructure its “HR and organizational operations” in support of the “AI First” strategy.</p><p>Tech companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/644943/shopify-ceo-memo-ai-hires-job">Shopify</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/657594/duolingo-ai-first-replace-contract-workers">Duolingo</a> have made AI a key part of their internal operations as well, and Krafton may not be the only big gaming company to make big structural changes due to AI. The investors that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/787723/ea-private-deal-buyout-future-games-layoffs">plan to take EA private</a> are “betting that AI-based cost cuts will significantly boost EA’s profits in the coming years,” the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133"><em>Financial Times</em> reported</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/805509/krafton-pubg-ai-first-developer-agentic-gpu-cluster]]></content:encoded>
