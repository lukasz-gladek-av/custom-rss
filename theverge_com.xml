As an independent developer and publisher, this decision allows us to ensure the experience meets the level of quality you players deserve on day one.</p><p>The game is progressing well and is fully playable from beginning to end, so these additional two months will allow us to further polish and refine the experience, ensuring we deliver the strongest possible version at launch. We’re confident this sets 007 First Light up for long-term success, and we sincerely appreciate the patience and continued support we’ve received ever since we revealed the game. We look forward to sharing more updates regarding 007 First Light in early 2026.</p></blockquote></div><div><p>IO Interactive, also known for the <em>Hitman</em> franchise, shared the first trailer for <em>007 First Light</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/679909/007-first-light-trailer-james-bond">back in June</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwRpK8eoLLE">gameplay deep dive in September</a>.
