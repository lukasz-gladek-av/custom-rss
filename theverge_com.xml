            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317407/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-final-season-offline-mode<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> only came out in February, but the game’s final season, which starts tomorrow, is going to be its last. Season 4 Episode 7 launches on Tuesday, and Episode 8, which is set to release on January 14th, 2025, will “serve as the last seasonal Episode for&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,” </em>developer Rocksteady <a href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/season-4-deep-dive">announced on Monday</a>.</p><p>After the release of the final content, the game will still be available to play online, according to <a href="https://dcgamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/36121518094995-SEASON-4-FAQ">a WB Games FAQ</a>. But the game is also getting an offline mode tomorrow — which had been <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-is-getting-an-offline-mode-after-all-but-not-until-sometime-after-its-out/">previously announced</a>, though without a specific date beyond “2024” — that will let you play the main story and all seasonal story mission content without an internet connection.</p><p>The game has had a troubled history. The game was originally set to release <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21376280/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-game-trailer-rocksteady">in 2022</a> before being delayed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/23/22992865/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-delay-spring-2023-announcement-ps5-xsx-pc">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/13/23682376/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-delayed-february-2024">times</a>. And a largely unsuccessful launch — in our review, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24062243/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review-ps5-xbox-pc">we said</a> the game “hides its brash personality under a generic looter shooter” — resulted in Warner Bros. Discovery announcing in May that it would be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172905/suicide-squad-kill-justice-league-200-million-loss-wbd-rocksteady">taking a $200 million loss</a> on the game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
