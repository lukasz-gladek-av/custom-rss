Paramount, the film studio behind <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>, will “develop, produce, and distribute a live-action feature film” based on the franchise, and “both companies are committed to honoring the brand’s rich narrative and distinctive style,” the companies say in a press release.</p><p>Years ago, Activision was <a href="https://variety.com/2018/film/news/sicario-2-call-of-duty-pic-activision-studios-exclusive-1202697515/">working on</a> a <em>Call of Duty</em> film that never ended up getting released, but this new movie could be a huge deal. The <em>Call of Duty</em> series has sold more than 500 million copies globally and the campaigns in the games tell big, cinematic, action-packed stories. A <em>Call of Duty</em>-style story could be a good fit for a movie, though obviously we’ll have to wait and see the final product to know how it turns out.</p><p>The two companies haven’t shared any details about a potential release window, a director, or any stars for the cast. But David Ellison, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tv/756298/paramount-plus-skydance-merger-complete-david-ellison">new CEO and chairman</a> of Paramount, a Skydance Corporation, is apparently a big fan of the franchise, so it seems likely that the film is going to be a priority for him — especially when things like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/1/23695720/nintendo-mario-movie-billion-box-office"><em>The Super Mario Bros.
