But now, Nvidia has confirmed to us that RTX 5080 production was affected by the same issue as well.</p><p>“Upon further investigation, we’ve identified that an early production build of GeForce RTX 5080 GPUs were also affected by the same issue. Affected consumers can contact the board manufacturer for a replacement,” Nvidia GeForce global PR director Ben Berraondo tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>In response to <em>The Verge</em>’s questions, Berraondo adds that “no other Nvidia GPUs have been affected” — we specifically asked about the upcoming RTX 5070, and he says it’s not affected either. Nor should any cards be affected that were produced more recently: “The production anomaly has been corrected,” he says. In case you’re wondering, he also told us that Nvidia was not aware of these issues before it launched these GPUs.</p><p>Here’s the company’s full amended statement:</p><div><blockquote><p><em>We have identified a rare issue affecting less than 0.5% (half a percent) of GeForce RTX 5090 / 5090D, RTX 5080, and 5070 Ti GPUs which have one fewer ROP than specified. The average graphical performance impact is 4%, with no impact on AI and Compute workloads. Affected consumers can contact the board manufacturer for a replacement. The production anomaly has been corrected.</em></p></blockquote></div><div><p>One specific Redditor was the one to discover <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618102/rtx-5080s-are-missing-rops-too">that their RTX 5080 also demonstrated the issue</a>; he’s since said he’s worked out a deal to hand that card to <em>GamersNexus</em>, which is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvBtfqU6svo">investigating the RTX 50-series issues</a>, for more study.</p></div><p>While it doesn’t seem like a lot of GPUs were affected, given how few of these GPUs have shipped so far, and Nvidia is also promising replacements, it’s the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/617901/nvidia-confirms-rare-rtx-5090-and-5070-ti-manufacturing-issue#:~:text=But%20it%20is%20the%20latest%20in%20a%20line%20of%20annoyances">latest in a line of annoyances</a> with Nvidia’s new cards.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He has covered tech and gaming for all of his 15-plus-year career for publications like Forbes, Business Insider, and more.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Ongoing scarcity has made it challenging to purchase Nintendo’s adorable Alarmo since its soft launch last year, but it appears those days are behind us. The $99.99 alarm clock is now readily available from third-party retailers in the US, starting with <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/z73qyjwthc940">Best Buy</a>. You can also buy it directly from <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-121311%2F" rel="sponsored">Nintendo</a> without a subscription, with the only caveat being that you must sign in with a Nintendo account.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->100</span></p><div><p>The Alarmo takes dozens of characters and scenes from classic Nintendo franchises and places them in a charming alarm clock that’s designed to help you sleep and wake. It uses motion sensors to detect whether you’re still in bed and gets more aggressive the longer you sleep in.</p></div></div><p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265984/nintendo-alarmo-alarm-clock-date-price">announced its alarm clock in October</a> while we patiently awaited (any) news regarding the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, which is set to launch later this year. Although the Alarmo is certainly not as exciting as a new console, it is unapologetically Nintendo, with a cartoonish look that calls to mind a vintage alarm clock — albeit with a few modern features.</p><p>Nintendo’s bright red alarm clock features an illuminated button on top and a rounded face that houses an LCD display. The 2.8-inch panel shows the time/date and will attempt to wake you each morning with scenes and sounds from several iconic franchises. It makes room for visits from beloved characters like Link and Mario, as well as pikmin. There are currently 35 scenes across five franchises available, and Nintendo says you’ll be able to download more in the future. An integrated motion sensor can detect whether you’ve moved, too, and each scene will get progressively more aggressive based on whether you’re knocked out cold or making an effort to get out of bed (it goes silent once you’re up).</p><p>Button mode enables a more traditional alarm clock experience by allowing you to start and stop alarms or access the settings by tapping and twisting the button on top. The Alarmo can also automatically initiate sleep sounds once you’ve jumped into bed for the night, provide basic insights into your sleeping habits, and even sound hourly chimes to help you keep track of time throughout the day. Individually, these features don’t always work as well as those on a dedicated alarm clock or sound machine, but most of those aren’t nearly as cute.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
