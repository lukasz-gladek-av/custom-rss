            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/651199/razer-blade-16-laptop-sales-resume-us-tariffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/antonio-g-di-benedetto">Antonio G. Di Benedetto</a> <span>is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget. He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In what seemed like a response to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">ongoing tariff tumult</a>, the US Razer site had quietly pulled its Blade laptops from direct sales, including its new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/638930/razer-blade-16-2025-rtx-5090-gaming-laptop-impressions-price">Blade 16</a> with Nvidia’s 50-series GPUs. Things seemed normal in <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fca-en%2Fstore%2Fgaming-laptops" rel="sponsored">other regions like Canada</a>. But even after a week of paused sales and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/1jtkmhd/anyone_elses_new_blade_still_stuck_in_customs/">Reddit posts</a> discussing Blade 16 preorders getting held up in US Customs, however, Razer never responded to <em>The Verge’s</em> inquiries about what’s going on.</p><p>Now, some configurations of the 2025 Blade 16 have reappeared for US residents, though not all Blade laptops have returned to Razer’s US online store.</p><p>Before the sales pause, there were still 2024 Blade 16 models available, as well as preorders for the Blade 18. Now, those are nowhere to be seen for US customers.</p><p>Also, the 2025 Blade 16 is only available for immediate purchase with the RTX 5080 GPU. The entry-level RTX 5070 Ti and flagship RTX 5090 configurations are only listed with “notify me” buttons.</p><p>And even more curious: the 5090 config is limited to 64GB of RAM and 4TB of storage for $4,899.99, but the review spec that Razer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/638930/razer-blade-16-2025-rtx-5090-gaming-laptop-impressions-price">sent us for testing</a> with 32GB / 1TB for $4,499.99 isn’t available.</p><div><p>What’s also still unavailable is any pricing on the new <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-pc-accessories%2Frazer-adjustable-laptop-stand" rel="sponsored">Razer Adjustable Laptop Stand</a>. But on the Canadian Razer site, you can find that stand <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fca-en%2Fgaming-laptops-accessories%2FRazer-Adjustable-Laptop-Stand%2FRC21-02330100-R3U1" rel="sponsored">with a $99.99 price</a>, as well as the <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fca-en%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-16%2FRZ09-05289EN4-R3U1" rel="sponsored">review spec of the 5090 Blade 16</a> and <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fca-en%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-18%2FRZ09-05297ER3-R3U1" rel="sponsored">preorders for the Blade 18</a>.</p></div><p>We’ve reached out to Razer to try and get clarification about what’s going on.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
