            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/reviews/658137/gigabyte-aorus-master-16-gaming-laptop-rtx-5080-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 is a gaming laptop, and it sure looks like one. It’s an inch thick, weighs 5.5 pounds, and is awash in RGB lighting, stylized text, and curved plastic. </p><p>This Aorus Master offers powerful hardware and a lovely high-res, high-refresh OLED display. It’s the first of several laptops we’re reviewing with the GeForce RTX 5080, Nvidia’s second-fastest laptop graphics card of this generation. At $3,100, it’s actually a few hundred dollars less than similarly powerful models from Razer, Lenovo, and Asus, and over a thousand dollars less than laptops with the RTX 5090, Nvidia’s fastest GPU.</p><p>But in exchange for being a little cheaper than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336394/asus-rog-strix-scar-16-18-specs-price-ces-2025">its direct competitors</a>, the Aorus Master <em>feels</em> a little cheap, and its built-in software includes a useless AI chatbot but no custom fan controls. And those fans get <em>loud</em>.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->3100</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Very good game performance from the RTX 5080 GPU</li><li>Lovely 2.5K 240Hz OLED display</li><li>Slightly less expensive than other 5080 competitors</li><li>Solid port selection</li><li>User-replaceable RAM and SSDs</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Fans can get distractingly loud</li><li>Meager battery life</li><li>Plasticky build</li><li>Included 1TB SSD storage is a little slow</li><li>GiMate software is clunky and bad, and its AI chatbot is even worse</li></ul></div></div></div><p>Like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/649577/razer-blade-16-2025-rtx-5090-review">Razer Blade 16</a>, the Aorus Master 16 comes with a 16-inch 2560 x 1600 OLED display. The Aorus’s panel isn’t quite as accurate as the Blade’s — with <em>slightly </em>lower color reproduction — but it’s just as bright and about as pleasing to the eye in regular use. It’s got punchy colors that aren’t oversaturated, and its 2.5K resolution and maximum 240Hz refresh rate enable games, websites, and videos to look sharp and smooth.</p><div><div><p id="component-report-card"><h2><strong>Component report card:</strong></h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Screen:</strong> A</span></li><li><span><strong>Webcam:</strong> C</span></li><li><span><strong>Mic: </strong>C</span></li><li><span><strong>Keyboard:</strong> B</span></li><li><span><strong>Touchpad:</strong> B</span></li><li><span><strong>Port selection:</strong> B</span></li><li><span><strong>Speakers:</strong> C</span></li><li><span><strong>Number of ugly stickers to remove:</strong> 2</span></li></ul></div></div><p>By contrast, the plastic screen bezel is a bit ugly, and the Aorus Master as a whole isn’t much of a looker. Its plasticky build feels dated and a little low-rentcheap compared to the more grown-up-looking Lenovo Legion Pro 7i or the all-out RGB bombast of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336394/asus-rog-strix-scar-16-18-specs-price-ces-2025">Asus’ ROG Strix Scar</a>, with its wraparound light bar and animated LED matrix on the lid. The lid of the Aorus opens easily with one hand, but the screen can wobble. And the diagonal-line designs in its vents and branding across its trackpad look cheesy. It has “Team up. Fight on” written on the lid for some reason, and it even projects the Aorus wordmark below the rear exhaust fans, which is as gauche here as it is on the <a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/the-ten-most-ridiculous-car-design-details-1743426644/#:~:text=2.)%20Door%20Projector%20Puddle%20Lights">doors of luxury cars</a>.</p><p>While I’ll poke fun at the Aorus’ tryhard design, Gigabyte gets credit for focusing on what counts: the screen, GPU, CPU, ports, and even user-upgradeable RAM and storage. The keyboard and trackpad are solid, with good tactile feedback. The keyboard has a 1.7mm key travel and the trackpad, while a little loud, easily clicks even near its top hinge. </p><div id=":R29dlhr96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The right side ports include USB-A, USB-C, headphone jack, and microSD slot.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>On the left are power (barrel plug), ethernet, HDMI, USB-A, and Thunderbolt 5</em>.</figcaption></p></div></div><p>The 1080p webcam, built-in mics, and speakers aren’t anything special, but you’ll get through video calls looking and sounding fine in most lighting. The speakers sound decently full for music, but dialog is flat. It can be slightly difficult to clearly hear spoken lines in games against loud music and sound effects, especially since you’ll also be competing with the Aorus’ fans.</p><p>Fan noise is my biggest hangup with the laptop. In graphically intensive games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/617587/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-xbox-steam"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a> or <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1749860%2FLushfoil_Photography_Sim%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Lushfoil Photography Sim</em></a> it’s loud and irritating enough that you find yourself cranking the game volume or reaching for a pair of headphones.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The keyboard only has three-zone RGB lighting instead of per-key customization, but the see-though WASD and adjacent keys are fun.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>My wife is used to hearing the fans of gaming laptops in our shared home office, but at one point the Aorus made her turn to me and say, “What the hell is going on over there?”</p><p>I was playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/649795/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-release-date"><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></a> on a 4K external monitor, and the fans were audible even in the next room, especially during initial shader compiling. At peak rpm, they sound like someone running a small vacuum cleaner across the room. The fans on the Razer Blade 16 and ROG Strix Scar 16 are noticeably quieter and less annoying.</p><div id=":R3pdlhr96:"><div><div><p><figcaption><em>Always be teaming. Always be fighting.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The holographic nameplate is one of three Aorus brandings on the keyboard deck and screen bezel.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The front-facing light bar has three-zone RGB and the rear-facing has two zones of color.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>And unlike Razer Synapse or Asus Armoury Crate, Gigabyte’s GiMate software doesn’t let you tweak the fan curves, only choose between four presets. Switching the laptop from game mode to balanced, and the fans from performance to normal can cut the noise a bit with minimal sacrifice to framerates. Though, even in this mode, the fans can still go loud when necessary. And turbo mode is solely for masochists; it pegs the fans at 100 percent the whole time.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>System</h3></th><th><h3>Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 / RTX 5080 / Core Ultra 9 275HX / 32GB / 1TB</h3></th><th><h3>Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 / RTX 5080 / Core Ultra 9 275HX / 32GB / 2TB</h3></th><th><h3>Razer Blade 16 (2025) / RTX 5090 / Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 / 32GB / 2TB</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Geekbench 6 CPU Single</td><td>3051</td><td>3113</td><td>2968</td></tr><tr><td>Geekbench 6 CPU Multi</td><td>19334</td><td>19709</td><td>15922</td></tr><tr><td>Geekbench 6 GPU (OpenCL)</td><td>197539</td><td>200189</td><td>213016</td></tr><tr><td>Cinebench 2024 Single</td><td>136</td><td>137</td><td>119</td></tr><tr><td>Cinebench 2024 Multi</td><td>1955</td><td>1965</td><td>1287</td></tr><tr><td>PugetBench for Premiere Pro</td><td>13416</td><td>13409</td><td>12593</td></tr><tr><td>PugetBench for Photoshop</td><td>8648</td><td>8482</td><td>8679</td></tr><tr><td>Sustained SSD reads (MB/s)</td><td>4802.21</td><td>6832.06</td><td>6726.25</td></tr><tr><td>Sustained SSD writes (MB/s)</td><td>3893.34</td><td>6550.21</td><td>4931.41</td></tr><tr><td>3DMark Time Spy</td><td>20520</td><td>20977</td><td>22498</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>GiMate’s other features are sparse, limited in scope, and worse than native solutions within Windows 11 and Nvidia’s GPU settings. Its operating modes are just shortcuts to Windows power settings. In some cases, GiMate simply opens Microsoft Copilot or Nvidia’s Control Panel and Broadcast App. But its interactions with other apps get even weirder when you unplug the charger and GiMate prompts you to switch to integrated graphics and kill apps it says are using the discrete GPU. This MUX switch functionality is already handled by Nvidia’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Frtx-laptops-advanced-optimus%2F" rel="sponsored">Advanced Optimus</a>, so I’m not sure why Gigabyte brute forces it this way.</p><p>The GiMate AI chatbot, another misfire, allegedly helps you optimize your laptop. I asked it to tell me the difference between Game Mode and Balanced, and it just enabled Game Mode. You can ask it to do basics like toggle Wi-Fi on or off, but it takes much longer than doing it yourself. That could be useful for someone unfamiliar with computers, but this is a gaming machine.</p><p>Bad software and noisy fans aside, the Aorus Master 16 is mostly a good performer. Its 24-core Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU, RTX 5080 GPU, and 32GB of RAM easily handle multitasking across various productivity apps, though it can’t last more than six hours on charge, even using power saving mode. It did okay with some hefty photo editing, but on two occasions on battery power Lightroom Classic slowed to the point where I had to close and restart it — not ideal when you need to edit quickly.</p><p>In gaming performance, the Aorus Master is right in line with an Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 using the same CPU and GPU for $200 more. The Aorus Master is usually on par or a frame or two better in 4K and 2.5K benchmark tests of <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. And like the Asus, that puts the Gigabyte within reach of the flagship RTX 5090 in the $4,500 Razer Blade 16. In our tests, the 5090 bested it by an average of just 3.5 fps without frame generation, and by up to 10 fps with frame generation. Those are pretty minimal differences, making the mobile 5080 a much better value — at least, compared to the Blade 16’s power-limited 5090. We haven’t yet tested a laptop with an uncapped 5090. </p><p>I averaged 143 fps in <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> on a 4K display with high settings and frame generation turned on in the game’s prologue. Turning off frame gen dropped it to an average of 99 fps. When I switched to ultra settings in the open world I saw an average of 50 fps without frame gen and 77 with. The one thing I couldn’t turn off was the incessant fan noise.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</strong><span><figcaption><em>The lid has a striped pattern across it that’s most visible when it catches the light.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>If you always play with headphones on, you can mitigate the Gigabyte’s biggest issue. But while the Aorus Master 16 is one of the cheapest 5080 laptops, there are plenty of interesting competitors for just a little more. The <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.asus.com%2Fus%2F90nr0ld1-m005n0-rog-strix-scar-16-2025.html" rel="sponsored">Asus ROG Strix Scar 16</a>, for example, looks cooler and has quieter fans; the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/omen-max-gaming-laptop-16-ah0097nr" rel="sponsored">HP Omen Max</a> and<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1875949-REG%2Flenovo_83f50052us_16_legion_pro_7.html" rel="sponsored"> Lenovo Legion Pro 7i</a> both have OLED screens like the Gigabyte. I think I still prefer the Gigabyte’s OLED to the Asus’ Mini LED, but I need to spend more time with the Asus before making that call. I’ll also be testing the Lenovo and HP; their OLED screens could make them closer competitors to the Gigabyte.</p><p>There’s a lot to like in the Aorus Master 16, but it’s not as easy to love. Its powerful hardware and brilliant OLED display are a treat to game on, but the lackluster GiMate software, basic build quality, and at times maddening fan noise feels like someone knocking the ice cream cone from your hand right after you get it.</p><div><div><p id="2025-gigabyte-aorus-master-16-specs-as-reviewed"><h2>2025 Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 specs (as reviewed)</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Display: </strong>16-inch (2560 x 1600) 240Hz OLED</span></li><li><span><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX</span></li><li><span><strong>GPU:</strong> Nvidia RTX 5080</span></li><li><span><strong>RAM:</strong> 32GB DDR5 5600MHz (user-replaceable)</span></li><li><span><strong>Storage:</strong> 1TB M.2 PCIe Gen 5 NVMe (with one extra Gen 4 slot)</span></li><li><span><strong>Webcam:</strong> 1080p, Windows Hello</span></li><li><span><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4</span></li><li><span><strong>Ports:</strong> 2x USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, 1x Thunderbolt 5 USB-C (left side), 1x Thunderbolt 4 USB-C (right side), HDMI 2.1, RJ-45 ethernet, microSD slot (UHS-II), 3.5mm combo audio jack, DC power</span></li><li><span><strong>Weight:</strong> 5.5 pounds</span></li><li><span><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 14.01 x 10 x 0.91 — 1.18 inches</span></li><li><span><strong>Battery:</strong> 99Wh</span></li><li><span><strong>Price:</strong> $3,099.99</span></li></ul></div></div><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/660635/polygon-valnet-vox-media-new-owner-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Polygon</em>, <em>The Verge’s</em> former sister site dedicated to covering gaming and entertainment, is now owned by Valnet, a company that owns more than 27 different brands covering gaming, entertainment, sports, travel, and more. The transition is, let’s say, <em>ongoing: </em>a day after the acquisition, the site still said it was a Vox Media property, and the site’s coverage continued more or less uninterrupted. </p><p>But Valnet has indeed acquired <em>Polygon</em>, so to learn more about the deal, why the company acquired it, and the future of the site, I got on the phone with Valnet’s head of mergers and acquisitions, Rony Arzoumanian.</p><p>Polygon is a “triple-A gaming brand” that Valnet has been of “high interest” for “some time,” Arzoumanian said. Valnet’s gaming portfolio also includes <em>GameRant</em>, <em>TheGamer</em>, <em>Fextralife</em>, <em>DualShockers</em>, <em>Hardcore Gamer</em>, and <em>OpenCritic</em>. Arzoumanian said the company is “bullish” on gaming coverage. </p><div><p>“We think Polygon has a lot of potential and could be much more.”</p></div><p>Valnet initiated the <em>Polygon</em> deal, and Arzoumanian said the conversations started a “few months ago.” He declined to share the terms of the deal. </p><p>Going forward, Valnet wants to ensure that <em>Polygon</em> has the “deepest” coverage of the gaming space, Arzoumanian said. He declined to share specific coverage expectations, but said Valnet will “do what’s right for <em>Polygon</em>” and that “we think <em>Polygon</em> has a lot of potential and could be much more.” </p><p>Around 10 existing <em>Polygon</em> staffers are moving over to the site’s new owner, Arzoumanian said. Matt Patches, who was previously <em>Polygon’s</em> executive editor, is heading things up for now. Valnet is also “rebuilding” the team, investing in its operations, and making sure it builds <em>Polygon</em> “for the next five to ten years,” according to Arzoumanian.</p><p>Valnet wants to recruit “triple-A” writers and editors for <em>Polygon</em>, Arzoumanian said. When I asked about what the balance might be of full-time hires and contractors, Arzoumanian deferred on specifics, but said “we will do it right.” Arzoumanian also deferred on whether <em>Polygon</em> would hire another editor-in-chief, saying that right now, the focus is on ensuring continuity following the close of the deal.</p><p>The sale resulted in most of <em>Polygon’s</em> staff leaving or being laid off, including <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plante.bsky.social/post/3lo4mn4noqc26">former editor-in-chief Chris Plante</a>. Chris Grant, Vox Media’s group publisher of <em>The Verge</em> and formerly <em>Polygon</em>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/charstring.com/post/3lo56isadnc2g">said that</a> “Valnet literally refused to meet with me or answer a single question of mine throughout this process.” (It all added to what turned into a brutal day for gaming journalism, which also included the news of <a href="https://kotaku.com/giant-bomb-fandom-dan-ryckert-jeff-grubb-gerstmann-1851778728">Fandom’s changes for <em>Giant Bomb</em></a>.)</p><p>I asked Arzoumanian about Grant’s post, reading him the part of the sentence I quoted above and asking if it was true. Arzoumanian said that Valnet “predominantly dealt” with Jim Bankoff, Vox Media’s CEO, and that “I’m not in a position to answer that, unfortunately.”</p><p>Valnet plans to keep <em>Polygon’s</em> archives available, Arzoumanian said, meaning we won’t see a repeat of GameStop’s Thanos-snap disappearance <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/3/24212291/game-informer-video-game-industry-mourns">of <em>Game Informer’s</em> archives</a>. (<em>Game Informer</em>, fortunately, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">is back now</a>.) When I asked if Valnet plans to introduce AI-generated stories onto <em>Polygon</em>, which has been a disconcerting trend <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158531/gannett-ai-generated-overviews-usa-today-memo">at other publications</a>, Arzoumanian said, “not at all.”</p><p>I also asked if Valnet more broadly is making changes in response to a recent report about Valnet <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/valnet-labor-lawsuit-hassan-youssef-digital-media-sweat-shop/">from <em>TheWrap</em></a>, which included an allegation from one former contributor about “almost sweatshop-level” working conditions at a Valnet publication. Arzoumanian pointed me to Valnet’s press release about <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250425504752/en/Valnet-Inc.-and-its-CEO-File-Lawsuit-Against-The-Wrap-News-Inc.-for-Defamation-Unfair-Competition-and-Other-Illegal-Actions">its recent defamation lawsuit</a> filed against <em>TheWrap.</em></p><p>A year from now, Arzoumanian said he doesn’t expect things to be that different. Valnet wants to maintain course and keep investing in the brand. He deferred to the operations side of Valnet on whether the company wants <em>Polygon</em> to switch to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2018/9/4/17689100/polygon-reviews-no-scores">scored reviews.</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Dell, for instance, <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/microsoft-corporation-xbox-series-x-1tb-white/apd/ad180049/gaming-gaming-accessories/" rel="sponsored">is still offering</a> the digital-only<strong> Xbox Series X (1TB)</strong> for $449.99, saving you $100 on the new MSRP.

The Series X offers support for native 4K resolution, for example, while the smaller Series S is primarily designed for 1440p gaming.
