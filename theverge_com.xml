            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337949/nvidia-ace-ai-npcs-pubg-ally-teammate<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia has spent the last two years showing off its digital “ACE” characters that can have in-game conversations with you using generative AI. But at CES 2025, the company is taking the ACE characters a step further by showing how they can be “autonomous game characters” — including, sometime this year, a teammate to help you get a chicken dinner in <em>PUBG</em>. </p><p>Nvidia says that ACE characters can use AI to “perceive, plan, and act like human players,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fnvidia-ace-autonomous-ai-companions-pubg-naraka-bladepoint%2F">per a blog post</a>. “Powered by generative AI, ACE will enable living, dynamic game worlds with companions that comprehend and support player goals, and enemies that adapt dynamically to player tactics.” The characters are powered by “small language models (SLMs)” that are “capable of planning at human-like frequencies required for realistic decision making” as well as “multi-modal SLMs for vision and audio that allow AI characters to hear audio cues and perceive their environment.”</p><p>As for how that will work in <em>PUBG</em>, you’ll be able to team up with the “<em>PUBG</em> Ally,” which Nvidia and <em>PUBG</em> publisher Krafton are calling the “world’s first Co-Playable Character (CPC).” The Ally will be able to “communicate using game-specific lingo, provide real-time strategic recommendations, find and share loot, drive vehicles, and fight other human players using the game’s extensive arsenal of weapons,” Nvidia says. </p><p>Basically, it sounds like an AI teammate you can talk with natural language who’s supposed to be as capable as a human. And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEKUSMqrbzQ">a video</a> shows the Ally indeed helping a player find specific loot, bringing over a vehicle, and attempting to flank opposing players. But the video is heavily edited and isn’t live, so I’m skeptical that the Ally will work as well as is being shown here.</p><p>AI characters built with ACE are coming to other games, too. <em>Naraka: Bladepoint Mobile PC Version</em> will get a “a local inference AI Teammate feature” in March 2025, while <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> on PC will get the feature “later in 2025,” according to Nvidia’s blog post. “AI Teammates powered by NVIDIA ACE can join your party, battling alongside you, finding you specific items that you need, swapping gear, offering suggestions on skills to unlock, and making plays that’ll help you achieve victory.”</p><p>Krafton’s upcoming life simulation game called <em>inZOI </em>will also get CPCs called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk9z1upOj3U">“Smart Zoi.”</a> And Nvidia says that ACE characters can be bosses, too, and they’ll be used for boss encounters in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8XeiZ4djKw&amp;t=2s">Wemade Next’s <em>MIR5</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The 2025 Scar 16 and 18 come with RGB lights all the way around the bottom of the chassis as well as a user-programmable LED dot-matrix display on the lid, as seen on other ROG devices <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24023549/asus-rog-phone-8-pro-ai-price-release-date-specs-features-gaming-smartphone">like Asus’ gaming phones</a>. </p><p>Beneath the flashy exterior, the Scar 16 and 18 can be maxed out with an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor and Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 GPU. It can also be configured with up to 64GB of DDR5-5600 RAM and a 2TB PCIe Gen4 SSD. The ROG Nebula HDR display comprises a 16:10 2.5K Mini LED panel with a peak brightness of 1,200 nits and a 240Hz refresh rate. There are two Thunderbolt 5 ports included, and the design allows for easy access to the bottom panel for component upgrades. </p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</p><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The Strix Scar 16 and 18 have all the cooling tech you’d expect from a gaming laptop of this caliber, including an end-to-end vapor chamber and sandwiched heatsink. Combined with the Conductonaut Extreme liquid metal treatment on the GPU and CPU, Asus claims that it can keep fan noise levels to a library-like 45dB, even during extended gaming sessions.</p><p>On top of all that, the ROG Strix Scar comes with the aforementioned light show. Asus calls it AniMe Vision, and you can customize it to display personalized animations and sync it with any other AniMe Vision devices you own. Download some prebaked artwork or cook up your own using <a href="https://rog.asus.com/content/anime-matrix-pixel-editor/">Asus’ pixel editor</a> — the choice is yours.</p><p>The ROG Strix Scar starts at $2,599; Asus says its new gaming laptops will begin shipping in February.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24336135/asus-thunderbolt-5-external-gpu-graphics-xg-mobile-ces-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This smoky black translucent box isn’t a gaming PC — instead, it might be the most powerful single-cable portable docking station ever conceived. When you plug your laptop or handheld into the just-announced 2025 Asus XG Mobile, it promises to add the power of Nvidia’s top-flight GeForce RTX 5090 mobile chip, <em>and</em> up to 140 watts of electricity, <em>and</em> two monitors, <em>and</em> a USB and SD-card-reading hub, <em>and</em> 5Gbps ethernet simultaneously.</p><div><p>That’s because it’s the world’s first* Thunderbolt 5 external graphics card and one of the first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/17/24247303/kensington-thunderbolt-5-dock-sd5000t5-eq-price-release-date">Thunderbolt 5 docks</a>, using <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23869802/intel-thunderbolt-5-launch-specs">the new 80 gigabit per second bidirectional link</a> to do more things with a single cable than we’ve ever seen before. </p></div><div><figcaption><em>The 2025 XG Mobile’s ports — and a standard AC power connector, because the power supply lives inside.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>And if you’re keeping score, I’m pretty sure it’s also the first standards-based portable eGPU with an Nvidia graphics chip. While Asus’ last-gen XG Mobile also boasted up to an Nvidia 4090, you could only tap into that power with a proprietary port found only on a few Asus devices. (Its USB4 and Oculink rivals have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/2/23747057/gpd-g1-dock-crowdfunding-announce-oculink">mostly featured the AMD Radeon 7600M XT</a>.) </p><p>None of that makes it the most powerful eGPU out there, as I currently have no performance figures from Asus, and you can definitely go further with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24319196/egpus-continue-to-evolve">bigger docks that can fit desktop graphics cards</a> rather than mobile GPUs. But Asus rep Anthony Spence tells me that the Thunderbolt 5 link does give you up to 64Gbps of bandwidth for its Nvidia graphics — more than USB4 and tied with Oculink — and I’m wowed that Asus managed to fit all this <em>and</em> a 350W power supply (no external brick!) into a sub-2.2-pound package with a fold-out kickstand.</p><p>Asus says it’s even 25 percent lighter and 18 percent smaller than the previous proprietary model. It’s got HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 2.1 for video output and a pair of 10Gbps USB-A ports, in case you’re wondering.</p><div><figcaption><em>Note that it comes with a little vertical stand, too.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Asus</cite></p></div><p>When it arrives later in Q1, it won’t come cheap. Spence says the top-tier XG Mobile with an RTX 5090 laptop chip will cost $2199.99 — meaning you could almost certainly cobble together a more powerful (but stationary) solution yourself. That said, Asus does plan to sell a lower-end $1,199.99 version with Nvidia’s mobile RTX 5070 Ti. Again, you’re paying for compact power here rather than maximum bang for the buck.</p><div><figcaption><em>Yes, that Asus ROG logo is light-up, programmable RGB using the company’s Aura Sync. You can also make out the top-mounted SD card receptacle.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>While it should work with any Thunderbolt 4 or USB4 laptop or handheld, including Asus’ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">own ROG Ally X</a>, you’ll likely want the still-rare Thunderbolt 5 to get the full GPU bandwidth here. Finding a Thunderbolt 5 computer that doesn’t already have a powerful discrete GPU might be tough, but perhaps some of 2025’s thin-and-light laptops will seize this opportunity to double as potent travel desktops. </p><div><p><em>*We are aware of </em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/eGPU/comments/1cubwro/thunderbolt_5_egpu_enclosure_pictured_has_3_tb/"><em>one possible Thunderbolt 5 eGPU enclosure</em></a><em>, to house a desktop graphics card, but that WinStar has barely even been detailed yet. </em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
