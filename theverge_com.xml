            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/631610/nanoleaf-pc-screen-mirror-lightstrip-usb<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nanoleaf has announced that it will be offering one of the easiest ways to add an immersive lighting experience to your gaming PC. Its new PC Screen Mirror Lightstrip features 75 color-changing LEDs that can be attached to the back of your display to cast a colored glow on a wall that will then mirror or react to what’s happening onscreen. And instead of requiring additional hardware like a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22725979/govee-tv-backlight-bars-review-specs-price">control box or a camera</a>, the lightstrip plugs directly into a PC’s USB port.</p><div><p>The PC Screen Mirror Lightstrip is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnanoleaf.me%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2Fessentials%2Flightstrips%2Fpc-screen-mirror-lightstrip%2F" rel="sponsored">available for preorder now through Nanoleaf’s online store</a> for $49.99 and is expected to ship at the end of March 2025.</p></div><p>It’s designed for use with monitors up to 32 inches in size and features a flexible adhesive zigzag design, making it easier to attach to the back of your display without the lightstrip getting twisted during installation. If you’re using a smaller monitor, excess length can be trimmed off without damaging the lightstrip.</p><p>In lieu of a control box, Nanoleaf’s new lightstrip pairs with the company’s desktop app, which lets you choose one of 16 million different colors or create custom lighting animations. It can also mirror and match the broad colors and tones of a game you’re playing, making the action feel like it’s extending into your room. Or you can use the lightstrip as an audio visualizer, with light effects that match the beats of music you’re playing on your PC.</p><p>If you have a Nanoleaf Premium subscription ($1.99 per month or $19.99 per year), the lightstrip can be used with the company’s more advanced Orchestrator mode that detects and analyzes songs “to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnanoleaf.me%2Fen-CA%2Fnewsroom%2Fpress-release%2Fces-2025%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored">create dynamic colour palettes</a> and animations tailored to each track.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/the-vergecast/631619/switch-2-steam-deck-handheld-consoles-vergecast<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/david-pierce">David Pierce</a> <span>is editor-at-large and Vergecast co-host with over a decade of experience covering consumer tech. Previously, at Protocol, The Wall Street Journal, and Wired.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">The Nintendo Switch 2 is nigh</a>. Nigh-ish, anyway. When it does launch later this year, it might start another revolution in portable gaming, as millions of people are able to play from their couch, their bed, the train, and anywhere else. That was also true of the first Switch, though, and as big a hit as it was it didn’t spark an industry-wide shift to handhelds the way some people expected. So what gives?</p><p>On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a>, we dig in on the state of the handheld console wars. <em>The Verge</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister">Sean Hollister</a> joins the show to tell us about what we’ve learned <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/618709/steam-deck-3-year-anniversary-handheld-gaming-shipments-idc">about the Steam Deck’s success</a>, and whether the sales numbers we’re seeing reflect an exciting new market or a surprisingly static one. We also talk about why Sony and Microsoft have (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305337/sony-handheld-gaming-console-playstation-nintendo-microsoft">so far</a>) avoided building Steam Deck-like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305337/sony-handheld-gaming-console-playstation-nintendo-microsoft">gadgets of their own</a>, and why <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/617613/lenovo-legion-go-s-review-feels-good-plays-bad">the Windows handheld universe</a> remains a bit disappointing. We all think handheld, convertible consoles could be the future, but it might take a little longer than we thought.</p><p>After that, David reports on a trip he took to Florida to see <a href="https://www.theverge.com/sport/629858/tgl-golf-tech-espn-sports-future">behind the scenes at TGL</a>, a golf league featuring some of the highest-tech sporting gear you’ve ever seen anywhere. Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy, and some of the other biggest names in golf are betting big that this combination of video games, augmented reality, and live action can be a hit both on TV and in your social feeds. But it also raises some questions, like: how do you know when you can trust the computer? And how big is a 53-foot-tall screen, really?</p><p>Finally, we answer a question from the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about why you might upgrade from a normal iPad <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ipad/626647/apple-ipad-air-review-2025">to an iPad Air</a>. We’ve heard from a lot of students and note-takers the last few weeks who say the extra stylus support, and a few power-hungry apps, make the extra expense worth it.</p><p>If you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started:</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
