            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339466/nintendo-switch-2-pc-gaming-handhelds-steamos<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first Nintendo Switch basically had the road to itself, and Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">instantly proved</a> just how awesome a hybrid console and handheld could be, leading to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150926/nintendo-expects-switch-to-become-its-best-selling-console-ever-this-year">massive success</a>. The next Switch is imminent, but it will launch into a world that’s packed with very capable handheld gaming PCs that could present an interesting challenge to Nintendo, especially following news from CES 2025.</p><p>Valve’s Steam Deck kicked off the handheld gaming PC push in large part because its Linux-based SteamOS makes playing your games just about as easy as it is on consoles. That’s why one of the biggest CES announcements is that Valve is going to let people install SteamOS on other handhelds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck">as soon as April</a>, potentially making the entire handheld PC gaming market a lot more appealing.</p><p>The first official non-Valve device with SteamOS is set to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">Lenovo’s $499 Legion Go S</a>, which launches in May. But it’s not hard to imagine a near-term future where many other hardware makers announce their own SteamOS handhelds, meaning the magic of SteamOS might be available in all kinds of interesting devices very soon. (And, hopefully, the increased competition means Valve will make the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884863/valve-steam-deck-2-refresh-upgrade-cpu-2025">eventual next Steam Deck</a> <em>really</em> good.)</p><div><figcaption><em>The Lenovo Legion Go S next to a Steam Deck OLED.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>CES 2025 featured a bunch of other handheld gaming hardware, too, like the chonk that is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335423/acer-handheld-gaming-pc-nitro-blaze-8-11-specs-price">Acer’s Nitro Blaze 11</a>. It has a gigantic 10.95-inch screen, detachable controllers, and a kickstand. It’s huge! Intel and Tencent also made a handheld with an 11-inch screen, and theirs <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337860/intel-brought-a-big-honking-stereo-3d-handheld-gaming-pc-to-ces-2025">has stereo 3D</a>. My colleague Sean Hollister finally got to see <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338654/i-finally-touched-the-msi-claw-8-ai-plus">the MSI Claw 8 AI Plus</a>. Razer made <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24336841/razer-handheld-dock-chroma-pc-remote-play-price-availability">a docking station</a> that works with handheld gaming PCs. And in a CES panel, Microsoft promised news about changes to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming">the handheld Windows experience</a> for later this year, which could improve things for people who already own Windows-based hardware.</p><p>That’s a lot of cool stuff! But Nintendo is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_(character)#:~:text=In%20a%20match%20against%20boxing,is%20given%20at%20800%20pounds.">800-pound gorilla</a> in the room, and as interesting as all of the PC gaming hardware is, the Switch’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">imminent</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">successor</a> will almost certainly be a very compelling upgrade. The original Switch was released <em>nearly eight years ago</em>, so the successor will likely be much more powerful and will probably have splashy new games in marquee franchises like <em>Super Mario</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. (I’d bet already-announced Switch games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> will get some kind of boost on the next Switch, too.)</p><p>Right out of the gate, Nintendo’s new console will also have an enormous library. The company already announced its next console will be compatible with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation">original Switch games</a> — a catalog that includes many of the indie hits that are also some of the best games on handheld PCs.</p><p>Back in 2017, when the original Switch launched, there wasn’t anything like it. The Switch’s successor will compete in a much more crowded field and one that’s getting even more crowded after CES 2025. Hopefully, the competition means everyone makes better hardware and better games. It’s a great time for handhelds.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s the third Developer Direct in a row, making it an annual look at what’s ahead for Xbox for the year. Like last year’s event, Microsoft will provide some updates on Xbox games that are planned for release in 2025, including feature <em>South of Midnight, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, and <em>DOOM: The Dark Ages.</em></p><p>Microsoft’s teaser image for the event also includes a teaser for an unannounced “brand new game” Xbox game. Last year’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24041665/xbox-developer-direct-2024-news-announcements-trailers">Developer Direct featured</a> a first look at Bethesda’s <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>.</p><p>The Xbox Developer Direct will likely follow a similar format to the last two events, with no hosts and around 45 minutes of gameplay and announcements. The Xbox Developer Direct will take place at 1PM ET / 10PM PT / 6PM UK on January 23rd and will be streamed live on on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/xbox">Twitch</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=1025X1701640&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fuser%2Fxbox%2Fhub&amp;xcust=__vg0107awD__23795287__________________https://www.google.com/">YouTube</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
