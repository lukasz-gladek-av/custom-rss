            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/667211/persona-5-the-phantom-x-pc-mobile-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-webster">Andrew Webster</a> <span>is an entertainment editor covering streaming, virtual worlds, and every single Pokémon video game. Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s not the next mainline entry in the series, but Atlus did announced a new <em>Persona</em> game today. It’s called <em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em>, and it’s a spinoff that’s launching on both mobile and PC on June 26th.</p><p>As the name implies, <em>The Phantom X</em> is set in the same universe as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15098458/persona-5-review-ps4-ps3">2017’s <em>Persona 5</em></a>, and will feature a new main character leading a new band of Phantom Thieves. This story takes place in “a mysterious Tokyo where desires have been lost.” The structure of <em>The Phantom X</em> sounds a lot like traditional <em>Persona</em>, as players will experience normal high school life during the day, before heading off to explore dungeons at night. There’s also turn-based combat and a “synergy system” where players can form close ties with NPCs in the game.</p><p>There are also multiplayer elements, including guilds which allow “players to interact with one another in-game.” From the sounds of it, <em>The Phantom X</em> is an attempt to blend the single-player RPGs the franchise is known for with live-service mobile games designed to keep players coming back. It’s hard to say right now how well those two sides will gel together; it’s also not clear at the moment if the game will be free-to-play. Hopefully it still has curry.</p><p>Given it’s been nearly a decade since <em>Persona 5</em> launched, Atlus releasing another spinoff will likely be a disappointment to some fans expecting any sign of life from <em>Persona 6</em> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona">at least <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> turned out well</a>). Then again, <em>The Phantom X</em> at least looks the part, and might be a good way to fill in the time before the next major release.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
