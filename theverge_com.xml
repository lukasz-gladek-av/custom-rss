Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia’s Arm-based PC chip could make its debut in Alienware’s laptops later this year or in early 2026, according to a report from the <a href="https://money.udn.com/money/story/5612/8778234">Taiwanese publication <em>United Daily News</em></a>. The chipmaking giant is reportedly working with MediaTek to develop an accelerated processing unit (APU) that combines an Arm-powered CPU with Nvidia’s Blackwell GPU architecture.</p><p>Nvidia is already popular in traditional gaming laptops using Intel or AMD chips, but an Arm CPU entry may well improve the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24215905/microsoft-windows-on-arm-gaming-laptops-notepad">Windows on Arm gaming situation</a>. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X chips have to run games emulated using Microsoft’s Prism software, and game compatibility and performance is severely limited on Qualcomm’s GPUs right now. </p><p>We first heard rumors about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/23/23929240/nvidia-amd-cpu-arm-pc-chips-2025-release-rumors">Nvidia’s Arm-based chip in 2023</a>, which could serve as yet another competitor to Intel’s chips and the Arm processors built by Qualcomm. Last week, <a href="https://youtu.be/6tASUo7UqNw?si=d8LoV-9bkP2JQ0V0&amp;t=2330">a video from YouTuber Moore’s Law is Dead</a> showed off what appears to be a leaked image of Nvidia’s rumored APU, with sources suggesting it could run between 80W and 120W. </p><p>In January, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during an investor’s presentation that the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338939/nvidia-jensen-huang-hints-arm-desktop-cpu">has “plans” for the Arm-based CPU</a> installed inside Digits, its personal AI supercomputer, <em>Reuters</em> reported at the time. Dell CEO Michael Dell also hinted at the possibility of launching an AI PC with Nvidia, as he replied, “come back next year” when asked about Nvidia’s presence in the AI PC market <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/dell-and-nvidia-ceos-hint-nvidia-ai-pc-chip-may-arrive-next-year">during an interview in 2024</a>.</p><p>Nvidia isn’t the only company that could challenge Qualcomm’s dominance in the Arm-based CPU space. MediaTek is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/mediatek-designs-arm-based-chip-microsofts-ai-laptops-say-sources-2024-06-11/">also rumored to be working on an Arm chip</a> of its own, while recent reports also <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-is-allegedly-working-on-arm-based-sound-wave-apus-for-microsofts-surface-laptops-next-year">suggest AMD is developing</a> an Arm-based chip for Microsoft Surface laptops.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He previously worked at <em>Android Police</em> and <em>Tech Advisor</em>.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you’re picking up a Switch 2 this week, resist the urge to remove the screen protector you’ll find applied to the console out of the box. This is actually a “film layer designed to prevent fragments scattering in the event of damage,” and the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Feu%2Fmedia%2Fdownloads%2Flegal_1%2Finformation_for_online_retailers_and_distributors%2Fnintendo_switch_20%2FMXAS_BEE_S_E5G_WWWBooklet1_1.pdf" rel="sponsored">Switch 2’s European safety manual</a>, spotted by fan site <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/nintendo-tells-users-not-to-remove-the-film-layer-from-the-switch-2-screen/"><em>NintendoSoup</em></a>, specifically warns not to peel it off.</p><p>This advice <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/8/22715422/nintendo-switch-oled-anti-scattering-film-protective-cover">might sound familiar</a>, because the Switch OLED had a similar anti-scattering layer with the same warning. In both cases, the goal is to minimize the spread of glass splinters if the screen gets smashed. Foldable phones also commonly ship with protective anti-scratch films that mustn’t be removed, which infamously caused problems when the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18412572/samsung-galaxy-fold-screen-damage-statement-inspect-screen-protector">first Galaxy Fold reviewers did exactly that</a>.</p><p>The Switch 2 safety document includes a host of other helpful tips / attempts to cover Nintendo from lawsuits, ranging from the inane (“Be aware of your surroundings”) to the unexpectedly technical (“Pay attention to the load capacity of the circuit when choosing where to plug the product in.”) Nintendo recommends you avoid using the Switch 2 in dusty, smoky, or humid environments; that you stick to playing it in temperatures between 5 and 35 degrees Celsius; and that you charge the batteries at least once every six months. </p><p>The new Joy-Con controllers get their own set of warnings. There’s the usual caution about using straps to avoid throwing a Joy-Con into your TV, but the document also warns against placing stickers over the controllers’ shoulder buttons, which might impede the magnets used to attach them to the console. Nintendo also recommends using a mousemat when using the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642493/nintendo-switch-mouse-controls-metroid-prime-4">new mouse control mode</a> to avoid scratching up whatever surface you’re playing on.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
