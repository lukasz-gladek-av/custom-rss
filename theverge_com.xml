In addition, 1.6 million units of hardware were sold in the US in November, which is “the lowest total for a November month since 1995 (1.4 million).”</p><p>The rising costs of consoles probably didn’t help. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series of consoles both turned five in November, but customers looking to pick up one of the consoles brand new are having to grapple with higher prices following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762410/sony-ps5-price-hike-raise-digital-pro">price</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">hikes</a> this year. Those hikes have led to an “all-time November high” for the average price paid for a new unit of video game hardware of $439, Circana says — a number that’s up 11 percent from 2024. (In November 2019, the average price was $235, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6vnwvjmk2h">according to Circana analyst Mat Piscatella</a>.)</p><p>In November, the PlayStation 5 was the month’s best-selling hardware, “in both units and dollars,” which happened for the first time since the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, according to Circana. The Switch 2 was 2nd in both units and dollars. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/844380/nex-playground-outselling-the-xbox">Nex Playground</a> was 3rd in terms of units sold, but the Xbox Series consoles ranked 3rd in dollars.</p><p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> was the best-selling game of the month, but the <em>Call of Duty</em> franchise experienced “a double-digit percentage full game dollar sales decline when compared to November 2024.” Activision announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/841290/activision-call-of-duty-modern-warefare-black-ops-back-to-back">last week</a> that it would be switching up its <em>Call of Duty</em> release strategy to not release <em>Modern Warfare</em> or <em>Black Ops</em> games back-to-back anymore.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/846693/video-game-hardware-sales-november-2025-circana]]></content:encoded>
