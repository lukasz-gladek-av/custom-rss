He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A group of tabletop game makers and other American small businesses are filed a lawsuit on Thursday against President Donald Trump and his administration to attempt to stop his tariffs. The lawsuit alleges the tariffs are “unlawful and unconstitutional” and details how they are creating challenges for the plaintiffs’ businesses.</p><p>The tabletop companies that are among the plaintiffs in the case include Stonemaier Games (which announced its involvement in the lawsuit earlier this week, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/562620/stonemaier-games-trump-tariff-lawsuit-wingspan-developer">as reported by <em>Polygon</em></a>), Spielcraft Games, Rookie Mage Games, XYZ Game Labs, and Tinkerhouse. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/politics/646604/trump-tariffs-reciprocal-pause-canada-mexico-china-de-minimis">145 percent tariffs</a> imposed on goods imported from China are a significant part of the burden, as spelled out in examples in the lawsuit:</p><div><ul><li><span>Stonemaier Games, which has its products printed at a factory in China, has imports that are “ready to ship on which it estimates it will pay millions in tariffs pursuant to the actions challenged herein.”</span></li><li><span>Spielcraft Games has paid $4,335.40 in tariffs for “a board game set” that it imported from China this month.</span></li><li><span>Rookie Mage Games has paid $3,120.80 in tariffs for “products imported from China” this month and will have to pay tariffs on “all future imports.”</span></li><li><span>XYZ Game Labs estimates that it will have to pay “substantial tariffs” on goods manufactured in China that it plans to import later this year and on “all future imports.”</span></li><li><span>Tinkerhouse is producing a “tabletop roleplaying game accessory” in China that the company has made a down payment on. The company estimates it will have to pay “substantial tariffs” on when it imports the accessory later this year. It also expects that it has to pay tariffs on “all future imports.”</span></li></ul></div><p>Other plaintiffs in the case include Princess Awesome, a clothing company, Mischief Toy Store, a toy store based in Saint Paul, MN, and others. The lawsuit was filed on Thursday with the US Court of International Trade.</p><p>The lawsuit from the small companies joins a growing list of parties fighting the tariffs in court. On Wednesday, 12 states <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/23/state-attorneys-general-lawsuit-trump-tariffs">sued the administration</a>, with New York Attorney General Letitia James calling the tariffs “unlawful” <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2025/attorney-general-james-and-governor-hochul-announce-lawsuit-against-trump">in a statement</a>. The CEO of Learning Resources, a toy company that also filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over tariffs, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tariffs-economy-trump-ceo-lawsuit-learning-resources-ceo-rick-woldenberg/">told CBS MoneyWatch</a> that “this path is catastrophic.”</p><p>However, the future of the tariffs is also murky right now, with <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/white-house-considers-slashing-china-tariffs-to-de-escalate-trade-war-6f875d69">reporting yesterday</a> that the Trump administration is thinking about reducing the tariffs on China</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The listings for both <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsuper-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-upgrade-pack-nintendo-switch-2-digital%2F6630695.p%3FskuId%3D6630695" rel="sponsored"><em>Mario Party</em></a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fkirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-star-crossed-world-upgrade-pack-nintendo-switch-2-digital%2F6630687.p%3FskuId%3D6630687" rel="sponsored"><em>Kirby</em></a> expansions went live today on retailer sites like Best Buy.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/23/22991829/nintendo-switch-kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review">very joyful Kirby</a> is getting a new Star-Crossed World mode to play, and Mario Party is getting Jamboree TV with extra mini-games. So, in addition to better graphics, you’re getting expansion-like updates as well. For those who already purchased the games at full price and buy the expansions, it will cost the same $80 ($60 original Switch game plus $20 Switch 2 Expansion) in the end as buying the game for the first time on Switch 2.</p><p>Meanwhile,<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> on the original Switch costs $69.99, and with the $9.99 expansion pack, it totals to the same $79.99 price of a new Switch 2 Edition copy. Both <em>Zelda</em> upgrade packs focus on visual and performance improvements, although the new Zelda Notes smartphone connectivity features can help you find more Korok seeds.</p><div><p>What the updates won’t do, however, is lower the price of the Switch 2, or help you find one, since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/655361/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-sold-out-walmart-gamestop-target">preorders from major retailers are already sold out</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-got-my-switch-2-preorder-the-old-fashioned-way-lining-up-at-gamestop.1173210/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/655949/switch-2-in-person-preorder-gamestop<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Switch 2 preorders <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/655361/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-sold-out-walmart-gamestop-target">are sold out online everywhere</a>. But some people have managed to snag one using once conventional but now antiquated means: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/654944/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gamestop-mario-kart-world-bundle">going to GameStop</a> and preordering one in store. </p><p>In addition to offering online preorders for the Switch 2, its <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em> bundle, and the various Switch 2 accessories, GameStop also allowed customers to preorder the console in person when stores opened for business on April 24th. With the advent of ecommerce, preordering video games in a brick-and-mortar store has become a quaint practice that’s fallen out of fashion; something looked upon with nostalgia for the midnight releases of years gone by. But for many people, physically preordering a Switch 2 was the best and easiest way to secure one. I should know — it’s how I got mine.</p><p>I missed the midnight commencement of online Switch 2 preordering for retailers like Wal-Mart, Best Buy, and others. Knowing GameStop opened its online preorders at 11AM ET on April 24th, I thought I might give it a go there, but it was not to be. GameStop’s later preorder launch was just as chaotic, frustrating, and fruitless as it was for the other stores. But then I remembered <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lnkymmvwec2x">seeing a post on Bluesky from <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Jason Schreier</a>. “About 40 people waiting on line here at my local GameStop for 80 Switch 2s. Better odds than the website!” he wrote. </p><p>I saw that my local GameStop on Howe Road in Akron, Ohio, opened soon, and I was no more than a 15-minute ride away. So I packed my wallet and my dog Bu and went down there only to be greeted by a line full of people, some of whom had been waiting for days.</p><p>“It’s been unbelievably busy,” one GameStop employee told me. He said that people started lining up earlier in the week but he discouraged them from camping for multiple days overnight. “We had six waiting yesterday,” he said.</p><p>Other than that small number of campers, most people I spoke to who were waiting in line had only arrived a few hours before the store opened. Nearly everyone owned a regular Switch and was excited by the promise of an improved console. </p><p>“The Switch 1 is so awesome and we’ve been waiting for a Switch 2 for seven years now,” one woman at the front of the line told me. </p><p>“I have to upgrade, there’s no other way around it,” said another Switch 2 hopeful. Everyone I spoke to was enthusiastic about the console and when I brought up its price they still didn’t seem phased.</p><p>“That doesn’t bother me, I got more than enough money,” said one man. Others mentioned the state of the US economy and with inflation impacting consumer goods across the board, the price of the Switch 2 itself seemed reasonable. “The OLED Switch when it launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review">was $350</a>,” said another man. “One hundred dollars more, almost 10 years later, not that bad.”</p><p>And while the price of the console doesn’t much bother this Akron crop of Switch 2 enthusiasts, the rising cost of games was another matter entirely. “The pricing for the games is a little steep for my tastes,” said the lady at the front of the line. I followed up by asking if that would impact her spending habits on games in the future. “No. The price is not going to affect that, it’s just going to make me upset.”</p><p>That was the sentiment of most everyone I spoke to. Nintendo’s pricing makes sense given everything going on with inflation and tariffs, and even if the higher prices do sting, it’s Nintendo. “I think it’s worth it,” a mother told me as she was waiting in line with her son and husband.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption>Me and Bu at the local Gamestop</figcaption> <cite>Photo: Ash Parrish / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p><em>Mario Kart World </em>was the first game out of everyone’s mouth when I asked what they were most excited to play at launch. Everyone in line was hoping to score the <em>Mario Kart World</em> Switch 2 bundle that essentially gets you the game at a $30 discount. Every so often, a GameStop employee would take a tally of the customers who wanted a bundle. He’d point to a person in line — who was well ahead of me — and say, “you’re the last.” </p><p>According to a sign on the door, that location had been allotted 44 bundles and 19 regular Switch 2 consoles. But throughout my time in line, I overheard them say to customers that they expect to have more units available to be purchased when the console launches on June 5th. Since everybody wanted a <em>Mario Kart</em> bundle, I resigned myself to only getting a regular Switch 2 — a far better prospect than the one I faced this morning of not getting any Switch at all. But as the line moved, the employees found more and more Switch 2 bundles. Finally, during one of the tallys, one employee pointed to me and said I would be the last one to get one.</p><p>And I did. </p><p>With Bu strapped ever so patiently to my back, I preordered a Switch 2 <em>Mario Kart World </em>bundle and threw an extra five bucks down on<em> Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. I shouldn’t be all that surprised this worked out as well as it did, sometimes the old ways simply work best.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The summer of video game releases is starting to heat up. Remedy Entertainment, the studio behind <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc">Alan Wake</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20832997/control-review-creators-thriller-ps4-xbox-pc">Control</a></em>, announced that its first multiplayer title <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/651425/a-rough-day-at-the-office">FBC: Firebreak</a></em> will launch on June 17th. It’ll be available on PC (both Steam and the Epic Game Store), the PS5, and Xbox. It’ll also be available on subscription platforms Game Pass and PlayStation Plus.</p><p>Set in the <em>Control</em> universe a few years after the original game, <em>Firebreak</em> is a three player co-op shooter where players take on missions inside of the headquarters of the FBC — Federal Bureau of Control — which has become overrun by supernatural forces. “The game features highly replayable missions known as Jobs, each uniquely designed with different challenges, objectives, and environments that require teamwork and adaptability,” Remedy explains.</p><p>The new game will be a paid release, priced at $39.99, and it sounds like it will be a nice change of pace from demanding live-service games. The studio says that, while there are updates planned for after launch, “all future playable content, including new Jobs, will be free. Players will have the option to purchase cosmetics, but none of these items will affect gameplay, and there will be no limited-time rotations or daily log-ins. ”</p><p>You can see some of the game in action here:</p><div><p><em>Firebreak</em> is part of <em>Remedy</em>’s plan to build <em>Control</em>’s supernatural universe into something much bigger. In addition to the multiplayer spinoff, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300511/control-2-action-rpg">a direct sequel is in development</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/29/24231469/control-sequel-movie-tv-remedy-annapurna">the studio has also partnered with Annapurna Pictures for future film and TV adaptations</a>.</p></div><div><p><em>Firebreak</em>’s release also comes during a very busy period for games, which will also include the launch of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642420/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-preview">the Nintendo Switch 2</a> (and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em>), alongside games like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349379/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-xbox-pc-ps5">Doom: The Dark Ages</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610946/death-stranding-2-trailer-ps5-state-of-play-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a></em>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
