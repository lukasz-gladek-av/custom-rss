That includes the <strong>8BitDo Ultimate</strong> controller, which has dropped to a record low $29.99 ($15 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSP5BB7Y?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/r6ia22zmu2c1t">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-ultimate-wired-controller-for-xbox-and-windows">8BitDo</a>. The DualShock-like <strong>8BitDo Pro 2 </strong>is also on sale<strong> </strong>at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CYZKNSS1?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-pro-2-wired-controller-for-xbox-%E5%A4%8D%E5%88%B6">8BitDo</a> starting at $29.99 (about $15 off), which is only $2 more than the lowest price to date.</p><div><p>The newest 8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox includes Hall effect analog sticks and triggers, plus two rear buttons, customizable mapping and sensitivity, and is also compatible with PC and mobile devices.</p></div><div><p>The latest 8Bitdo Pro 2 wired controller for Xbox and Windows offers a DualShock-like shape and layout with Hall effect triggers and sensors, software customization, and two mappable rear buttons.</p></div><p>8BitDo’s wired Xbox controllers have been on the market for a few years now, so even if you already have one, you may have missed the refreshed Hall effect models. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22966831/8bitdo-ultimate-wired-controller-for-xbox-announced-price-release-date">The older ones</a> have ALPS-based sticks, which are commonly used in the standard controllers that ship with major consoles. They use mechanically moving parts and sensors to read the sticks’ positioning, which can eventually degrade and cause misreads to the point that your in-game characters can move even when you’re not touching the controller.</p><p>Hall effect sticks, instead, use magnetism and the sensors don’t have moving parts, and while they aren’t completely immune to eventually getting stick drift, they should last much longer. That doesn’t mean you can’t still break a controller from excessive sweaty rounds of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337409/marvel-rivals-fantastic-four-season-1-date-trailer"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>. The triggers on both controllers benefit from similar technology and also include dedicated vibration motors.</p><p>The 8BitDo Ultimate and 8BitDo Pro 2 offer other perks that are nice to have at this price point, too, like dual rear buttons, software-based remapping (the 8BitDo Ultimate supports on-the-fly switching between three profiles using a dedicated button), and configurable sensitivity and vibration settings. In addition to Xbox One, Series X, and Series S, you can also use the controllers on Windows PCs, Android, and iOS devices by plugging them in using the detachable USB-C cable.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339979/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-renders-onleaks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>New day, new Nintendo Switch 2 leaks. Nintendo is getting ever-closer to its April 2025 deadline to reveal its Switch successor, but thanks new renders <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/nintendo-switch-2-design-renders-exclusive/">from OnLeaks and <em>91Mobiles</em></a>, we may now have an even better idea of what the new console might look like.</p><p>If you’ve been following our coverage of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">other</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld">Switch 2</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">leaks</a>, these renders shouldn’t look too surprising. According to the new renders, the console will resemble the original Switch, but it will be bigger, with an 8.4-inch screen. Interestingly, OnLeaks and <em>91Mobiles</em> report that the screen will “most likely” be an “OLED panel” — previous reports have said the console would have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/26/24051407/analyst-tips-8-inch-lcd-for-nintendo-switch-2">an LCD screen</a>.</p><p>The renders show that the top of the Switch 2 will feature a power button, a volume rocker, a 3.5mm headphone jack, a game card slot, and, new for the Switch 2, a USB-C port. OnLeaks and <em>91Mobiles</em> also say that “there also seems to be a sensor of sorts” and they speculate that “this might be an ambient light sensor or something else.” These renders also have a U-shaped kickstand that has appeared in other leaks. </p><p>As for the Joy-Cons, OnLeaks and <em>91Mobiles’ </em>renders show the mysterious second new button on the right Joy-Con. However, they say the new button is <em>above</em> the Home button; other leaks have included the new button <em>below</em> it. The Joy-Cons in the renders have the large buttons in the back that are apparently used to detach the controllers from the console, which are apparently attached magnetically.</p><p>The renders also show an interesting color scheme for the Joy-Cons: they are mostly black but have color accents — light blue on the left one and orange on the right — under the joystick pads and on the bumped-out part of the controllers with the SL and SR buttons. A similar design popped up earlier this month for an alleged Switch 2 left Joy-Con <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336340/thats-a-nice-blue">with light blue accents</a>. I love it, personally.</p><p>Hopefully, given the tidal wave of recent leaks, we don’t have to wait too much longer for Nintendo to officially announce the new console. But whenever the console actually launches, it’s going to have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339466/nintendo-switch-2-pc-gaming-handhelds-steamos">some stiff competition</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
