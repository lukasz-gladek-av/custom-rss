This time, it’s through the <em>Star Wars</em>-themed Galactic Battle, a new Battle Royale season that starts May 2nd and features Darth Jar Jar and the debut of Force Lightning, a new in-game ability. The news was appropriately <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/swcj-2025-fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle">revealed at Star Wars Celebration</a> in Japan. As with most <em>Fortnite</em> seasons, this one had been heavily rumored in the runup.</p><p>For the uninitiated, Darth Jar Jar is a <a href="https://screenrant.com/star-wars-darth-jar-jar-theory-explained/">goofy fan theory</a> that holds that Jar Jar Binks was secretly a Force user and possibly the real villain of the <em>Star Wars</em> prequel trilogy.</p><p>Ahmed Best, the voice of Jar Jar Binks since <em>Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace</em>, said on stage at the event that he improvised some Darth Jar Jar lines for the portrayal. When asked to list any of his favorites, he said, “‘I am the phantom menace’ was totally [improvised],” adding that the line was something he’s “been meaning to say for over 20 years.”</p><p>Galactic Battle will include X-Wings and TIE Fighters that players can pilot, themed maps, and “all-new Item Shop offerings including Mace Windu.” Players will also be able to buy put their hard-earned Fortnite V-Bucks towards a <em>Star Wars-</em>themed Battle Pass with characters like Emperor Palpatine and Wookiee Cuddle Team Leader. Galactic Battle will play out over five weeks with different themes leading up to a narrative live event. Here’s the schedule, <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/swcj-2025-fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle">from StarWars.com</a>:</p><div><blockquote><p>Imperial Takeover – May 2, 2025</p><p>The Pull of the Force – May 8, 2025</p><p>Mandalorian Rising – May 22, 2025</p><p>Star Destroyer Bombardment – May 29, 2025</p><p>Death Star Sabotage – June 7, 2025</p></blockquote></div><div><p>Of course, this is far from the first collaboration between the two pop culture behemoths.

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/interview/649723/henk-rogers-tetris-book-interview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/henk-rogers-on-telling-the-real-story-of-tetris-%E2%80%98i-have-to-set-the-record-straight%E2%80%99.1168899/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/interview/649723/henk-rogers-tetris-book-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When Henk Rogers first read the script for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23650577/apple-tetris-movie-taron-egerton-review">the <em>Tetris</em> movie</a>, he was shocked. “There was so much Hollywood in the movie,” he tells <em>The Verge</em>. “It just drove me nuts.” The film largely follows a pivotal period in Rogers’ life, when he traveled to the Soviet Union to navigate the complex rights issues for <em>Tetris</em> to bring it to platforms like the Game Boy. There, he connected with game’s creator Alexey Pajitnov, with whom he eventually formed a lifelong friendship, and turned <em>Tetris </em>into a global phenomenon.</p><p>The movie turned this experience into something resembling a high-stakes spy thriller — and while Rogers ended up loving the final product, that initial experience inspired him to tell the story of what really happened. “While reading the script I said, ‘I have to set the record straight,’” he says.</p><p>That story now exists in the form of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Game-Tetris-Russia-Love/dp/1962603202?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored"><em>The Perfect Game</em></a>. While Rogers originally sat down to write about the events that transpired in the movie, he soon realized the story was much bigger than that. “I started writing it, and somebody looked at it and said, ‘That could be a book, it’s just not big enough,’” he explains. “I didn’t want to rewrite that part and add water, so to speak, so I added the before and after. So it ended up being about my game career.”</p><p><em>The Perfect Game</em> starts out by exploring Rogers’ early life, bouncing around from the Netherlands to New York City to Hawaii, before eventually landing in Japan, where he founded Bullet-Proof Software and went on to release the influential RPG <em>The Black Onyx</em>. Even before the book gets to the <em>Tetris</em> part of the tale, it’s filled with fascinating insight into the early days of game development. Rogers talks through the many complications and nuances of dealing with publishers and funding, as well as releasing and marketing a game in Japan despite not speaking Japanese.</p><p>But things really kicked into gear at CES in 1988, when he flew to Las Vegas in search of a new game to publish and stumbled on a puzzle game about falling blocks. As he tells it, he knew immediately that he found something special. “I left the Consumer Electronics Show with a sense of purpose,” Rogers writes in his book. “I was determined to publish <em>Tetris </em>in Japan.” That proved tricky, of course, due in large part to the web of copyright laws in the Soviet Union at the time. Rogers found himself traveling back and forth between the Soviet Union and Japan, dealing with everyone from the higher-ups at Nintendo — including legendary designer Shigeru Miyamoto — to the intimidating employees at Soviet trade organizations.</p><div><p>“There’s times when my memory is a little shady, but it was such an exciting time that I pretty much remember.”</p></div><p>Rogers’ account is a detailed one, and he says that he wrote the book entirely from memory. That said, he did check with his friend Pajitnov on a few details, which resulted in one of the book’s more charming features. At various points, Pajitnov’s thoughts are inserted into the book, where he often disagrees with Rogers on small details, like how impressed he was by the Famicom version of <em>Tetris</em> or the quality of the elevator in his apartment building.</p><p>“Alexei read my manuscript and was writing in the margins where his memory is different, so I decided to keep those and put them in the book,” Rogers explains. “There’s times when my memory is a little shady, but it was such an exciting time that I pretty much remember.”</p><p>Even if it’s missing the Hollywood thrills of the script that inspired Rogers to write in the first place, <em>The Perfect Game</em> is a fascinating read, particularly if you’re interested in game development anecdotes. And because the story covers the entirety of Rogers’ career to date, which includes setting up The Tetris Company and bringing the game to just about every platform imaginable, there are a lot of stories about pivotal points in the medium, from the launch of the Game Boy to the burgeoning days of mobile gaming.</p><p>The story is especially notable as<em> Tetris</em> continues to thrive. In addition to the movie and book, Rogers was also featured prominently in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24291537/tetris-forever-review-ps5-switch-pc-xbox">Digital Eclipse’s playable documentary <em>Tetris Forever</em></a><em>,</em> and the game still pops up frequently in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/636581/nintendo-music-app-tetris-dr-mario-kirby-edit-share-playlists-update">places like Nintendo’s new music app</a>. Rogers has largely stepped away from the business, which is now run by his daughter Maya. So now when he sees the game appear somewhere surprising, it elicits a different kind of feeling. “It feels like success,” he says. “Every time <em>Tetris</em> pops up somewhere, or a new deal comes down the pike, it’s like, ‘Wow, she’s killing it.‘”</p><p>As for that movie, Rogers changed his mind when he actually saw it, describing the film as “emotionally correct,” even if it didn’t get all of the facts right. “The first time I saw it I cried about things that never actually happened,” he says.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Technically this came out last week, when we were off, but so many of you told me how much you love it that I feel obligated to include it here. It’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/647451/blue-prince-review-architectural-roguelike-balatro">a deep, complicated puzzle game</a> that you <em>have </em>to play carefully, and I love that.

Yeah, whatever, bad pictures are part of the fun, but instant film is so expensive! Just make all my pictures good!</span></li><li><span><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/204284-the-rehearsal?language=en-US"><strong><em>The Rehearsal</em></strong><strong> season 2</strong></a>. Nathan Fielder is definitely some kind of genius. And this show, in which Fielder helps people practice for big moments in life, makes me constantly (like, <em>constantly</em>) wonder what’s real and what’s a bit. Oh, and it’s also very, very funny.</span></li><li><span><a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/the-final-patch-new-subclasses-photo-mode-and-cross-play_138"><strong><em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em></strong><strong>Patch 8</strong></a><strong>.</strong> This is the last major Baldur’s Gate 3 patch, and it’s a doozy: crossplay, photo mode, new subclasses, modding upgrades, and lots more.

A horror movie about vampires that is also a meditation on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/movie-reviews/649188/sinners-review">life for Black Americans in the South</a>. And Michael B. Jordan plays <em>two </em>roles!

I was skeptical of this game when it came out, because good Indy games are hard to come by. But this is a good one, and now this previously Xbox and PC-only game is available to millions of other gamers. There’s no in-game weapon quite like a whip, my friends.</span></li><li><span><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fchipolo.net%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fchipolo-pop%3FranMID%3D48087%26ranEAID%3DTnL5HPStwNw%26ranSiteID%3DTnL5HPStwNw-rLWNLhZcxNBX8UjwSl5rVw" rel="sponsored"><strong>The Chipolo Pop</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Every time I turn around, someone is doing clever stuff with AirTags — but AirTags are so expensive! These are colorful, cheaper, and also work on both Google’s and Apple’s device-finding network. These are going in my luggage, on my keys, and maybe in my toddler’s shoes. He runs fast.</span></li><li><span><strong>“</strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBQBY9b6OAU"><strong>I Tested Every YouTuber Tech Product</strong></a><strong>.”</strong> This Mrwhosetheboss video is such a good idea it makes me furious with jealousy. He tested and reviewed everything from JerryRigEverything’s utility knife to MKBHD’s Panels app to Hank Green’s 2D glasses, and he is pretty unsparing.

The last thing I need is more stuff on my desk! I already bought a two-pack.</span></li></ul></div><p>I want to do something slightly different here in this space this week: I want to talk about wallpapers. For years, I’ve cared a lot about my wallpaper. Sometimes it’s a photo of a place I love, sometimes it’s a shot of my family, sometimes that all just looks kind of aesthetically busy and I go for something minimalist. I find a lot of wallpapers just by Googling words, but in case you’re curious, here are a few sources of stuff I’ve liked over the years:</p><div><ul><li><span><a href="https://x.com/aestheticsguyy"><strong>Aestheticsguyy</strong></a><strong>. </strong>I don’t know anything about this person, their account, or where these wallpapers come from, but they post a <em>ton </em>and I find myself scrolling their page at least every couple of weeks. I’ve been really enjoying their <a href="https://x.com/aestheticsguyy/status/1907914130625003910"><strong>Formula series.</strong></a></span></li><li><span><strong>The </strong><a href="https://bento.me/papers"><strong>Papers</strong></a><strong> app.</strong> The mobile app, like most wallpaper apps, is pretty ad-riddled, but there’s a lot of good stuff in there. But honestly, I’ve found most of the stuff I like by following <a href="https://x.com/papers_app?lang=en">Paper’s X feed<strong>,</strong></a> which is just a giant stream of wallpaper options.</span></li><li><span><a href="https://basicappleguy.com/basicappleblog/category/Wallpaper"><strong>Basic Apple Guy</strong></a><strong>.</strong> As you’d expect, there’s a lot of Apple-related stuff, but some of his more abstract stuff really works for me. I really love the <a href="https://basicappleguy.com/basicappleblog/liminal-spaces"><strong>Liminal</strong></a> set.</span></li><li><span><strong>The </strong><a href="https://www.backdrops.io/"><strong>Backdrops</strong></a><strong> app.</strong> This is one of the nicest selection of wallpapers – and one of the most usable wallpaper apps — I’ve found anywhere. (In the email version of this newsletter I said this was Android only, but I was wrong! It’s just harder to find on iOS.)</span></li><li><span><a href="https://onlockscreen.app/wallpapers"><strong>On Lock Screen</strong></a>. I don’t tend to find all that much truly unique stuff here, but it’s a fun website to poke around every now and again. (A lot of good stuff <a href="https://x.com/on_lockscreen">on the X feed here</a>, too.)</span></li><li><span><a href="https://shop.theverge.com/en-usd/pages/wallpapers"><strong>The Verge Shop</strong></a>. This is not just a plug! I mean, it <em>is, </em>but I mean it sincerely: I got our <a href="https://shop.theverge.com/products/cellular-wallpaper-pack"><strong>Cellular Wallpaper pack</strong></a> for free because I work here and it’s still my favorite wallpaper. And if you don’t want to pay, we have<a href="https://shop.theverge.com/en-usd/products/the-verge-wallpaper-pack"><strong> a whole archive of free ones</strong></a> to poke through.</span></li></ul></div><p>I should say two things about all this. One, the wallpaper world has long been a mess when it comes to ownership and copyright — people just share these things willy-nilly. And two, there is a <em>lot </em>of generative AI at work in the wallpaper game right now. I always try to track down wallpapers I find (a reverse image search on Google often does the trick), but it’s messy.</p><p>Anyway, the reason I bring this up is because I had a conversation with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/swolewoman/?hl=en"><strong>Casey Johnston</strong></a> from <a href="https://www.shesabeast.co/"><strong><em>She’s a Beast</em></strong></a> the other day (coming soon to <em>The Vergecast!</em>), and she made a surprisingly compelling case that actually, wallpapers are bad. She argued that you don’t want your lockscreen and homescreen to be peaceful or exciting or enticing — they should be ignored as much as possible, because you should either get to what you’re doing or get off your phone. This strikes me as a very good argument! I’ve had an all-black wallpaper going ever since we chatted, and, well, I don’t know how I feel about it. I certainly don’t like looking at it as much as I used to.</p><p>So here’s what I’m wondering: what’s your wallpaper strategy? Have you had the same one forever? Do you rotate daily? Hourly? Where do you find stuff? I want to hear all about it — and also, I want to start sharing more of your homescreens in this space, too. So if you have a good one, send it my way. And we’ll be back to our regular programming next week.</p><div><p id="crowdsourced"><h2>Crowdsourced</h2></p></div><p><em>Here’s what the </em>Installer<em> community is into this week.
