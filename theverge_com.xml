Both are “launching soon” on Kickstarter and feature a design where the Switch 2 docks to the controllers so they can connect to and draw power from the console’s bottom USB-C port. The Abxylute N6 is similar to existing accessories like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/28/24017863/nitro-deck-micro-review">CRKD Nitro Deck</a>, but the N9C looks like someone sliced a GameCube controller in half and stuck either side to the console.</p><p>Pricing details aren’t known for either controller, but the N9C will feature capacitive joysticks, ABXY buttons and triggers that use mechanical micro-switches, and a dedicated C button for accessing GameChat. Its button layout mirrors the original GameCube controller, so the N9C may only appeal to nostalgic gamers who regularly play the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24339906/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-nso">small lineup of GC titles added to Nintendo Switch Online</a> last year, or <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> fans who still prefer Nintendo’s 25-year-old controller. For the latter group, the right joystick on the N9C has a swappable gate that limits its movement to eight directions, providing more precision when inputting moves in fighting games.</p><p>The N6 offers a more traditional asymmetrical controller design, and some key upgrades over the N9C. It features drift-resistant Hall effect joysticks, thicker grips than the standard Joy-Cons, digital triggers, and ABXY buttons that use a rubber membrane for a softer feel. There’s a pair of customizable back buttons that can be used to trigger macros programmed right on the controller. Below the Switch 2 you’ll also find a resonance chamber that directs audio from the console’s speakers toward you, while also boosting lower frequencies by about 10 percent, Abxylute claims.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/872223/abxylute-nintendo-switch-2-controller-n6-n9c-gamecube-retro]]></content:encoded>
