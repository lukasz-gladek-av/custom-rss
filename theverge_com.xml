Case in point: <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fmeta-quest-3s-128gb-the-walking-dead-saints-sinners-bundle-dive-into-virtual-reality-white%2FJ3LHRV8HL7" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> is offering the 128GB Meta Quest 3S for $249 ($50 off) along with a $50 gift card and a copy of <em>The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners</em>. You can also pick up the headset with 256GB of storage for $329.99 ($70 off), which comes with a $50 gift card, at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fmeta-quest-3s-256gb--virtual-reality-headset-without-wires-thirty-three-percent-more-memory-2x-graphical-processing-white%2FJ3LHRV8QSL" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>.</p><p>The Quest 3S is a standalone virtual reality headset with the same processor as the more expensive Quest 3, but with the lenses, field of view, and per-eye resolution (1832 x 1920 pixels per eye) of the Quest 2. You can play the platform’s latest VR games at full speed but with slightly lower visual fidelity. The Quest 3S can be wirelessly connected to a gaming PC using Meta’s AirLink app or the official Steam Link app to play PC-based VR games like <em>Half-Life Alyx.</em></p><p>Our reviewer enjoyed using the Quest 3S to play <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow </em>and <em>Maestro</em>, and praised the Quest VR game catalog, which includes <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>and <em>Beat Saber</em>. Using a standalone VR headset can feel more freeing when playing games than being connected to a PC with a cable, but it’ll still weigh heavily on your head, so you may feel some strain after wearing it for a little while. However, its sale price and included extras make it an especially great choice if you’ve never tried a VR headset before, or are shopping for a gift for a gamer.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandt Ranj</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/820921/meta-quest-3s-black-friday-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Steam Deck changed the way I buy and play games. Just like how the Nintendo Switch blew me away with how it let me play the latest and greatest Nintendo games on the go and on a TV, the Steam Deck has drawn me in with how it offers a vast catalog of PC games that I can play portably or on a big screen. And with the Steam Deck’s microSD card slot, I can add a lot more storage just by tossing in a tiny memory card, meaning I can bring even more games around with me on the device.</p><p>But with its new Steam Machine PC and Steam Frame VR headset, Valve is about to make any microSD cards you use with the Steam Deck even more useful. Like the Steam Deck, both of those devices also run Valve’s Linux-based SteamOS operating system, and both have microSD card slots, too. So if the microSD card you’ve plugged into your Steam Deck is formatted for SteamOS, any games you’ve stored on it will be immediately visible by the Steam Machine and Steam Frame as well.</p><p>When the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">Steam Machine</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">Steam Frame</a> launch in early 2026, this microSD card support means you’ll be able to take the devices out of the box, slot in your microSD card from your Deck, and start playing most of your games without having to download them again. There might be differences in how well games play across the three devices because of their different specs. But many games will probably work well on all of them, meaning you’ll be able to drop your microSD card into whichever device you want to use and just start playing.</p><p>Basically, your microSD card will almost function like an old-school game cartridge, but instead of it being limited to one piece of hardware or one single game, you can easily bring as many games as can fit on the card to whatever SteamOS PC you’re using at the time.</p><p>However, Valve is only building UHS-I card readers into these devices. UHS-I is <em>slow</em> compared to state-of-the-art microSD or internal SSDs. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/15/23761845/pc-games-ssd-minimum-specs-starfield-cyberpunk-2077">They may not be able to keep up</a> with every game you want to play, even if most will load fine. Meanwhile, Nintendo has already moved on to supporting the much faster microSD Express format with the Switch 2 (though has arguably also taken a step back by introducing Switch 2 cartridges that are a “key” and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/643635/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-explained">don’t actually contain games</a>).</p><p>“SD cards are notorious for having low performance, but from our testing and our experience, they actually work really well,” Valve hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat told <em>The Verge</em> while showing us the Steam Machine at Valve’s headquarters. “For most people, the option makes the most sense, in our opinion.</p><p>When we asked to clarify the spec of the microSD reader, Aldehayyat added, “What we’re trying to emphasize here again is we really want the Steam Machine to be a really easy, super convenient device” that you just plug in, sign into, and start playing games on.</p><p>It’s a key part of what makes Valve’s new hardware feel like part of a cohesive ecosystem, and it could be an important advantage as it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818622/valve-console-wars-price-sony-microsoft-nintendo-windows">enters the console wars</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/818602/valve-steam-deck-machine-frame-microsd-card-game-cartridges]]></content:encoded>
