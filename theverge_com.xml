He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Many of Logitech’s products are pricier now than they were in the recent past. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4d__01u2mc">video published this week</a>, YouTuber Cameron Dougherty detailed increases as high as 25 percent on the company’s PC and gaming accessories, including well-known Logitech gear like the MX Master 3S mouse.</p><p>I took a peek at a few Internet Archive captures of Logitech’s current offerings to confirm the YouTuber’s findings, and sure enough, prices are going up. The MX Master 3S, my favorite mouse and the one I’m using at this very moment, <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fp%2Fmx-master-3s.910-006556" rel="sponsored">now costs $119.99</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250219183053/https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/mx-master-3s.910-006556">$20 increase from before</a>. And on the keyboards side, for instance, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23858523/logitech-pro-x-tkl-lightspeed-mechanical-gaming-keyboard-price-release-date-specs-features">Pro X TKL</a> has <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fgaming-keyboards%2Fpro-x-tkl-wireless-keyboard.html" rel="sponsored">gone up to $219.99</a> from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250303235239/https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/pro-x-tkl-wireless-keyboard.920-012154">$199.99 before</a>. One keyboard Dougherty calls out, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250321205050/https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/k400-plus-touchpad-keyboard.920-007119">previously $27.99</a> K400 Plus Wireless Touch, <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fp%2Fk400-plus-touchpad-keyboard.920-007119" rel="sponsored">went up by $7 to $34.99</a> — a relatively small increase that, at 25 percent, is one of the higher price bumps Logitech made.</p><p>Dougherty notes a few products that didn’t see price increases, including the MX Ergo mouse and the G703 gaming mouse. And according to the video, a handful of products have actually dropped in price, like the Pro X Superlight mouse, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250207231555/https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/pro-x-superlight-wireless-mouse.910-005940.html">was $159.99</a>, but is <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fgaming-mice%2Fpro-x-superlight-wireless-mouse.910-005940.html" rel="sponsored">now $149.99</a>.</p><p>Logitech doesn’t seem to have publicly announced the price changes, so we can’t say for certain when or why it made the changes. The most likely explanation is that it’s a response to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">President Donald Trump’s global tariffs</a>, which the company cited earlier this month as it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/647130/logitech-has-withdrawn-its-fiscal-year-2026-outlook-because-of-tariffs">withdrew its financial outlook</a> for fiscal year 2026. Logitech didn’t immediately respond to our request for comment.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
