The studio is planning yet another quality-of-life update for the game with Patch 8.</p><p>“Arriving next year, this update will introduce some of the most eagerly awaited features to <em>BG3</em>:&nbsp;cross-play, and&nbsp;photo mode, along with&nbsp;12 new subclasses,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1086940%2Fview%2F4461474037375172735">Larian wrote on its Steam Community page</a>.</p><p>Cross play will introduce multiplayer capabilities between any of the game’s platforms including Steam, PC, Mac, Xbox, and PlayStation. Cross platform multiplayer progression will also be added.</p><p>Another big community ask that Patch 8 will satisfy is the addition of photo mode. The feature will come with a robust suite of options including poses for party members, picture frames, photo filters, and stickers.</p><p>Finally, the game will get 12 additional subclasses, one for every base class in the game. Here’s the list:</p><div><ul><li>Bard - College of Glamour</li><li>Barbarian - Path of Giants</li><li>Cleric - Death Domain</li><li>Druid - Circle of Stars</li><li>Paladin - Oath of the Crown</li><li>Fighter - Arcane Archer</li><li>Monk - Drunken Master</li><li>Ranger - Swarmkeeper</li><li>Rogue - Swashbuckler</li><li>Sorcerer - Shadow Magic</li><li>Warlock - Hexblade</li><li>Wizard - Bladesinging</li></ul></div><p>The post goes into detail about each subclass with many of them incorporating homebrewed elements straight from the developers’ creativity.  </p><div><p>Larian has said <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/22/24108773/baldurs-gate-3-larian-dungeons-and-dragons">it won’t add any major story content updates or DLC for <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>. But with these patches including the recent addition of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24236649/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-now-live-evil-endings-mod-support">official mod support</a>, the developers have left the game in the best place for the community to continue the adventure without them. Patch 8 is scheduled to release next year.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
