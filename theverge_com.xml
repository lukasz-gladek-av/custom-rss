            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324626/balatro-localthunk-18-plus-rating-europe-pegi<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The creator of the poker roguelike <em>Balatro</em>, who goes by the alias LocalThunk, has been sharing some frustrations over the game’s 18-plus rating in Europe.</p><p>“Since PEGI gave us an 18-plus rating for having evil playing cards maybe I should add microtransactions / loot boxes / real gambling to lower that rating to 3-plus like <em>EA Sports FC,</em>” <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1868142749108797590">LocalThunk posted on X over the weekend</a>.</p><p><em>Balatro’s</em> 18-plus rating isn’t new. The game was originally rated 3-plus, but shortly after its February launch, PEGI bumped it up to 18-plus, as spelled out at the time <a href="https://x.com/PlaystackGames/status/1763614758043795909">by Playstack</a>, <em>Balatro’s</em> publisher. The game was briefly delisted from “a number of digital stores in some countries” as a result.</p><p>According to <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=balatro&amp;op=Search&amp;age%5B%5D=&amp;descriptor%5B%5D=&amp;publisher=&amp;platform%5B%5D=&amp;release_year%5B%5D=&amp;page=1&amp;form_build_id=form-UHS_qJPR8y3wmOQu29CLnMnZt4aDd3pN6XBAA02hku8&amp;form_id=pegi_search_form">PEGI’s page for <em>Balatro</em></a>, the rating was given because the game “features prominent gambling imagery.” PEGI also spells out the following “content specific issues”: </p><div><blockquote><p>This game teaches — by way of images, information and gameplay — skills and knowledge that are used in poker. During gameplay, the player is rewarded with ‘chips’ for playing certain hands. The player is able to access a list of poker hand names. As the player hovers over these poker hands, the game explains what types of cards the player would need in order to play certain hands. As the game goes on, the player becomes increasingly familiar with which hands would earn more points. Because these are hands that exist in the real world, this knowledge and skill could be transferred to a real-life game of poker.</p></blockquote></div><p>While it’s true that the game does feature poker imagery and poker hands that a player could translate into an actual game of poker, it’s worth noting that <em>Balatro</em> doesn’t actually have any gambling as part of playing the game. (LocalThunk has even <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1820752209765961746">stipulated in their will</a> that <em>Balatro</em> can’t be sold or licensed to a gambling company.)</p><p>Games like <em>EA Sports FC</em> include in-game purchases <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/fifa/fut-packs-explained">with randomized content</a>, which is what LocalThunk takes issue with. “I’m way more irked at the 3-plus for these games with actual gambling mechanics for children than I am about <em>Balatro</em> having an 18-plus rating,” <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1868540666869121033">he said on Sunday</a>.</p><p>LocalThunk <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/localthunk.bsky.social/post/3ldmanyal7k2d">said Wednesday</a> that they attempted to discuss <em>Balatro’s</em> rating with PEGI, but “they do not see anything wrong <em>Balatro</em> being rated 18-plus, nor with <em>EA Sports FC</em> (and similar games) having a 3-plus rating.” PEGI was “blaming EU laws, blaming storefronts, waiting for the future,” LocalThunk said.</p><p>PEGI didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324594/intel-performance-arrow-lake-core-ultra-200s-cpus<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Intel’s new Arrow Lake CPUs came out in October promising high performance at lower power levels, but reviews, including ours, noted surprisingly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278407/intel-ultra-9-285k-benchmarks-performance-hands-on">lackluster gaming performance</a>. Tom Warren said of the Core Ultra 9 285K, “...in many titles, it provides worse performance than the 14th Gen chips it was designed to replace.”</p><div><p>Now, <a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Field-Update-1-of-2-Intel-Core-Ultra-200S-Series-Performance/post/1650490">the troubled chipmaker says</a> it has been gradually releasing updates that fixed most of the issues it identified, as <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intels-arrow-lake-performance-fix-is-now-available-another-update-coming-next-month">reported earlier by <em>Tom’s Hardware</em></a>.</p></div><p>“At the end of the day, there were four root issues that we needed to address, and fixes for those are actually already in the field right now,” Robert Hallock, Intel’s VP and GM of client AI and technical marketing said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6rwTGJTcOQ">during an interview with <em>HotHardware</em></a>. “They’ve been coming out over the last two weeks or so in drips and drabs, as update schedules allow.”</p><p>One issue stemmed from a “mistimed” update that was supposed to optimize Windows’ processor power management (PPM) system for Intel’s Core Ultra 200S-series processors. (PPM adjusts the performance of a CPU based on the current power plan, such as Balanced, High Performance, Power Saver, etc). </p><p>Instead of releasing the PPM update before reviewers got their hands on the processors, Intel says it scheduled the update to go out when it became widely available, which may have caused reviewers to see worse-than-expected performance. Due to the missing PPM update, Intel’s performance-boosting Application Performance Optimizer (APO) also couldn’t take effect in games, while “misconfigured” performance settings also had a negative impact on reviewers’ benchmarks.</p><p>A fix was already applied for these issues in&nbsp;Windows 11 build 26100.2161. Intel also says Epic Games resolved a driver compatibility issue <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24h2#3448msgdesc">causing the blue screen of death</a> when running games with Easy Anti-Cheat, such as <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>.</p><p>Intel is planning to release another set of performance upgrades for Arrow Lake CPUs in January, and it will “provide a comprehensive performance update” at CES. For now, Intel recommends updating Windows and applying the latest BIOS update to your motherboard if you haven’t already. Otherwise, you can wait until the “final” performance update next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last Friday, we brought you <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">leaked dimensions of the next Nintendo Switch</a> from the most likely source yet: a “3D scan of the actual hardware” obtained by case manufacturer Dbrand. But case manufacturers aren’t the<em> only</em> source of leaks.</p><p>A Redditor named “NextHandheld” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hdvb2d/ive_come_from_the_future/">claims to have seen and touched</a> an actual final retail unit of the Nintendo Switch 2. I spoke with them, and I’ve now heard and seen enough to think they might be legit.</p><p>In particular, I’ve seen two photos of a possible Nintendo Switch 2 dock, and one photo of the <em>inside</em> of a possible Switch 2 controller rail, covered in certification logos and with copper contacts exposed, which also shows its metal kickstand hinge open at an angle. Notably, the dock was <em>not</em> included in the 3D scan that’s circulating among case manufacturers.</p><p>If NextHandheld is telling the truth, we now know a good bit more about Nintendo’s next console. For example: as much as we’d love it to be called the “Super Nintendo Switch,” it’ll likely be introduced as the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>.  </p><p><h3>Name and date</h3></p><p>Officially, Nintendo has only called it “the successor to Nintendo Switch,” promised to formally announce the new console <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">by March 31st, 2025</a>, and revealed that it will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation">be backward compatible</a> with original Switch games.</p><p>Unofficially, NextHandheld’s source has heard it might be announced as soon as January — and shared what they claim is first-hand evidence with <em>The Verge</em> that it is the Nintendo Switch 2. I saw a picture of a dock, with the same logo as as the original Nintendo Switch, only with a 2 attached. </p><p>And while NextHandheld says they’re “disappointed” that the dock doesn’t seem to have any more ports than the original — two USB-A, one HDMI, one ethernet, and one USB-C likely used for its power brick — it may have a <em>different</em> trick up its sleeve.</p><p><h3>Magnetic controllers — finally with drift-resistant joysticks</h3></p><p>In April, <a href="https://vandal.elespanol.com/noticia/1350770848/exclusiva-switch-2-conocemos-en-primicia-nuevos-detalles-de-la-proxima-consola-de-nintendo/">Spanish pub Vandal</a>&nbsp;(which correctly reported&nbsp;<a href="https://vandal.elespanol.com/noticia/1350744733/nuevos-detalles-exclusivos-de-switch-pro-pantalla-tamano-dock-llegada-a-europa/">minor details of the Switch OLED</a>&nbsp;before launch) reported that, incredibly, Nintendo might replace the Switch’s controller rails with <em>magnets</em> so your Joy-Cons can magically snap into place. </p><p>Today, it no longer seems incredible, because the photo I saw of a joystick rail region contains no rail: it’s just a long, rounded, hollow area, with a 13-pin connector that sticks out so it can slot into the Joy-Con. NextHandheld says there’s a physical magnetic click when you attach them, and that you’ll press a much larger button on the controller, one that’s physically connected to a magnet, to release. (You can see mockups of such buttons <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">in our Dbrand story</a>.)</p><p>More importantly, the Nintendo Switch 2 might finally get rid of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23571821/nintendo-switch-joy-con-joystick-drift-button">the infamous “Joy-Con Drift” that plagues its controllers to this day</a>. NextHandheld claims the controllers will have magnetic Hall effect joysticks, which don’t contain the same deteriorating sensor material and can be recalibrated easily. </p><p><h3>A U-shaped kickstand</h3></p><p>The original Nintendo Switch had a tiny, easy-to-topple gumstick of a kickstand, and the Switch OLED had a wide, flat plate. But the Nintendo Switch 2 will feature a U-shaped rail of a kickstand, according to a photo that NextHandheld shared with me. </p><p>I understand that the 3D CAD file shows the U-shape, too — and case manufacturers have begun sharing images of similar U-shaped kickstands, too. But it looks like it could be beefier than some of the mockups floating around:</p><p><h3>Extra power when docked?</h3></p><div><p>Once upon a time, Nintendo was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/nintendo-to-use-new-nvidia-graphics-chip-in-2021-switch-upgrade">reportedly planning to release a Nintendo Switch Pro</a>, one that would output 4K graphics when docked to your TV, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22348095/nintendo-switch-nvidia-dlss-graphics-ai-explained">at least partly thanks to Nvidia’s DLSS AI upscaling</a>. That didn’t happen, but the Nintendo Switch 2’s dock might be designed to let the handheld run a bit faster. </p></div><p>On Reddit, NextHandheld cryptically teased that asking if the dock had a fan was “the right question,” and in a picture shared with <em>The Verge</em>, I can see the alleged dock has big feet <em>around back, </em>ones positioned so it can lie down horizontally without blocking a set of vents. </p><p>While I don’t imagine you’d intentionally put it on its back, as the handheld might fall out of the completely open slot up top, I can imagine Nintendo wanting to make sure the console doesn’t overheat if you accidentally knock it over. </p><p>Intriguingly, NextHandheld says the dock is rated for 60W, while the Switch 2 is rated for 45W, both of which would be substantially higher than the original if true. The original Switch had an unusual 39W charger for both docked and handheld modes, which only provided up to 18W for the handheld.</p><p><h3>The many things we still don’t know</h3></p><p>You can dig through <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NextHandheld/comments/">NextHandheld’s Reddit comments</a> or read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hf06co/switch_2_ama_with_next_handheld_summarized/">this early summary</a> for a lot more possible details about the new console. But the Redditor is upfront that they never got to turn the handheld on, or play any games. They don’t know whether a Switch 2 can play original Switch cartridges, or only digital Switch 1 games. They don’t know if it has a microphone, or a camera, or how much storage space it has, or its performance, or anything about its reportedly 8-inch screen, or its launch titles.</p><p>They do say it will launch in dark grey, however, like the original Nintendo Switch, and that it will be followed by a white model, and one themed with a Nintendo game that hasn’t received a themed Switch yet. And, they’re the latest to possibly corroborate a new second USB-C port on the top, though that was obviously revealed in the 3D scan.</p><p>If it’s true that Nintendo will announce the Switch 2 in January, though, you won’t have to wait long for more answers — or to find out if these ones are true.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
