He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>RetroTINK, a company that sells hardware for playing retro consoles on modern screens, says it will be temporarily suspending US shipments — even though the company wants to pre-pay President Donald Trump’s tariffs, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/04/us-retrotink-shipments-are-being-temporarily-suspended">as reported by <em>Time Extension</em></a>.</p><p>The company is suspending shipments “due to lack of guidance on how tariffs will be collected starting May 2nd,” RetroTINK’s Mike Chi <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/retrotink.com/post/3lmsr6nja6k2x">says on Bluesky</a>. “Without proper procedures in place, the risk of delays and lost packages is simply too high.” The company will resume shipments “as soon as we understand how to pre-pay tariffs on behalf of the customer,” he says.</p><p>In a post <a href="https://www.retrotink.com/blog/tariff-update-last-call-for-us-orders">on its website</a>, the company says that “we have not received guidance from the government on how US shipments will be processed.” April 23rd will be the last day to make non-expedited orders and April 28th will be the last day to make expedited orders for US-bound shipments.</p><p>Chi also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/retrotink.com/post/3lmsr6njf2t2x">says that</a> the company expects that the situation “will be resolved eventually – but it is impossible to say when or how.”</p><p>President Donald Trump announced wide-ranging tariffs <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642240/trump-tariffs-imports-apple-manufacturing">on April 2nd</a>, and while he lowered them to 10 percent for many countries shortly after they went into effect <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646029/trump-announces-a-90-day-pause-on-tariffs-outside-of-china">a week later</a>, the US currently has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/politics/646604/trump-tariffs-reciprocal-pause-canada-mexico-china-de-minimis">a 145 percent tariff</a> in place on goods imported from China.</p><p>RetroTINK isn’t the only small business in games dealing with issues created by the tariffs. Fangamer, for example, is <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/pizza-tower/products/pizza-tower-game-collectors-edition-nintendo-switch">delaying preorders</a> of the <em>Pizza Tower Collector’s Edition</em> because of “new tariffs targeting manufacturing in China that have made it impossible for us to estimate the CE’s final price.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Today, Panic confirmed the first details of the handheld’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284707/playdate-season-2-release-date">upcoming season 2</a>, which will include 12 new games and run from May 29th to July 3rd, with two titles releasing each week. The full season will cost $39.</p><p>When the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025390/playdate-handheld-portable-gaming-console-review">Playdate first launched back in 2022</a>, it similarly came with a number of games from notable developers that released over time. The idea was that every Playdate owner would receive these mystery games at the same time as they launched weekly throughout the season, but ensuing shipping delays put a wrench in that plan. Panic says that with this second season it “hopes to deliver on that original idea,” while adding that the season will also include “a must see surprise for all those who want something… a little different.”</p><p>In addition to the date and price of season 2, Panic also revealed four of the games that will be featured. They include:</p><div><ul><li><span><em><a href="https://play.date/games/fulcrum-defender/">Fulcrum Defender</a></em>, a “crank-powered, arcade action game” from Subset Games, the studio behind strategy classics <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/26/17053172/into-the-breach-review-pc-steam-ftl">Into the Breach</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/3/5577792/best-new-apps-ftl-for-ipad">FTL: Faster Than Light</a></em>.</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span><em>Taria &amp; Como,</em> a “physics-based puzzle platformer where movement is built around swinging instead of jumping,” from Popseed Studio Inc and JuVee Productions.</span></li><li><span>A classic-style point-and-click adventure from Pixel Ghost called <em>Shadowgate PD</em>.</span></li><li><span>And <em>Dig! Dig! Dino!</em> from Dom 2D and Fáyer, which is about, well, digging dino bones.</span></li></ul></div><p>Panic also announced a new yellow case for the handheld, which is available to order today for $34.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
