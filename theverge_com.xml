But that time’s over. Rockstar announced that it would reveal the game’s first trailer on Tuesday, December 5th, 2023, at 6AM PT / 9AM ET. Unfortunately, an early leak prompted the company to release the trailer more than half a day earlier than planned, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23988446/gta-vi-trailer-leaked-vice-city">revealing <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> will bring the series back to Vice City</a>, and it showed off a new protagonist, Lucia.</p><p>Though Rockstar Games has kept mum on what to expect from the next installment in the series, we do have a bit of an idea of what the game looks like thanks to a hacker leaking 90 videos’ worth of material. In 2022, Arion Kurtaj — a member of the Lapsus$ hacker ring — leaked the videos, and in 2023, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23842746/lapsus-member-uber-rockstar-games-hack">a London jury found him responsible for the act</a>.</p><p>There have also been unconfirmed reports of another, more recent <em>GTA VI</em> leak in the days before the trailer’s world premiere, showing off a bit of the game’s map <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-leaks-may-have-just-come-from-a-rockstar-employees-son">that allegedly came from a Rockstar employee’s kid</a>.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article"><div><p>GTA VI is still coming this fall.</p><div><blockquote><p>Looking ahead, this calendar year is shaping up to be one of the strongest ever for Take-Two, as we plan to launch Sid Meier’s Civilization VII on February 11th, Mafia: The Old Country in the Summer, Grand Theft Auto VI in the Fall, and Borderlands 4.</p></blockquote></div><p>Take-Two also revealed that the over-a-decade-old <em>GTA V</em> has sold more than 210 million copies globally.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6Mjc5MDg=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158510/gta-6-release-date-fall-2025">Grand Theft Auto VI is launching in fall 2025</a></h2><div><p>In Take-Two’s <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/news/take-two-interactive-software-inc-reports-results-fourth-0">Q4 2024 earnings report</a>, the company stated when gamers can expect the next entry in the <em>GTA</em> series.

That’s according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-27/gta-6-news-video-game-to-feature-playable-female-main-character">a new report from <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, which just published a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-27/gta-6-release-date-rockstar-cleans-up-image-after-employee-backlash">lengthy feature on the game’s development</a>. The report also includes new details on the game’s release, which sources suggest is likely to be at least two years away.</p><p>Rockstar has reportedly made efforts to overhaul its internal culture ever since the release of its last major title, 2018’s <em>Red Dead Redemption 2,</em> was marred by reports of poor <a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-rockstar-games-culture-of-crunch-1829936466">working conditions at the studio</a>. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, morale at the company has improved significantly since then, and the development of <em>GTA VI</em> is being managed in such a way so as to minimize the crunch that employees experienced during the development of previous titles.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/27/23280496/gta6-gta-vi-miami-female-protagonist-2024-release-date-development-crunch">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NDMyNDQ=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/4/22917783/rocstar-games-gta6-active-development-gta5-ps5-xbox-series-x-patch">Rockstar finally confirms it’s working on the next Grand Theft Auto</a></h2><div><p>A new entry in the Grand Theft Auto series is in active development, <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/ak73k92o47ko75/grand-theft-auto-community-update">Rockstar Games has confirmed</a>. “We are pleased to confirm that active development for the next entry in the Grand Theft Auto series is well underway,” the company wrote in a post on its website. In the more immediate future, <em>GTAV</em> and <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em> will release on PS5 and Xbox Series X and S on March 15th.</p><p>The popularity — and profitability — of <em>GTAV</em>’s online component has meant that there’s been an unusually long wait for a sequel. The game originally released for the PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2013, over eight years ago. In contrast, <em>GTAV</em> released a little over five years after 2008’s <em>GTAIV</em>. “With the unprecedented longevity of <em>GTAV</em>, we know many of you have been asking us about a new entry in the Grand Theft Auto series,” Rockstar Games writes. “With every new project we embark on, our goal is always to significantly move beyond what we have previously delivered.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/4/22917783/rocstar-games-gta6-active-development-gta5-ps5-xbox-series-x-patch">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li></ul></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
