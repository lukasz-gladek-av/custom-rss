The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24213808/video-game-voice-actor-strike-sag-aftra">strike began on July 26th, 2024</a>, after the union and a bargaining committee of video game companies — including Activision, Epic Games, EA, Disney Character Voices, Take-Two, Insomniac Games, WB Games, and others — failed to agree on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24206357/video-game-performer-strike-sag-aftra">worker protections around AI</a>. </p><p>“It is expected the terms of a strike suspension agreement will be finalized with employers soon,” SAG-AFTRA announced. “Until such agreement is reached, however, SAG-AFTRA members will remain on strike against these employers.”</p><p>The contract is subject to approval by the SAG-AFTRA national board and is expected to be put to a ratification vote with union members “in the coming weeks.” If all goes well, the <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/contracts/video-game-strike/ima-strike-notice-members">lengthy list of restrictions</a> preventing SAG-AFTRA’s approximately 160,000 members from undertaking video game projects will be lifted, alleviating some development headaches for new titles.</p><p>“Everyone at SAG-AFTRA is immensely grateful for the sacrifices made by video game performers and the dedication of the Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee throughout these many months of the video game strike,” SAG-AFTRA’s Chief Negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, said in the announcement. “Patience and persistence has resulted in a deal that puts in place the necessary AI guardrails that defend performers’ livelihoods in the AI age, alongside other important gains.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/684247/xbox-ally-x-hands-on-gears-of-war-reloaded<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Xbox has revealed its new handheld line, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">the ROG Xbox Ally and the Ally X</a>, made in partnership with Asus. And I got the chance to play it during Summer Game Fest. My colleague Tom Warren has already broken down <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">how the handheld works</a> with its operating system, UI, and integration with the Xbox app and third-party game stores. Meanwhile, I’ll get into the simple experience of playing the dang thing — and the biggest selling point, for me, was comfort.</p><p>Despite my best efforts, the Xbox PR reps did not let me peek at the device’s storefronts or play the much-anticipated <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. So for this brief hands-on overview, I’ll cover the game that I did get to play — <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em>. </p><p>I can sum up my experience with the Xbox Ally X (as I recall, the less powerful white Xbox Ally was not available) with a few words: I need this. The Xbox Ally X felt roughly the same weight as a Steam Deck. But with its hand grips, modeled to resemble the form factor of an Xbox controller, it felt like a literal dream. </p><p>I’ve struggled with my Steam Deck for a long time because it’s not comfortable to hold. After extended gaming sessions, my hands stiffen into claws that take a moment to regain their flexibility and normal use. While I wasn’t able to spend hours playing the Xbox Ally X to test my hands’ endurance, I could already notice the difference in my fingers within moments of picking it up. It felt <em>good</em> to hold, both in weight and form factor.</p><p>As for playing <em>Gears</em>, it was a seamless experience. Microsoft had the remaster of the seminal Xbox shooter (its second remaster in the game’s 25-year history) set up across the different platforms that the game supports. I played on a regular Ally at first, then I moved over to the Xbox Ally X, and the differences were subtle but noticeable. The device’s weight felt comparable to a Steam Deck. I performed better on the Ally X, which could be a component of having already warmed up, but my shooting was tighter and more accurate. </p><p>Visually, between the Ally and the Xbox Ally X, I didn’t notice a difference, but I really wasn’t looking for one. I was so enamored with how comfortable it felt in my hands that any graphical differences seemed less important in comparison. I wish I could have seen more of the home UI to judge the ease of loading in games or jumping from Steam games to Xbox games or judge Xbox Play Anywhere games versus those streamed from an Xbox or over the cloud. But like I said, the eagle-eyed PR folks kept this to a <em>Gears </em>demonstration only. </p><p>I love the portability of my Steam Deck, Switch, and PS Portal. Those three are my preferred ways to play over my desktop and consoles. While there are still a lot of question marks around the Xbox Ally X, particularly with its interface and how it holds up over long sessions, that little bit of comfort has gone a long way to selling me on a portable Xbox.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
