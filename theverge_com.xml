            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24315781/gamers-nexus-video-reply-nzxt-defense-misleading-customers-flex-pc-rentals<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Gamers Nexus has released a video deconstructing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313974/nzxt-flex-pc-rental-response">NZXT’s defense</a> of its Flex gaming PC purchase and rental program. In it, host Steve Burke says the company is still misleading customers, despite adjustments made in response to his previous video in which he <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/1/24310181/nzxt-pc-rental-program-gamers-nexus-investigation">called the program</a> “a scam.”</p><p>NZXT <a href="https://nzxt.com/news/nzxt-update-addressing-your-concerns-about-the-flex-subscription-program">said in its response</a> this week that it would clarify details about its Flex program, which Gamers Nexus had criticized for having specs that would change sometimes “day-to-day.” The company has appeared to update specs and performance numbers for its purchase builds. But Gamers Nexus reports it still spotted issues like inconsistent FPS numbers and a FAQ that implied NZXT’s for-sale Player: Three Prime build uses an RTX 4090 graphics card, despite its specs saying otherwise. </p><p>The FAQ entry Burke mentions seems to be gone now, but as of this writing, there’s still an entry titled “What GPU is right for me?” that lists the RTX 4090 and its benefits. Such inconsistencies are a problem for potential customers, Burke says.</p><div><blockquote><p>The fact that NZXT misrepresented its product, even after its statement, as having a 4090 when it still had a 4080 Super ... seemingly indicates that even NZXT can’t keep up with its own specs changes. If NZXT can’t keep up with it ... how are they expecting the customer to keep up with it?</p></blockquote></div><p>Gamers Nexus offers other criticisms of the company’s rental program, from “improper packaging” damage fees with upper bounds that exceed the cost of equivalent non-rental versions of the PCs to the creator-based ad videos that continue to exist, despite the company saying it had “pulled all influencer-led Flex advertising.” NZXT did not immediately respond to our request for comment on the new video.</p><p>Gamers Nexus said Thursday that it’s working on a deeper investigation, and its video today ends with Burke saying he’s received “a number of very concerning tips” from former employees and customers. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
