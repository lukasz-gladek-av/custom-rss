EA says that starting today players will no longer be able to spend real money in the game, and that it will be delisted on both iOS and Android tomorrow before the servers shut down completely next year, making it entirely unplayable.</p><div><p>The news comes as the <em>Sims</em> franchise is in the process of moving on to what’s next. While <em>The Sims 4</em> is still chugging along, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870172/project-rene-next-gen-sims-free">and shows no signs of ending any time soon</a>, the mysterious “Project Rene” is lurking in the background as the next big iteration for the series. EA hasn’t spoken about the next <em>Sims</em> project in some time, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23579786/the-sims-project-rene-multiplayer-solo-cross-platform">it’s expected to be both a single and multiplayer experience that’s available across PC and mobile</a>. This, in theory, makes a game like <em>Sims Mobile</em> less necessary.</p></div><div><p>Of course, plans for Project Rene could shift as well. Not only is it still early in development, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/787112/electronic-arts-55-billion-privacte-acquisition-pif-silver-lake-affinity-partners">EA is in the midst of going private</a> in a $55 billion deal <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/795232/ea-battlefield-6-hit-launch-deal">that could impact that trajectory of its biggest franchises</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/802631/the-sims-mobile-shut-down-2026]]></content:encoded>
