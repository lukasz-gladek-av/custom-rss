The Xbox Avatar <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/profile/xbox-avatar-editor-app-faq">FAQ says</a> that “due to low engagement and our shift in focus towards delivering other player experiences,” it’s discontinuing the editor as of January 9th, 2025.</p><p>After that time, players won’t be able to access their Avatars or the items they’ve bought for them. The company will automatically refund users for any of those items they’ve bought since November 1st, 2023. </p><div><figcaption><em>Xbox Avatar Editor, as it appeared in its June 2018 testing period.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>GIF: Xbox Avatar Editor</cite></p></div><p>Xbox Avatars, which Microsoft first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/11/17958800/microsoft-xbox-one-october-update-alexa-avatars-dolby-vision-features">rolled out in 2018</a>, offered more diverse, detailed avatar creation than what had been available on the Xbox 360. Players can still edit and use those older avatars (aka Xbox Original Avatars) after the newer ones are deprecated, as Microsoft writes:</p><div><blockquote><p>You can continue to update your gamerpic using the Xbox Avatar Editor app until January 9, 2025. After this date, any further changes to Xbox Avatar-themed gamerpics will need to be made through the Xbox Original Avatars app. To do this, launch the Xbox Original Avatars app, press the&nbsp;<strong>Menu</strong>&nbsp;button and select&nbsp;<strong>Take a photo</strong>. From there, you can adjust your avatar’s&nbsp;<strong>Animation</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Background</strong>. Once you have the gamerpic you like, press the&nbsp;<strong>View</strong>&nbsp;button&nbsp;and then select&nbsp;<strong>Save as gamerpic</strong>.</p></blockquote></div><p>If you’re fond of your Xbox Avatar, now might be a good time to get as many screenshots of it as you can. You’ll still be able to edit it until the January 9th shutdown. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
