He previously worked at <em>Android Police</em> and <em>Tech Advisor</em>.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve has issued a corrective update to the Steam client for its Steam Deck gaming handhelds, after an earlier version left some devices stuck in boot loops and broke performance settings. The initial update reached the Steam Deck’s stable channel despite warnings from beta testers about the problems.</p><p>The problems were caused by a Steam Deck client update released on April 1st, shortly after a general SteamOS update to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/eventcomments/597396873172485895/">version 3.6.24</a> the day before. The client update was intended to fix a variety of minor issues, improve download performance, and resolve some problems with DualSense controllers, but owners <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1jp7n7s/do_not_update_to_latest_stable_branch_3624/">took to Reddit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/11865">GitHub</a> to report new issues including boot loops and the disappearance of settings to control GPU clock speed and TDP. </p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1675200%2Fview%2F529842339955345099" rel="sponsored">Valve’s patch update</a> now notes that the client update was “rereleased” on the same day with a fix for those problems, with a separate update <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/eventcomments/597396968629617899/">released to the console’s beta channel today</a> with the same fixes. Beta users had reported issues with the TDP and GPU sliders since the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/eventcomments/624417276294163576?snr=1_2108_9__2107">March 19th beta update</a>, raising questions about how the errors made it through to a stable release.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Roblox is introducing new parental controls that give parents more tools to control the people their children talk to and the experiences they can access, <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/04/new-parental-controls-on-roblox">according to a blog post</a> from chief safety officer Matt Kaufman.</p><p>The updates build on changes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/18/24298330/roblox-child-safety-chat-parent-accounts">introduced last year</a>, which included a special type of account parents and caregivers can use to remotely manage some aspects of how a child uses the platform, that followed reports highlighting times when Roblox failed to protect children.</p><p>As part of the new updates, parents who have linked their account with a child’s will be able to block and report specific people on that child’s friends list. Kaufman says in the post that kids under 13 can’t unblock users that have been blocked by their parents, but they will be able to request if those friends can be unblocked.</p><p>Parents will also now be able to block their children from being able to access specific experiences and games. Previously, they could only block their kids from accessing experiences at a certain content maturity level. As with blocked friends, children under 13 won’t be able to unblock experiences until they are 13 or older, though they can request to access them.</p><p>In addition, Kaufman says the company will now let parents see the 20 experiences their children have spent the most time in over “the last week.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The ads will be available to buy programmatically “via Google’s advertising solutions and direct buying (Direct IO) in the coming weeks,” Roblox says. </p><p>Owners of Roblox experiences must be at least 18 to show ads, and only public experiences are eligible, according to a <a href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/production/monetization/immersive-ads">page on its creator hub</a>.

Google writes in <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/immersive-ads-roblox/">a separate announcement</a> today that they can show up as “a billboard ad you see driving through a virtual city or an ad on the big screen during a virtual football game.” The company claims these ads “blend naturally into the game environment.” </p><p>Roblox says it will start selling other ad formats through Google’s platform in the coming months, including billboards and entire rows on the Roblox home page.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
