            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/29/24309086/intel-battlemage-gpu-leak-arc-b580-b570<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Under financial pressures, Intel’s desktop gaming graphics business <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285513/intel-ceo-lunar-lake-one-off-memory-package-discrete-gpu#:~:text=Unfortunately%20for%20PC%20graphics%20enthusiasts">may be on the chopping block</a> — but it seems that a pair of Battlemages will escape unscathed. <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/exclusive-intel-arc-battlemage-to-launch-december-12th"><em>Videocardz</em> is reporting</a> that Intel will announce the Arc B580 and B570 graphics cards just days from now on December 3rd, and launch them on December 12th alongside media reviews. </p><p>You shouldn’t expect these card to compete at the high-end. Far from it, based on leaked specs that suggest they have fewer cores, less memory, and less memory bandwidth than some of their Intel predecessors. </p><p>But they could also be a value leader. Retailer leaks <a href="https://x.com/momomo_us/status/1861788237456711881">spotted by Momomo_us</a> suggest Intel’s own “Limited Edition” Arc B580 could cost just $250. </p><p>While no confirmed specs have surfaced just yet, <a href="https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/news/hardware/grafikkarten/64956-intel-arc-battlemage-amazon-f%C3%BChrt-asrock-intel-arc-b580-steel-legend.html">one particular GPU leak on Amazon</a> suggested that the B580 will feature 20 Xe2 cores, a 2.8GHz GPU clock, 12GB of GDDR6 graphics memory at 19Gbps with a 192-bit memory interface, and require as little as two axial fans and one single 8-pin PCIe power connector (though another variant was spotted with three fans and two connectors.) They may also connect to a motherboard with a PCIe 5.0 x8 connector.</p><p>If <em>Videocardz</em> is correct, we won’t have to speculate for long: full confirmed details should arrive this Tuesday. </p><p>It’d be nice to see the lower end of the GPU market get shaken up a bit. What with the pandemic, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/1/23191634/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-over-3080-3070-3060-radeon-rx-6900-6800">the great GPU shortage</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23734022/nvidia-rtx-4060-ti-amd-rx-7600-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test">its aftermath</a>, it’s been a while since big GPU boosts have felt affordable. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
