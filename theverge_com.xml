            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24281659/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-complete-mobile-launch-date-introductory-price<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The final, microtransaction-free version of <em>Animal Crossing</em> mobile is coming to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-c/id6547834967">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.zasa">Android</a> on December 3rd. <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete</em> is set to replace the existing “free-to-start” version of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/22/16691618/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-review-iphone-android-nintendo"><em>Pocket Camp</em></a> that first launched in 2017. The complete version will cost $9.99 in the US at first, but once January 30th at 10PM PT rolls around it will cost twice as much at $19.99.</p><p>Existing <em>Pocket Camp</em> players who want to port their game data over will have until June 1st, 2025 to do so, via a linked Nintendo account. The original app’s service will cease on November 28th at 7AM PT, so it seems anyone on the fence needs to have their save data linked and <a href="https://faq.complete.ac-pocketcamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/29555650212761-Preparing-to-Transfer-Save-Data">prepped for transfer</a> before that. Nintendo has spelled out some of these details in a 12-minute video explainer, which also goes over the existing features that are transferring over and what’s not making the <em>Complete</em> cut.</p><p>What’s new for <em>Pocket Camp Complete</em> is the ability to play without a constant internet connection. Players will still be able to visit and trade with friends online, but the new version can be a fully offline experience if desired. Instead of the premium currency of the original game, Leaf Tickets, the complete version will have Leaf Tokens — earned by exchanging Bells or completing goals. Leaf Tokens will be used for buying furniture or speeding up crafting times, so it sounds like the replacement for in-game purchases may be more grinding. And for those that have a stockpile of the old Leaf Tickets, know that they will not be transferred (best to get spending before that Thanksgiving cutoff).</p><p>The other big new features for <em>Pocket Camp Complete</em> are in-game Camper Cards that players can customize with their avatars and favorite in-game animals. You can create and trade cards with other players in real life via QR codes. Collecting friends via Camper Cards adds their character to a new mountain location called Whistle Pass, where they may occasionally gift you items and enjoy daily musical performances from K.K. Slider at 7PM. Other members of your friends list who made the transfer to <em>Complete </em>may also appear at Whistle Pass. I assume the others will be quietly raptured and never spoken of again.</p><p><em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete</em> can be preordered / pre-registered on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-c/id6547834967">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.zasa">Android</a> now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
