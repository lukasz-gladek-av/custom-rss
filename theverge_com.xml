            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Apple has lost its appeal of a massive district court ruling in its ongoing antitrust dispute with Epic Games.</p><p>That <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">April ruling</a> from Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said that Apple “willingly” failed to comply with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown">a 2021 order</a> allowing mobile app developers to link to payment options outside of Apple’s, and she barred Apple from charging a commission on in-app purchases using external payment links, among other restrictions. In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26372151-epic-v-apple-appeals-court-opinion/">today’s opinion</a>, the three-judge Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel largely affirmed Gonzalez Rogers’ contempt findings and the limits on Apple. But it asked the judge to consider options that would let Apple charge reasonable fees for external link purchases.</p><p>Gonzalez Rogers’ ruling took issue with a series of moves Apple made to discourage developers from using external payment methods, including adding a 27 percent fee for external payments, requiring developers to restrict links to plain text instead of allowing them to make buttons, and showing users a fullscreen warning when they tapped an external link. The appeals court agreed that “Apple claimed to comply with the injunction, but it instead prohibited developers from using buttons, links, and other calls to action without paying a prohibitive commission to Apple, and it restricted the design of the developers’ links to make it difficult for customers to use them.”</p><p>But the appeals court ruling said Gonzalez Rogers had gone too far in one area: prohibiting Apple from collecting <em>any </em>fee on in-app purchases from developers. “Rather than coercing Apple to comply with the spirit of the Injunction with a reasonable, non-prohibitive commission, the district court used blunt force to ban all commissions, abusing its discretion,” according to the opinion.</p><p>The panel has recommendations about an “appropriate commission or fee limitation,” including that Apple charge based on the necessary costs for “its coordination of external links for linked-out purchases.”</p><p>The opinion also says that while Apple can’t force developers to make their own options less visible or appealing than Apple’s default, it can restrict developers from placing buttons, links, or “other calls to action” in “more prominent fonts, larger sizes, larger quantities, and more prominent places than Apple uses for its own buttons, links, or other calls to action.”</p><p>Apple and Epic didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney retweeted posts from <a href="https://x.com/business/status/1999209253131759821"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> and <a href="https://x.com/schaeffers/status/1999214579956809906">Schaeffer’s Investment Research</a> about the ruling.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/842991/apple-epic-appeal-loses-contempt]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Remember Google Stadia? Steam finally made its gamepad worth rescuing]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/829631/save-google-stadia-gamepad-steam-deadline</link>
            <guid>1380124</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>December 31st, 2025 is the deadline to <a href="https://stadia.google.com/controller/index_en_US.html">save the Google Stadia controller</a>. That’s less than three weeks from today — but there’s never been a better time. Last month, I discovered the controller is finally a first-class citizen in Steam and SteamOS.</p><p>The Stadia controller was originally designed to connect to your Wi-Fi network and remotely control games from Google’s cloud servers. But when Stadia shut down in January 2023, the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23561541/google-stadia-shutdown-precedent-editorial">did an amazing job shutting down the service</a>: it offered full hardware refunds and let you rescue the Stadia Controller by turning it into a generic Bluetooth gamepad instead.</p><p>When I flew to Valve headquarters in late October to see <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/819080/valve-brings-back-steam-machines-steam-os-steam-frame-news-announcements">the Steam Machine</a>, I asked Pierre-Loup Griffais if Steam would ever fully support the Stadia controller the way it’s supported so many other gamepads, letting you turn each of its buttons and joysticks into fully customizable control schemes. At the time, he said he thought the Xbox One wireless adapter might be a higher priority than Google’s abandoned controller.</p><p>So you can imagine my surprise to find Steam not only supports the Stadia gamepad now, it’s made every button useful. That Google Assistant key is now a freely programmable M1 macro button! Google’s screenshot button takes screenshots in SteamOS! The Stadia button is now effectively an Xbox button, letting you activate many (not all) of the Steam Deck’s handiest shortcuts, including Stadia+A to pull up the quick access menu, Stadia+Right Stick to summon a mouse cursor, and Stadia+Left Stick to adjust the volume or brightness.</p><p>On a desktop, the Stadia button can additionally launch Steam’s Big Picture Mode.</p><p>It’s certainly not the best gamepad you can buy for Steam. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/678772/8bitdo-controller-gaming-favorites">This one’s currently my fav</a>.) The Stadia Controller never offered gyro or back buttons, and while I see an “Allow this device to wake Steam Deck” option in the SteamOS Bluetooth menu, it doesn’t seem to work properly. The controller also doesn’t automatically shut off when I put the Deck to sleep — I have to hold down the power button every time.</p><p>Also, don’t expect to plug headphones into the pad’s 3.5mm jack — as Google warned years ago when Stadia shut down, that pass-through audio feature isn’t designed to work in Google’s replacement Bluetooth LE mode.</p><p>But if you picked up a Stadia Controller years ago, perhaps <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22790946/google-stadia-birthday-premiere-edition-price-free">even for free</a>, it’s a great secondary gamepad that might even be a good primary device for certain games. It’s got a tight, clicky, and <em>very</em> directional D-pad, smooth sticks and triggers, and responsive face buttons.</p><p>And through December 31st, saving this gamepad is exceptionally easy. You just plug it into a desktop computer, <a href="https://stadia.google.com/controller/index_en_US.html">open a browser to Google’s official page</a>, and follow a few minutes worth of instructions. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23559284/google-stadia-controller-bluetooth-mode-how-to">Here’s our how-to</a> if you want to see what’s involved first. Afterwards, you just hold Stadia+Y to put it in pairing mode, though it can’t remember pairings for more than one device at a time.</p><p>It’s possible that Google will grant another <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/12/11/24319049/psa-youve-got-another-year-to-save-your-google-stadia-gamepad-from-a-wired-only-existence">last-minute reprieve</a> and extend the deadline another year, but I wouldn’t bet on it. I’ve been asking Google PR for over two weeks, but the company hasn’t offered an answer.</p><p>If you know a friend with this gamepad, or see one at your local thrift store for cheap, perhaps it’s time to save it!</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/829631/save-google-stadia-gamepad-steam-deadline]]></content:encoded>
