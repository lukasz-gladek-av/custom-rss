Funcom, developers of the MMORPG based on Frank Herbert’s <em>Dune</em> sci-fi series, <a href="https://pr.funcom.com/An-important-update-regarding-Dune-Awakening">announced the news</a> saying the game will be pushed back from its May release date to June 10th. Players who have pre-purchased one of the game’s deluxe editions will get access a few days earlier on June 5th.</p><p><em>Dune: Awakening</em> takes place in an alternate universe where <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24086957/dune-part-two-movie-review">Timothee Chalamet was never born</a> and thus never fought Austin Butler in single combat. Your job, as a new arrival to the desert planet Arrakis, is to investigate the disappearance of the Fremen, the planet’s native inhabitants. To do that you’ll have to combat exhaustion, thirst, the blood thirsty Harkonnens, and the Shai Hulud, Arrakis’ big bad worm dudes.</p><p>The delay of the game is only a few weeks, which according to Funcom, gives developers “more time to cook.” Funcom wrote in its announcement that it intends to use the additional time to respond to feedback from the game’s ongoing closed beta testing.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game was originally planned to be a VR-exclusive before the development crew at Innersloth and Schell Games pivoted to making this version of the game accessible to those without the expensive hardware too. <em>Among Us 3D </em>is compatible with Meta Quest, PSVR2, Steam VR headset, or PICO, and PC players on Steam will be able to join in on the fun too via cross-play. </p><p>Players can expect all the crewmate-killing action from the 2018 party game that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196330/among-us-half-billion-players-november">exploded in popularity during the pandemic</a> along with new game modes and extras. There will be lots of cosmetics including new skins and weird little hats, in-game proximity voice chat, and limited time events. Exclusive to <em>Among Us 3D </em>will be a new game mode called <a href="https://youtu.be/NYaSrHVXCmE?si=4q5PSmeWB4UDeXJu">Tag Mode</a> which is exactly what it sounds like. One player will be designated as the infected whose job it is to spread their affliction by chasing, capturing, and infecting unaffected teammates. </p><p><em>Among Us 3D</em> launches May 6th on Steam for $9.99.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
