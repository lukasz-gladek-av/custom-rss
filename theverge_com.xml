He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony is shutting down the “current version” of the PlayStation Stars loyalty and rewards program that it launched in 2022, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/21/playstation-stars-coming-to-a-close-as-sie-evaluates-new-ways-to-evolve-future-loyalty-program-efforts/">according to a blog post</a>. </p><p>The program let users obtain “digital collectibles,” which Sony described <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/14/23215753/sony-playstation-stars-digital-collectibles-loyalty-points">at the time</a> as “digital representations of things that PlayStation fans enjoy, including figurines of beloved and iconic characters from games and other forms of entertainment, as well as cherished devices that tap into Sony’s history of innovation.”</p><p>While that might make them sound like they could have been NFTs, they weren’t; PlayStation’s Grace Chen, VP of network advertising, loyalty, and licensed merchandise, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/07/14/sony-playstation-stars-announcement/">told <em>The Washington Post</em></a> that the program was “not leveraging any blockchain technologies and definitely not NFTs.”</p><p>In Wednesday’s blog post about the shutdown, Chen says that “since launching the program, we’ve learned a lot from evaluating the types of activities our players respond best to, and as a company, we are always evolving with player and industry trends. Through this evaluation, we have decided to refocus our efforts and will be winding down the current version of PlayStation Stars.”</p><p>As of today, “PlayStation Stars will no longer accept new members for this version of the program,” according to Chen. If you’re in the program now, users can “still earn Digital Collectibles, Points and level up their status” until July 23rd at 10:59AM ET, and after that date, there will be no new PlayStation Stars campaigns.</p><p>“This version” of PlayStation Stars will fully end on November 2nd, 2026.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
