            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-webster">Andrew Webster</a> <span>is an entertainment editor covering streaming, virtual worlds, and every single Pokémon video game. Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The developers at Boss Team Games have such sights to show you: the studio just announced that it’s taking the terrifying world of the classic <em>Hellraiser</em> films and turning it into a survival horror game. The new title is called <em>Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival</em>, and somehow it’s the first gaming adaptation of the franchise, which has been around since 1987.</p><p>According to the studio, the game will blend “survival horror with a single-player, story-driven action experience.” And, yes, there will be a dark and mysterious puzzle box. There are also some notable names on board. Doug Bradley, the original actor for <em>Hellraiser</em>’s iconic villain Pinhead, will be reprising the role, and series creator Clive Barker is assisting with the game’s story. In a statement, Barker said that “I’m eager for both the curious and the damned to experience this new chapter in the <em>Hellraiser</em> mythos, where every moment balances on the brink of nightmare and revelation.”</p><p>While this will be the first <em>Hellraiser</em> game, it’s part of a growing trend of classic horror franchises being adapted for the medium. The likes of <em>Friday the 13th</em> and <em>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</em> were turned into asymmetrical multiplayer games, as was <em>The Evil Dead</em>, which was developed by Boss Team.</p><p>Single-player survival horror seems like a better fit for <em>Hellraiser</em>, however, though it’s unclear yet when it might be available. Right now it’s listed as simply “in development.” It’ll be available on the PC, PS5, and Xbox whenever it does launch.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/710637/clive-barker-hellraiser-revival-game-trailer-ps5-xbox]]></content:encoded>
