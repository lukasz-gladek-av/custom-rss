After <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335156/hyperkins-new-xbox-controller-looks-like-a-ps5-dualsense">revealing the final form of its Competitor gamepad</a> at CES 2025, Hyperkin has announced it will be available sometime in October for $49.99 in black and white color options for North America, and red, blue, and gold for Europe and Australia – although the company says those colors will also launch here at a later date.</p><p>The Competitor was first teased as far back as 2019, and while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23841614/hyperkin-competition-xbox-controller-hall-effect-drift-free-sticks-playstation-announcement-specs">Hyperkin revealed a blander design in 2023</a>, it’s now fully embracing comparisons to PlayStation controllers, given that the Competitor features a symmetrical, side-by-side joystick arrangement. The Competitor’s features remain in line with what was revealed earlier this year at CES, including anti-drift Hall effect joysticks and impulse triggers, separated D-pad buttons, a pair of back buttons with locks, and a mic mute button.</p><p>It’s far from being an exact clone of the DualSense, and it lacks the advanced haptic feedback and adaptive triggers of Sony’s controller. And don’t worry about battery life, the Competitor is a wired-only Xbox controller.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/761638/hyperkin-competitor-xbox-wired-controller-sony-ps5-dualsense]]></content:encoded>
