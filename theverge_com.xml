Stevie started out at Laptop Mag writing news and reviews on hardware, gaming, and AI.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Rockstar Games, the developer of <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>, fired between 30 to 40 employees on Thursday, as previously reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. According to the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB), all of the employees fired were part of a private trade union Discord chat and were either already union members or attempting to organize a union at Rockstar.</p><p>“Rockstar has just carried out the most blatant and ruthless act of union busting in the history of the games industry,” IWGB president Alex Marshall said in a statement provided to <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Alan Lewis, head of global corporate communications at Rockstar parent company Take-Two Interactive, responded, telling <em>The Verge</em> the firings were “for gross misconduct, and for no other reason,” without elaborating further.</p><p>The firings were spread out across Rockstar offices in the UK and Canada. They come just seven months ahead of the release of <em>Grand Theft Auto VI. </em>The game’s launch was originally scheduled for this fall, but a few months ago, Rockstar <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660057/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026">delayed its release</a> until May 26th, 2026, saying, “We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.”</p><p>Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) president Alex Marshall:</p><div><blockquote><p>“Rockstar has just carried out the most blatant and ruthless act of union busting in the history of the games industry. This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry.</p><p>Despite this calculated attack on workers organising for a collective voice and to improve their difficult working conditions, the Rockstar Union remains undeterred. They will keep organising for respect and better conditions whilst continuing to pour their blood, sweat and creativity into games that are loved by millions.</p><p>The IWGB will pursue every legal claim possible to ensure our members are reinstated and receive interim relief.”</p></blockquote></div><p>Alan Lewis, head of global corporate communications at Take-Two Interactive:</p><div><blockquote><p>“We strive to make the world’s best entertainment properties by giving our best-in-class creative teams positive work environments and ongoing career opportunities. Our culture is focused on teamwork, excellence, and kindness. Rockstar Games terminated a small number of individuals for gross misconduct, and for no other reason. As always, we fully support Rockstar’s ambitions and approach.”</p></blockquote></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/811999/gta-vi-rockstar-games-union-busting]]></content:encoded>

As part of the latest Windows 11 Insider Preview Build, Microsoft is rolling out support for the Xbox FSE in preview to “MSI Claw models” today, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/10/31/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26220-7051-dev-beta-channels/">the company announced</a>.</p><p>FSE debuted on the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X earlier this month, and my colleague Sean Hollister ran into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/799698/xbox-ally-x-review-asus-microsoft-full-screen-experience">quite a few issues with it</a> (and the new handhelds). If you’re interested in installing the Xbox FSE on your MSI Claw, you might want to wait until some of the problems are ironed out and until it’s available outside of the Windows Insider program.</p><p>To turn on the Xbox FSE, “on supported devices, go to Settings &gt; Gaming &gt; Full screen experience, then select Xbox as your home app,” Microsoft says. “Once enabled, you can access FSE from Task View and Game Bar or configure your handheld to enter full screen experience on startup.”</p><p>In today’s post, Microsoft says that “additional OEMs” will be enabling their handhelds to use the Xbox FSE “in the coming months,” and we already know that Lenovo’s Legion Go 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/772853/the-lenovo-legion-go-2-will-get-xbox-flavored-windows-in-spring-2026">is set to get it next year</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/811826/microsoft-xbox-full-screen-experience-fse-msi-claw-windows-11-insider]]></content:encoded>
