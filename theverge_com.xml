            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/656284/bionic-bay-review-ps5-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Wandering through <em>Bionic Bay</em>’s dark alien world is unsettling and awe-inspiring. There are massive structures with no clear purpose and autonomous factories filled with whirring saw blades and devastating lasers. It’s grim and unforgiving, with little light and harsh shadows that give everything a sinister tone. But then you step on a bomb and your character bounces off of walls like a pinball, and you realize it’s a game of contrasts.</p><p><em>Bionic Bay</em> is a curious blend of two very different genres. On the one hand, it’s an atmospheric side-scrolling adventure in the mold of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/28/12050342/inside-review-xbox-one-steam"><em>Inside</em></a> and <em>Limbo</em>, filled with disturbingly stunning environments to explore. At the same time, it’s a hard-as-nails platformer like <em>Super Meat Boy</em>, with elaborate physics that will have you dying repeatedly while trying to find the best route through deadly obstacles. Somehow, the disparate vibes come together surprisingly well.</p><p>What first drew me to <em>Bionic Bay</em> was that dark world. It’s mysterious to the point that I still don’t actually know what it is you’re doing or why. But that mystery is a large part of the appeal. As you make your way through its levels, you’re subject to some incredible and intimidating environments, and it’s largely up to you to figure out what story the world is trying to tell. There are fiery factories, green areas where organic life merges with technology and architecture in disturbing ways, and dank sewers lit up by dripping bioluminescent goo. All of these spaces make you feel minuscule in comparison. It’s the kind of game where almost every moment makes for a great screenshot.</p><p>In order to see it all, though, you have to deal with a very tough game. While there is some relatively simple platforming at first, you’re soon presented with seemingly insurmountable tasks, like a series of spinning saw blades that require exacting jumps to get through. But it’s not as precise as it may seem. One of the more unique elements of <em>Bionic Bay</em> is its physics; the little guy you control is very sturdy and can survive being bounced around, so you can sometimes flop your way through trickier areas.</p><p><em>Bionic Bay</em> is also something of a puzzle game. You have access to multiple powers, like the ability to swap places with an inanimate object or slow down time (though you can only actively be using one). Combine these tools with the floppy physics and there are a lot of creative ways to get through the game.</p><p>Key to this is that <em>Bionic Bay</em> encourages experimentation. You will die a lot, but because the game has such a forgiving checkpoint system, there’s rarely much punishment for failure. Being able to quickly retry a jump keeps the game from being too frustrating while also making it easier to find a route that actually works. And if you have a wild idea about, say, riding on the back of a rocket to avoid killer laser beams, there’s no harm in trying.</p><p>The game isn’t easy. I’ve found myself stuck on a few occasions. And while I wish the game focused a little more on exploration, the weird and unforgiving world is also what helped me persevere through the trickier challenges. I just had to see what was next.</p><p>If you’re a fan of sci-fi works like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/19/15663380/blame-netflix-anime-tsutomu-nihei"><em>Blame!</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24086957/dune-part-two-movie-review"><em>Dune</em></a>, with their impressive sense of scale, <em>Bionic Bay</em> offers something very similar. You just have to work hard to see it all.</p><p><sub>Bionic Bay <em>is out now on the PS5 and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/report/656783/gpu-prices-are-out-of-control-again<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Every so often, Central Computers — one of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/24/22298616/frys-electronics-going-out-of-business">last remaining</a> dedicated Silicon Valley computer stores — lets subscribers know it’s managed to obtain a small shipment of AMD graphics cards. Today, it informed me that I could now purchase a $600 Radeon RX 9070 XT <a href="https://www.centralcomputer.com/sapphire-pulse-radeon-rx-9070-xt-gaming-16gb-gddr6-graphics-card-pcie-5-0-3x-displayport-2-1-1x-hdmi-2-1-16-pin-power-connectors.html">for $850</a> — a $250 markup.</p><p>It’s not alone. I just checked every major US retailer and street prices on eBay, and I regret to inform you: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/1/23191634/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-over-3080-3070-3060-radeon-rx-6900-6800">the great GPU shortage</a> has returned. Many AMD cards are being marked up $100, $200, $250, even $280. The street price of an Nvidia RTX 5080 is now over $1,500, a full $500 higher than MSRP. And <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">an RTX 5090</a>, the most powerful consumer GPU? You can’t even get the $2,000 card for $3,000 today.</p><p>Here, I’ve built tables to show you:</p><div><h2>GPU street prices: April 2025</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Item</h3></th><th><h3>MSRP</h3></th><th><h3>Average eBay street price (Mar-Apr)</h3></th><th><h3>Best retail price (April 25th)</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT</td><td>$599</td><td>$957</td><td>$880</td></tr><tr><td>AMD Radeon RX 9070</td><td>$549</td><td>$761</td><td>$835</td></tr><tr><td>Nvidia RTX 5090</td><td>$1,999</td><td>$3,871</td><td>$3,140</td></tr><tr><td>Nvidia RTX 5080</td><td>$999</td><td>$1,533</td><td>$1,390</td></tr><tr><td>Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti</td><td>$749</td><td>$1,052</td><td>$825</td></tr><tr><td>Nvidia RTX 5070</td><td>$549</td><td>$715</td><td>$610</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>“Best retail price” is the actual price I saw a card for on April 25th — roughly the minimum you’d pay.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>You shouldn’t just blame tariffs for these price hikes. In early March, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628332/amd-9070-xt-gpu-retailer-partner-scalping">we found retailers were already scalping</a> their supposedly entry-level MSRP models of the new AMD graphics cards. Nor is this likely to just be high demand, given how few cards are changing hands on eBay: only around 1,100 new Nvidia GPUs, and around 266 new AMD GPUs were listed there over the past 30 days.</p><div><p>But tariffs may have an greater impact soon: on May 2nd, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/politics/646604/trump-tariffs-reciprocal-pause-canada-mexico-china-de-minimis">the de minimis exemption will no longer apply</a>, meaning shipments valued at $800 or less can be taxed, and many more shipments will likely get hit as a result. Stores like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/656165/shein-temu-price-increase-trump-tariffs-fast-fashion">Shein and Temu have already raised prices</a> in anticipation.</p></div><p>Here’s a deeper dive on the “MSRP” models of the AMD cards, which were all originally listed at $549 or $599:</p><div><h2>AMD “MSRP” GPU prices, April 2025</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Item</h3></th><th><h3>MSRP</h3></th><th><h3>April 25th, Newegg</h3></th><th><h3>April 25th, Micro Center</h3></th><th><h3>eBay street price (past 30 days)</h3></th><th><h3>Units on eBay (past 30 days)</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>PowerColor Reaper 9070 XT</td><td>$599</td><td>$699</td><td>$799</td><td>$755</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Sapphire Pulse 9070 XT</td><td>$599</td><td>$879</td><td>$849</td><td>$879</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>XFX Swift 9070 XT</td><td>$599</td><td>$839</td><td>$829</td><td>$949</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>ASRock Steel Legend 9070 XT</td><td>$599</td><td>$699</td><td>$699</td><td>$892</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Gigabyte Gaming 9070 XT</td><td>$599</td><td>$659</td><td>N/A</td><td>$913</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>PowerColor Reaper 9070</td><td>$549</td><td>$699</td><td>$679</td><td>$765</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Sapphire Pulse 9070</td><td>$549</td><td>$669</td><td>$789</td><td>$771</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>XFX Swift OC 9070</td><td>$549</td><td>$639</td><td>$749</td><td>$746</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>ASRock Challenger 9070</td><td>$549</td><td>$549</td><td>$609</td><td>$880</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Gigabyte Gaming OC 9070</td><td>$549</td><td>$669</td><td>$669</td><td>$893</td><td>36</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>eBay street prices are an average.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>I’ve focused this table on Newegg and Micro Center since they carry more models than any other retailer, though I also spotted “MSRP” 9070 XT cards at $800 and $850 at Amazon today, and an $830 card at Best Buy. Otherwise, these are the new sticker prices, not necessarily attainable prices, as most were out of stock.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay">From December 2020</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/1/23191634/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-over-3080-3070-3060-radeon-rx-6900-6800">July 2022</a>, I periodically tracked the prices of game consoles and GPUs during the covid-19 pandemic, when they were incredibly expensive to obtain. At one point, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards">some GPUs were worth triple their MSRP</a>. I’d love to hear from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24306571/verge-subscription-launch-fewer-ads-unlimited-access-full-text-rss"><em>Verge</em> subscribers</a> in particular: is this a valuable service we should continue in the tariff era? Or do you just want to know when it’s safe to enter the water again?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
