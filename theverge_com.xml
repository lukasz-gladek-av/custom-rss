            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony is suing Tencent to attempt to stop the release of <em>Light of Motiram</em>, which Sony describes as a “slavish clone” of its <em>Horizon</em> series of games, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/sony-sues-tencent-allegedly-ripping-off-horizon-video-games-2025-07-28/">as reported by <em>Reuters</em></a>. <em>Light of Motiram</em> was announced last year with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTMxBhy2dp0">a trailer</a> featuring an aesthetic that’s quite similar to the <em>Horizon</em> franchise — including huge robot animals and even a title font that resembles the <em>Horizon</em> games.</p><p>In its complaint, Sony alleges that “unlawful copying of the protected audiovisual elements of the <em>Horizon</em> games, as well as its deliberate adoption of a confusingly similar character mark, constitutes both copyright and trademark infringement that should be enjoined immediately.”</p><p>According to the lawsuit, Tencent started developing <em>Light of Motiram</em> in 2023. At the Game Developers Conference in March 2024, Tencent allegedly pitched Sony on a proposal that would have its Aurora Studios subsidiary “develop a <em>Horizon</em> sequel game under the requested license,” which Sony rejected. “Apparently, Tencent was undeterred by SIE’s refusal to license its <em>Horizon</em> intellectual property,” Sony says.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3319630%2FLIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM%2F" rel="sponsored">game’s Steam page</a>, <em>Light of Motiram’s</em> developer and publisher is Polaris Quest. In the lawsuit, Sony alleges that “Upon information and belief, Tencent Shanghai does business under the names ‘Aurora Studios’ and/or ‘Polaris Quest.’”</p><p>Sony says that it “had discussions with Tencent” to informally try to “resolve its concern that <em>Light of Motiram</em> violated its intellectual property rights.” However, Sony alleges that Tencent “again sought to license the <em>Horizon</em> intellectual property,” to which it “communicated clearly and unequivocally that it would not license the <em>Horizon</em> assets to Tencent, objected to <em>Light of Motiram</em>, and insisted that it be withdrawn.”</p><p>Tencent didn’t reply to a request for comment.</p><p>This isn’t the only high-profile lawsuit over allegedly similar video games. Last year, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248602/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-pocketpair-patent-infringement-lawsuit">against <em>Palworld</em>-developer Pocketpair</a>. Pocketpair said in May that it had to remove features from the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/663210/palworld-updates-feature-removed-nintendo-lawsuit">due to the lawsuit</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/714870/sony-tencent-horizon-clone-lawsuit]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Another San Diego Comic-Con has come and gone, and while there were no explosive reveals like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/27/24206259/marvel-russo-brothers-avengers-doomsday-secret-wars-sdcc">last year’s surprise appearance of Robert Downey Jr. as Doctor Doom</a>, there were quite a few interesting developments. That includes several <em>Star Trek</em> spinoffs, a new sci-fi show on Apple TV Plus, trailers for everything from <em>Peacemaker</em> to <em>Gen V</em>, and a surprising amount of Stephen King.</p><p>Here’s everything notable that you might have missed.</p><div><p id="meet-pavi-the-new-avatar"><h2>Meet Pavi, the new Avatar</h2></p></div><p>We’ve got our first look at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/616866/avatar-seven-havens-nickelodeon-konietzko-dimartino">Nickelodeon’s newest entry in the animated <em>Avatar</em> franchise</a>, and while <em>Seven Havens</em> doesn’t have a firm release date just yet, we now know that Pavi (the new Earthbending Avatar) is good friends with a cat / lemur hybrid.</p><div><p id="its-aztec-batman-vs-the-conquistadors"><h2>It’s Aztec Batman vs. the conquistadors</h2></p></div><p>Writer / director Juan Meza-León’s upcoming animated feature for DC Studios reimagines the Dark Knight as an Aztec warrior whose life is turned upside down when his father is murdered by Spanish conquistadors. If it’s anything like <em>Batman Ninja vs. Yakuza League</em>, <em>Aztec Batman: Clash of Empires</em> is going to be wild, and after it hits HBO Max on September 18th, we’re probably going to be seeing a lot of fan art of these inspired costumes.</p><div><p id="coyote-vs-acme-gets-a-date"><h2><em>Coyote vs. Acme</em> gets a date</h2></p></div><div><p>The feel-good story of this formerly canceled movie continues. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/632742/coyote-v-acme-ketchup-entertainment-theatrical-release">We already knew it was coming to theaters next year</a>, and now there’s a specific date: <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/coyote-vs-acme-release-date-1236471190/">August 28th</a>.</p></div><div><p id="gen-v-is-for-the-children"><h2><em>Gen V</em> is for the children</h2></p></div><p>The kids are not alright in the new trailer for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678130/gen-v-season-2-premiere-date-september-17"><em>Gen V</em>’s upcoming second season</a>. But when the show returns on September 17th, Marie (Jaz Sinclair) and her friends are going to be on a mission that forces them all to level up and become the kind of superheroes that might be able to take down Homelander.</p><div><p id="it-welcome-to-derry-looks-fantastic"><h2><em>It: Welcome to Derry</em> looks fantastic</h2></p></div><p>No one in their right mind would ever move to Derry, Maine, if they knew what kind of monster was lurking in the town’s shadows. But everyone in the new trailer for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/670460/it-prequel-welcome-to-derry-trailer-hbo">HBO’s <em>It</em> prequel</a> is pretty clueless about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/12/14897214/it-reboot-pennywise-preview-sxsw-2017">Pennywise</a>, who seems like he’s going to be eating very well when the show premieres later this year.</p><div><p id="ready-to-take-the-long-walk"><h2>Ready to take The Long Walk?</h2></p></div><p>When <em>The Long Walk </em>was first published in 1979, the idea of people entering a deadly walking competition in hopes of winning a prize probably seemed much more far-fetched. But everything about Lionsgate’s new adaptation that’s premiering on September 12th feels unsettlingly plausible given the state of the world in 2025.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><figcaption>Maul: Shadow Lord.</figcaption> <cite>Image: Lucasfilm</cite></span></p></section><div><p id="heres-a-first-look-at-maul-shadow-lord"><h2>Here’s a first look at <em>Maul: Shadow Lord</em></h2></p></div><p>There wasn’t much <em>Star Wars</em> presence at Comic Con, but we did at least get the first still image from this Darth Maul animated series coming to Disney Plus next year. As an added bonus, Lucasfilm also showed off a new image from the second season of <em>Ahsoka</em>.</p><div><p id="peacemaker-season-2-is-going-multiversal"><h2><em>Peacemaker </em>season 2 is going multiversal</h2></p></div><p>Now that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/movie-reviews/701362/superman-dc-studios-james-gunn-review">Superman</a> has become a headliner in DC Studios’ new cinematic universe, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tv/714446/peacemakers-new-trailer-reveals-how-itll-tidy-up-dc-canon">HBO Max’s <em>Peacemaker </em>series</a> looks like it’s stepping its game up and getting much weirder in its second season due out on August 21st.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24150193/apple-tv-plus-sci-fi-streaming-dark-matter-constellation">Apple’s run of science fiction</a> doesn’t appear to be slowing down with the reveal of <em>Pluribus</em> from <em>Breaking Bad</em> creator Vince Gilligan. While the teaser doesn’t reveal much, we at least know it’ll start streaming on November 7th.</p><div><p id="a-few-minutes-of-scott-pilgrim-ex-gameplay"><h2>A few minutes of <em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em> gameplay</h2></p></div><p>The gang is back together (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23963700/scott-pilgrim-takes-off-review-netflix">again</a>) in this side-scrolling beat-’em-up from the team behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/18/23172898/tmnt-shredders-revenge-classic-arcade-game-interview"><em>Shredder’s Revenge</em></a>. The latest trailer focuses on the gameplay and is full of some great Anamanaguchi tracks.</p><div><p id="president-curtis-reporting-for-duty"><h2><em>President Curtis</em> reporting for duty</h2></p></div><p>The <em>Rick and Morty</em> cinematic universe is growing, as Adult Swim announced a spinoff called <em>President Curtis</em>, which will see Keith David reprise the titular role as he deals with everything from “interdimensional diplomacy to paranormal investigations and unexplained phenomena.” No word on when it will air.</p><div><p id="a-first-look-at-starfleet-academy"><h2>A first look at <em>Starfleet Academy</em></h2></p></div><p>Another <em>Star Trek</em> spinoff is coming to Paramount Plus, but this one focuses on a fresh cast of recruits at the academy in a futuristic San Francisco. There’s no date yet, but it’ll be streaming in 2026.</p><div><p id="strange-new-worlds-will-get-even-stranger-in-season-4"><h2><em>Strange New Worlds</em> will get even stranger in season 4</h2></p></div><p>While season 3 is currently airing, Paramount provided a surprise glimpse at the upcoming fourth (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/686564/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-season-five-final-renewal">and penultimate</a>) season of the show. It’s surprising because, well, there’s a muppet.</p><div><p id="talamasca-will-connect-all-of-amcs-anne-rice-adaptations"><h2><em>Talamasca </em>will connect all of AMC’s Anne Rice adaptations</h2></p></div><p>AMC’s other Anne Rice adaptations have yet to have any significant overlap. But the network’s upcoming series about an organization of humans keeping an eye on the supernatural world seems like it’s going to change all of that when it premieres on October 26th.</p><div><p id="the-vampire-lestat-is-ready-to-rock"><h2><em>The Vampire Lestat </em>is ready to rock</h2></p></div><p>Lestat (Sam Reid) is going on tour in the third season of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186463/interview-with-the-vampire-season-3-is-a-go">AMC’s <em>Interview With the Vampire </em>series</a>, and it seems like he’s doing everything in his power to reveal the existence of his kind to the human world</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTE="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Charles Pulliam-Moore</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/film/714492/sdcc-2025-best-trailers-announcements]]></content:encoded>
