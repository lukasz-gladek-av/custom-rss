            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/681254/seagate-4tb-xbox-storage-expansion-card<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Seagate has announced a new 4TB version of its storage expansion card for the Xbox Series X and S consoles. It’s the first time the company has introduced a new capacity since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738266/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-512gb-2tb-storage-expansion-cards-release-date-pricing">launching 2TB and 512GB versions</a> of the expansion card in late 2021.</p><p>The 4TB card is available starting today through Seagate’s online store and Best Buy for $499.99, but is discounted to $429.99 as part of a limited-time launch promotion. For comparison, the Xbox Series S starts at $379.99, while the Xbox Series X starts at $599.99. </p><p>But, the added storage may be required by folks with large libraries of games. Depending on the options and expansions you install, games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283801/comcast-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-large-downloads"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22593883/microsoft-flight-simulator-xbox-series-x-s-review"><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em></a> can easily gobble up hundreds of gigs of storage each. You can increase the Xbox’s storage capacity using an external drive connected over USB, but to play games directly from an SSD, without having to move files around, requires the storage expansion cards.</p><p>You may want to wait for a price drop, though. The 2TB version of the card was originally priced at $399.99, but is now listed on <a href="https://www.seagate.com/products/gaming-drives/xbox-gaming/storage-expansion-for-xbox-series-x/?sku=STJR1000400">Seagate’s online store for $249.99</a>, with a current promotion bringing it down to $219.99. </p><p>For nearly three years, Seagate was the only company offering expandable storage cards for the Xbox Series X and S, but in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/6/23750797/western-digital-xbox-storage-expansion-card-price-release-date">mid-2023 Western Digital</a> introduced its own. Its current pricing and capacities are comparable to Seagate’s offerings. Western Digital hasn’t yet introduced a 4TB option.</p><p>Although the added competition did help bring the price of Seagate’s expansion cards down, they’re still more expensive than storage expansions for the PlayStation 5, which allows you to use any SSD as long as it meets certain performance requirements. Not only does <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-accessories%2F4tb-wd-black-sn850p-nvme-ssd-for-ps5-consoles" rel="sponsored">Western Digital already sell a PS5-compatible 4TB SSD</a> for $339.99, it also offers an 8TB option, although that will set you back a steep $699.99.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
