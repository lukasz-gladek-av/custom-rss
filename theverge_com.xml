The Voicemod Key serves as a workaround — it sports a USB-C connection that plugs into a tablet or smartphone (including older iPhones thanks to an included lightning adapter), and two audio jacks that connect to your console and a wired gaming headset. The Voicemod mobile app can then be used to access the platform’s soundboard and real-time voice-changing features in console chats.</p><div><figcaption><em>Here’s an example of how the setup works — it’s worth noting that Voicemod Key will only work with wired headsets.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Voicemod</cite></p></div><p>The Voicemod Key is supported on iOS 16 and Android 8.1 or higher. Availability is restricted to paid Voicemod subscribers, and the Key price will depend on your current membership tier: $25 for users with existing monthly or lifetime Pro accounts, or a $36 bundle that includes the Voicemod Key and an annual subscription for non-members.</p><p>“In-game voice chats are becoming essential for building real connections in the digital world,” said <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/pl/Console-gamers-can-now-transform-their-voices-while-they-play-thanks-t">Voicemod CEO Jaime Bosch in the announcement</a>. “Gamers value the convenience of console platforms, and we’re excited to bring our real-time voice transformation technology to all their favorite consoles.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
