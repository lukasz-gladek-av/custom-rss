Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s looking like Nintendo might have a DK-sized addition to its feature film lineup. The company has <a href="https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/rmm_voyager_V01503556900000">filed a copyright notice</a> for a motion picture listed as an “Untitled Donkey Kong Project.” And last month, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said in <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf">an investors call</a> that the company was working on more movies, explaining that “although we cannot discuss our plans beyond <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> movie at this time, we are working on various other projects.” So even though a Donkey Kong movie isn’t official just yet, it seems likely — and it would make a whole lot of sense for Nintendo.</p><div><p>Nintendo’s current foray into film got off to a great start. It partnered with Universal for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a>, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/1/23695720/nintendo-mario-movie-billion-box-office">earned more than $1 billion</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/666569/super-mario-world-movie-sequel-nintendo-universal">currently has a sequel in the works</a>. It was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/671949/nintendo-switch-2-era-risks">a safe bet among a series of safe bets from Nintendo</a>: taking one of the most iconic properties in games and adapting it alongside Universal’s Illumination animation studio, the same team behind family-friendly blockbusters like <em>Minions</em> and <em>Despicable Me</em>. Nintendo used a similar tactic for its foray into theme parks, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23608700/super-nintendo-world-entertainment-miyamoto-takahashi-interview">leading with Mario and the Mushroom Kingdom</a>, and also partnering with Universal.</p></div><p>Things will get trickier from there. While the <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> sequel seems like a fairly safe follow-up, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682751/legend-of-zelda-live-action-movie-date-delay">upcoming adaptation of <em>The Legend of Zelda</em></a> feels much riskier. <em>Zelda</em> games are as popular as they’ve ever been thanks to Switch-era releases <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, but taking a beloved fantasy world and translating it into a live-action film is more complicated than an animated Mario movie crafted by an established studio. The casting of Link and Zelda alone will likely bring much more scrutiny than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/17/23645093/super-mario-bros-movie-chris-pratt-mario-voice-nintendo">Chris Pratt’s Mario voice</a>. <em>Zelda</em> director Wes Ball has had some success in the past, most recently with last year’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/10/24152293/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review"><em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em></a>, but nothing to suggest that the live-action take on Hyrule will be a guaranteed box office success. (And that’s not even factoring <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23668181/super-mario-bros-movie-live-action-revisited">Nintendo’s questionable history with live-action films</a>.)</p><div><p>Given how calculated Nintendo tends to be, balancing out a risky bet like Zelda with a safer one like Donkey Kong makes a lot of sense. And the company has been priming DK for his breakout moment for years now. Not only did the character have a major role in the first <em>Mario Bros.</em> film (voiced by Seth Rogen), but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24293604/super-nintendo-world-theme-park-donkey-kong-country-osaka-date">a DK-themed area was the first expansion for the Super Nintendo World theme park in Osaka</a>. DK is also playing a major role in the launch of the Switch 2. Following the launch title <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, this week’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/703468/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-interview-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/695726/donkey-kong-bananza-developers-super-mario-odyssey">developed by the same team behind <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a> — will be the console’s second significant Nintendo exclusive.</p></div><p>So this really is Donkey Kong’s moment. The original game from 1981 was a pivotal point as Nintendo cemented its space in video games, introducing Mario to the world and also providing a taste of what <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23604504/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-super-nintendo-world">creator Shigeru Miyamoto</a> had in store for the future. Now, a few decades later, DK is playing a different but no less pivotal role in the company’s biggest expansions, whether it’s a theme park or new console — and, just maybe, his own movie.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/analysis/706610/donkey-kong-movie-copyright-notice-nintendo-strategy]]></content:encoded>
