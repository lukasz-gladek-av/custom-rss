            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/669323/elgato-stream-deck-modules-vsd-scissor-switches<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Elgato announced a new “Stream Deck Everywhere” strategy at Computex, which includes a software-based virtual Stream Deck for PCs, an ethernet dock accessory, unbranded Stream Deck modules that can bring its keys into other products, and even new scissor-switch keys for a more precise, keyboard-like feel. “With these launches, we’re opening up Stream Deck to a world of new users, from developers and DIY builders to manufacturers seeking a field-proven interface for their products,” said Elgato general manager Julian Fest. “Because Stream Deck isn’t just a device—it’s a platform.</p><p>Stream Deck Modules are designed for hobbyists and manufacturers to easily integrate into hardware projects instead of ripping apart the consumer version or developing their own custom macropad solutions. The modules are available in 6-, 15-, and 32-key variants and are housed in an aluminum chassis that can be built into custom bases, machines, and furniture, making it possible to actually create <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640725/april-fools-2025-elgatos-stream-deck-desk">Elgato’s ridiculous 1,262-key April Fools’ desk</a>.</p><p>The Stream Deck Modules are available now starting at $49.99 for the six-key version, $129.99 for the 15-key, and $199.99 for the 32-key. Elgato technical marketing manager Philipp Eggebrecht told <em>The Verge</em> that discounts will be offered for bulk purchases.</p><p>A new variant of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22579144/elgato-stream-deck-mk-2-stand-faceplates-usb-c-valve">MK.2 Stream Deck</a> has been introduced that replaces the membrane keys with scissor-style switches that provide “enhanced speed and precision,” according to Elgato. Eggebrecht says the scissor keys variant costs $149.99 and will be available in “around two weeks.” </p><p>Stream Deck buttons that feel more like keyboard keys would make it easier for users to tell they’ve clicked something without having to look at the device. Elgato describes the scissor switch variant as something that “lends itself to typing-style interactions, paving the way for new use cases that benefit from rapid, multi-layered input and control,” which could be testing the waters for a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/features/24191410/elgato-stream-deck-art-lebedev-optimus-maximus-keyboard-retrospective">Stream Deck keyboard</a> or any other application requiring precise controls.</p><p>“The idea of a full LCD-key based keyboard is interesting. We’ve explored it in the past and so far, what we’ve found is that the experience hasn’t been great, and there’s the cost question,” Eggebrecht told <em>The Verge</em>. “We’re getting closer to a keyboard feeling with Stream Deck Scissor Keys, and always looking at the technology and what is becoming possible. Stream Deck and keyboards are a natural fit.”</p><p>Elgato is also rolling out a software-only Stream Deck for desktop devices, akin to the <a rel="sponsored" href="https://elgato.sjv.io/c/482924/2029077/13666?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elgato.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fs%2Fstream-deck-mobile">existing Stream Deck mobile app</a>. The Virtual Stream Deck (VSD) can provide a permanent macro menu on computer screens or be summoned at will when users hit allocated hotkeys and mouse buttons. The VSD software will initially be available for people who own a Corsair Scimitar Elite Wireless SE mouse, Xenon Edge touchscreen, or any Stream Deck model, before later rolling out to “more devices.”</p><p>Custom layouts, virtual faceplates, and support for beyond six buttons require iPhone and Android Stream Deck users to pay for Pro access, which starts at $2.99 monthly or $49.99 as a one-time purchase. Eggebrecht says Elgato’s desktop VSD isn’t locked behind a subscription, but does require users to install the Stream Deck 7.0 beta.</p><p>A new $79.99 Stream Deck network dock accessory was also announced that includes support for power over Ethernet (PoE), which lets you place its buttons anywhere there’s a network jack, and with more flexibility than USB-C affords by itself. Eggebrecht says the Stream Deck network dock will start shipping in August.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He joined in 2018, and served as commerce editor at Polygon until May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>WizKids did <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23860060/baldurs-gate-3-news-reviews-updates">Baldur’s Gate 3</a></em> dirty with its new D&amp;D Icons of the Realms collection of miniature figures. The anticipated collection based on the beloved RPG (my personal 2023 GOTY) launched in April, and some buyers noticed that the characters look nothing — and I mean <em>nothing </em>— like how they were advertised. These cursed recreations of Shadowheart, Astarion, Karlach, Gale, Wyll, and Lae’zel look like unlicensed knockoffs when they are, in fact, officially licensed by Wizards of the Coast. And, it costs $50 for the set!</p><p>Anyone who has played the game, or at least seen its cover art numerous times, knows what these characters should look like. They don’t look like 3D-printed discards predestined for the garbage bin, with little to no effort made to look authentic, unless perhaps you’re squinting from 10 feet away.</p><p>In response to buyers posting pictures of the botched figures on social media and retail sites, and likely from <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/baldurs-gate-3-companions-got-official-usd50-d-and-d-minis-and-i-am-casting-vicious-mockery-because-what-in-the-nine-hells-is-this/"><em>GamesRadar</em></a> and other sites posting about it last week, <a href="https://wizkids.com/recent-announcements-2/baldurs-gate-3-character-boxed-set-update/">WizKids posted an apology</a> to buyers — and to Wizards of the Coast. In it, it details how to get a refund or a replacement to anyone who bought them online or at a local games store. Keep them, replace them, destroy them, pray to them. It’s up to you.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/669885/darth-vader-ai-fortnite-sag-aftra-unfair-labor-complaint<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>SAG-AFTRA, the organization that represents voice, motion, and screen performers, has filed an <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-statement-fortnites-use-ai-darth-vader-voice-and-ulp-filing">unfair labor complaint against Epic Games</a>. The complaint stems from the company’s recent introduction of an AI programmed to sound like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/668349/fortnite-star-wars-james-earl-jones-vader-ai-voice">James Earl Jones’ Darth Vader that can respond to a player’s actions and questions</a>.</p></div><p>SAG-AFTRA wrote in a statement that it understands its members and members’ estates wish to use AI technology in any way they choose. “However,” SAG-AFTRA’s statement continued, “we must protect our right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of our members, including those who previously did the work of matching Darth Vader’s iconic rhythm and tone in video games.”</p><p>While the AI “revolution” slowly replaces human workers with oftentimes inferior products, and despite <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/10/24033258/sag-aftra-ai-video-game-voice-acting-licensing-replica-studios">some members’ distaste for the practice</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/18/23962349/sag-aftra-tentative-agreement-generative-artificial-intelligence-vote">SAG-AFTRA has embraced the idea of using AI</a> trained to replicate an actor’s performance. It has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24283240/sag-aftra-has-announced-an-agreement-with-ethovox-which-is-building-a-foundational-ai-model-for-voic">established contracts and partnerships with several AI companies</a> with the idea being members can use this technology with specific contract-guaranteed protections. So the act of using an AI to replace Darth Vader’s voice performers (both the late James Earl Jones and those brought in after his death to match his performance) isn’t what SAG-AFTRA is objecting to. Rather, it’s the fact that this was done without Epic Games sitting down with SAG-AFTRA at the bargaining table to hash out the specifics. </p><p>“<em>Fortnite</em>’s signatory company, Llama Productions, chose to replace the work of human performers with AI technology,” SAG-AFTRA wrote. “Unfortunately, they did so without providing any notice of their intent to do this and without bargaining with us over appropriate terms.” <em>The Verge</em> has reached out to Epic Games for comment.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24213808/video-game-voice-actor-strike-sag-aftra">AI and its use in video game voice and motion performance</a> is the main stumbling block in the ongoing video game voice actor strike. Negotiations between SAG-AFTRA and the signatory companies of its interactive media agreement broke down last year, and performers have been on strike since July — a length of time that eclipses both the actors and writers strikes of 2023.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
