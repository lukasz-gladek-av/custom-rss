            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/674523/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-live-service<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Tiger Borgia, a content creator focused on cozy games, has been pulling weeds in <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> for over five years. </p><p>Given the current landscape in which game developers constantly release new updates to vie for the attention of audiences, Borgia’s dedication to <em>New Horizons</em> can come across as admirable. Nintendo has not released a major update to <em>New Horizons </em>since the <em>Happy Home Paradise</em> DLC in 2021. (Just this week <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/49112/~/how-to-update-animal-crossing%3A-new-horizons">the game was patched</a> in advance of the Switch 2.) The version of <em>New Horizons</em> Borgia plays today — the one where she pulls weeds and fishes each day — is more or less the same game that the company released in the spring of 2020. </p><p>At a time when seemingly every publisher is trying to capture a piece of the lucrative live-service boom, <em>New Horizons</em> showed Nintendo slowly inching its way into the space with more than a year’s worth of regular updates after launch. And that expansion into live service is something that could become an even larger part of Nintendo’s future with the Switch 2.</p><p>Speaking to <em>The Verge</em>, Borgia explains that two years ago she would have said yes to having more content in <em>New Horizons</em>, but her opinion has since changed. “Now I feel like the game should be left as is,” Borgia says via email. “<em>New Horizons</em> already had its moment. I would be open to the next Animal Crossing title being a live-service game, but I would be skeptical about paywalls and subscription fees.”</p><p>Since the release of <em>Fortnite </em>and<em> PUBG: Battlegrounds </em>in 2017, live-service games have become a core pillar of modern gaming. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-09-29/why-playstation-fans-are-cheering-ceo-jim-ryan-s-departure">Live-service games</a> — or what some call “games as a service” — don’t have a clear start and end. Instead, developers release a base game and continue to put out updates that add new characters, game modes, and other content to try and get people to play as much as possible.</p><p>The model has become a massively popular way to monetize games. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lj27nkyes22r">Industry analyst Mat Piscatella</a> published data saying more than 40 percent of all time spent playing on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles in the US in the month of January was spent playing the top 10 live-service games. And the trend has hit the developer side too: a <a href="https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-2025-state-game-industry-devs-weigh-layoffs-ai-and-more">2025 survey from the Game Developers Conference</a> found that roughly 30 percent of all “AAA” developers are working on a live-service game. </p><p>Despite all the big numbers, Nintendo has been selective with the live-service games it develops. Creating a live-service game isn’t as easy as flipping a switch, and even major companies like Sony have struggled to enter the space; it <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects">recently shut down development on two such projects</a>. However, some fans are wondering if that could change with the Switch 2. </p><p>Previous titles like <em>Splatoon 3 </em>have already gotten live-esque service with regular <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23683377/splatoon-3-splatfest-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-kingdom">updates and events</a> — even if the earlier entries in the series were ultimately shut down. And <em>New Horizons</em> received a steady stream of updates initially. New features, like the Switch 2’s Discord-like social tool GameChat, could benefit live-service games that rely on online communication and logging in with friends regularly to play. Additionally, leaks from an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275596/nintendo-switch-online-beta-playtest-program-leak-mmo">October playtest</a> suggested that Nintendo could be working on some sort of MMO for the Switch 2, which could also fall under the umbrella of a live-service game. </p><p>But here is the most compelling argument that a shift could be on the horizon: Nintendo has already been investing in live-service games for years. If you look at Nintendo’s mobile games, entries like <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em> already used a free-to-play model with in-game transactions at launch.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Some Animal Crossing fans welcome the possibility of adapting the mainline games to a live-service model. <em>New Horizons</em> is really good for people who like to get creative and design an island, but the game can run out of new content after players complete certain tasks and storylines.</p><p>Tom, an artist who played the game for more than two years, tells <em>The Verge</em> a live-service version of the game could have kept him playing even longer. “More updates would have made it <em>way</em> more likely that I’d have kept going, especially because it would keep friends coming back too,” he says<em>.</em></p><p>Additionally, the gameplay and structure of <em>New Horizons </em>could be the perfect fit for a live-service game, since it has seasonal events depending on the time of year and the region you play in. However, some of the fans I spoke to expressed skepticism. </p><p>“I was never expecting to get infinite content from Animal Crossing honestly,” Christi Kerr, a player who spent more than 700 hours playing <em>New Horizons</em>, tells <em>The Verge</em>. “I was used to old AC games where all the content came out at once, and you play it until you feel like you’ve done all you want. I thought the updates to <em>New Horizons</em> were fun, but also kind of frustrating as a <em>New Leaf</em> player.”</p><p>That’s not to say that players <em>The Verge</em> spoke to are completely closed off to the live-service model with the next mainline Animal Crossing game; it just needs to be done in a way that feels respectful to players’ time, money, and attention. Today, even beloved live-service games are regularly criticized by fans for requiring too much time to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteXPMaps/comments/1h45vb0/leveling_up_this_season_so_far_doesnt_seem_so_easy/">level up a battle pass</a> or for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/wa1348/patch_28_has_the_worst_puzzle_designs_in_genshin/">poorly designed events</a>. </p><p>“If Animal Crossing were to consider a live-service approach, I really hope that they would focus on seasonal events and quality-of-life updates,” Borgia says. “I would be nervous to say I hope for continuous new content like furniture and clothing, because that can easily turn into a microtransaction nightmare. I’d love to have more seasonal celebrations, challenges, and temporary NPC visitors.”</p><p>So far, Nintendo has shown a measured approach to live-service games. In the case of <em>Pocket Camp</em>, Nintendo ended up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312047/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-complete-review-microtransactions">rereleasing it as a standalone game</a> free of microtransactions. Now, people who missed the boat on playing <em>Pocket Camp</em> initially and don’t like in-app purchases can still play the same game. </p><p>For the fans we spoke to, this is good enough. Animal Crossing doesn’t need to be some sort of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23583539/back-4-blood-content-updates-expansion-packs-good">never-ending forever game</a> that trudges on like a zombie throughout the years. As Kerr put it, it’s totally fine to have a game start and end, and then get a new one down the line. </p><p>“I would’ve been delighted to see updates like a live service game. [...] But like I said, I’m not bothered if the next Animal Crossing game sustains my interest for a while and then I’m done.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Alongside Switch 2 support comes new features, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642093/nintendo-switch-smartphone-app-zelda-notes">first announced in early April</a>, making it easier to access screenshots on other devices and adding mobile notifications for GameChat invitations.</p><p>The most useful update to the app is that the Switch 2 will be able to upload screenshots and videos to it through the cloud. The Switch 2’s album will have a new Upload to Smart Device option for manually sending screenshots, as well as an automatic uploads feature where the 100 most recent screenshots and videos on the console will be available in the app.</p><p>Files will be stored in the cloud for up to 30 days, Nintendo says, but can be downloaded from the app to a mobile device’s camera roll to be saved permanently. If you attempt to upload more than 100 screenshots and videos, the oldest screenshots will be overwritten. A free Nintendo Account is required to use the feature, but a paid Nintendo Switch Online membership is not.</p><p>Sharing screenshots from the original Switch was a more cumbersome process requiring a smartphone to scan a QR code on the console and then connect to a temporary Wi-Fi network to transfer the files wirelessly.The Nintendo Switch App will also let you see when you’ve been invited to a GameChat call and includes the Zelda Notes features for the Switch 2 editions of <em>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. Although not active in the app yet, the feature will include achievements, spoken directions to areas you mark on a map, and access to additional Princess Zelda recall memories.</p><p>The Nintendo Today app also received an update today with new features including the ability to link its calendar with your own calendar app so you can see upcoming Nintendo events and game release dates as part of your personal schedule. There’s also the option to favorite content and filter news so you only see what you’re interested in, and the app now lets you zoom in on images.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/676167/nvidia-geforce-now-steam-deck-test-hands-on<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>I don’t want gaming to become another streaming subscription service that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23901586/streaming-service-prices-netflix-disney-hulu-peacock-max">keeps going up in price</a>. I don’t want to put even more power in Nvidia’s hands, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/672637/nvidia-rtx-5060-review-meddling-gamersnexus-wake-up-call">particularly not right now</a>.</p></div><p>But I can’t deny that the company’s $20-a-month* GeForce Now is a near-perfect fit for the Steam Deck. I’ve been covering cloud gaming for 15 years, and this is the very first time I’ve wanted to keep playing indefinitely.</p><div><div><p id="what-is-geforce-now"><h2><strong>What is GeForce Now?</strong></h2></p></div><p>For the uninitiated, Nvidia’s GeForce Now is a game streaming service that farms the graphical processing power out to the cloud. Instead of controlling a game running locally on your Steam Deck’s chip, you’re effectively remote-controlling an RTX 4080-powered* gaming rig in a server farm many miles away, which you sync with your existing Steam, Epic, Ubisoft, Xbox, and Battle.net accounts to access your games and savegames from the cloud.</p><p>*Nvidia’s GeForce Now also technically has a free tier, and a “Performance” tier, but I recommend you ignore both. For me, it was the difference between playing many games through a clean window or a dirty window, the difference between playing <em>Alan Wake II</em> and <em>Indiana Jones</em> with full ray tracing or none at all, the difference between comfortably stretching to 4K or not.</p></div><p>Handhelds have already become my favorite way to play games. The Steam Deck is comfortable and easy to pick up whenever and wherever the mood strikes. But neither my Deck nor my aging desktop PC have kept up with the latest titles. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> can look like a fuzzy mess on a Deck, and I’ve never seen <em>Alan Wake II</em>, <em>Portal RTX</em> and <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> in all their ray-traced glory on my RTX 3060 Ti desktop.</p><p>But today, with Nvidia’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce-now%2Fdownload%2F" rel="sponsored">just-now-released GeForce Now app</a> for the Steam Deck, I can play every one of those titles at near-max settings, anywhere in my home, for hours and hours on a charge. And if I dock that Steam Deck to my 4K TV, it can output 4K60 HDR and/or ray-traced graphics that put <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">the PS5 Pro</a> to shame.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23561989/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-4080-price-reflex-hands-on-cloud-gaming">When we tested GeForce Now’s last big upgrade in 2023</a>, Tom and I agreed it wasn’t <em>quite</em> on par with playing on a native PC.</p></div><p>But on a Steam Deck, where I’m either playing on a low-res handheld screen or sitting across the room from a TV where I don’t notice so many imperfections, it can feel like the best of both worlds.</p><p>Here’s what <em>Expedition 33 </em>looks like running natively on my Steam Deck today, versus the Deck with GeForce Now:</p><p>The best part might be this: while handhelds like the Steam Deck barely get two hours of such a game at potato graphical settings, I could get 7 to 8 hours of GeForce Now. I saw the cloud gaming service consistently sip under 7 watts from my Steam Deck OLED’s 49.2 watt-hour battery, barely more than the system consumes at idle.</p><p>And the new native app makes it a cinch to set up, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/2/24147034/nvidia-geforce-now-steam-deck-script-install">no more web browser-and-script workaround</a>: just hold down the power button and switch to desktop mode, download the app, run it, and scan QR codes with your phone to link your various accounts.</p><p>Oh, you’d best believe there are caveats. Giant gaping gotchas galore, which I’ll explain as we go. But after testing the service for nearly two weeks, I’m starting to believe in cloud gaming again.</p><p>Now, you might be wondering: how the heck am I playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/667900/doom-the-dark-ages-clair-obscur-expedition-33-parry-season">a game where timing is so critical</a> via remote control? Here’s the first big caveat: you need a low-latency internet connection, a good Wi-Fi router or wired ethernet, and you need to be within range of Nvidia’s servers for the magic to work. Download speed isn’t as key: 50Mbps should suffice for 4K, and you can get away with less.</p><p>But I’m armed with a AT&amp;T Fiber connection, and I live maybe 30 minutes away from Nvidia’s San Jose, California servers, which makes me a best-case scenario for this tech. Still, Nvidia has over 35 worldwide data centers now, including 14 distinct locations in the United States, and my colleagues with Xfinity and Spectrum cable internet in Portland and Brooklyn tell me <em>Expedition 33</em> played just as well for them.</p><p>“The latency was negligible to the point that I wasn’t missing parries,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/cameron-faulkner">Cameron Faulkner tells me</a>, saying he nailed the Sad Troubadour on the first try. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> and I found we needed to adjust our timing a bit, but I wound up playing roughly half the game over GeForce Now and almost never looked back.</p><p>Even with the best of connections, though, GeForce Now isn’t bulletproof. Once or twice a day, my seemingly stable gameplay session would at least briefly unravel into a choppy mess.</p><p>In single-player games like <em>Expedition 33</em> and <em>Indiana Jones</em> I could easily forgive a few minutes of trouble, but my colleagues <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/antonio-g-di-benedetto">Antonio Di Benedetto</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/erick-gomez">Erick Gomez</a> saw it in otherwise stable twitch shooters where lag could be a bigger issue. “I saw a handful of lag spikes / hiccups that would definitely screw anybody over in a competitive shooter, but thankfully they weren’t at the worst times and they soon subsided,” Antonio tells me.</p><p>You also give up some of the Steam Deck’s portability. While you can plug and unplug the Steam Deck from a TV dock and seamlessly switch between big screen and small screen play, you can’t just put the Steam Deck to sleep without ending the session and losing unsaved progress. (Unlike, say, <a href="https://github.com/streetpea/chiaki-ng">Chiaki.</a>) And although the native GeForce Now app supports 4K60, a big leap up from 1440p, you may find yourself squinting at tiny text because it doesn’t scale the UI appropriately.</p><p>Also: while GeForce Now also supports a lower res but smoother 1440p 120Hz mode on TVs and even other gaming handhelds, it doesn’t offer a 90Hz mode for the Deck OLED yet. I tested at 60Hz instead.</p><p>Speaking of portability, public Wi-Fi generally isn’t good enough for GeForce Now, and neither are most cellular connections — even with four bars of Verizon 5G UWB service and a wired USB tether to my phone, my stream quickly deteriorated into the jumble you see below. Only the very best cellular connection in my entire neighborhood, a spot right under a 5G tower where I can get 1,200Mbps down and 30 millisecond ping, felt playable to me.</p><p>And, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23561989/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-4080-price-reflex-hands-on-cloud-gaming">as we’ve discussed previously</a>, only the $20-a-month Ultimate tier truly shows what cloud gaming is capable of. <em>Expedition 33</em> looked substantially worse on the Performance tier (Epic spec, native resolution, vs. Medium spec, 50 percent resolution with DLSS) and<em> Indiana Jones</em> went from gorgeous to just “playable while handheld” for me.</p><p>But the biggest caveat with GeForce Now may be outside the company’s control: you have to bring your own games, and yet you only can bring games where Nvidia has explicitly struck a distribution deal.</p><p>Nvidia has made progress: 165 of my 457 Steam games are now available to play, up from 85 two years ago. The company offers over 2,100 games in total across Epic, Battle.net, Ubisoft, Xbox, and GOG too. But Nvidia has no games from Sony, so I’m not playing <em>Helldivers 2</em>, no games from Rockstar, so I’m not playing <em>GTA V </em>or <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, and no <em>Elden Ring</em>, no <em>PUBG</em>, no <em>Schedule I</em> or <em>Football Manager</em> or <em>FIFA</em> or <em>NBA</em> or <em>The Sims.</em> We never quite know which games GeForce Now will get, or when, or if they <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21168645/nvidia-geforce-now-2k-games-titles-bioshock-borderlands">might disappear</a>.</p><p>Cloud gaming has never felt like a better deal, now that the service has matured, now that handhelds can make such good use of it, and now that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/656783/gpu-prices-are-out-of-control-again">buying your own GPU is such a ridiculously expensive proposition</a>. Maybe I’ll defer my own next GPU upgrade in favor of a subscription.</p><p>But it’s not for everyone — you should definitely try a $8 GeForce Now Ultimate day pass first — and there’s still <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547334/cloud-gaming-xbox-xcloud-microsoft-streaming-google-stadia-amazon">a lot of mental friction</a>. I’m not looking forward to the day that Nvidia <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24289443/nvidia-geforce-now-monthly-playtime-caps-performance-membership-1440p">alters the deal further</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
