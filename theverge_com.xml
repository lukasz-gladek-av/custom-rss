            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It only took a few notes from the <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em> menu music to transport me to a long-forgotten world of sunflowers, pea shooters, and not being able to put the dang game down for one second. First released in 2009, the colorful strategy game was an instant hit, adding to developer PopCap’s enviable lineup of time-wasters like <em>Peggle</em> and <em>Bejeweled</em>. And now it’s been newly remastered so you can relive those days on modern consoles. The updated <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em>, dubbed <em>Replanted</em>, is still a great game that stands the test of time — and it’s also a depressing reminder of just how badly EA fumbled this franchise.</p><p>If you haven’t had the pleasure of fighting off the undead using only a garden full of plants, the premise is relatively simple. The zombies are here, and you need to defend your little slice of home. On the right side of the screen is your house, which you need to protect, and on the left, the undead will shamble in to attack. Between the two is a lawn divided into rows. You fend off these hordes using a green thumb, planting flowers in that lawn that each have a unique ability. The pea shooters… shoot peas, making them the basic turrets of your arsenal. There are stomping squashes and walnuts that form protective barriers, along with explosive cherry bombs. At the core of all of this is the humble sunflower; in order to add new plants, you need to harness the sun, which is generated from those smiling flowers.</p><p><em>PvZ</em> is a serious and deep strategy game masquerading as a Sunday morning cartoon. The complexity steadily ramps up, introducing things like pools and nighttime free of sun that force you to adapt new strategies while continuing to give you more fauna that can be utilized as instruments of destruction. The sheer variety means that there’s a lot of potential for creativity and experimentation. Nearly two decades later, I still get a lot of enjoyment out of placing a man-eating plant behind a walnut, where it can munch on unsuspecting zombies. The whole experience is then slathered with charm, from bouncing, cheerful plant life to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0N1_0SUGlDQ">perhaps the catchiest song in video game history</a>. It was a near-perfect game, and the remaster offers some enhanced visuals, a few new ways to play co-op, and a handful of single-player modes. But not much changed, because it didn’t need to.</p><p>Sounds like the perfect recipe for a beloved series, right? EA seemed to have that exact same thought when it acquired PopCap in 2011. But instead of a proper sequel, the publisher expanded the <em>PvZ</em> brand in other ways. There were Facebook spinoffs and a strange shooter series called <em>Garden Warfare</em>, along with plentiful comic books and other merchandise. <em>Plants vs. Zombies 2</em> did launch in 2013, with a free-to-play mobile iteration that had some interesting ideas but eventually became bogged down by energy timers, microtransactions, and constant updates. It largely played like <em>PvZ</em>, but it lacked the purity of vision that made the original so great. That didn’t matter much to EA, of course, because <em>PvZ 2</em> did numbers, <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/plants-vs-zombies-2-sprouts-big-numbers">reaching a much larger</a> — and more lucrative — audience than its predecessor.</p><p>But something was lost in the search for more players (and money). While the series became financially successful, the creativity that made it so beloved steadily dwindled. The original <em>PvZ</em> was a hand-crafted, carefully tuned experience with a beginning, middle, and end. It’s the kind of game that you want to revisit through a remaster like this because it’s just that good. The sequels and spinoffs, meanwhile, were mostly watered-down versions of this premise that proved much more disposable. It’s not like I’m anticipating playing a remaster of <em>PvZ2</em> in a few years. (A third mainline game is currently in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/17/24042133/ea-plants-vs-zombies-3-soft-launch">soft-launch limbo</a>.)</p><p>It’s a sad state of affairs for a concept that once held such promise. And the fact that I really can’t stop playing the remaster — I’ve whispered<em> just one more round</em> to myself multiple times while writing this — drives that point home further. And things don’t look like they’ll be getting better anytime soon. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/787112/electronic-arts-55-billion-privacte-acquisition-pif-silver-lake-affinity-partners">EA is in the midst of going private in a deal worth $55 billion</a>, which will almost certainly necessitate <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/787723/ea-private-deal-buyout-future-games-layoffs">further layoffs and fewer risks</a>. That means focusing even more on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/795232/ea-battlefield-6-hit-launch-deal">big games with big earning potential</a>, instead of cute games that worm their way into your heart. In that way, this remaster is like a time capsule from a simpler, happier time.</p><p><sub>Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted <em>launches on October 23rd on the Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/803795/plants-vs-zombies-replanted-remaster-switch-pc-ps5-xbox]]></content:encoded>

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Tero Virtala, CEO of <em>Control</em> developer Remedy Entertainment, <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=49a7f7db-a1c3-400f-948b-f25b3b7426f8">is stepping down from his position immediately</a>. The news comes in the aftermath of a disappointing launch for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/689333/fbc-firebreak-review-xbox-ps5-steam"><em>FBC: Firebreak</em></a>, the Finnish studio’s first foray into multiplayer gaming. Virtala will be replaced on an interim basis by Markus Mäki, Remedy’s chief product officer and one of the studio’s co-founders. The studios says it will “initiate a search process for a new CEO immediately.”</p><p>Virtala took over the role back in 2016, and was a key figure behind Remedy’s transformation over the past decade, as it shifted from a work-for-hire studio to one that developed multiple projects simultaneously and owned and published its own games. This period was highlighted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20832997/control-review-creators-thriller-ps4-xbox-pc">the launch of <em>Control</em> in 2019</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc">the long-awaited sequel to <em>Alan Wake</em> in 2023</a>.</p><div><p><em>Firebreak</em> was meant to be a major part of this transformation, a self-published spinoff of <em>Control</em> that was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/665752/fbc-firebreak-preview-interview-remedy-control-ps5-xbox">an attempt to marry the studio’s worldbuilding and storytelling with a live-service co-op shooter</a>. However, the combination didn’t win over players and, despite launching <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/784967/remedy-fbc-firebreak-update">a major update in September</a>, two weeks ago <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=b4d23a32-03e7-49e5-bbc3-93ec062699a5">Remedy issued a profit warning</a> due to “weak sales” of <em>Firebreak</em>.</p></div><p>Part of the impetus behind Remedy’s shift to a multi-project studio — in addition to <em>Firebreak</em>, it’s also currently developing <em>Control 2</em>, remasters of <em>Max Payne</em>, and a mystery game — was to help it deal with potential flops like <em>Firebreak</em>, though Virtala told me ahead of the game’s launch that, even still, each release was still significant for the independent studio. “Every single game is highly important for us,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/691964/remedy-entertainment-profile-alan-wake-control-fbc-firebreak">Virtala told <em>The Verge</em></a>. “There is no question that we are not fully insulated. But we are less dependent on any single game than we used to be.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/804372/remedy-ceo-resigns-fbc-firebreak-control]]></content:encoded>
