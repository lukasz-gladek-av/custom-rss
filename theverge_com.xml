            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/637717/assassins-creed-shadows-stealth-assassinations<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I realized quite late in <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/631744/assassins-creed-shadows-review-ubisoft">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a></em> that being this version of a shinobi is hard — but it was precisely the precision the game demanded that made it all the more rewarding.</p><p>With <em>Shadows</em>, the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise has achieved both its most impressive stealth and assassination mechanics. At its best, <em>Shadows</em> evokes games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/23/13719322/dishonored-2-immersive-sim-serious-game-melodrama">Arkane’s <em>Dishonored</em> series</a>, mixing emergent action with an artful blend of skills and scenarios. While not nearly at the level of sophistication as those games, I nevertheless had moments that left me breathless from what I could achieve. These put me more in the space of immersive simulated assassination games than the most recent, chest-thumping<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> games.</p><p>Here’s an example. In Ubisoft’s open-world third-person action game, I was faced with a group of about 10 men in a dark cave, all of whom turned out to be targets I’d been hunting for ages. They were all part of one group, who I’d been carefully taking down individually — one leading me to the next. Now, after tracking one, it turned out he and his remaining colleagues had decided to hold a meeting. Together. With their guards. I hadn’t planned this, but now I either had to leave or use this opportunity to finish the job in one lethal swoop.</p><p>Importantly, my character, the shinobi Naoe, was not without her own tricks to balance the overwhelming odds. First, she wasn’t alone. In <em>Shadows</em>, you organically recruit allies throughout your massive revenge quest. You can summon them at a moment’s notice to assist you in any scenario: from a barefisted fighter monk to a giggling, creepy teenage poisoner. Having “upgraded” my poisoner, her poison bomb put three enemies to sleep immediately. Her upgrades also meant anyone who came to investigate fell under the same spell. I began by summoning said poisoner to take out several of the targets and guards.</p><p>Second, Naoe herself has skills that verge on magical, such as slowing down time while moving at normal speed — again, reminiscent of <em>Dishonored</em> or Arkane’s other big hitter, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc">Deathloop</a></em>. Using this skill immediately after my poisoner allowed me to throw several deadly kunai at guards’ heads and move closer to the actual targets for a slick close-up double assassination.</p><p>All of this happened within less than 20 seconds. And voila! All the targets and their guards were down.</p><p>Never had I felt more like an assassin in <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>. It surprised me, given that I have been playing the franchise since the first game. But this moment made me realize that I had never had to be this clever before in these games, or had access to such a variety of complementary skills, tools, and abilities. Even the more recent trilogy of “reboots” — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/4/16414638/assassins-creed-origins-ancient-egypt-hands-on-open-world-exploration"><em>Origins</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/1/17921552/assassins-creed-odyssey-review-ps4-xbox-pc"><em>Odyssey</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/12/21319059/assassins-creed-valhalla-hands-on-preview-pc-xbox-one-ps4-gameplay-ubisoft-rpg"><em>Valhalla</em></a> — did not feature such variety and complementary actions. While the lovable goofball protagonists of those games develop god-like abilities, most were centered around combat rather than stealth. The last expansion of <em>Valhalla</em>, for example, literally saw you play a god, Odin, battling through the Norse realms to save his son, Baldur.</p><p>Now, with <em><em>Shadows</em></em>, Ubisoft has managed to balance both action and stealth, allowing you to play as the shinobi Naoe and the lethal mountain samurai Yasuke. It’s Naoe’s stealth, in particular, that has left me impressed. <em>Shadows</em> creates multiple scenarios that require planning for your shinobi. While Naoe moves like dark silk on a night wind and can instantly assassinate multiple targets, she can die quickly. Yet, she will often face large set pieces with upward of 20–30 enemies patrolling an area.</p><p>The game places huge rewards in, for example, giant, heavily guarded castles. Walking in the front gate is almost never an option. But Naoe can climb overhanging trees, find cracks in walls, and swim in via aqueducts. Once inside, she can use “eagle vision” to see through walls and tag enemies. <em>Shadows </em>removes the flying companion from the previous three games, which acted like a military drone to provide air reconnaissance.</p><p>Now, it’s entirely within the limited confines of Naoe’s vision — but that’s not necessarily limiting. If used properly, Naoe can never be surprised and can plan the order of assassination such that no one ever realizes she has infiltrated. For example, if one guard is patrolling, it could be easier to take him out, rather than his colleagues who are stationed, since he may spot you moving.</p><p>The size of these places turns this into a murdery puzzle. If I take Guard A out, I have access to Guards B and C. However, Guard D is watching Guard A, etc. Without realizing it, you have to create an assassination Rube Goldberg machine, taking one out, then another, timing it and using different abilities, recruits, and so on. It takes some time to get through these giant castles, but you’re rewarded with some of the best weapons and armor in the game. And if you’re caught, you are hunted for a while, making traversal a hazard. In previous entries, stealth was largely optional and functional but unremarkable. There was also no real penalty for being spotted that those godlike protagonists couldn’t easily silence.</p><p>Similarly, the other playable character, the samurai Yasuke, requires careful consideration, despite being a moving mountain. He doesn’t have eagle vision. He is made for loud lethality; even his instant assassinations sever heads and limbs. This creates its own thoughtful play since you need to carefully move and work your way through these large set pieces, ideally without drawing attention.</p><p>Yasuke’s advantage is that he can use a huge bow to take enemies out instantly from a distance — unlike Naoe, who has to be close. This speaks to the give-and-take theme central to the game’s mechanics. But Yasuke can more easily and quickly end alerts, making his style of murder puzzle less clean but easier to recover from should things go awry.</p><p>I did not expect <em>Shadows</em> to place so much work and thought into its assassinations, which is obviously amusing given the name of the franchise. Having played this series since its inception, I was struck by the emphasis on clean, thoughtful assassinations — not only within scripted contexts, but in the open world itself.</p><p>After years of trending toward bombastic action, <em>Shadows</em> points toward a future where <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> continues to live up to its name — and hopefully creates scenarios to make players feel like the titular leads, rather than god-like warriors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/638930/razer-blade-16-2025-rtx-5090-gaming-laptop-impressions-price<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2Frazer-blade-16" rel="sponsored">Razer Blade 16</a> is designed to be the gaming-focused alternative to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24319419/apple-macbook-pro-m4-max-pro-review-price-specs">MacBook Pro</a>, and I’m always here for that. I love a gaming laptop that still looks and feels like a somewhat normal laptop, and the new Blade returns to a thinner and lighter chassis design after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23588660/razer-blade-16-2023-review-specs-features-design">last-gen</a> got a bit chunky. The top-end configuration also adopts the new flagship <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/637898/nvidia-rtx-5090-laptop-gpu-impressions-benchmarks-testing-specs">Nvidia RTX 5090 laptop GPU</a> and an even heftier price of $4,499.99 ($200 more than the 4090 model).</p><p>I’ve spent some time with the new Razer Blade 16, but my first review unit had noticeable hardware issues and was replaced by Nvidia, which provided the Blades for RTX 5090 testing. I’ve only had the replacement unit for a few days, and while it doesn’t exhibit any of the same performance issues or buzzy speakers, it’s had a couple of random bluescreens of its own. I’m in troubleshooting talks with Razer, but while that’s ongoing, I’m still testing this laptop and sizing up my feelings about it. Consider this me posting through it — a little glimpse into my internal dialog. (You’re welcome. But also, I’m sorry?)</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Unlike a MacBook Pro, the Blade 16’s black is actually black. Like a MacBook Pro, it’s quite the fingerprint magnet (but it cleans up well).</em></figcaption></p></div><p>I love most of the hardware on the new Blade — <em>most</em>. Its 16-inch, 2560 x 1600 OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate remains a lovely panel to work and play on, just like its predecessor. And the keyboard and trackpad are overall very good. My biggest gripe with the keyboard is the new column of macro keys on the right, which often causes me to mute the microphone when I mean to hit the right arrow. It’s yet another problem that could have been avoided by using the standard inverted-T arrow key arrangement that’s easier to find by feel. Are Windows laptop makers ever going to learn?</p><p>The thinner and lighter chassis is a welcome change (it shaves off a whole 7mm and 0.8 pounds), though I need to do more thermal testing to see if it’s as good at cooling as the last model. There’s also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24350342/razer-laptop-cooling-pad-review-hyperboost-synapse-rgb">Razer’s Laptop Cooling Pad</a>, which can give the Blade 16’s GPU and CPU up to 25W more power each. I have it here, so I’ll see if HyperBoost is worth the added noise and extra $150. I also wonder whether <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336394/asus-rog-strix-scar-16-18-specs-price-ces-2025">thicker gaming laptops</a> might eke out more juice from the RTX 5090.</p><div id=":Rebdcer6:"><div><div><p><figcaption><em>The new Razer Blade 16 (right) is noticeably thinner than the last-gen 4090 model (left).</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The keyboard deck is slightly deeper on the new model (right).</em></figcaption></p></div></div><div><div><p><figcaption><em>The new Blade 16 thankfully maintains the same plethora of ports.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>I know we’re only talking a difference in thickness of just 7mm, but you definitely feel it.</em></figcaption></p></div></div></div><p>As I’ve <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/637898/nvidia-rtx-5090-laptop-gpu-impressions-benchmarks-testing-specs">already written</a>, the RTX 5090 GPU in the Blade 16 is a fine upgrade if you enjoy DLSS and frame generation. I’m going to continue testing it, including more gaming while on battery power. Nvidia’s made some <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nvidia-rtx-50-gaming-laptops-start-at-1299/">big claims</a> about how powerful yet power-efficient the 50-series laptop cards are, and in my early testing, the 5090 <em>is</em> about 20 percent more efficient than the 4090, so I’m intrigued. </p><p>But I’m skeptical, because when I’m not gaming, the Blade 16 struggles to get through a basic work day on battery, even while using productivity apps like Slack, Chrome, and Google Docs on the integrated graphics. Its AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 “Strix Point” CPU can easily stretch beyond eight hours of work in other gaming laptops, like the 2024 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24324299/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-gaming-laptop-review-amd-strix-point">Asus ROG Zephyrus G16</a>, but I can’t get five and a half hours with the Blade, despite enabling Advanced Optimus and triple-checking the graphics settings in Nvidia Control Panel, Windows Settings, <em>and</em> Synapse. (Maybe there’s something misconfigured <em>somewhere</em>, so I’ll continue testing this too.)</p><p>This laptop is supposed to be great for productivity, creative apps, <em>and </em>gaming. It costs four-and-a-half <em>thousand</em> dollars. Part of me really likes what it has to offer, and I’m downright impressed with how cool it can run under load, but another part of me thinks the price is outlandish if things are randomly crashing under light loads and you have to charge multiple times a day. For that money, you can buy a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24289831/apple-macbook-pro-m4-review-14-2024-laptop-specs-benchmarks">$2,000 MacBook Pro</a> that can handle creative workflows and last well over a whole day (if you don’t mind MacOS, of course). And you’d have another $2,500 to spend on a respectable gaming laptop, or even a more powerful desktop.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Green-illuminated lid logo aside, the Blades continue to look sleek and fit in anywhere.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>However, I’ll concede that having one device to do it all is a slick proposition. I keep coming back to how nice this laptop looks and feels. And boy does it make games look pretty and run them smoothly, either on its brilliant OLED or on an external 4K monitor. It is, after all, meant for games.</p><p>I can still see myself loving the Blade 16. But we’ll have to see in the full review, after a whole bunch more testing that’s hopefully (fingers crossed) devoid of any further technical hangups.</p><p>What do you think? Does any laptop actually make sense for nearly five grand? Let me know in the comments, and if there’s anything in particular you’d like to see tested on the Blade 16 for the full review.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.
