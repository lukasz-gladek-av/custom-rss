The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tcgplayer-workers-form-ebay-first-union-095615128.html">workers at TCGplayer unionized</a> under the Communications Workers of America (CWA) in 2023, which later filed unfair labor charges that accused eBay of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/31/23813935/ebay-tcgplayer-union-labor-unfair-complaints-cwa">refusing to acknowledge the union</a>, failing to provide relevant information related to collective bargaining, and <a href="https://cwad1.org/news/cwa-files-unfair-labor-practice-after-ebay-owned-tcgplayer-illegally-fires">“surveilling” pro-union employees</a>, among other alleged union-busting tactics.</p></div><p>TCGplayer and eBay also canceled their meeting to finalize the union’s first contract just days before eBay revealed that it’s closing the Syracuse location.</p><p>The CWA <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/cwa-statement-ebays-syracuse-closure-announcement">has since filed another unfair labor practice</a> charge with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), accusing eBay of “terminating the employment” of workers to avoid bargaining. On Monday, <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/ebay-escalates-intimidation-union-members-after-closure-announcement">the CWA claimed that eBay</a> hired security guards at TCGplayer’s Syracuse authentication center that have “created an oppressive atmosphere by physically and verbally harassing employees.”</p><p>“TCGplayer is closing its Syracuse Authentication Center to consolidate operations within an eBay logistics center in Kentucky,” eBay spokesperson Maddy Martinez said in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “We recognize the near-term impact it will have on our employees, their families and the Syracuse community, and we are dedicated to taking care of our people during this transition.”</p><p>“Deploying security guards to stalk us immediately after letting us know that we would all be losing our jobs is psychological warfare,” Zach Freeman, an eBay worker and TCGunion-CWA Local 1123 member said in a press release. “By unleashing this brutal surveillance and intimidation campaign, TCGplayer and eBay are doing everything in their power to punish us for exercising our federally-protected rights to organize.”</p><p><em><strong>Update, May 27th: </strong>Added a statement from eBay.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
