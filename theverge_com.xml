As a result, the 512GB of internal storage supplied by the Xbox Series S is feeling increasingly paltry. You’ll even start to feel the squeeze on the 1TB Series X when you load up on new titles like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24173669/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-october-25th"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops VI</em></a><em> </em>(which demands about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283801/comcast-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-large-downloads">85GB for multiplayer alone</a>, and much more if you’re into the campaign). Don’t even get us started on the spate of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/17/24272580/xbox-fall-partner-showcase-october-2024-trailers">games due in the next year and beyond</a>. The <strong>1TB WD_Black C50 expansion card</strong> can offer relief, and it’s down to an all-time low of $99.99 ($56 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C44XVWCH?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://howl.link/uovl0g0slx4fh">Best Buy</a>. You can also get the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C44B1VSH?tag=theverge02-20">512GB card for $67.99</a> ($12 off), which is $2 more than its lowest price.</p><p>The expansion card is tiny and looks much like Western Digital’s other Black-branded storage products, but offers NVMe storage for your Xbox Series X/S that’s nearly as fast as the internal SSD. That means it’s fully capable of storing and running games optimized for the current generation console, complete with quality-of-life features like Quick Resume. With ordinary external hard drives and SSDs, you’d only be able to store the games and would need to transfer them in order to play. It still stings to see proprietary storage formats like these in 2024, but one advantage is that it’s an easy plug-and-play expansion that requires no tools.</p><div><p>Western Digital’s storage expansion cards for Xbox Series X / S consoles are speedy, plug-and-play cards that match the performance of the consoles’ onboard SSDs. They offer a slightly lower-cost alternative to Seagate’s expansion cards, which were the only game in town for years.</p></div><div><div><h2>Verge Deals on X<!-- --> <!-- --> / </h2><p>Join nearly 50,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals</p></div><p><a href="http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud">Follow us!</a></p></div><p><h3>A few more week-starting deals</h3></p><div><ul><li>Speaking of games, you can get a digital download of <em><strong>Diablo IV</strong></em> bundled with its first expansion, <em>Vessel of Hatred</em>, starting around $44.99 (about $25 off) on Series X/S from <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/diablo-iv-expansion-bundle/9P5F369NJ9PG/0010">Xbox</a> or on PC via <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/diablo-iv">Battle.net</a>. You can also buy the expansion alone for $29.99 ($10 off) at <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-standard-edition/9P0RZSCPFLW6/0010">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/diablo-iv">Battle.net</a>. The action RPG takes place 50 years after the previous title and sees the player chasing down the powerful demon Lilith in an effort to save the realm of Sanctuary from hellish torment. The expansion continues the story in a new region called Nahantu and introduces the Spiritborn class, a new dungeon, and a fresh batch of legendary items. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23747068/diablo-iv-review-blizzard-class-customization">Read our review</a>.</li><li>The newest <strong>Microsoft Surface Pro</strong> with a Snapdragon X Plus chipset and 16GB of RAM is the first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234687/microsoft-co-pilot-plus-pcs-intel-features-release-date">CoPilot Plus PC</a> in the lineup, and the 512GB SSD model is down to $899.99 ($300 off) at <a href="https://howl.link/c1lrgdpj0h83g">Best Buy</a>. That’s $100 cheaper than the base 256GB model. There are better dedicated laptops and tablets, but the hybridized AI-ready Windows tablet is one of Microsoft’s most compelling, offering the best balance between power, portability, and battery life we’ve seen so far in a Surface Pro. It has a bright 13-inch 120Hz display and is compatible with an <a href="https://howl.link/ihfqp3fw02k9j">excellent detachable keyboard</a> ($179.99) and the <a href="https://howl.link/an2g2phm25sex">Surface Slim Pen</a> ($129.99). <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24191243/microsoft-surface-pro-11-oled-review">Read our review</a>.</li><li>Through November 30th, <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://computers.woot.com/plus/keychron-mechanical-keyboards-6">Woot</a>&nbsp;is taking up to 50 percent off&nbsp;<strong>various Keychron mechanical keyboards. </strong>The sale includes the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://computers.woot.com/offers/keychron-k8-wireless-mechanical-keyboard-9">Keychron K8 with blue Gateron optical switches</a>, which is normally $79.99 but drops to $49.99 — and today only, you can take an extra $5 off with code <strong>KEYCHRONFIVE</strong>.

The K8 doesn’t quite make the grade like its more substantial offerings, mainly due to its lacking VIA remapping and macro customization, but it has hot-swappable keys and should otherwise fit most needs just fine.</li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24297436/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review"><h2>Sometimes you just need a straightforward, old-school RPG</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24295933/bluesky-social-network-custom-how-to"><h2>Here’s some cool stuff you can do with Bluesky</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/15/24297261/casio-smart-ring-digital-watch-crw-001-1jr"><h2>Casio’s first smart ring has innovative features like a stopwatch and flashing alarm</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/17/24298669/musk-trump-endorsement-x-boosting-republican-posts-july-algorithm-change"><h2>A&nbsp;study found that X’s algorithm now loves two things: Republicans and Elon Musk</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/18/24299376/lg-ultragear-gx7-480hz-oled-gaming-monitor-price-availability"><h2>LG’s first 480Hz OLED gaming monitor is $1,000</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/18/24299455/house-lan-gaming-parties-software-engineer-kenton-varda<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re nostalgic for the era of lugging your desktop to a friend’s house to play <em>Unreal Tournament</em>, software engineer Kenton Varda doesn’t have <em>exactly</em> the solution — but he thinks he has something better. The Cloudflare Workers tech lead has spent more than three years and at least a million dollars to <a href="https://lanparty.house/">transform his Austin house</a> into the ultimate local PC gaming pad, complete with 22 machines and a dedicated hardware room. It’s dubbed the LAN Party House, and you’re probably not invited.</p><p>LAN (short for local area network, as many readers likely know) parties were the best option for “online” gaming <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/11/just-a-bunch-of-idiots-having-fun-a-photo-history-of-the-lan-party/">in the era of dial-up internet</a>. While some are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/12/1/2603289/dreamhack-winter-2011-120-gbps-connection-lan-party">large-scale events</a>, Varda’s house is aimed at having groups of friends drop by, pull a gaming station out of a hidden wall or table panel, and start playing.</p><p>Much of the house was specifically designed to hold PCs. There’s a basement room with 12 gaming stations built into folding wall cabinets, two call rooms equipped with their own gaming stations for private meetings, and an office space used for board games. A large table in the latter also unfolds to reveal an additional six gaming PCs plus two personal workstations. (In case you’re wondering, each PC contains an Intel Core i5-13600 CPU, a GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, and 32GB of RAM.)<em> </em></p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</p><div><figcaption><em>Each gaming station is housed in folding cabinets that convert into individual desk setups.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Kenton Varda</cite></p></div></div><p>Some of these machines are discrete desktops, but most are monitors that connect to a central room that holds and cools the towers. Varda says the 22 PC stations collectively cost about $75,000, but the full-house project was “a 7-digit number.”</p><p>Varda — who’s apparently hosted LAN parties as frequently as every other weekend —&nbsp;says most of the people who drop by are “not actually hardcore gamers.” They focus on team-based games like <em>Deep Rock Galactic </em>or the non-deathmatch modes of <em>Unreal Tournament 2004. </em>One room also includes four built-in <em>Dance Dance Revolution </em>(DDR) pads. These aren’t public events — “sorry, you must be invited,” Varda says. “I’m sure you understand: For security reasons, we can’t just let random people on the internet into our house.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Four DDR stations are also embedded into the floor for any emergency dance-offs.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: <a href="https://lanparty.house/">Kenton Varda</a></cite></p></div><p>This is actually the second LAN party house that Varda has created, having <a href="https://newatlas.com/google-engineer-builds-ultimate-lan-party-house/20833/">completed a previous property in Palo Alto, California in 2011</a> that went similarly viral. That 1400 square-foot house was smaller than his latest property according to Varda, who says it “made for a pretty awesome bachelor pad, but would have been a bit cramped for raising a family.” He lives in this house with his two children and his wife, entrepreneur Jade Wang — who’s apparently a <em>DDR</em> fan. The new place was funded with money from the pair’s long career in tech, as well as the $1 million in profit he apparently got when selling the old house. It’s far from the worst thing you can spend a tech industry windfall on.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</p><div><figcaption><em>The actual PCs remotely wired and housed in this dedicated engine room that requires its own A/C intake.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Kenton Varda</cite></p></div></div><p>Varda acknowledges that this setup isn’t exactly the classic LAN party model. And in fact, his first house was built to let people bring their own machines. “Nobody ever did,” he notes. “Not once.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
