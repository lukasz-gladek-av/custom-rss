He joined in 2018, and after a two-year stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Buying a pre-assembled gaming desktop makes sense for some. It can save you time and money, too, compared to buying PC components piecemeal. If you’re weighing your options, consider some Presidents Day offers on iBuyPower’s pre-built desktops, including the <strong><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibuypower.com%2Fstore%2Frdy-element-9-pro-r07" rel="sponsored">$1,899 RDY Element 9 Pro R07</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fibuypower-slate-gaming-desktop-pc-amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-amd-radeon-rx-9070xt-16gb-32gb-ddr5-rgb2tb-nvme-ssd-black%2FJ3R75JYGZ5" rel="sponsored">$2,099.99 Slate</a></strong> — both of which are stocked with high-end AMD processors and GPUs that can tear through most games at 1440p with fast frame rates. They also come with 32GB of DDR5 RAM and 2TB of storage, along with a mouse and keyboard.</p><p>Digging into the Element 9 Pro R07, it features AMD’s Ryzen 7 7800X3D processor, a Radeon 9070 XT graphics card with 16GB of VRAM (roughly on-par with the Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti), 32GB of DDR6 6000MHz RAM, and a 2TB NVMe SSD built into the Asus B650EM Max Gaming motherboard. It ships in iBuyPower’s Element 9 Pro case, which has tempered glass on the front and one side, and features a 360mm RGB liquid cooling system. The system includes an 850W power supply, a wired mouse, and a keyboard, plus a three-year labor warranty and two years of parts coverage. The GPU will be shipped uninstalled, so that’s the only component you’ll need to insert with iBuyPower’s <a href="https://content.ibuypower.com/Download/GPU-Manual.pdf">instructions</a>. Normally $2,149, you can currently get it for $1,899 at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibuypower.com%2Fstore%2Frdy-element-9-pro-r07" rel="sponsored">iBuyPower</a> when you use coupon code <strong>STARS </strong>at checkout.</p><p>The Slate has slightly different specs, some that are improved over the Element above and some that are a bit below what it provides. The biggest highlight is that the Slate features AMD’s Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor, which edges out the 7800X3D in performance (although both are very capable CPUs). It also features an AMD Radeon 9070 XT graphics card, 32GB of DDR5 RAM at 5,200MHz instead of 6,000MHz, and a 2TB NVMe SSD. Like the R07, it includes a wired keyboard and mouse to get you started, along with a 750W power supply, a liquid cooling system, and a one-year warranty. It’s available for $2,099.99 at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fibuypower-slate-gaming-desktop-pc-amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-amd-radeon-rx-9070xt-16gb-32gb-ddr5-rgb2tb-nvme-ssd-black%2FJ3R75JYGZ5" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/878927/ibuypower-gaming-desktop-pc-presidents-day-sale-deal]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>My ongoing quest to turn my iPhone into one of my favorite consoles of all time has led me to a curiously named controller. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/860093/pocket-taco-pocket-taco-pocket-taco">GameSir’s Pocket Taco</a> is only barely pocketable, and distinctly lacking in taco fillings, <a href="https://gamesir.com/products/gamesir-pocket-taco">but for $35</a>, it’s an excellent and easy way to turn your phone into a Game Boy-inspired handheld for playing retro games that don’t require a pair of thumbsticks.</p><p>Unlike the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/864821/abxylute-m4-snap-on-mobile-controller-magsafe-magnetic-bluetooth">Abxylute M4 mobile controller</a> that attaches to phones using magnets, or the Backbone Pro that sandwiches your device between a split gamepad, the Pocket Taco uses a hinged mechanism that, for lack of a better description, bites onto the bottom half of your smartphone.</p><div id=":R1hir6eqb96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>Inside the Pocket Taco are soft silicone pads on either side that grip your phone without damaging it.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The ergonomics aren’t as good as standalone controllers, but the Pocket Taco is quite comfortable to play with.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>Inside the Pocket Taco, you’ll find soft silicone pads on either side that securely grip your device without scratching it or leaving any bite marks. The hold feels satisfyingly secure, and while my iPhone could slightly shift from side to side while inside the Pocket Taco, at no point did it ever feel at risk of falling out on its own.</p><p>The Pocket Taco’s hinge expands wide enough to attach to smartphones still inside bulky cases, and its open sides can accommodate phones and devices wider than the controller itself. You could use it with an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24275956/apple-ipad-mini-2024-review">iPad Mini,</a> for example, although I didn’t have the chance to test the ergonomics of such a setup.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/860160/8bitdo-flippad-hands-on">8BitDo announced a similar Game Boy-style controller</a> for smartphones at CES 2026, featuring a front panel that can fully flip down. I couldn’t understand why anyone would want that feature, but after playing with the Pocket Taco for a week, I now understand why 8BitDo took that approach.</p><p>The front panel on the Pocket Taco can only hinge outward about 45 degrees, blocking the lower part of your smartphone’s screen while attached to your device. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854303/8bitdo-mobile-smartphone-controller-ios-android-flippad-game-boy">8BitDo’s FlipPad</a> gives you full access to your smartphone’s screen and UI while it’s attached, but I frequently found myself having to completely remove the Pocket Taco if I wanted to flip over to another app, or even just unlock my phone.</p><div id=":R1k2r6eqb96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>A passthrough hole on the bottom of the Pocket Taco lets you plug in a power cable, assuming your device’s charging port is centered.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>A hard plastic carrying case is included, but the Pocket Taco is a bit too thick to be comfortably pocketed.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>I haven’t tested the USB-C 8BitDo FlipPad yet, but a big advantage of the larger Pocket Taco is that it connects to your device over Bluetooth and has its own 600mAh rechargeable battery that won’t drain your phone. Opening the Pocket Taco powers it on and automatically pairs the controller with the last device you used — in my case, an iPhone 16 Pro. GameSir doesn’t list iOS as being officially supported, only Android, but I was able to connect to the Pocket Taco and my iPhone recognized it as a “DualShock 4 Wireless Controller.”</p><p>The Pocket Taco turns off automatically when you remove it from your phone. It powers up and reconnects quickly, though, so having to occasionally remove the controller to access your phone’s screen isn’t a huge inconvenience.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The Pocket Taco turns on automatically when attached to a phone, but it can also be powered on manually and used as a portable standalone wireless gamepad.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The Pocket Taco’s home button can also be used to manually power it on and off when it isn’t attached to a device, allowing it to be used as a standalone rechargeable Bluetooth controller. It was easy to pair with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Switch 2</a>.</p><div id=":R1mir6eqb96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The Pocket Taco’s controls look and feel very similar to the original Game Boy’s, but with a few more buttons.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Two sets of shoulder buttons can be found on the back of the Pocket Taco, with a USB-C charging port in between them.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>The controller’s four face buttons and D-pad all feel good with a solid click when pressed, and despite it being a little narrower than the original Game Boy, my large hands found the Pocket Taco extremely comfortable to play with. The double pair of shoulder buttons on the back were easy to reach, and the rounded edges on the bottom of the Pocket Taco didn’t dig into the fingers I was using to support the controller and my phone.</p><p>There are just a few things you’ll want to keep in mind when choosing what games to play, or how to play them. Unlike the Abxylute M4 or the Backbone controllers, GameSir made no attempt to squeeze thumbsticks or sliding joysticks onto the Pocket Taco. So it’s better suited for playing retro games from the 16-bit era and earlier that don’t have 3D environments with a camera to control.</p><div id=":R1o2r6eqb96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The GameSir mobile app shrinks to half screen with the Pocket Taco attached, and lets you update firmware and remap the controller’s buttons.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>You may need to make some adjustments if an app or emulator centers a game vertically onscreen, as it will be partially blocked with the Pocket Taco attached.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>I primarily tested the Pocket Taco with Game Boy, Super Nintendo, and GBA games played through the Delta emulator and RetroArch on iOS. The Pocket Taco worked great with both, but you’ll want to make sure you’re using an app with skins or layout options that can position the game closer to the top of your device’s screen. When I first tested the Pocket Taco with Delta, I turned off the emulator’s default skin to remove on-screen controls. That resulted in the game being vertically centered on my iPhone and partially covered by the Pocket Taco. It was easy to fix, but note that the controller can only be used in a vertical orientation.</p><p>8BitDo hasn’t announced pricing or a release date for its FlipPad yet, so I’m still curious how effective that smaller accessory will be at turning my smartphone into a handheld console, given its limitations. The <a href="https://gamesir.com/products/gamesir-pocket-taco">Pocket Taco isn’t expected to ship until March 2026</a>, but for $35, you get excellent controls, solid ergonomics, reliable Bluetooth connectivity, nearly universal smartphone compatibility, and the ability to use it as a standalone wireless gamepad.</p><p><em>Photography by Andrew Liszewski / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/877491/gamesir-pocket-taco-wireless-bluetooth-controller-clamp-hands-on]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Returning stolen artifacts becomes a thrilling heist in Relooted]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/878121/relooted-review-xbox-steam</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Colonialism is not merely about occupying nations. It’s a project of mass violence, part of which involves total erasure and the widespread theft of some of the most culturally significant artifacts in the world. Even today, colonizing nations proudly display stolen artifacts, acting as peacocking robbers under the guise of tourism. See, for example, the British Museum’s continual hold of the Egyptian Rosetta Stone, the so-called Benin Bronzes, and the Ethiopian Maqdala collection. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/oct/12/restitution-row-how-nigerias-new-home-for-the-benin-bronzes-ended-up-with-clay-replicas">Colonized nations have sought to reclaim their stolen culture</a>.</p><p>But what happens when kind requests and diplomatic maneuvers are not only insufficient but undeserving of the ongoing crime? This is where the fantasy of the moral heist comes in — and no game has done it better than <em>Relooted</em>.</p><p>Developed by South African studio Nyamakop, <em>Relooted</em> focuses on a group of lovable, albeit unprofessional, Johannesburg-based thieves from different African countries. They have a singular goal: Reclaim from colonizer nations what was stolen from Africa. Playing as the frontwoman Nomali, a world-class parkour athlete, you help start this ragtag group inspired by her grandmother, a history professor. The game is an Africanfuturist (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nyamakop_some-screenshots-from-relooted-and-why-we-activity-7343997849002565632-0RKq">as opposed to Afrofuturist</a>) 2.5D heist-’em-up platformer, sending Nomali and her team around the Global North, infiltrating museums, private collections, and banks to take back legendary but stolen artifacts.</p><p>Once acquired, the team anonymously seeks to deposit them in the the Museum of Black Civilisations in Senegal. What I found surprising was that the museum, like every artifact, is in fact entirely real.</p><p>In mission briefings in your Batcave-like base, you get a genuine short history lesson on the artifact and, through it, Africa’s colonized past. For example, did you know the modern Republic of Benin, a West African nation, and the historical and powerful Kingdom of Benin (which reached its peak in the 15th century), located in what is now Nigeria, are different? Legendary masks of this kingdom were looted by colonizers and not returned, held by, among others, the British Museum.</p><p>In the fictional world of <em>Relooted</em>, this is precisely where Nomali and her crew come in. If the nations that profited off theft and stolen labor won’t return the artifacts, then Nomali and co. will simply take them back. They’re benevolent thieves; the team doesn’t make a profit and only will only steal what was previously stolen. As a lawyer, I have qualms, since in most legal systems theft of even your own property is still theft — you cannot break into your robber’s home to reclaim your phone, for example. But as someone whose ancestors were colonized by the British in India before moving to a British-occupied South Africa, this was deeply fulfilling and morally wholesome.</p><p>Every mission sees you scouting the level for robot guards, exits, and additional artifacts. You discuss this with your team, each of whom provides a different skill that is itself a mechanic in the game: Your brother is a locksmith who can break into doors or safes, while another team member is a professional acrobat who can use Batman-like skills to reach impossible areas. After scouting, Nomali is then tasked with retrieval of the artifact(s).</p><p>However, you must also make sure of your exit. This is the most exciting part for me, as it requires you to plan your escape route before setting off the alarm. After Nomali snags the object, you must then follow a perfect route out without getting caught by chasing drones. You can also plan to steal a few artifacts, meaning you need to be clever about which item to steal first; it could be that the item closest to the entrance is in fact <em>not</em> the best first option, as it is awkwardly placed. Careful planning and running through the route, placing your teammates in the right areas, all leads to a clockwork-like heist that would make Arsène Lupin proud.</p><p>The game is a cerebral platformer, a satisfying mixture of brains and twitch responses. You feel the exhilaration of a fast chase, as well as the satisfaction of a well-considered exit plan with the coordinated efforts of your teammates, when executed properly and all artifacts are in tow.</p><p>The stages are varied, sometimes not using the names as we know them now. For instance, the US is known as “the Shiny Place,” depicted as a mixture of Las Vegas and New York, with more cyberpunk aesthetics. Another is a European mansion, home of a “collector,” depicted in dark, rain-drenched cobblestone streets and with creepy paintings haunting cold brick walls. Stages usually last between five to 10 minutes, unless you repeat them due to a faulty plan or execution.</p><p>Repetition does set in, despite a wider story eventually unfolding. There’s only so much variety when dealing with 2D stages and limited mechanics, but the game does not wear out its welcome. The graphics are quite dated; though it is attempting to look like a Pixar film or other modern animation productions, character faces are flat and dialogue animations look stiff and basic.</p><p>However, parkour animations are fluid, and the colors and world are vibrant. Nomali felt great to control, especially when you get into a “flow” of parkour movement. This is heightened by an incredible soundtrack from composers Nick Horsten and Dustin van Wyk, which is able to both soothe as ambience and pump up for the action set pieces. Using a mixture of electronic and traditional instruments, the soundscapes capture the Africanfuturistic theme as well as the ’80s James Bond espionage aesthetics for our sneaky thieves.</p><p><em>Relooted</em> is very special to me as a South African. Not only is it made by South Africans, but it centres on a <em>pan</em>-African group, working together for a common goal of reclaiming what was stolen by colonial occupiers. Ugandan scholar <a href="https://roape.net/2022/12/02/surrounded-an-ethnography-of-new-colonialism/#:~:text=A%20recent%20study%20put%20the,the%20old%20form%20of%20colonialism.">Yusuf Serunkuma cites one calculation</a> that puts the loss Africa experienced through colonization between 1960–2010 at an estimated $152 trillion. To think of where my country and continent would be today were it not for the enormous theft and exploitation makes me continually angry. Even today, African citizens still have to visit former colonizer nations to view their own history.</p><p><em>Relooted</em> serves as a fine and righteous outlet for the moral rage at the unfairness and unjust occupation and horror experienced by this continent, and fulfills double roles as a history lesson and fun heist platformer. Here’s hoping more people discover just how bloody and unfair African history really was — and how wonderful, beautiful, and inspiring our continent and its people remain.</p><p><sub>Relooted <em>is available now on the Xbox and PC.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAwNTg="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tauriq Moosa</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/878121/relooted-review-xbox-steam]]></content:encoded>
