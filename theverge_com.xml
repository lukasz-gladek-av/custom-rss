Assuming that games already run great on your desktop or laptop, a monitor with per-pixel color and brightness control will make them look better than ever. If you’ve been shopping for one that’s on sale, <strong>Alienware’s 27-inch 1440p QD-OLED monitor</strong> is a fine candidate that just dropped to its lowest price yet, selling for $499.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZSGWLD5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and through <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/alienware-27-360hz-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-aw2725df/apd/210-bljd/monitors-monitor-accessories" rel="sponsored">Dell</a> (originally $649.99).</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6Njk4ODI3"><p><span>$<!-- -->500</span></p><div><p>Alienware is a major player when it comes to OLED monitors. This 27-inch 360Hz model hits the sweet spot in terms of screen resolution, features, and — most importantly — price.</p></div></div><p>It’s easy to find monitors of this size selling for slightly less, but the Alienware’s 360Hz refresh rate at 1440p resolution makes it stand out from the 240Hz offered by most others. The panel has a 111 pixels per inch (PPI) density, which is common among monitors of this size and price, and it features two DisplayPort ports and a single HDMI 2.1 port. It can only achieve 360Hz via DisplayPort, as its HDMI port caps out at 144Hz. No support for video over USB-C is a disappointment (since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/820451/msi-qd-oled-1440p-gaming-monitor-deal-sale-black-friday">MSI’s often-cheaper QD-OLED</a> at Costco has it), but its omission may not be an issue for you.</p><div><p id="other-great-verge-approved-deals"><h2>Other great Verge-approved deals</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Numerous first-party Nintendo Switch titles</strong> are discounted in physical <em>and</em> digital formats, some of which have received free Switch 2 upgrades that improve performance and graphical fidelity.

This sale also extends to preorders on movies that haven’t yet released. The catalog runs deep, filled with some well-known classics, like <em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.criterion.com%2Ffilms%2F27903-his-girl-friday" rel="sponsored">His Girl Friday</a></em>, <em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.criterion.com%2Ffilms%2F34534-eyes-wide-shut" rel="sponsored">Eyes Wide Shut</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.criterion.com%2Ffilms%2F34870-pee-wee-s-big-adventure" rel="sponsored">Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure</a></em>. It’s a great place to fill your library with cult classics, too. These days, when I wonder whether a movie that got the Criterion Collection treatment is worth my money, reading a few reviews on Letterboxd usually guides me in the right direction.</span></li><li><span>It’s not uncommon to find the Apple Watch Series 11 selling for as low as $299.99 in its smallest 42mm Wi-Fi / GPS configuration (in fact, it’s happening now for one color scheme at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-11-GPS-42mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-Purple-Fog-Sport-Band-M-L%2F17834760826" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>). However, if you’d like to save more money by instead getting the <strong>Series 10 in the 46mm configuration</strong> with Wi-Fi / GPS support, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-10-GPS-46mm-Jet-Black-Aluminum-Case-with-Ink-Sport-Loop%2F11396215385" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a> has a deal on that, too. It’s $229 for the silver aluminum model that includes the denim sport band, down from its original $429 price. The Series 11 claims to offer slightly better battery life and a more scratch-resistant display, but it otherwise pretty similar to the last-gen model. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/smartwatch-review/778012/apple-watch-series-11-review-hypertension-5g-sleep-score-wearables-smartwatch">Read our review of the Series 11.</a></span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/879940/alienware-qd-oled-pc-gaming-monitor-switch-games-apple-watch-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
