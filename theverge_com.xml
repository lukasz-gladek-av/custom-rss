            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft announced earlier this week that it would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/690967/microsoft-xbox-app-windows-steam-games-aggregated-library-support-beta">start testing its new aggregated gaming library</a> on the Xbox app for Windows, and it’s now starting to show up for testers today. This new library experience lists Steam, Battle.net, Ubisoft, Epic Games Store, and Riot Games titles that are all installed on a PC from various other launchers — much like GOG Galaxy.</p><p>I’ve been trying out the experience today and found that Microsoft automatically detects installed games and lists them in your library in the Xbox app, along with a relevant thumbnail or icon, and the name of the launcher where the game was installed from. While the thumbnails could do with some work in this beta app, you’ll get an option to play the game or see it in the relevant launcher. You can also hide games from these different PC stores if you don’t want to see them listed in the Xbox app.</p><p>This integration simply lists the games and you won’t get Xbox achievements or any additional functionality in these titles. The consolidated library is part of Microsoft’s effort to make the Xbox app on Windows <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318799/microsoft-xbox-app-new-games-homescreen">the home of PC gaming</a>, and to improve the handheld experience of Windows.</p><p>Speaking of Microsoft’s work to improve the Windows handheld experience, I’ve had multiple people <a href="https://x.com/RGVetGaming/status/1937982655301292426">tip me</a> this week that the “Xbox full-screen experience” settings have randomly appeared on their existing ROG Ally devices. While the settings have appeared, the experience isn’t live yet and nothing happens if you try to enable it.</p><p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> earlier this month</a> that existing devices like the ROG Ally will get this full-screen Xbox experience at some point soon, and it looks like the company is already starting to test that on some devices. I’m confident this is a bug showing the settings, as the new ROG Xbox Ally devices aren’t due until later this year and they’ll launch with this new experience first.</p><p>If you’re interested in testing the new consolidated library you don’t need to wait until later this year. You just need to have the Xbox test app installed, which is as simple as downloading the <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PLDPG46G47Z?hl=en-us&amp;gl=GB&amp;ocid=pdpshare">Xbox Insider Hub</a> on PC, joining the PC gaming preview in the app, and then updating the Xbox app in the Microsoft Store.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/693772/xbox-app-windows-steam-games-integration-epic-games-battle-net]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Earlier this week some devoted Xbox 360 users booted up their aging consoles to find that Microsoft had updated the home screen to finally <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/1h5xa22/box_art_is_still_stretched_man_what_the_fuck_are/">resolve an issue with box art</a>. But in addition to that fix, several <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/1ljh196/360_dashboard_updated/">users on Reddit</a>, as well as <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-console-update-more-ads-20-years-old-series-x-1851785111"><em>Kotaku</em></a>, have confirmed the update also adds some sizable ads for the Xbox Series X / S consoles to the 360’s dashboard, as <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/xbox-360-update-2025">spotted by <em>TrueAchievements</em></a>.</p><p>Microsoft’s last major update to the Xbox 360’s dashboard came shortly after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/29/24208627/the-xbox-360-store-shuts-down-today">Microsoft shut down the Xbox 360 online store in July 2024</a>, when it removed menus and tiles no longer needed. That update introduced a bug causing game thumbnails and box art to appear stretched and distorted on the home screen, but the bug has now been fixed.</p><p>What’s less welcome are Microsoft’s not-so-subtle hints that it might be time for Xbox 360 owners to upgrade. The two different ads that now appear on the 360’s dashboard include one featuring an image of the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles without any text, and one featuring a QR code that leads to the Xbox website with text encouraging players to “Experience next gen performance.”</p><p>Clicking either ad does nothing at all. You’ll need to pull out your smartphone or grab a tablet to visit the URL embedded in the QR code, where you’ll be further enticed to upgrade to the latest Xbox model.</p><p>The Xbox 360 remains Microsoft’s best-selling console to date, with around 84 million units sold since it launched in 2005. It remained popular long after the release of the Xbox One, and still held a sizable market share in countries like Mexico following the release of the Xbox Series X / S. Microsoft kept its online store running for an impressive 19 years, which is a good indication of how long it was actively in use.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/693631/microsoft-xbox-360-dashboard-software-update-ads]]></content:encoded>
