Sakhnini takes over on April 28th. Citron will stay on the board of directors and serve as an advisor to the CEO.</p><p>“As we enter our next phase, I’ve been reflecting on how I can best contribute to Discord’s long-term success,” Citron says in a message shared with employees and <a href="https://discord.com/blog/passing-the-torch">posted to Discord’s website</a>. “The job of a CEO is constantly evolving, and over the years I have continuously ‘hired myself out of a job.’ Usually that means delegating work and then taking on different leadership challenges. However, as I look at what is needed of Discord’s CEO over the next few years, I realize that it’s time for me to literally ‘hire myself out of a job.’”</p><p>When we interviewed Citron <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24134914/discord-ceo-gaming-chat-teens-safety-moderation-decoder-interview">on the <em>Decoder</em> podcast last year</a>, he said the company had grown to about 870 employees and over 200 million monthly active users.</p><p>Stanislav Vishnevskiy, Discord’s other co-founder, will remain at the company as chief technology officer.</p><p>“I look forward to working with Stan and Discord’s talented team to scale our business while staying true to the company’s core mission and the special connection it has with player communities,” Sakhnini says in a statement. “We’re still at the beginning of gaming’s impact on entertainment and culture, and Discord is perfectly positioned to play a central role in that future.”</p><p>The leadership shift is happening as Discord is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/625025/discord-is-reportedly-exploring-an-ipo">reportedly exploring an IPO</a>. In an interview <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/why-discord-founder-jason-citron-is-stepping-down-from-ceo-job-exclusive-interview/">with <em>GamesBeat</em></a>, Citron said that Discord didn’t have plans to announce about potentially going public, but noted that “as you can imagine, hiring someone like Humam is a step in that direction.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Xbox app will let LG TV owners stream Xbox games directly to their TVs, and use a wireless controller to play them.</p><p>The Xbox app will be available for LG’s 2022 OLED TVs, select 2023 smart TVs, and newer models and smart monitors that are running webOS24 or higher. It will also soon be available for LG’s portable StanbyME screens. The Xbox app is built into the LG gaming portal on the latest 2025 LG TVs, but for older models you’ll have to head into the LG app store and download the Xbox app.</p><p>LG’s 2022 OLED TVs and select 2023 smart TVs will also need the latest firmware upgrade to run the Xbox app, and you’ll have to connect a Bluetooth-enabled controller and subscribe to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to stream Xbox games to your TV.</p><p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/9/23159460/microsoft-xbox-tv-app-samsung-2022-tv-xbox-cloud-gaming-streaming">first launched its Xbox TV app</a> on Samsung’s range of smart TVs in 2022, before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/14/23959795/samsung-cloud-gaming-hub-boosteroid-tvs">expanding it</a> to older models a year later. The app looks very similar to the web version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, and aims to provide a console-like experience without the need to purchase an Xbox Series S / X device. The Xbox TV app is a big part of Microsoft’s strategy to expand Xbox to multiple devices and make it clear that it thinks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296420/microsoft-this-is-an-xbox-marketing-campaign-xbox-everywhere">every screen is an Xbox now</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
