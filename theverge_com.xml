Now, Valve watcher Brad Lynch claims a Steam Controller 2 — codename “Ibex” — is actually getting made.</p><p>His sources tell him the Steam Controller 2 is currently being tooled for mass production, and it’s apparently not the only new Valve gamepad on the way!</p><p>Remember <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/17/23172293/valve-deckard-vr-headset-rumor-patent-images-leak">the long-swirling rumors about Valve’s standalone “Deckard” VR headset</a>, the one that could be an inexpensive Meta Quest-like wireless alternative to the aging Valve Index? Lynch has discovered references to a new wand-like “Roy” controller in Valve’s SteamVR code, and his sources say that Roy is now aimed at mass production as well.</p><p>What’s more, “Roy” may have enough buttons to double as a Steam Controller gamepad when it’s not acting as your hands in VR. Unlike the Index wands, they’ll apparently have a D-pad, bumpers (aka shoulder buttons), and a full set of ABXY buttons for traditional gaming as well.</p><p>Presumably, Valve would ship the unannounced Deckard headset at the same time as its “Roy” wands. I’m curious how it’s evolved <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/17/23172293/valve-deckard-vr-headset-rumor-patent-images-leak">since the patent drawings</a>. Might it have an Arm chip inside, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/20/24250135/is-valve-cooking-up-an-arm-powered-vr-headset">as was also rumored</a>?</p><p>Valve hasn’t confirmed any of this, of course — these days, it tends to wait until it’s ready to show a near-complete product before surprise-announcing everything at once. It did also partner with Hori on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24288729/hori-official-steam-controller-us-release-date-pricing">an officially licensed Steam gamepad that’s coming to the US</a>, but is not really a proper successor.</p><p>Oh, and just in case you’re wondering why “Roy,” please familiarize yourself with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708804/blade-runner-rutger-hauer-dead-tears-in-rain-replicant-roy-batty">tears in rain</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

UK theme park company Merlin Entertainments has announced the completion of a $110 million deal with developer Mojang <a href="https://www.merlinentertainments.biz/newsroom/news-releases/2024/merlin-minecraft-in-real-life/">to open <em>Minecraft</em>-themed attractions in the US and the UK</a>. The attractions are planned to open in 2026 and 2027 and will either be new additions to existing parks or a wholly new experience. The game seems well-suited for the theme park treatment with in-game activities like mine cart rides, fighting creepers, taking trips to the The Nether, and more. </p><div><h3>Related</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23608700/super-nintendo-world-entertainment-miyamoto-takahashi-interview">Nintendo is creating an entertainment empire, and it all starts with Mario </a></li></ul></div><p><em>Minecraft</em> too has made inroads with other forms of entertainment with Warner Bros. jointly producing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24235698/minecraft-movie-trailer">a <em>Minecraft</em> movie</a> starring Jack Black and Jason Momoa set to debut in theaters in April 2025. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
