We expect to see steep discounts on a number of gaming goods when many of the early sales <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569881/black-friday-deals-start-time-hours-cyber-monday-stores">kick off next week</a>, but if you want to shop ahead of time, <strong>Seagate’s 2TB Storage Expansion Card for the Xbox Series X / S<em> </em></strong>is already matching its all-time low of $199.99 ($160 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BJYXMDW/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/7x46p0sfha73r">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://www.seagate.com/products/gaming-drives/xbox-gaming/storage-expansion-for-xbox-series-x/">Seagate’s online storefront</a>.</p><p>While pricey, Seagate’s proprietary expansion cards are a great way to expand the storage capacity of your Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S. The NVMe-based, Microsoft-licensed cards — of which there are currently two — are incredibly easy to install, fast, and allow you to run games as if they were loaded on your console’s internal memory. That means they support Microsoft’s Quick Resume function and prevent you from having to shuffle downloads around, which you’d have to do if you were to purchase a USB-based external hard drive (those are limited to playing backward-compatible games).</p><p>Understandably, Sony’s approach to expandable storage, which lets PlayStation 5 owners upgrade their console with any PS5-compatible M.2 SSD, is still far more inviting. But Seagate’s proprietary option has been coming down in price since the introduction of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/2/23666795/western-digital-xbox-storage-expansion-card">Western Digital’s WD_Black C50</a>, and Seagate’s 2TB model is far easier to stomach now than with its original starting price of $399.99. Here’s hoping the current price drop is a sign of steeper cuts to come.</p><div><p>Proprietary SSD expansion for the Xbox Series X / S consoles. The plug-and-play drives are designed to be as fast as the Xbox internal SSD and are sold in 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB configurations.</p></div><p><h3>Other deals and discounts of note</h3></p><div><ul><li><strong>Google’s Pixel Buds Pro 2</strong> are on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Buds-Pro-Cancellation/dp/B0D79ND3N7/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/txk86dj781imt">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;u=1225169&amp;m=83747&amp;urllink=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellbots.com%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle-pixel-buds-pro-2">Wellbots</a> for an all-time low of $179 ($50 off), with the latter retailer offering an additional $10 off when you use offer code <strong>VERGEBF60</strong> at checkout. They’re a pretty notable step up from the prior model — particularly if you use a Pixel phone — with a smaller build, an excellent transparency mode, and some of the best battery life you can get in a pair of noise-canceling earbuds. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24254109/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Read our review</a>.</li><li><strong>Nomad</strong> is running an <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://nomadgoods.com/">early Black Friday sale</a> through the end of today, November 9th, allowing you to save 20 percent on a variety of accessories when you use coupon code <strong>EARLY20</strong>. The promo applies to a few <em>Verge </em>favorites, including the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://nomadgoods.com/products/traditional-leather-case-brown-iphone-16-pro">Traditional Leather Case</a> for the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max ($12 off) and a selection of <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://nomadgoods.com/products/sport-band-naval">Apple Watch Sport Bands</a> ($12 off), along with the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://nomadgoods.com/products/stand-one-silver">Nomad Stand One</a> ($22 off). The latter isn’t as capable as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24224358/nomad-stand-one-max-third-gen-magsafe-qi2-charger-price-specs">Stand One Max</a>, but it still offers up to 15W MagSafe speeds and an ultra-premium design made of metal and glass. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24224358/nomad-stand-one-max-third-gen-magsafe-qi2-charger-price-specs">Read our Stand One review</a>.</li><li>In some ways, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22982833/best-fitbit-watch-fitness-tracker">best Fitbit you can buy</a> is actually the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24239115/google-pixel-watch-3-review-smartwatch-wear-os-wearable">Google Pixel Watch 3</a>. The <strong>Fitbit Charge 6 </strong>isn’t a bad alternative for fitness tracking, though, especially since it’s fallen to $99.95 ($100 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Exercise-Equipment-6-Months-Membership/dp/B0CC62ZG1M/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FFitbit-Charge-6-Black-aluminum-activity-tracker-with-infinity-band-silicone-obsidian-NFC-Bluetooth-1-33-oz%2F5087333627">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://howl.link/bxj1pg5hp12dh">Best Buy</a>. The high-end band features a color OLED screen and a solid suite of fitness-tracking tools, plus EKG, EDA, and SpO2 sensors. It also offers turn-by-turn navigation via Google Maps and a haptic side button, one that’s far better than the inductive groove on the previous model. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23958997/fitbit-charge-6-review-fitness-tracker-side-button">Read our review</a>.</li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24291592/arcane-season-2-review-netflix<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The first season of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22763818/netflix-league-of-legends-arcane-review">Netflix and Riot’s <em>Arcane</em></a> animated series fashioned disparate pieces of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/19/18099147/league-of-legends-marvel-comics-game-lore-riot"><em>League of Legends </em>lore</a> into a beautiful, devastating tale about a society on the brink of collapse. The show infused each of its characters with a depth and complexity that felt unlike anything Riot had done <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22567914/league-of-legends-riot-games-sentinels-of-light-novel">elsewhere in the longrunning franchise</a>. And its commitment to telling its own story made it remarkably easy for new fans to dive in.</p><p>There’s a density to <em>Arcane</em>’s second season that feels reflective of the show’s creative team working to bring this juggernaut of a story to a satisfying end in just nine short episodes. Especially since it has been three years since season 1, you might need a refresher on how things became so dire for the citizens of Piltover and Zaun. But while the new season drops you right back into the chaos in a somewhat disorienting way, it does an excellent job of weaving together the many different threads of <em>Arcane</em>’s powerful legend.</p><p><em>Arcane</em>’s first season ended with a literal bang — an explosive attack from Jinx (Ella Purnell) on the elite council members of Piltover just as they were about to sign a peace treaty that would have brought an end to their war on the impoverished people of Zaun. Though Jinx’s attack was rooted in years of personal psychological torment and her growing up as part of Zaun’s abused, disenfranchised underclass, it was a moment that made her sister Vi (Hailee Steinfeld) see truly her as a terroristic monster. It wasn’t clear who might emerge from the smoking rubble in the end, but there was no question about how much harder Piltover would retaliate with its dangerous Hextech weapons.</p><p><em>Arcane</em>’s second season picks up in the immediate aftermath of the attack to emphasize the sheer amount of destruction Jinx caused in her crusade to make Piltover pay for its history of injustices. With so many of Piltover’s political leaders dead, the city’s priorities and its balance of power have to shift in ways that feel necessary to Vi and other survivors like enforcer Caitlyn Kiramman (Katie Leung). But while the new season takes some time to make you appreciate the magnitude of Piltover’s loss, it pushes this act of <em>Arcane</em>’s story into motion by exploring how oppressive societies create the monsters they ultimately come to hate and fear.</p><p>Everyone suffers as <em>Arcane </em>moves its characters into a new phase of conflict, but the show uses Vi and Jinx in particular to highlight how profoundly war can unmoor people from their senses of self. It’s easier for the sisters to let one another go than it is for either of them to see themselves in the other’s face. And when presented with chances to channel their feelings into action, it seldom occurs to them how fighting just to hurt the other side is guaranteed to cause self-inflicted wounds.</p><p><em>Arcane </em>repeatedly echoes that idea as it briskly shifts focus to the rest of its cast and brings the devastating danger of Hextech into sharp focus. Inventor Jayce Talis (Kevin Alejandro) and politician Mel Medarda (Toks Olagundoye) can understand the gravity of the escalation her warhawk mother Ambessa (Ellen Thomas) is hungry for. But that foresight can only do so much to keep the calls for a full-on invasion of Zaun at bay.</p><p><em>Arcane</em>’s second season uses the rising tension and Jayce’s fears about what he has helped create to delve deeper into the magical mysteries of Hextech with a subplot that zooms far out into new realms of the <em>League of Legends </em>universe. It’s another way the show reinforces its ideas about actions coming with consequences that aren’t immediately obvious up close. And in some of <em>Arcane</em>’s characters, it crystalizes how heavy a price the planet can pay as humanity wages war.</p><p>Hextech also features largely in most of this season’s more visually stunning set pieces, which are once again truly the show’s greatest strength. Though the show as a whole is still utterly gorgeous, the action feels even more brutal this time around. On occasion, the “cool” needle drops feel a bit tone deaf because of how frank <em>Arcane</em> is trying to be in its depiction of a society tearing itself apart. But that has always kinda been <em>Arcane</em>’s vibe, and the season really leaning into it will likely appeal to hardcore fans.</p><p>Because the stakes are even higher and all of <em>Arcane</em>’s players are now fully locked into the war, this season’s first three episodes often feel more narratively dense and like they’re moving at a much faster pace. That might be more exhausting if the season was dropping all at once, but Netflix has smartly chosen to split it up into three separate acts set to debut through the end of the month. We won’t know until the end of November just how <em>Arcane</em>’s creators intend to bring this story to a close and whether it might set the stage for whatever’s coming next for the franchise. But this first act is a strong opener for <em>Arcane</em>’s final chapter.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
