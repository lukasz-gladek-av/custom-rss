Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Switch 2 owners will soon have another big Nintendo game to play. During <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/687451/nintendo-direct-donkey-kong-bananza-gameplay">its latest Direct presentation</a>, the company showed off plenty more of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642699/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-preview-switch-2">a 3D platformer that launches as a Switch 2 exclusive on July 17th</a> — and it’s looking like a surprisingly robust experience.</p></div><p>In the new game DK teams up with a younger version of the singer Pauline — who apparently has been hidden inside of a rock for some time — and travels to an underground realm that seems kind of like Nintendo’s take on Hollow Earth. Despite being below ground, the game takes place in a varied and diverse world, with beaches, mountains, and icy locales. There are even giant elder characters and <em>Breath of the Wild</em>-style ancient ruins with unique challenges.</p><p>The Direct was primarily focused on gameplay, which in <em>Bananza</em> is built around destruction. DK can smash up the environment, tear of chunks of terrain to use as a weapon, and also, uh, turn into a number of different animals. The game’s “banana transformations” let DK transform into creatures like an ostrich (so he can fly) or a zebra (so he can run so fast he can even sprint on water). These powers utilize a substance called “bananergy.” There are also other abilities that can be unlocked through a skill tree. Maybe the most important: you can purchase new outfits for both DK and Pauline. So even though it mostly plays like a platformer, it appears that <em>Bananza</em> has significant role-playing elements.</p><p>There’s a two-player co-op mode where one person controls Pauline, and the multiplayer supports GameShare, so you can play on two different consoles using only one copy of the game. <em>Bananza</em> also has a bonus mode where you can sculpt rocks using the Switch 2’s new mouse controls.</p><p><em>Bananza</em> was first revealed during <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream">Nintendo’s big Switch 2 unveiling in April</a>. It’s the second major first-party release for the console, following <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em>, which launched alongside the new console. <em>Bananza</em> is the franchise’s first 3D platformer since the Nintendo 64 era, and is the first mainline entry since <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/1/17301860/nintendo-switch-ports-wii-u-obsolete">Tropical Freeze</a></em> more than a decade ago.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
