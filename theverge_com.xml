He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Just about everything with the Nintendo Switch 2 is more expensive than the original Switch. </p><p>It’s perhaps not unexpected that the console itself costs more money than the first Switch. That device launched more than eight years ago, after all. But following yesterday’s big Switch 2 Direct, there has been a lot of sticker shock as people have seen just how much Nintendo is charging for the console and its games, including multiple titles with a price tag of just under $80. (And some of those games are just improved versions of years-old Switch titles.)</p><p>Based on hands-on reports from my colleagues, the Switch 2 seems like another <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642420/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-preview">excellent device</a>, with upgrades like an improved <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642793/nintendo-switch-2-dlss-support-nvidia-ray-tracing">Nvidia processor</a> and a bigger screen with support for HDR and 120fps framerates. Nintendo games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642699/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-preview-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a> seem like they’re shaping up well, too.</p><p>But if you’re looking to buy a Switch 2 for yourself – pre-orders in the US start <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/24342715/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-price-release-date-availability-how-to-buy">on April 9th</a> – you’re going to have to pay up. (And, depending on the impact of President Trump’s newly-announced tariffs, the Switch 2 could cost <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642459/switch-2-price-donald-trump-tariffs-china-vietnam-cambodia">even more</a>.)</p><p>Here are some comparisons of console, accessory, and game costs between the Switch and Switch 2. </p><div><p id="console"><h4><strong>Console</strong></h4></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Switch:</span><ul><li><span>Switch Lite: $199</span></li><li><span>Switch: $299</span></li><li><span>Switch OLED: $349</span></li></ul></li><li><span>Switch 2:</span><ul><li><span>Switch 2: $449.99</span></li><li><span>Switch 2 + <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle: $499.99 (which is available for a limited time through fall 2025)</span></li></ul></li></ul></div><div><p id="games"><h4>Games</h4></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Switch (typically): $59.99</span></li><li><span>Switch 2: seems to be between $69.99 and $79.99</span><ul><li><span>Nintendo’s suggested retail price for <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is $69.99, while <em>Mario Kart World</em>’s is $79.99.</span></li><li><span>Wal-Mart lists <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Fswitch-2-hardware-and-software%2F0%2F0%3F_refineresult%3Dtrue%26_be_shelf_id%3D7433688%26search_sort%3D100%26facet%3Dshelf_id%253A7433688%26povid%3Dets_switch2_pov%26nrtv_cid%3Dq6408wp3nhonf%26clickid%3DQTFXQTy2wxyKT9I2Qh2KvSx-Uksyj3SByXfazY0%26irgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_QTFXQTy2wxyKT9I2Qh2KvSx-Uksyj3SByXfazY0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_376373%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383%26sharedid%3D" rel="sponsored">various prices</a> for Nintendo’s Switch 2 games, including:</span><ul><li><span><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em>: $69.00</span></li><li><span><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition:</em> $79.00</span></li><li><span><em>Kirby and The Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star Crossed World:</em> $79.00</span></li><li><span><em>Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</em>: $79.99</span></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div><div><p id="accessories"><h4>Accessories</h4></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Switch:</span><ul><li><span>Joy-Con: $79.99</span></li><li><span>Pro Controller: $69.99</span></li></ul></li><li><span>Switch 2:</span><ul><li><span>Joy-Con 2: $89.99</span></li><li><span>Pro Controller: $79.99</span></li><li><span>Camera: $49.99</span></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo’s Switch 2 tech specs yesterday <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ftech-specs%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOoqSK0XVcXWXnovf-BkRIqZJb0wajHEfE2VV8eWNDFncMBGfNHHO" rel="sponsored">vaguely said</a> that the console is powered by a “custom processor made by Nvidia,” but in a new blog post, Nvidia has shared <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nintendo-switch-2-leveled-up-with-nvidia-ai-powered-dlss-and-4k-gaming/">a little more detail</a> about how it’s powering the device.</p><p>Nvidia says that its chip enables DLSS support on the Nintendo Switch 2, allowing the console to upscale games and provide better performance, much like how DLSS powers Nvidia’s desktop and laptop GPUs. Nvidia doesn’t mention which version of DLSS will be supported on the Switch 2, nor whether there will be any frame generation capabilities.</p><p>The Nvidia GPU inside the Switch 2 also has “dedicated RT Cores and Tensor Cores,” according to Nvidia. These RT cores will deliver real-time ray tracing on the Switch 2, with the promise of “lifelike lighting, reflections, and shadows for more immersive worlds. The Tensor Cores will “enable AI-powered face tracking and background removal in video chat use cases, enhancing social gaming and streaming.”</p><p>Nvidia also says that the console has “10x the graphics performance of the Nintendo Switch,” which is a performance claim that’s almost certainly related to the use of DLSS. The Switch 2’s variable refresh rate in handheld mode is also powered by Nvidia G-Sync technology.</p><p>Nintendo, from the outset of working on the Switch 2, wanted to improve its power over the original Switch, according to an “Ask the Developer” interview <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-1%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOor2lw7D2_B_Ig_OsE7Rysc49i1LaqOcmkWF0eQnUf0PFwGrRcBx" rel="sponsored">published yesterday</a>. The company says that its improved performance enables things like letting you destroy “anything you want” in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> “without restrictions” and the seamlessly-connected courses in <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p><p>The Switch 2 launches <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">on June 5th</a>. It will start at $449.99.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
