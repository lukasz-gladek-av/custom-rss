That’s because there still aren’t many controllers that can mimic one of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">$89.99 Switch 2 Pro</a>’s biggest selling points, which is letting owners turn the console on from their couch. It’s still something to brag about, and yet notable accessory company 8BitDo doesn’t seem keen to boast that it recently debuted new firmware for its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/755307/8bitdo-pro-3-controller-review-pc-nintendo-switch-2">Pro 3</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619229/8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-tmr-anti-drift-joysticks">Ultimate 2</a> that enables this handy trick.</p><p>Version 2.0 of its firmware for both controllers (available now in its <a href="https://app.8bitdo.com/Ultimate-Software-V2/">Ultimate Software V2</a> on Windows and Mac) brings shake-to-wake support on Switch 2. Once either controller is paired with this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLT-fUVxsBU">goofy one-time procedure</a>, you can simply turn on your gamepad, give it a little shake, then your console will wake up. I’ve confirmed that it works on my Switch 2 with both controllers.</p><p>The lack of Switch 2 wake-up in 8BitDo’s latest controllers was one of the reasons why I’ve been suggesting other models to <em>Verge </em>readers. At around $69.99 each, these aren’t cheap. And yet, models that are considerably less expensive (like GuliKit’s $29.99 ES Pro and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/791574/best-switch-2-controllers">other solid controllers</a>) shipped months ago with the ability to wirelessly wake the Switch 2.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/814551/8bitdos-latest-wireless-controllers-can-now-shake-to-wake-the-switch-2]]></content:encoded>
