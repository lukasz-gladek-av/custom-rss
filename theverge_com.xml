The chances of Cross-Save coming to PlayStation consoles are now very slim, but not impossible, so we’re going to keep working alongside PlayStation to resolve these problems.”</p><p>Poncle and PlayStation didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><p>Cross-saves are now available on Android, iOS, PC, and Xbox, Poncle says. <em>Vampire Survivors</em> on Nintendo Switch will also get cross-saves, but “at a later date.” Poncle wants to bring them to the Apple Arcade version of the game, but only “if we can do so without breaching any privacy commitments.” </p><p>If you want to turn on cross-saves, <a href="https://poncle.games/accounts">check out Poncle’s guide</a>. Note that cross-saves aren’t automatically synced, meaning you’ll have to manually save and load your save data across platforms as needed.</p><p>Alongside the cross-saves news, Poncle also released a free <em>Vampire Survivors</em> DLC expansion based on the Square Enix’s <em>SaGa</em> franchise titled <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3451100%2FVampire_Survivors_Emerald_Diorama%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Emerald Diorama</em></a> and a chicken-themed update to the main game that Poncle calls “The Coop.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/646693/trump-tariffs-pause-nintendo-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646029/trump-announces-a-90-day-pause-on-tariffs-outside-of-china">“90-day pause”</a> on high tariffs for many countries could be good news for Nintendo. The shift marks an opportunity for the company to ship more Switch 2 units from Vietnam to the US. And customs data reported on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-10/nintendo-s-pivotal-switch-2-launch-boosted-by-trump-tariff-pause?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NDI2Mzk0NywiZXhwIjoxNzQ0ODY4NzQ3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVUg2WTRUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBRDcxOUY5NDBGRTk0MzNBOERCNzI2OEJDOTY3NzY3QyJ9.ZEIyQWKfjdHBpVs7zO7eZStqT-Y5Xj20QhPKsgOroaw&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">by <em>Bloomberg</em></a> suggests the company has already been stockpiling Switch 2 units from Vietnam this year ahead of the console’s June 5th launch date.</p><p>Before the pause, the Trump administration had placed <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/04/08/trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade/">a 46 percent tariff on Vietnam</a>, where Nintendo manufactures <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a781c853-3fed-4dfc-b940-4137546180de">some of its hardware</a>. Concerns over the tariffs caused Nintendo to delay its planned April 9th date for Switch 2 preorders <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">in the US</a>. Right now, a 10 percent tariff is still in place for countries that haven’t retaliated against Trump’s tariffs, so any consoles shipped to the US from Vietnam will, for the time being, be hit with a smaller tariff than before.</p><p>Nintendo has already said that it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645534/nintendo-switch-2-supply-demand-inventory-us-tariffs-doug-bowser">shipped “some” Switch 2 inventory</a> to the US, which could help it get ahead of what’s expected to be high demand for the console. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, one of the Nintendo Switch 2’s primary assemblers in Vietnam has significantly ramped up how many devices it’s shipped to the US in the past couple months.</p><p>“Hosiden Corp., one of three main Switch 2 assemblers, shipped more devices in February to the US from Vietnam than in the previous six months combined, according to customs data provided by NBD,” <em>Bloomberg</em> says. A chart of NBD data in the article says that Vietnam exported 383,000 game console units to the US in January and more than 725,000 game console units to the US in February.</p><p>Nintendo hasn’t said when preorders in the US (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645240/nintendo-switch-2-canada-preorders-delayed-trump-tariffs">and Canada</a>) might open or if the Switch 2 will have a higher price to account for tariffs. But with the lower tariff in place for now, it seems likely that Nintendo is going to try and bring as many Switch 2 consoles to the US before higher tariffs potentially come into effect down the line.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
