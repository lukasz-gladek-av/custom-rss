Now, we have a date for that upgrade: September 10th. The upgrade will allow GeForce Now subscribers to rent what’s effectively <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/598045/nvidia-rtx-5080-review-test-benchmark">an RTX 5080</a> in the cloud, with a huge 48GB of memory and DLSS 4 support.</p><p>Nvidia’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760219/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-5080-cloud-gaming">RTX 5080 upgrade for GeForce Now</a> will include support for 5K resolutions at 60fps and 120fps, or 1440p at 240fps and 1080p at 360fps. You’ll also be able to enable full ray-tracing support in games with Neural Rendering and Multi Frame Generation, all at the same $19.99 a month for GeForce Now Ultimate.</p><p>The reveal of the upgrade date for GeForce Now is part of Nvidia’s <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-sept-2025">weekly GeForce Now announcements</a>, which include 17 games set to be added to the service this month. <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> arrives on GeForce Now today, with <em>Borderlands 4</em>, <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>, <em>Jump Space</em>, <em>Endless Legend 2</em>, and <em>Cloverpit </em>all debuting on the streaming service later this month.</p><p>“On Wednesday, September 10th, Nvidia Blackwell RTX is coming to GeForce Now,” says Nvidia. “To celebrate, next week’s GeForce Now announcements will come a day earlier to usher in the Blackwell era of GeForce Now.”</p><p>Nvidia is also bringing back the ability to install games on GeForce Now without waiting for Nvidia to formally curate them. This new “Install-to-Play” feature will greatly improve the GeForce Now library.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/771273/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-5080-upgrade-release-date#comments">0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/771273/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-5080-upgrade-release-date]]></content:encoded>
