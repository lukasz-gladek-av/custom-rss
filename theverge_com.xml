            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/14/24343771/netflix-witcher-sirens-of-the-deep-trailer-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Though the fourth season of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/22/24162497/the-witcher-netflix-liam-hemsworth">Netflix’s live-action <em>Witcher </em>series</a> still doesn’t have a concrete release date, Netflix has finally announced when we’ll see yet <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23955404/the-witcher-sirens-of-the-deep-trailer-netflix">another animated take</a> on Geralt of Rivia.</p></div><p>Originally, Netflix intended for <em>The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep </em>to debut some time late last year, but the steamer revealed today that the movie is now set to premiere on February 11th. Based on Andrzej Sapkowski’s short story “A Little Sacrifice” from <em>Sword of Destiny</em>, <em>Sirens of the Deep </em>tells the tale of how Geralt of Rivia (Doug Cockle) and Jaskier (Joey Batey) get caught up in an age-old conflict between humans and merpeople.</p><p>In a new trailer for the movie, things seem simple enough to Geralt as he’s first hired to put his special skills to good use. It makes sense that humans would want a witcher’s help to deal with a deadly series of sea monster attacks. The gig’s also easy money for Geralt and a solid way to keep his mind off Yennefer of Vengerberg (Anya Chalotra). There’s something nefarious at the root of the interspecies war, though, and by the time Geralt realizes he might have gotten things wrong, he can only do but so much to stop the bloodshed.</p><p>Compared to the live-action series, <em>Sirens of the Deep </em>looks like it’s going for a more spectacular (in the sense that the action’s <em>big</em>) depiction of Geralt’s adventures. And while it might not connect directly to the events of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23955404/the-witcher-sirens-of-the-deep-trailer-netflix">Netflix’s last animated <em>Witcher </em>movie</a> or the live-action <em>Witcher</em>’s fourth season, it should make the wait a little more bearable.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
