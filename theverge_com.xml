            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301557/new-york-times-connections-creator-take-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The New York Times</em> wants to shut down a copy of its popular <em>Connections</em> word game. The publication sent a cease and desist letter to the owner of <a href="https://connections.swellgarfo.com/">a website</a> that lets you make your own <em>Connections</em> games. The site also has a full archive of all of the <em>NYT’s</em> past <em>Connections</em> puzzles, which the <em>NYT</em> keeps behind a paywall.</p><p>The <em>Connections</em> creator website is built and run by Anthony Salazar, a freelance web developer who runs the creative studio <a href="https://swellgarfo.com/">Swellgarfo</a>. Earlier this month, striking <em>New York Times</em> tech workers used Salazar’s <em>Connections</em> tool to make their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289634/nyt-tech-guild-connections-strike-edition-custom-creator">own strike-themed puzzle</a>. Salazar previously told me that he built the archive using the <em>NYT’s</em> publicly available API.</p><p>In the letter, which Salazar shared with <em>The Verge</em>, the <em>NYT’s </em>counsel alleges that the website “unlawfully copies and reproduces” <em>Connections</em>, which constitutes “trademark and copyright infringement in violation of The Times’s intellectual property rights.” The letter also says that the <em>NYT</em> has three trademark applications pending in connection with <em>Connections</em>.</p><p>Salazar has been given three business days to take down the site. If that doesn’t happen, the <em>NYT’s </em>counsel says it’s “prepared to take further action if necessary to protect its valuable intellectual property rights,” such as filing a lawsuit.</p><p>Salazar tells <em>The Verge</em> that he will “definitely take down the archive.” But he wants to keep the creator open, saying that it’s used by schools globally. “It’s not like I am getting paid for it or competing with their users (of which I am one),” Salazar says. He’s not sure about the specific timeline for when things might happen, though.</p><p>The <em>NYT</em> says people should just play <em>Connections</em> on its website. “Mr. Salazar’s website violates the intellectual property rights of <em>The New York Times</em>,” spokesperson Jordan Cohen says in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “Anyone looking to play the original <em>Connections</em> game can do so for free on <em>The Times’s</em> own platforms. Those looking to solve puzzles from the <em>Connections</em> archive can do so by subscribing to <em>New York Times</em> Games.”</p><div><p>The <em>NYT</em> targeted <em>Wordle</em> clones with legal takedowns <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094234/ny-times-wordle-clones-files-dmca-copyright-takedowns-knockoffs">earlier this year</a>. The publication has also warned AI search engine Perplexity <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24270774/new-york-times-cease-and-desist-letter-perplexity-ai-search-engine">to stop using its content</a> and is suing OpenAI and Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/27/24016212/new-york-times-openai-microsoft-lawsuit-copyright-infringement">for copyright infringement</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
