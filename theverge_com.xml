            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jess-weatherbed">Jess Weatherbed</a> <span>is a news writer focused on creative industries, computing, and internet culture. Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Razer is launching a new $350 external graphics enclosure that can boost the visual performance of gaming laptops or handhelds, provided you make a few other investments. <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-egpus%2Frazer-core-x-v2" rel="sponsored">The Razer Core X V2</a> is the first of Razer’s Core X eGPU chassis lineup to support the faster Thunderbolt 5 connectivity standard, providing a single cable that provides up to 140W of power to connected host devices.</p><p>Some generational upgrades provided by the Core X V2 include support for larger four-slot AMD and Nvidia GPUs, and backwards compatibility with Thunderbolt 4. Laptops equipped with Thunderbolt 5 are still pretty rare, but the Core X V2 should theoretically support bandwidth speeds of up to 80 Gbps for devices that can make use of it.</p><p>Aside from a 120mm cooling fan, that single Thunderbolt 5 cable is the only other accessory, however. That means customers will not only need to purchase a compatible desktop graphics card (which can get pricey for the more powerful models), but also a standard ATX power supply that meets their GPU requirements in addition to the 230W for the Core X V2 itself.</p><p>Previous Razer Core enclosure models, like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18624843/razer-x-chroma-gpu-enclosure-thunderbolt-3-gaming-review">$399 Core X Chroma</a>, came with a pre-installed power supply. The change perhaps offers more flexibility for GPUs with lofty power requirements, but for everyone else, it’s just an additional expense.</p><p>The Razer Core X V2 also loses the integrated USB and Ethernet ports provided by its predecessors. Users who need more connectivity for peripherals will therefore <em>also</em> need to buy a compatible Thunderbolt 5 dock — just like the <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-pc-accessories%2Frazer-thunderbolt-5-dock%3F_gl%3D1*1rms8ds*_ga*NzgxNjk2MTA5LjE3NTI2NjEyODY.*_ga_3TRK53PM75*czE3NTI2NjQ1MzYkbzIkZzEkdDE3NTI2NjUyNzYkajMyJGwwJGgw*_gcl_au*MjEyODI2NjM3NS4xNzUyNjY1MjU0" rel="sponsored">$390 one that Razer conveniently announced</a> alongside the Core X V2.</p><p>The Thunderbolt 5 Dock is currently available to buy on Razer’s website. The Core X V2 is also listed, but isn’t on sale yet. We have asked Razer to share when the eGPU will be available to purchase.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/708202/razer-core-x-v2-egpu-price-thunderbolt-5]]></content:encoded>
