Welcome to <em>Installer</em> No. 67, your guide to the best and <em>Verge</em>-iest stuff in the world. (If you’re new here, welcome, happy Switch week, and also you can read all the old editions at the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/installer-newsletter"><em>Installer</em> homepage</a>.)&nbsp;</p><div><p>This week, I’ve been watching <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/225385-black-doves?language=en-US"><em><strong>Black Doves</strong></em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1167027-ibelin?language=en-US"><em><strong>The Remarkable Life of Ibelin</strong></em></a>, reading about <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/01/20/lorne-michaels-profile"><strong>Lorne Michaels</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2025/01/13/the-tickling-of-the-bulls-a-rodeo-at-madison-square-garden/"><strong>rodeos</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/how-ben-shapiro-conquered-maga-verse-trump-1236104674/"><strong>Ben Shapiro</strong></a><strong>, </strong>restarting <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/1920-twin-peaks?language=en-US"><em><strong>Twin Peaks</strong></em></a> in honor of David Lynch, wading nervously into <a href="https://www.lemon8-app.com/"><strong>Lemon8</strong></a> and <a href="https://rednoteapp.io/"><strong>RedNote</strong></a><strong>, </strong>catching up on old episodes of <a href="https://www.birbigs.com/working-it-out-pod"><em><strong>Working It Out</strong></em></a><em>, </em>and watching altogether too many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVbo_cbHZP0"><strong><em>Balatro </em>strategy videos</strong></a>.</p></div><p>I also have for you my most anticipated gadget of the year, the new season of <em>Severance</em>, an incredibly cool tech design exhibit to explore, a nifty new AI productivity tool, and much more. This week has been <em>wild, </em>with the potential TikTok ban and the upcoming US inauguration and seemingly 40,000 other things happening — but we’ve got some great ways to decompress. Let’s dive in.</p><p>(As always, the best part of <em>Installer</em> is your ideas and tips. What are you reading / watching / playing / cooking / building / cutting into small pieces this week? Tell me everything: <a href="mailto:installer@theverge.com">installer@theverge.com</a>. And if you know someone else who might enjoy <em>Installer</em>, tell them to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/installer-newsletter-sign-up">subscribe here</a>.)</p><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p> / <span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div><p><h3>The Drop</h3></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fsuccessor%2Fen-us%2Findex.html"><strong>The Nintendo Switch 2</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Nintendo is launching this thing in a typically odd, typically Nintendo-y way — so all we’ve really seen of the new device is a two-minute video with some details and vibes. But I’ve seen enough. This is the Switch successor I was hoping for.</li><li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/95396-severance?language=en-US"><strong><em>Severance </em>season 2</strong></a><strong>. </strong>I just rewatched the first season and loved it even more the second time. One of my favorite shows in years, and by all accounts, the second season is worth the wait. I’d put the first season up against any season of anything, so that’s high praise.</li><li><a href="https://nokiadesignarchive.aalto.fi/"><strong>The Nokia Design Archive</strong></a><strong>. </strong>A bunch of researchers spent several years putting together a massive, interconnected history of Nokia’s design work —&nbsp;from its wacky phone concepts to its biggest ideas about the future of everything. You could spend weeks digging around in there.</li><li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/252174-an-update-on-our-family?language=en-US"><em><strong>An Update on Our Family</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong> </em>As a still new-ish dad, I spend a <em>lot</em> of time thinking about how much of my personal and family life to share online. This story is, like, the opposite: what if you created a personal and family life <em>just</em> to share it online? It’s a wild ride.</li><li><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fdonkey-kong-country-returns-hd-switch%2F"><em><strong>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong> </em>While you’re waiting on the new Switch, here’s a new game for the old one. I love Donkey Kong the way a lot of people love Zelda and Mario, so the idea of an updated, upgraded, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24343009/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review-nintendo-switch">super-challenging side-scroller</a> is exactly up my alley.</li><li><strong>“</strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8L9Z2vmMTQ"><strong>The Science of the Matrix with Laurence Fishburne</strong></a><strong>.”</strong> A somewhat unexpected episode of Neil Degrasse Tyson’s <em>StarTalk </em>podcast, but oh BOY was it fun to listen to Morpheus himself talk through red pills, the absence of spoons, and <em>The Matrix</em>’s<em> </em>deepest thoughts about everything.</li><li><a href="https://www.raycast.com/core-features/focus"><strong>Raycast Focus</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Raycast has become the first app I install on a new Mac, and I use it for everything. Love this new feature, which can block specific apps or websites —&nbsp;and uses a countdown timer to help keep you focused.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/279299-snl50-beyond-saturday-night"><em><strong>SNL50: Beyond Saturday Night</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong> </em>Another one for the SNL 50th-anniversary content machine: a four-part NBC doc about some of the biggest moments in the show’s history. It’s an officially sanctioned thing, so don’t expect fireworks, but it’s a fun dive into the archives.</li><li><a href="https://chatgpt.com/tasks"><strong>ChatGPT Tasks</strong></a><strong>.</strong> A <em>super </em>basic feature so far, and pretty buggy — it invented a dentist appointment that I didn’t have? —&nbsp;but I’m really intrigued by the combination of a to-do list app and chatbot. I have it sending me a new oatmeal recipe and workout idea every morning, and it’s a pretty cool system.</li></ul></div><p><h3>Screen share</h3></p><p>It is an unintentional tradition at <em>The Verge</em> that new people always seem to start in incredibly chaotic situations. Often, it’ll be a writer’s first day on, like, the day of the iPhone launch, or they’ll be 15 minutes out of HR orientation and Elon Musk will suddenly buy Twitter. For <a href="https://www.threads.net/@todd.haselton"><strong>Todd Haselton</strong></a>, our new deputy editor for reviews and commerce, the chaos was CES. Todd started at the beginning of this year and was immediately inundated with 90,000 stories about weird gadgets nobody’s ever heard of. Welcome to the team!</p><p>I like to ask new <em>Verge</em> staffers to share their homescreen with us to see what we can learn about them by how they use their phone. You can fake it at work, but you can’t fake your phone, you know? Here’s Todd’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps he uses and why:</p><p><strong>The phone: </strong>iPhone 16 Pro Max. I’ve been using the biggest iPhone for years. I also have an old Galaxy Z Fold 3 that I’ve been thinking about upgrading to another folding phone.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The wallpaper: </strong>It’s a picture of me at my graduation from Lehigh University with my grandfather and my uncle, who also went to Lehigh. They’re my role models. It’s a reminder to myself to work hard and to be thankful for what I have. (My twin brother is cut off in this shot. Sorry, bro.)</p><p>My lockscreen background is a rotating picture of my family.</p><p><strong>The apps: </strong>Photos, Calendar, GroupMe, Xbox Cloud Gaming, ChatGPT, Gmail, The Verge, Messages, Phone, Safari, Camera.</p><p>David, are you sure you wanted me to do this? It might be the most boring homescreen you’ve ever published. It’s almost the default.</p><p><a href="https://groupme.com/"><strong>GroupMe</strong></a> is for staying in touch with my college friends and also where my town’s volunteer fire department keeps in touch. I haven’t been as active as I’d like to be since the summer. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fplay"><strong>Xbox Cloud Gaming</strong></a> is there because I always tell myself I’m going to have all this free time for gaming on the go. But I don’t.</p><p>The photo frame widget rotates pictures of trips I’ve taken and family members. This is a shot from my brother’s wedding in Santa Monica.</p><p>Just in case people think it’s rigged: the<em> Verge</em> icon was there before I started. I’ve been reading since the site was started, and I subscribed before I joined.</p><p><em>I also asked Todd to share a few things he’s into right now. Here’s what he said:</em></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/172494/angle-of-repose-by-wallace-stegner/"><em><strong>Angle of Repose</strong></em></a><em> </em>by Wallace Stegner. I just started it so don’t ask me what it’s about. I spend most nights reading on a Kindle Paperwhite. If you’re looking for other recommendations, though, some other books I just finished and enjoyed: <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/678664/trust-pulitzer-prize-winner-by-hernan-diaz/"><em><strong>Trust</strong></em></a> by Hernan Diaz, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/191134/stoner-by-john-williams-introduction-by-john-mcgahern/"><em><strong>Stoner</strong></em></a> by John Williams, and <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/176616/the-little-friend-by-donna-tartt/"><em><strong>The Little Friend</strong></em></a> by Donna Tartt.</li><li>I mostly game on Friday nights with my college friends from about 9PM to 11PM. (We’re all dads now, so… early bedtimes.) It’s a ritual we started during the pandemic, and it’s a good and totally mindless way for us to stay in touch. Gamers are gonna hate, but right now, it’s <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blackops6/pc"><em><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</strong></em></a><em> </em>with the Nuketown map on repeat. Just a classic map.</li><li>I’ve been really into the McDonald’s two-cheeseburger meal. It’s a little restaurant nearby with good prices, and the burgers are solid. I <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.doordash.com%2Fbusiness%2Fmcdonalds-5579%2F"><strong>get it DoorDashed</strong></a>. Starting a new job is always a little stressful (in a good way!), and this is my stress food I guess. The Dasher is waiting for my order right now.</li></ul></div><p><h3>Crowdsourced</h3></p><p><em>Here’s what the </em>Installer<em> community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email </em><a href="mailto:installer@theverge.com"><em>installer@theverge.com</em></a><em> or message me on Signal —&nbsp;@davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week.

I’ve always struggled to stick with journaling, but this makes it effortless (it takes just 15 seconds) to capture my thoughts and details about my day.” –&nbsp;Austin</p><p>“<a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/207332-sakamoto-days"><em><strong>Sakamoto Days</strong></em></a> on Netflix. It’s an anime about the best hit man in the world who retired and settled down with a family. Extremely tropey, I know. Mostly just watching to see this cutie kick ass.” –&nbsp;Ryan</p><p>“Trying to get better at Dutch, and downloaded the excellent <a href="https://mochi.cards/"><strong>Mochi</strong></a> app. Like Anki but so much better in every way.” –&nbsp;Hannes</p><p>“I just discovered <a href="https://www.stremio.com/"><strong>Stremio</strong></a> and I have a profound feeling it will change my life forever. Okay, at least the way I consume media. With all the price hikes and many services not available in the Netherlands, this seems like a great alternative.” – Jasper</p><p>“<a href="https://www.macdroid.app/"><strong>MacDroid</strong></a>. I always back up my full-resolution photos to an external hard drive every few months in addition to Google Photos, but damn is it a pain to do that on the Mac. Tried MacDroid today and instantly signed up for a lifetime subscription. So much time and stress saved!” – Josh</p><p>“<a href="https://indianajones.bethesda.net/en-US"><em><strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</strong></em></a> on Xbox. It’s the best Indiana Jones thing made in decades. I’m shocked at how much fun it is to explore and how they hit the tone perfectly. And wow did the voice actor nail young Harrison Ford. It’s almost eerie.” – DSquiz</p><p>“I started reading <a href="https://www.viz.com/one-piece"><em><strong>One Piece</strong></em></a> from the beginning last year after watching <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/111110-one-piece"><strong>the Netflix show</strong></a> — it’s very fun, it’s lighthearted, the art’s great, and the characters are all lovable and easy to latch on to.” – Luis</p><p>“Got back into Apple Arcade JUST to play <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pocket-card-jockey-ride-on/id1604577143"><em><strong>Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On!</strong></em></a> A solitaire horse racing game developed by Game Freak (the <em>Pokemon</em> people), originally for 3DS, even though it looks SO mobile. It is amazingly fun and I cannot stop playing.” –&nbsp;Uli</p><p>“The amazing Safari extension <a href="http://safarikeywordsearch.aurlien.net/"><strong>Keyword Search</strong></a>! It allows you to run custom web searches by adding a keyword or letter, so adding ‘wiki’ or ‘yt’ will search those respective sites instead of your default search engine.” – JME&nbsp;</p><p>“Have you tried <a href="https://sparrownight.com/"><em><strong>News Tower</strong></em></a> yet? Total blast.” –&nbsp;Dave</p><p><h3>Signing off</h3></p><p>The Australian Open is happening right now, which means it’s the part of the tennis calendar where I wake up in the morning and it’s 6AM and somehow half the matches are already over and something really exciting is inevitably happening. It’s delightful. The tennis has been great, but the real story of this year’s tournament is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@australianopen"><strong>the YouTube channel</strong></a>.</p><p>For complicated rights reasons, the organization behind the Open is streaming the matches on YouTube, but not like you’d think: everything is live-animated and everyone looks like Wii Sports characters. It’s deeply bizarre and extremely hokey, but against all odds, it totally works? <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/14/australian-open-avatars-helping-tennis-reach-new-audience"><strong><em>The Guardian</em> has a good story</strong></a> on how it works and why it’s necessary. I always thought these “alternative broadcasts” were just silliness, but I think there might be something here. Next year: real tennis, but make it Mario Tennis. I’ll be there.</p><p>See you next week!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-snap-is-banned-just-like-tiktok.1086294/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347034/marvel-snap-banned-tiktok-bytedance<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The divest-or-ban law <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/18/24346961/tiktok-shut-down-banned-in-the-us">aimed at TikTok</a> is also taking down other ByteDance-linked apps, including the popular card game <em>Marvel Snap</em>. The app suddenly cut off access Saturday night, seemingly without warning, surprising gamers who weren’t aware of its connection to ByteDance.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/19/23413064/marvel-snap-second-dinner-hearthstone-ios-android">card game battler set in the Marvel universe</a> is developed by Second Dinner, which is based in California. But the game is published by Nuverse, a company owned by ByteDance. As a result, it’s subject to the same shutdown order. </p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880850204095811821">a statement on X</a>, Second Dinner called the takedown a surprise and said, “Marvel Snap isn’t going anywhere. We’re actively working on getting the game up as soon as possible and will update you once we have more to share.”</p><p>Just before the calendar turned over to January 19th, 2025, the game disappeared from the App Store for iPad and iPhone players and from Google Play for players on Android. For players on PC, the game is still listed in Steam at the moment, but <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1997040/discussions/0/510696076432380503/">many players</a> are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelSnap/comments/1i4pmgy/comment/m7xogf3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reporting</a> they were signed out and can’t sign back in.</p><p>An in-game message now tells players:</p><div><blockquote><p>Sorry, Marvel Snap isn’t available right now</p><p>A law banning Marvel Snap has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use Marvel Snap for now. Rest assured, we’re working to restore our service in the U.S. Please stay tuned!</p></blockquote></div><p>Oddly, unlike TikTok, it doesn’t appear that players were given much warning about the law’s effect, and many people may not have realized it was even connected to ByteDance, including people who were still spending money on in-game items expecting to be able to keep playing it. </p><p>Other ByDance apps quickly disappeared from app stores along with TikTok, including Lemon8 and CapCut. The effect on other ByteDance-linked apps is mixed; however, it may take time to remove them. The <a href="https://www.larksuite.com/">Lark app</a> that offers a Slack-like collaboration platform was available initially but has now been removed, while other Nuverse-published games, like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9-%E3%83%AA%E3%83%90%E3%82%A4%E3%83%90%E3%83%AB-%E5%9C%B0%E4%B8%AD%E6%B7%B1%E3%81%8F%E3%81%B8/id1665908849"><em>Earth: Revival - Deep Underground</em></a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/ragnarok-x-3rd-anniversary/id1545808948?mt=8"><em>Ragnarok X: 3rd Anniversary</em></a><em>,</em> are still available in the App Store as of this writing, just after midnight ET on the 19th.</p><p><em><strong>Update, January 19th: </strong>Noted reports that Marvel Snap PC players can’t log in and added </em><a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880850204095811821"><em>a statement</em></a><em> from game developer Second Dinner.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

According to the FTC, the company “actively marketed” its loot boxes to children and misled players about their odds of winning prizes.</p><p>Cognosphere allegedly also “deceived children and other users about the real costs of in-game transactions,” by requiring them to buy virtual money that involved multiple currency exchanges. Players often spent “hundreds of dollars on prizes they stood little chance of winning,” according to Bureau of Consumer Protection Director Samuel Levine. For years, loot boxes have been likened to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18226852/loot-boxes-gaming-regulation-gambling-free-to-play">a form of legal gambling</a>. </p><p>The complaint, filed by the Department of Justice, also accuses the <em>Genshin Impact</em> developer of marketing to kids using approaches like posts on social media channels and in-game banners. The company then allegedly collected their personal information in violation of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule. Once the settlement is approved, the company is required to delete any data for children under 13 whose parents haven’t consented to their data being collected.</p><p>Other requirements of the settlement include that Cognosphere must offer an option to buy loot boxes directly and not just through virtual money. It’s also forbidden from misrepresenting pricing, features, and winning odds for loot boxes, and it must disclose exchange rates for multi-tiered virtual currency. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
