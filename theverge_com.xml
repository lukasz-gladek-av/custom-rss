Opening the controller requires you to first forcefully remove a faceplate held in place by adhesive tape before a single screw is visible. But you’ll need to extract several other parts and components, including the controller’s mainboard, before its battery is even accessible.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/687610/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-teardown-repair-upgrade">previously revealed</a>, the Pro 2 is still using older potentiometer-based joysticks that are prone to developing drift over time. They do feature a modular design that will potentially make them easier to swap with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/22/23566353/switch-joy-con-drift-solution-nintendo-gulikit">third-party Hall effect</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">TMR replacements</a>, but reassembling the controller after that DIY upgrade will require you to replace all the adhesive tape you destroyed during disassembly. </p><div><p>There are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/681153/8bitdo-controller-gamepad-nintendo-switch-2-compatible-firmware-update">cheaper alternatives to the Switch 2 Pro controller</a> that offer additional functionality, better performance, and more longevity with durable joysticks and batteries that are easy to replace.</p></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/705383/ifixit-teardown-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-repairability]]></content:encoded>
