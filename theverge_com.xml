The launch date was <a href="https://www.neteasegames.com/news/20250704/37000_1245018.html">announced by Chinese developer NetEase Games</a> alongside the release of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3JJKAc-C8Y&amp;t">a new gameplay trailer </a>that shows off some of the missions, strikes, PvP battles, and PvE features that players can expect to encounter.</p><p>The game was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/14/24269790/destiny-rising-mobile-rpg-shooter">announced in October last year</a>, spawning from the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/3/17422410/bungie-netease-100-million-investment-china-destiny-business">$100 million Bungie investmen</a>t that NetEase (the developer behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24113437/marvel-rivals-trailer-netease-pc-mcu-disney"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22180377/diablo-immortal-iphone-android-technical-alpha-preview"><em>Diablo Immortal</em></a>) made in 2018. NetEase says that <em>Destiny: Rising</em> is “set in an alternate timeline before the events of the original game,” allowing players who are new to the franchise to jump in without needing to experience previous <em>Destiny</em> titles. </p><p>Players can choose to take on the role of a “fully customisable” Lightbearer named Wolf, or play as established <em>Destiny</em> characters like Ikora Rey and Iron Lord Jolder. Game features include single, co-op, and competitive multiplayer modes, customisable Primary and Power Weapons, the ability to share weapons across character arsenals, and a new weapon type and “Mythic” rarity gear tier.</p><p>The <em>Destiny: Rising</em> release date announcement follows a limited-access playtest that was launched in November, with preorders for the game now available on Google Play and the App Store. NetEase is also holding a pre-launch event that allows players to register to receive special in-game bonuses, with more rewards being unlocked when registration milestones are crossed.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/699184/destiny-rising-mobile-game-ios-android-release-date]]></content:encoded>
