The watch’s user interface can be customized with Atari 2600-themed artwork and sound effects. But pushing it squarely into impulse purchase territory is the watch’s ability to play <em>Centipede</em>, <em>Pong</em>, <em>Super Breakout</em>, and <em>Missile Command</em> using the touchscreen or the watch’s crown dial functioning as a paddle controller.</p><p>Instead of trying to compete with the Apple Watch’s capabilities, the <a href="https://atari.com/products/atari-2600-my-play-watch-smartwatch">Atari 2600 My Play Watch</a> targets longtime gamers nostalgic enough for the consoles of their youth to spend $79.99 on an elaborately themed fitness tracker. The watch is available for preorder now through Atari’s online store and is expected to ship by June 10th, 2025.</p><div><p>If the Atari 2600 My Play Watch feels familiar, it’s because it’s actually based on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24254312/space-invaders-my-play-watch-taito-kickstarter">Space Invaders My Play Watch</a> that launched last September through a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/f84/space-invaderstm-my-play-watch?ref=hodqsx">Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign</a>. Its limited smartwatch capabilities are <a href="https://www.myplaywatch.com/">nearly identical to that previous version</a>, including swappable watch faces and fitness tracking capabilities like step tracking, calories burned, and a heart rate monitor.</p></div><p>There’s still no Bluetooth or Wi-fi connectivity. So, while the Atari 2600 My Play Watch won’t pester you with notifications from your smartphone, you won’t be able to expand its capabilities by downloading apps or new games.</p><p>There are a few upgrades on the Atari 2600 My Play Watch. Its 2.02-inch touchscreen is slightly larger than the 1.86-inch screen on the Space Invaders watch, it has a beefier and more industrial-looking metal case, and there’s now a button located beneath its crown dial. It also comes with three swappable bands featuring retro graphic designs, although Atari says they will only be available for a limited time.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The joystick was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24225264/microsoft-xbox-adaptive-joystick-accessiblity-accessory-release-date-pricing">originally announced last August</a> with a planned release in early 2025. It’s designed to meet the unique needs of gamers with limited mobility through customizable buttons and optional 3D printable accessories that can make its controls easier to use.</p></div><p>With four remappable front-facing buttons, an additional shoulder and trigger button on the back, and an Xbox thumbstick, the Xbox Adaptive Joystick can be operated single-handedly, and includes a threaded insert allowing it to be mounted to articulated supports or tripods.</p><div><p>There’s no wireless functionality, but the joystick can be connected to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23424294/microsoft-xbox-adaptive-controller-interview">Microsoft’s highly-customizable Adaptive Controller</a>, or be plugged directly into a PC or Xbox’s USB port.</p></div><p>The joystick comes in packaging that’s designed to be both accessible and sustainable, similar to packaging Microsoft introduced with its Adaptive Controller. And alongside today’s availability announcement, Microsoft’s Packaging and Content Team published a new <a href="https://packagingandcontent.blob.core.windows.net/accessibility/Creating-Accessible-Packaging.pdf">design guide for creating accessible packaging</a> that includes best practices and strategies to ensure it’s inclusive. The days of frustrating plastic clamshell packaging may soon be entirely behind us.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
