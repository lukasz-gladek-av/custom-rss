The company quietly listed the $60 gamepad <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-HORIPAD-Steam-Midnight-Black-Deck/dp/B0DLLKRFG8/?tag=theverge02-20">for preorder on Amazon</a>, with availability starting December 16th.</p></div><p>Hori originally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186645/valve-steam-controller-officially-licensed-wireless-horipad-announcement-specs">released its Wireless Horipad for Steam in October</a> — but only in Japan. The controller features dedicated buttons you can use to pull up menus in Steam, whether you’re playing in Big Picture Mode, or on the company’s handheld. Just like on the Steam Deck, the gamepad comes with touch sensors on its joysticks for motion controls and mappable back buttons.</p><p>The controller can connect to your computer or Steam Deck with Bluetooth or the included USB-A Bluetooth receiver. Hori says the wireless gamepad will last up to 12 hours on a full charge, but you can plug in its USB cable in case it runs out of juice in the middle of your game. Additionally, you can remap buttons and adjust the gamepad’s stick sensitivity, gyro controls, and turbo settings from the controller menu in Steam.</p><p>Hori’s controller lacks a few features you might expect to see on a Steam-specific controller, though, including rumble packs, a headset jack, and a trackpad. Still, it seems like a decent choice if you want a controller that’s sort of like an extension of your Steam Deck. It’s just too bad Valve hasn’t revived the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/4/5063760/we-try-the-steam-machine-valves-video-game-console-of-the-future">ultra-customizable Steam controller</a> it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/26/20984123/valve-steam-controller-discontinued-sale-price">discontinued in 2019</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
