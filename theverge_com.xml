The studio is “targeting” a price of $39.99, and “purchasing <em>Marathon</em> will give you full access to the game, including a roadmap of free gameplay updates as the year progresses,” <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonvidoc">according to a blog post</a>.</p><p>Bungie delayed <em>Marathon</em> in June <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688479/bungie-marathon-delay-sony">after alpha test feedback</a>, and since alpha, the studio has added features like proximity chat and solo queue. “Since the Alpha playtest in April, we’ve been quietly iterating on <em>Marathon</em> alongside a dedicated community of players,” Bungie says. “Every closed playtest was a chance for us to hear candid feedback about what’s working, what needs work, and where <em>Marathon</em> can shine.”</p><p>To prevent FOMO, the game’s “Rewards Passes” won’t expire and you’ll be able to buy past passes. Bungie is also promising that “we believe in preserving competitive integrity in <em>Marathon</em>, so survival will never come down to how much money you spend.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/844780/bungie-marathon-march-launch-delay]]></content:encoded>
