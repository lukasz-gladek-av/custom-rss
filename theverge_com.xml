He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>LG <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2025/12/lg-unveils-ultragear-evo-redefining-5k-gaming-with-worlds-first-ai-upscaling-technology/">unveiled</a> a whole new line of gaming monitors ahead of CES on Friday. The UltraGear evo line are all high-end monitors covering a range of technologies, but united by 5K resolution and AI upscaling.</p><p>The three flagships under the new branding are the 39GX950B, the 27GM950B, and the 52G930B. The first number in the model name indicates the size. The rest of the letters and numbers, well, I’m sure they mean something to someone.</p><p>The 39-inch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643183/lg-oled-ultragear-gx9-price">GX9</a> is an ultrawide 21:9 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/29/24331748/lg-ultragear-gx9-bendable-oled-5k2k-monitors-specs">5K2K</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/844417/rog-strix-claims-it-made-the-first-5k-dual-mode-gaming-monitor">dual-mode</a> OLED screen. It can run at its full resolution at 165Hz, or jump to 330Hz for fast-twitch games at WFHD. The 27-inch GM9 uses “New” MiniLEDs, which promise to deliver brighter images compared to OLED, without the blooming often associated with MiniLEDs. Lastly, the 52-inch G9 is an absolutely massive curved display that delivers a 12:9 panoramic view at 240Hz in its native 5K2K resolution.</p><p>The GM9 model is particularly interesting since LG makes the panels for Apple’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161487/apple-mac-pro-display-xdr-review-6k-lcd-screen-price-features">Pro Display XDR</a>, and word is that the monitor is finally getting a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple-rumors/777791/whats-next-for-apple-iphone-17-m5-ipad-pro">long-overdue update</a> in the near future.</p><p>All three monitors will be on display at CES next month, but there’s no word on pricing or availability just yet.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjA5MzU0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Terrence O'Brien</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/850572/lg-announces-new-ultragear-evo-gaming-monitors-with-ai-upscaling]]></content:encoded>
