Nigh-ish, anyway. When it does launch later this year, it might start another revolution in portable gaming, as millions of people are able to play from their couch, their bed, the train, and anywhere else. That was also true of the first Switch, though, and as big a hit as it was it didn’t spark an industry-wide shift to handhelds the way some people expected. So what gives?</p><p>On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a>, we dig in on the state of the handheld console wars. <em>The Verge</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister">Sean Hollister</a> joins the show to tell us about what we’ve learned <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/618709/steam-deck-3-year-anniversary-handheld-gaming-shipments-idc">about the Steam Deck’s success</a>, and whether the sales numbers we’re seeing reflect an exciting new market or a surprisingly static one. We also talk about why Sony and Microsoft have (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305337/sony-handheld-gaming-console-playstation-nintendo-microsoft">so far</a>) avoided building Steam Deck-like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305337/sony-handheld-gaming-console-playstation-nintendo-microsoft">gadgets of their own</a>, and why <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/617613/lenovo-legion-go-s-review-feels-good-plays-bad">the Windows handheld universe</a> remains a bit disappointing. We all think handheld, convertible consoles could be the future, but it might take a little longer than we thought.</p><p>After that, David reports on a trip he took to Florida to see <a href="https://www.theverge.com/sport/629858/tgl-golf-tech-espn-sports-future">behind the scenes at TGL</a>, a golf league featuring some of the highest-tech sporting gear you’ve ever seen anywhere. Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy, and some of the other biggest names in golf are betting big that this combination of video games, augmented reality, and live action can be a hit both on TV and in your social feeds. But it also raises some questions, like: how do you know when you can trust the computer? And how big is a 53-foot-tall screen, really?</p><p>Finally, we answer a question from the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about why you might upgrade from a normal iPad <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ipad/626647/apple-ipad-air-review-2025">to an iPad Air</a>. We’ve heard from a lot of students and note-takers the last few weeks who say the extra stylus support, and a few power-hungry apps, make the extra expense worth it.</p><p>If you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started:</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/629964/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review-nintendo-switch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The failure of the Wii U has turned out to be a big win for the Switch. While Nintendo’s previous console was its worst selling, it was still home to some of its most inventive games. Over the years, Nintendo has steadily brought many of them — ranging from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/13/17568040/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-nintendo-switch-review">Captain Toad puzzles</a> to various <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/1/17301860/nintendo-switch-ports-wii-u-obsolete">Donkey Kong</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24343009/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review-nintendo-switch">adventures</a> — to a much larger audience on the Switch. In fact, the Switch’s best-selling game, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/15/5714102/mario-kart-8-review">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a></em>, is an updated version of a Wii U classic.</p><p>And even now, with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">new-generation console on the horizon</a>, the Wii U still has more to give. This time, it’s an absolutely massive sci-fi RPG — and one that is just begging to be explored.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9862024/xenoblade-chronicles-x"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em></a> first launched in 2015. The story involves an ark-like spaceship that left Earth after an an alien invasion and eventually crashed on an untamed world called Mira. Your character is a part of the early stages of the settlement process. Much of the planet is unexplored, and the crashed ship has been turned into a city of sorts, dubbed New Los Angeles. <em>X</em> has more of a hard sci-fi setup compared to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23277681/xenoblade-chronicles-3-review-nintendo-switch">other games in the series</a>, and it’s also a standalone experience, so you don’t need to have played <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/30/16719154/xenoblade-chronicles-2-nintendo-switch">any other <em>Xenoblade</em> title</a> to understand what’s going on.</p><p>The premise is great, though the story gets pretty convoluted in a very RPG way as it progresses. But the main reason to play <em>X</em> is because of Mira. The world outside of New Los Angeles is a sprawling, strange, and seductive place teeming with alien wildlife. You’ll encounter beasts the size of dinosaurs, so gigantic that you can run under them without being noticed. There are angry monkeys that race through the world, and terrors that patrol the skies.</p><p>One of the most compelling things about the creatures in this world is that they feel like wildlife. Yes, some will attack you on sight, but most are content to leave you alone if you do the same. Mira is an incredibly dangerous place, but also one where you have the option to slow down and appreciate its beauty. As I said in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9862024/xenoblade-chronicles-x">my original review</a>, there are areas in the game that look like sci-fi staples from Pandora and Arrakis, and they’re incredible to behold, even if <em>X</em> is a decade old.</p><p>Smartly, most of the missions in the game involve further exploration, and you can expand your knowledge of the world by placing beacons that provide more detailed map information. It’s sort of like searching out towers in <em>Zelda</em>; in fact, <em>Xenoblade</em> developer Monolith Soft helped develop both <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, so the similarities make a lot of sense.</p><p>The caveat is that to enjoy all of the beauty and awe <em>X</em> has to offer, you’ll need a lot of patience. Like every other <em>Xenoblade</em> game, <em>X</em> is filled with complex systems that aren’t always clearly explained, and it can require a good amount of grinding to make your character powerful enough to take on specific missions and enemies. Battles happen in real time, with your character attacking automatically, while you choose between weapons and various special abilities with their own cooldowns.</p><p>There are other things to pay attention to beyond XP, like your affinity with other characters or your proficiency in specific skills; if you ignore them, it’s easy to find yourself in a position where you’re stuck, unable to take on a necessary mission with your current build. The game also starts very slow: the first few hours can feel like an extended tutorial.</p><p>But for a certain kind of player, it’s worth pushing through the game’s fussiness. Because even now, 10 years after it debuted, there’s still nothing quite like the sense of stunning sci-fi exploration that <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> offers. You even get a mech suit eventually. The Switch version doesn’t change much, but it does make that incredible world portable, which is more than enough reason to jump in — either again or for the first time.</p><p><sub>Xenoblade Chronicles X <em>launches on the Nintendo Switch on March 20th.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
