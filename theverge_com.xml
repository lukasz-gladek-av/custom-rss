The new union includes game developers, artists, designers, engineers, and support staff across the <em>Diablo</em> franchise, according to the Communications Workers of America (CWA) <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/hundreds-diablo-game-developers-join-communications-workers-america">press release</a>, which voted “strongly in favor” to be represented by the CWA.</p><p>The <em>Diablo</em> team is seeking to improve compensation, job security, and workplace conditions under its Microsoft parent company. Over 3,500 employees at Microsoft are now in CWA unions, including more than 500 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24205366/world-of-warcraft-developers-form-union-blizzard-entertainment"><em>World of Warcraft</em> developers</a> who formed Blizzard’s first wall-to-wall union last year. Microsoft laid off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/693535/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-xbox">as many as 9,100 employees</a> earlier this year, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs">1,900 employees</a> at Activision Blizzard and Xbox in 2024.</p><p>“With every subsequent round of mass layoffs, I’ve witnessed the dread in my coworkers grow stronger because it feels like no amount of hard work is enough to protect us,” said Kelly Yeo, an organizing committee member for the Diablo union. “This is just the first step for us joining a movement spreading across an industry that is tired of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/709144/microsoft-layoffs-2025-ai-notepad">living in fear</a>.”</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/767944/diablo-developers-form-union-blizzard-entertainment#comments">4<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/767944/diablo-developers-form-union-blizzard-entertainment]]></content:encoded>
