Starting May 28th and lasting till June 11th, Sony’s putting on its annual Days of Play summer event in which PS5s, PS5 accessories, and some of the console’s most popular games will go on sale. The sale is Sony’s first time discounting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">the PS5 Pro</a>, which launched last year. </p><p>You can check out the details of the sale on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/27/celebrate-days-of-play-2025-starting-on-may-28/?sf277411446=1">PlayStation’s website</a>, but here’s a short list of what you can get.</p><div><ul><li><span>In the United States and Canada, you can get a PlayStation 5 console plus Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Bundle (Digital and Standard) starting at $399.99 USD / $509.99 CAD, a savings of up to $119.99 USD / $159.99 CAD compared to buying each separately.</span></li><li><span>In select regions such as Europe and Asia, the PlayStation 5 console (Digital and Standard) will be on sale starting at €399.99 / £339.99 / ¥65,980.</span></li><li><span>$50 USD off PlayStation 5 Pro console </span></li></ul></div><div><p>Though traditionally timed to take advantage of all the announcements made during the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/603313/summer-game-fest-returns-on-june-6th">Summer Game Fest starting June 6th</a>, this year’s Days of Play sale has an interesting significance for Sony and the other console manufacturers, specifically Nintendo. Xbox has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659430/microsoft-xbox-console-controller-game-price-increases-worldwide">raised the prices on its console globally</a>. Meanwhile, Sony recently cited <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/13/ps5-price-to-rise-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/">high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates</a> as the reason for<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/647869/sony-ps5-price-rise-uk-europe-australia-new-zealand"> increasing the price of its consoles in Europe, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand</a>. In light of the Trump Administration’s chaotic tariff policy, that increase <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/666584/sony-earnings-tariffs-ps5-price-us-manufacturing">is expected to</a> (but has not yet) hit North America. The Play Days sale may be your last chance to get a PS5 in the US before those prices potentially go up.</p></div><p>Additionally, with single digit days left until the Switch 2 launches, the PS5’s $399.99 sale price, which includes one of the console’s most popular and most played games, is a cheaper and better deal than the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">$450 Nintendo wants from you for a Switch 2</a> (or the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer">$500 it wants for the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle</a>.) With the announcement of this sale event and with Summer Game Fest looming in the distance, we can probably expect Sony to announce a PlayStation State of Play event sometime soon.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Described as a “reimagined interactive music experience,” Dance with Sabrina will challenge players within the Festival Jam Stage to fill up their heart meters by matching the beat of some of Carpenter’s songs like “Espresso” and “Bed Chem” as her avatar performs them on stage. </p><p>By racking up the most hearts, <em>Festival</em> players will be able to “contribute to the show” during the next song in one of three roles: Dance Leader, Special Effects Pro, or Video Artist. Players who match the most beats throughout the entire event will be pictured along with Carpenter’s avatar in the Dance With Sabrina finale snapshot.</p><p>Some <em>Just Dance</em>-style dancing would have been very cool to see in <em>Fortnite</em>, but Dance with Sabrina sounds a bit more like timed button mashing with some emoting thrown in for pizazz. That doesn’t exactly seem like the most entertaining prospect, but this is part of how Epic figures out what works, and what doesn’t.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/671323/nintendo-switch-2-wii-u-technology-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Nintendo Switch is on the cusp of becoming Nintendo’s bestselling hardware ever. In retrospect, it’s easy to see why: it’s a device that seamlessly transitions from a home console to a handheld, erasing the distinction between the two. It’s been so successful that Nintendo isn’t changing all that much with the Switch 2. But both consoles are well-executed versions of ideas Nintendo has been working on since the failed Wii U — and maybe even earlier.</p><p>Purely by sales numbers, the Wii U was a flop. The Switch has sold more than 150 million units in its eight-year lifetime. The Wii U, by comparison, sold 13.56 million units — less than a 10th of what the Switch did — making it Nintendo’s worst-selling home console.</p><p>As a result, it had a much shorter lifespan, launching in late 2012 before being superseded by the Switch about four and a half years later. But many of its ideas and its games were not only excellent, they were also well ahead of their time, and, in some ways, predicted several modern trends in gaming.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The Wii U, with its tablet controller, <em>also</em> worked as a device that could play games on a TV or in handheld mode. The ability to see a game on a big screen or curl up with it on the couch is an enduring one, as the existence of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24012547/sony-playstation-portal-handheld-remote-player-ps5-chiaki-review">PlayStation Portal</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck</a> now show. The concept has become a whole category of video game hardware, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295461/dont-expect-an-xbox-handheld-any-time-soon">even Xbox wants to make a handheld now</a>. Nintendo’s interest in the idea long preceded the Wii U, as it toyed with handheld-to-TV connections with things like the Game Boy Advance’s ability to connect to the GameCube or the Super Game Boy add-on for the SNES.</p><p>The Wii U had the major limitation that you couldn’t play the games if you were too far away from the console, so they weren’t truly portable. The tablet’s battery life wasn’t great, either, so you could only play for so long before having to charge it.</p><p>The Switch improved on all of these ideas. Instead of a TV-connected console that could beam a game to the tablet, the Switch was a tablet that could easily display on a TV. The Switch’s dock made that connection seamless, as it was nearly impossible to mess up just dropping the Switch into the dock so that it could show up on your TV. (And easily recharge the console’s battery.)</p><p>Many of the Switch’s defining games started out on the Wii U. <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, the Switch’s bestselling title by far, is a port of <em>Mario Kart 8</em> for the Wii U. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> was originally going to be a Wii U exclusive before Nintendo decided to release it for the Switch as well. The first <em>Splatoon</em> title launched on Wii U before getting a pair of Switch sequels, and so did the original <em>Super Mario Maker</em>. <em>Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</em>, <em>Super Mario 3D World</em>, <em>Pikmin 3</em>, and <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> are all great Wii U games that got new life on the Switch.</p><p>The Switch 2 looks to build off that legacy by being backward compatible with the vast majority of Switch games, including the Switch versions of those Wii U classics. <em>Breath of the Wild</em> will even be getting a third version for the new console <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641365/nintendo-zelda-botw-totk-switch-2-edition-announced">with technical improvements</a>. Features like <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ffeatures%2Fgameshare%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOooxJmrZ9_LELPmfqNiku1Sqt5QJ9PgrBzcoRhyVg18GcqRqb4gB" rel="sponsored">GameShare</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">GameChat</a> could also help people more easily play games with their friends.</p><p>Before the first Switch came out in March 2017, Nintendo was aggressively moving on from the Wii U. Production of the console ended in Japan <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wii-u-production-is-dead-in-japan-long-live-the-wii-u/">in January of that year</a>, and the company was also dipping its toes into mobile as another avenue to reach players. Even at the time, the company seemed to realize that it was on to something with the concept. It was just too early. This is something <em>Mario</em> and <em>Zelda</em> creator Shigeru Miyamoto seemed keenly aware of in a 2016 interview with my colleague Andrew Webster around the release of the mobile game <em>Super Mario Run</em>.</p><p>“I hope people will continue to recognize the areas where Nintendo has taken that first step,” Miyamoto <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/8/13878378/super-mario-run-iphone-nintendo-shigeru-miyamoto-interview">told <em>The Verge</em></a>. “And hopefully someday people will look back on the Wii U and think ‘Oh wow, I remember when Nintendo did that, and now look at what’s come of that.’”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
