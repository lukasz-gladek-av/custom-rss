In a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">financial results briefing</a> on Wednesday, Nintendo said that “going forward, we will shift our primary development focus to Nintendo Switch 2 and expand our business around this new platform.”</p><p>The Switch won’t be retired immediately, but the wheels are now in motion, and we’ll probably start seeing fewer games released for the older platform. For now, Nintendo says it will continue to sell Switch hardware “while taking consumer demand and the business environment into consideration,” and that several major Switch titles are still in the pipeline from October onward.</p><p>More than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/813025/nintendo-switch-2-sales-september-2025-earnings">10.36 million Switch 2 consoles</a> have been sold since it launched in June, 84 percent of which were purchased by people transitioning from the original Switch, according to Nintendo. That’s just a fraction of the 154.01 million lifetime sales for the Switch, but Nintendo says it’s seeing a uniform migration to the new platform.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/814273/nintendo-switch-2-console-primary-focus-pivot]]></content:encoded>
