            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/2/24284956/windblown-roguelikes-friends-multiplayer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some of the most beloved roguelikes are single-player — the likes of <em>Hades</em>, <em>Balatro</em>, and <em>Dead Cells</em> are all solo titles. But <em>Windblown</em>, the new roguelike from Motion Twin, the studio that created <em>Dead Cells</em>, showed me just how cool it can be to play a roguelike with other people.</p><p>In <em>Windblown</em>, your character, one of a few adorable animal adventurers like an axolotl or a bat, is shot out of a cannon into a mysterious giant tornado to fight your way through various zones. Like <em>Dead Cells</em>, you can equip up to two main weapons. I typically have one for close-range bouts and another for long-distance attacks. But with every weapon, you’re also able to pull off a combo that uses a special move from the <em>other weapon</em> called an “Alterattack.”</p><p>Here’s an example. I love using a crossbow to attack enemies from a distance, and I pair it with a giant heavy blade. I rarely use the blade on its own; instead, I use its Alterattack that cracks open the earth in a straight line to continue to wallop on enemies at range. That turns a run into a steady rhythm of slinging arrows and using the Alterattack at <em>exactly</em> the right time, and with my five hours so far with the game, I haven’t gotten tired of the pattern.</p><p><em>Windblown</em> just launched in early access, and you can already unlock more than a dozen weapons, meaning there are a lot of combinations that I haven’t messed around with. And with four different biomes to get through on a run, there’s a lot to see, too.</p><div><figcaption><em>The bosses are no joke.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Motion Twin</cite></p></div><p>All of that would be enough to make <em>Windblown</em> part of my regular rotation of roguelikes I use to wind down at the end of a long day. But the game’s multiplayer is making <em>Windblown</em> the game I turn to every time I turn on my Steam Deck.</p><p><em>Windblown’s</em> multiplayer lobbies, which you unlock fairly early on, let you play a full run with a team of three people. You can use voice and text chat to communicate, but it’s not required; I haven’t used those at all, instead relying on four in-game emoji. I also like that you can name your lobbies. I created one titled “help me get 1st win” and immediately had two helpful people join up to help me tackle the tornado. (Sadly, we did not get the win.)&nbsp;</p><p>When playing solo, I’ve found that I’m somewhat cautious and strategic as I think about how to use weapons and positioning to take on the game’s aggressive enemies and dodge their attacks. With the help of a team, battles are speedier and become delightful explosions of light, color, sound, and damage. It’s <em>so</em> fun to absolutely annihilate baddies with other people, and it’s comforting to know that they’ve got your back in a pinch.</p><p>There are <em>a lot</em> of great roguelikes to play right now; <em>Hades II</em> just got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271897/hades-ii-2-major-update-olympic">a huge update</a>, <em>Balatro</em> is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">nearly impossible</a> to put down (especially now that it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24256010/how-to-play-balatro-mobile-localthunk-playstack">on mobile</a>), and I’ve wanted to get back into <em>Shogun Showdown</em>, which I think <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/15/24243908/shogun-showdown-review">everyone is sleeping on</a>. <em>Windblown</em> needed more than just its Motion Twin pedigree to stand out, but so far, the multiplayer is the hook that keeps me coming back.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24283508/fortnite-remix-chapter-2-concert-snoop-dogg-ice-spice<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fortnite</em> is rewinding the clock once again. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285464/fortnite-remix-the-prelude-event-how-to-watch">After a bit of teasing</a>, Epic is about to kick off a new period in the battle royale game dubbed <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-run-it-back-with-snoop-eminem-ice-spice-and-juice-wrld-in-battle-royale">The Remix: Chapter 2</a> — and it’s not only looking back in time, it’s integrating music in an ambitious new way.</p><p>The launch of the remixed season was preceded by a musical event, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/2/23978521/fortnite-the-big-bang-eminem-chapter-5">similar to the Eminem concert that teased a new era for <em>Fortnite</em></a>. This time around, Snoop Dogg and Ice Spice took the stage — both in the game and IRL at Times Square in New York — and once the season kicks off, the musical aspects will go a step farther. </p><p>As the name implies, the new mini season brings back many of the characters, gameplay elements, and locations of the game’s second chapter, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20916237/fortnite-chapter-2-new-map-season-11-black-hole-design-epic-games">which launched in 2019</a>. Chapter 2 was notable in particular because it erased the original battle royale map to start over fresh for the first time. (The Chapter 2 map itself would be swapped out in 2021 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22815391/fortnite-the-end-event-chapter-2-recap-highlights-news">when it flipped over in dramatic fashion</a>.) The month-long event will change things up weekly, with new elements themed around a different musical artist. Snoop Dogg is up first, followed by Eminem, Ice Spice, and culminating with Juice WRLD.</p><p>The remixed version of Chapter 2 begins on November 2nd and will run through November 30th, with Epic teasing a “finale” event to wrap things up. It’s also introducing a new cosmetic item: kicks, so that you can put a pair of Nikes on Peely the banana.</p><div><p>Going back in time isn’t new for the game. A year ago <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23948555/fortnite-og-new-season">Epic kicked off <em>Fortnite OG</em></a>, a throwback mini season that was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23993686/fortnite-og-new-players-lego-fortnite">designed specifically to lure back lapsed players</a>, before the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic">dramatically expanded with new experiences like <em>Lego Fortnite</em></a>. Similarly, music has long been a large focus for the game, with virtual concerts from the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report">Travis Scott</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling">Ariana Grande</a>, along with a rhythm game called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23992574/fortnite-festival-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band"><em>Fortnite Festival</em></a> featuring stars like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137317/billie-eilish-fortnite-festival-date">Billie Eilish</a>.</p></div><div><p>More recently, Epic has started <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24282075/fortnite-streamlining-battle-passes-music-lego-festival">streamlining <em>Fortnite</em>’s battle passes to better accommodate all of its many games</a>. Meanwhile, a number of notable places have been crafting <em>Fortnite</em> islands of late, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261095/hasbro-board-games-fortnite">Hasbro</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24279789/fortnite-espn-football-island-disney">ESPN</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24281908/where-we-voting-boys">the Kamala Harris campaign</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
