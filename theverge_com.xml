He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>At least two of Nintendo’s Switch 2 games are going to be more expensive than most games on the first Switch. Many Switch games cost $59.99, but Nintendo revealed today the Switch 2’s <em>Mario Kart World</em>, a June 5th launch title, will cost $79.99, while <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, releasing a little over a month later, will cost $69.99.</p><p>These aren’t Nintendo’s first titles to exceed a $59.99 price. That honor goes to <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591275/nintendo-70-dollar-game-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">launched at $69.99</a>. When that price was announced, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2023/02/08/update-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-costs-70">told <em>Game Informer</em></a> that “we determine the suggested retail price for any Nintendo product on a case-by-case basis.”</p><p>Nintendo is taking some of the sting off <em>Mario Kart World’s</em> higher price if you get it as part of a special $499.99 Switch 2 bundle. (On its own, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">the Switch 2 costs $449.99</a>.) But it appears that Nintendo’s next-generation console could have games that are generally more expensive than before.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/642049/nintendo-switch-2-verge-staff-reacts<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo has finally aired its big Switch 2 Direct, and now we know a whole lot about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/630264/nintendo-switch-2-specs-details-performance">its next console</a>. <em>The Verge</em> staff has a lot of feelings about the device, which will launch on June 5th, and we’ve collected our first impressions below.</p><div><p id="a-soulless-design"><h2><strong>A soulless design</strong></h2></p></div><p>Look, I love black. My entire wardrobe is almost exclusively black. But the Switch 2’s mostly-black design looks off to me. The original Switch may have launched with a gray Joy-Con option, but the neon red and blue controllers that also launched on day one became iconic. Now, the Switch 2 has just splashes of colors, and they’re mostly hidden.</p><p>I imagine Nintendo will inevitably release full-color Joy-Con 2 controllers in the future, but I think the Switch 2 out of the gate could have looked much more fun.</p><p><em>-Antonio Di Benedetto, laptop reviewer</em></p><div><p id="a-meaningful-screen-upgrade"><h2><strong>A meaningful screen upgrade</strong></h2></p></div><p>No, it’s not an OLED. And yes, Nintendo will almost certainly repeat its strategy of launching a Switch 2 with that display technology down the line. But even right now, there’s a lot to like about the Switch 2’s new 1080p screen.</p><p>Its much larger 7.9-inch size is a blessing for the eyesight of a generation that grew up with Nintendo consoles — myself included. And I was pleasantly surprised that the company went with a 120Hz panel that supports variable refresh rate (VRR) and wider HDR color.</p><p>It won’t deliver the inky blacks of OLED, but as long as Nintendo’s quality assurance is up to snuff, the LCD won’t dissuade me from buying a Switch 2 on day one.</p><p><em>-Chris Welch, senior reviewer</em></p><div><p id="the-joy-con-seem-like-a-big-improvement"><h2><strong>The Joy-Con seem like a big improvement</strong></h2></p></div><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642024/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controllers-mouse-magnetic-attach-c-button">new Joy-Con</a> are bigger, look more comfortable, do indeed attach via magnets, and can even be used like a mouse. Now, the real question is: will the sticks drift?</p><p><em>-Jay Peters, news editor</em></p><div><p id="social-features-no-thanks"><h2><strong>Social features? No thanks</strong></h2></p></div><p>Just imagine: the joy of Zoom meetings, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">now integrated into your gameplay</a>. Voice chat and video streaming are the worst parts about gaming to me. I will not be using these features to scare my friends away by yelling at them.</p><p>-<em>Marina Galperina, senior tech editor</em></p><div><p id="the-new-gamecube-controller-is-one-flaw-from-perfection"><h2><strong>The new GameCube controller is one flaw from perfection</strong></h2></p></div><p>I play a lot of my Switch games with a licensed PowerA replica GameCube controller. While it unfortunately uses AA batteries, it includes an additional ZL button that lets me play most of my Switch games. While Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641482/nintendo-is-releasing-a-gamecube-controller">official wireless GameCube controller</a> for the Switch 2 brings rechargeable batteries, Nintendo opted to give it a little nub of a ZL button instead of a full button. Hardly the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637833/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-details">Pro Controller</a> replacement or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/9/23546851/nyxi-wizard-nintendo-switch-driftless-gamecube-controller-hall-effect#:~:text=for%20the%20Gamecube.-,I%20love%20the%20WaveBird,-(as%20do%20our">WaveBird</a> successor I was hoping for.</p><p><em>-Umar Shakir, news writer</em></p><div><p id="a-higher-than-expected-price"><h2><strong>A higher-than-expected price</strong></h2></p></div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">$449.99</a> is higher than I was expecting for the Switch 2. I was hoping for $399. But still I’ll be doing everything I can to snag the $499.99 bundle with <em>Mario Kart World</em>, a game that costs an eye-watering $79.99 on its own. </p><p>Let’s just hope pre-orders, which start on April 9th, go ok. (I’m expecting disaster.)</p><p><em>-Jay Peters</em></p><div><p id="donkey-kong-bananza-looks-great"><h2><strong>Donkey Kong Bananza looks great</strong></h2></p></div><p>I’m sure I’ll play plenty of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer">Mario Kart World</a></em>, but I’m an antisocial sort at heart, so I spent most of this Direct waiting for Nintendo’s first-party, single-player killer app. I never would have bet on <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641537/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> </em>leading the charge. </p><p>He may be as old as Mario, but this is only Donkey Kong’s second-<em>ever</em> 3D platformer, his first since 1999’s <em>Donkey Kong 64</em>, and his first solo game since <em>Tropical Freeze</em> in 2014. He’s an unlikely candidate for a system seller. Then again, that’s probably what <em>Mario Kart </em>is for.</p><p><em>-Dominic Preston, news editor</em></p><div><p id="charging-for-a-tutorial"><h2><strong>Charging for a tutorial?</strong></h2></p></div><p>The age of new consoles being bundled with a free game is behind us, but it’s confusing why Nintendo is charging for the <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> app. Although it does appear to include a small selection of mini-games, the app seems to be more of a highly-polished interactive tutorial than a game.</p><p><em>Wii Sports</em> not only helped make that console a huge hit for Nintendo, it also cleverly introduced gamers to the Wiimote and Nunchuck’s unique capabilities and motion-controlled gaming. The <em>Welcome Tour</em> app feels like a similar idea, but with much less replay value.</p><p><em>-Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter</em></p><div><p id="no-super-smash-bros"><h2><strong>No <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> </strong></h2></p></div><p>Throughout the Switch 2 Direct, I was waiting for the iconic <em>Super Smash Bros. </em>logo to flash across my screen. And I nearly jumped out of my seat <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641602/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-masahiro-sakurai">during the <em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a> trailer, which looked almost like an intro for a new <em>SSB </em>game.</p><p>It wasn’t, unfortunately, though <em>SSB</em> creator Masahiro Sakurai, who also directed the original <em>Air Ride</em>, is directing <em>Riders</em>. Here’s hoping he’ll be up for another <em>SSB</em>.</p><p><em>-Emma Roth, news writer</em></p><div><p id="gamecube-games-on-nintendo-switch-online"><h2><strong>GameCube games on Nintendo Switch Online</strong></h2></p></div><p>It’s been more than two decades since Nintendo released <em>F-Zero GX, </em>my favorite anti-gravity racer of all time, and Switch 2 Direct revealed that it and several other GameCube games are <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fwhats-new-with-nintendo-switch-online-on-nintendo-switch-2%2F" rel="sponsored">coming to the new console</a> as a Nintendo Switch Online feature. In addition to <em>GX</em>, I can’t wait to finally play bangers from Nintendo’s most adorable console in higher resolution without the need to screw around with the pain of emulators.</p><p><em>-Wes Davis, weekend editor</em></p><div><p id="virtual-cartridges-look-useful"><h2><strong>Virtual cartridges </strong>look useful</h2></p></div><p>After my decision to stick with digital game downloads for the original Nintendo Switch led to frustrations with playing those games on the Switch OLED, I was planning a return to physical cartridges for the Switch 2.</p><p>But Nintendo’s reveal of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637307/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-card-lending-system">new virtual game cards</a> last week has changed my mind. Being able to more easily move games between several versions of the Switch without the consoles needing a constant internet connection is exactly the upgrade Nintendo needed to introduce to streamline digital game management with the Switch 2 enroute.</p><p><em>-Andrew Liszewski</em></p><div><p id="promising-updates-for-old-games"><h2><strong>Promising updates for old games</strong></h2></p></div><p>Nintendo squeezed in some promising info about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641578/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatibility-games-faq">Switch 2 updates for older titles</a> during today’s Direct. The selection of games getting updates — which includes <em>Arms</em>, <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, and <em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em> — is relatively small, and it sounds like Nintendo is taking steps to make them compatible with the Switch 2’s new GameChat feature. But Nintendo also said that the updates “may improve performance,” which feels <em>very </em>significant for certain titles on the list like <em>Pokémon Scarlet </em>/ <em>Violet </em>and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>.</p><p>-<em>Charles Pulliam-Moore, film and TV reporter</em> </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/642024/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controllers-mouse-magnetic-attach-c-button<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In its April 2nd Direct event, Nintendo revealed a lot of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">Switch 2 details</a> we’ve been waiting for, including the console’s price ($449.99 in the US), its June 5th release date, and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641985/nintendo-switch-2-every-game-announced-direct">slew of new games</a> coming to it, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641537/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a><em>. </em>The video and details the company published after the event also helped create a more complete picture of what we should expect from the second-generation Joy-Cons that come with the system.</p><p>The new Joy-Cons look a lot like the old Joy-Cons but are about a half-inch longer and black, with color accents on the connection rails and under the analog sticks — blue on the left and a pinkish-red on the right. Nintendo says they’ll be more comfortable, too. They have the same general button layout as the originals, but with a new “C” button on the right Joy-Con that’s used for a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">Discord-like GameChat feature</a> that lets you talk to friends using a microphone embedded in the top of the Switch 2 and that includes screen sharing functionality and the ability to start streaming with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641352/nintendo-switch-2-camera-launch">Switch 2 camera accessory</a> Nintendo is selling separately.</p><p>As Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto describes in a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-2%2F" rel="sponsored">new “Ask the Developer” interview</a> published today, the Switch 2’s Joy-Cons have “larger and more durable” analog sticks “with smoother movement.” On its site, the company says that the Joy-Con 2s are quieter, too. Smoother and quieter makes sense if Nintendo is using Hall effect sensors this time around, as previously rumored. Kawamoto also points out that the L and R buttons curve further down the side for easy reach. </p><p>The Joy-Con 2s connect to the Switch 2 magnetically, something Kawamoto says the company originally wanted to do with the first Switch. The Joy-Cons have larger SL and SR buttons that are made of metal, while the magnets themselves are embedded in the console. Disconnecting them involves pressing a release button on the back. In its Direct today, Nintendo claims they “won’t easily detach” on their own, but we’ll see about that when the system launches this summer. </p><p>Another big new feature of the Switch 2 Joy-Cons is that they can work like a mouse with select games. When they’re detached, you hold them, connection rail down, on a surface like a coffee table. Kawamoto said the feature will be used in games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640231/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-2-enhanced-edition-beyond"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a><em>, </em>for aiming (gyro control is still an option, too, according to a footnote on the page), and the thoroughly named <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</em>.</p><p>Comparing it to the Wii Remote’s cursor, Switch 2 director Takuhiro Dohta, who is also featured in the interview, says the company sees the mouse functionality of the new Joy-Cons as a way to let the Switch 2’s touchscreen capabilities transition to playing in docked mode. The Joy-Cons come with wrist straps, which Nintendo says gives them a wider base for “smoother gliding and better stability.”</p><p>Kawamoto said the new Joy-Con rumble feature, now called HD Rumble 2, is updated “to allow for a wider variety of vibrations.” They’ll also be stronger, he said, and have “quicker response times.” According to Nintendo’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ftech-specs%2F%23joycon2" rel="sponsored">official specs</a>, the controllers will last about 20 hours between charges and recharge in about 3.5 hours, same as the original Joy-Cons. </p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Faccessories%2F" rel="sponsored">As for accessories</a>, apart from the included wrist straps, Nintendo has also announced a $19.99 set of two wheels you can attach the Joy-Con 2s to for games like <em>Mario Kart World</em>. The company will sell a $34.99 charging grip, and the console comes with a standard non-charging grip as well. </p><p>Nintendo did away with the IR sensor found on the right-hand first-generation Joy-Con, which I will miss for no reason other than that I love when gadgets have IR sensors. In every other way, the updated Joy-Cons sound like an improvement over their predecessors, with intriguing new features and Nintendo’s promise of better comfort and improved rumble. Now, we just have to wait to see if Nintendo managed to solve the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained">stick drift problem</a> of the first Joy-Cons.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
