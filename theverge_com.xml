He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Roblox is launching a new licensing platform that will make it easier for companies to offer their intellectual property (IP) to creators so they can build approved experiences. The platform includes a license manager that “equips rights holders with new self-serve IP management tools” and a licenses catalog that creators can browse and use to apply for “licensed use of IP,” according to a newsroom post <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/07/roblox-launches-new-licensing-platform-for-experiences">from Roblox CPO Manuel Bronstein</a>.</p><p>The platform is initially launching with four partners: Lionsgate, Netflix, Sega, and Kodansha. Seven IPs will be available for “licensed use‬ by eligible creators,” including <em>Squid Game</em>, <em>Stranger Things</em>, <em>Twilight</em>, <em>Saw</em>, and <em>Like a Dragon</em>. “Two more will follow in the coming weeks, with‬ additional IPs being added later this year,” according to Bronstein.</p><p>Initially, “full-experience adaptations” will be the “first form of‬ agreement” that Roblox is offering, but “we’re exploring additional license types and offering more ways‬ to bring IP to Roblox for all types of creators,” Bronstein says.</p><div><p>Epic Games’ <em>Fortnite</em> also lets creators build experiences using official assets from franchises like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296627/fortnite-tmnt-roguelike-user-made-games-creators"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em></a> and <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/let-the-games-begin-start-creating-squid-game-islands-in-fortnite?lang=en-US"><em>Squid Game</em></a>. At some point, <em>Fortnite</em> creators will be able to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678399/epic-games-fortnite-ai-darth-vaders-tech-creators">make <em>Star Wars</em> experiences</a>, too.</p></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/707075/roblox-creators-licensing-netflix-stranger-things-lionsgate-twilight]]></content:encoded>
