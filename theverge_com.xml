            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/623905/sony-beta-program-playstation-test-ps5-updates-early<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony is launching a new PlayStation beta program to offer “an easier, more consolidated way for gamers to sign up to participate in future PlayStation betas across a wide range of PlayStation experiences,” according to <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/04/registration-for-new-beta-program-at-playstation-starts-today/">a blog post</a> by Sony’s Sid Shuman.</p><p>By signing up for the beta program (technically called the “Beta Program at PlayStation”), you’ll be able to “express interest in gaining beta access to test participating games for the PS5 console and PC, new PS5 console features, PlayStation App features, and even user experience features on PlayStation.com,” Shuman says.</p><p>You’ll only need to sign up a single time to indicate that you’re interested beta tests. That’s a nice change from previous <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/31/23813778/sony-playstation-5-dolby-atmos-support-8tb-m2-storage">PS5</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/8/22924049/ps5-beta-voice-commands-party-chats">betas</a>, which have required individual signups and codes to access.</p><p>You should be able to <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/beta-program-at-playstation/">sign up for the program here</a> starting today, though as I write this, the page is 404-ing for me. The post suggests that you should “check back later if the page is not yet available in your region.”</p><p>Signing up for the program doesn’t guarantee that you’ll get picked for a beta, Shuman says.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
