He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Get ready for more <em>Silent Hill</em>. As part of its <a href="https://youtu.be/NXaDgU72gRI?feature=shared">Press Start online presentation on Thursday</a>, Konami announced that it’s remaking the original <em>Silent Hill</em> in partnership with Bloober Team, the studio that developed last year’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/26/24279276/survival-horror-silent-hill-2-fear-the-spotlight">well-received <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake</a>. Konami didn’t share any more details beyond that the game is in development; the presentation didn’t include any footage, screenshots, or even an estimated release date.</p><p>The presentation also included a segment about <em>Silent Hill F</em>, the new entry in the series that’s launching <a href="https://www.theverge.com/sony-playstation/679960/f-is-for-freaky">on September 25th</a>. <em>Silent Hill F</em> is the first title in the series set in Japan, and during the segment, the game’s developers talked about how they designed the game and some of their inspirations. It all looks pretty frightening.</p><p>Konami kicked off the show with a segment on <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>, the upcoming remake of <em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em>. Part of the segment included footage of the <em>Ape Escape</em>-themed “Snake vs. Monkey” mode, available on PS5 and Steam, the <em>Bomberman</em>-themed “Snake vs. Bomberman” mode that you can play on Xbox Series X / S, and a new “Fox Hunt” online multiplayer mode. <em>Delta</em> is set to release on August 28th.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I feel like a broken record, but I’ve been writing for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24123318/microsoft-next-xbox-pc-future">more than a year</a> that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/612105/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-platform-changes-notepad">next Xbox console</a> will be more <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339889/microsoft-xbox-handheld-windows-operating-system-changes-notepad">PC-like</a>. Now, I think Microsoft just teased its next-gen Xbox plans while announcing its partnership with Asus to bring <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">two Xbox Ally handhelds</a> to the market later this year.</p><p>The Xbox Ally handhelds run Windows, but the Xbox team has worked with Windows engineers to boot these PC handhelds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices?preview=true&amp;vm_preview=fa9278b54dcc70a82977039c0c8c6fb8">into a full-screen Xbox UI</a>. The Windows desktop doesn’t even fully load, and you use the Xbox app UI as a launcher to get to all your games (even Steam titles) and apps like Discord.</p><p>While the combination of Windows and Xbox here is intriguing, it’s the way that Microsoft is positioning these devices that really caught my attention. “This is an Xbox,” said Microsoft during the reveal, clearly expanding its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296420/microsoft-this-is-an-xbox-marketing-campaign-xbox-everywhere">marketing push</a> beyond a single console to every screen and device.</p><p>It all felt like a true Xbox handheld reveal. There was even an 11-minute-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOKm9dDOSC8">behind-the-scenes video</a> on the Xbox Ally handhelds, filmed in a similar style to Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1dRgWpGePs">“Project Scorpio” Xbox One X reveal</a> from nearly nine years ago. “This is a breakthrough moment for Xbox,” <strong>Carl Ledbetter</strong>, a 30-year Microsoft design veteran, says in the video. Ledbetter helped design the original IntelliMouse, the Xbox 360 Slim, the Xbox One X, and plenty of other Microsoft devices. When Ledbetter is involved, you know it’s more than just a simple partner project with Asus.</p><p>“For the first time, a player is going to be able to hold the power of the Xbox experience in their hand, and take it with them anywhere they want to go,” says Xbox president <strong>Sarah Bond</strong>, in the same video. Microsoft thinks of the Xbox Ally handhelds as Xbox consoles with the freedom of Windows, and I think the next-gen Xbox is going to look very similar as a result.</p><p>Microsoft’s own Xbox handheld <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-xboxs-handheld-pembrooke-has-been-sidelined-for-now-as-microsoft-doubles-down-on-windows-11-pc-gaming-handheld-optimization">was reportedly</a> “sidelined” recently, and I’ve heard from insiders that it’s essentially canceled as the company focuses on Xbox’s new software platform. I still think we’ll see next-gen Xbox hardware from Microsoft, but I also strongly believe we’ll see multiple devices from PC makers like Asus that will also be considered next-gen Xbox consoles.</p><p>That’s because the next-gen Xbox platform is being built in the open, with devices like the ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X. These handhelds seem like a market test for where Microsoft goes next with the combination of Windows and Xbox, and the company’s goal to turn any screen into an Xbox.</p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO <strong>Phil Spencer</strong> made it clear in an <a href="https://youtu.be/mw26FdfkUDM">Xbox podcast</a> earlier this week that the Windows and Xbox teams are working more closely than ever. He also revealed this is to make the PC gaming experience more console-like:</p><div><blockquote><p><em>This is the tightest collaboration I’ve seen between the gaming organization and the Windows team in my three decades at the company. For 25 years, almost, we’ve been working on a console experience where you turn it on and it works and your games are there, and how do we bring that to the Windows ecosystem so you get the freedom of Windows to use the storefronts and the apps you want to use, but it feels like a device that’s purpose-built.</em></p></blockquote></div><p>There are plenty of technical challenges on the Windows side to fix, but these new Xbox Ally handheld devices also demonstrate a challenge for Microsoft: it’s about to sell an “Xbox handheld” that won’t run most Xbox console games natively. I’ve seen plenty of hands-on YouTube videos claiming this is a true “Xbox handheld,” but very few make it clear that it’s actually only natively running PC games.</p><p>Microsoft’s Xbox Play Anywhere effort lets you buy an Xbox game and get the PC version, but only a small amount of Xbox games and publishers are currently part of this. This isn’t an issue for Microsoft’s own first-party Xbox games, as they’ve been publishing to PC for years now, but upcoming games like <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> won’t run on these Xbox handhelds. You’ll have to stream <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> instead, until the PC version, which hasn’t been announced yet, is released.</p><p>I think most consumers won’t even realize this is the case as Microsoft is already heavily marketing these handhelds as Xboxes. Xbox fans were going wild <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLEflHcy8bU">during a watch party</a>, but as soon as the ROG logo appeared the room got a lot more subdued. This highlights Microsoft’s brand challenges here and why Xbox fans are cautious when it comes to the complexity of a PC and the future of their game library. Either way, the real benefit of Microsoft’s approach is access to Steam PC games and even PlayStation PC titles on “Xbox handhelds,” so Microsoft should lean into that selling point initially.</p><p>Over the long term, I think Microsoft will eventually solve this challenge through emulation. Bond created a new team focused on game preservation and forward compatibility in early 2024, but there are technical and licensing hurdles to overcome before original Xbox, Xbox 360, and modern Xbox games can run emulated on a PC.</p><p>Until Microsoft is ready with emulation, it’s filling the gaps with Xbox Play Anywhere and Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming instead. Microsoft’s Xbox app on PC will simply show your recently played games, and then you can just play them — whether it’s natively or streaming through the cloud. Microsoft has already done all the important work for cloud saves, so this makes the experience a lot more seamless.</p><p>All of this work is moving in a direction that Microsoft keeps talking about: choice. Instead of buying one Xbox console from Microsoft, what if you could buy Xbox consoles from lots of PC makers without ever having to see the complexity of Windows?</p><p>Microsoft is going to change the next generation of game consoles if it can pull this off. The company is already opening up its Xbox PC app to list Steam games, so having the ability to run <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633478/microsoft-xbox-steam-games-support-ui">Steam games on next-gen Xbox</a> consoles doesn’t feel all that far-fetched anymore. </p><p>I don’t think Microsoft is doing a bunch of Windows and Xbox work just to have this software running on handhelds. I think this work will give Microsoft the ability to control the console-like experience and UI on a variety of hardware, in a way where it can upsell Game Pass, its own Xbox PC games, and more. Microsoft is already in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/15/24221036/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming-valve-steamos">handheld gaming PC race</a> against Valve and SteamOS, but that’s a smaller battle in the war to define the next generation of video game consoles. </p><p>As I’ve written plenty of times before, the key to this next-gen Xbox platform will be Microsoft’s execution. It has everything it needs to make this approach a success, but Microsoft’s focus on gaming on Windows has been disastrous in the past. With the Windows and Xbox teams now working together more closely than ever before, it’s make or break time for a new Xbox platform that looks like it’s going to extend far beyond the confines of a handheld PC.</p><div><p id="the-pad"><h2>The pad:</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>You can now try Microsoft’s new Start menu for Windows 11. </strong>Microsoft is now allowing Windows 11 testers to try out a new, larger Start menu that includes a scrollable interface, new views, and more customization. The best thing about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/683818/microsoft-windows-11-new-start-menu-testing-dev-channel">this refreshed Start menu</a> is that you can now disable the recommended section and see a lot more of your own apps. Microsoft has also made the Start menu larger based on the screen size of your device or monitor. I’d still like to see a bigger overhaul to the Start menu, but having two new category and grid views certainly helps.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft is moving its Build conference out of Seattle for 2026. </strong>Microsoft isn’t planning to host its Build developer conference in its home city of Seattle next year. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684313/microsoft-build-conference-2026-location">The conference is being relocated</a>, and Microsoft isn’t saying where it will host Build next, after holding it in Seattle since 2017. One report suggests that the move out of Seattle could have been related to attendee experiences in downtown Seattle. An email is making the rounds locally in Seattle that claims Build attendees had “cited the general uncleanliness of the streets, visible drug use, and the presence of unhoused individuals.”</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft Edge is getting an AI-powered browser history that works with typos. </strong>Microsoft has started testing a new feature for its Edge browser that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684195/microsoft-edge-ai-browser-history-search-feature">adds an AI-powered search to browsing history</a>. This new “enhanced search” feature lets you find websites in your browser history even if you use a phrase, synonym, or even a typo that’s similar to the site you actually want to find. This feature is opt-in and uses an on-device model to train on browsing history data “which never leaves your device and is never sent to Microsoft.” This seems like less of a privacy risk than Microsoft’s Recall feature, and you don’t have to worry about snapshots of your screen being stored in a local database, either.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft and Asus’ two new Xbox Ally handhelds are coming later this year</strong>. We don’t have pricing for either device yet, but we do have specs for the new Xbox Ally handhelds. The white ROG Xbox Ally is designed for 720p gaming, and the more powerful black ROG Xbox Ally X targets 900p to 1080p gaming on the go. You can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">read all about the devices here</a> and a deep dive into the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices?preview=true&amp;vm_preview=fa9278b54dcc70a82977039c0c8c6fb8">Windows and Xbox changes here</a>.</span></li><li><span><strong>Windows 11 gets an important update to fix system crashes when launching games. </strong>If you use any games with Easy Anti-Cheat, then <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/windows-11-gets-important-update-to-fix-system-crashes-when-launching-games/">Microsoft just issued</a> a surprise out-of-band update to fix problems with its latest June security update for Windows 11. Some games were making Windows BSOD, but Microsoft notes that its June update wasn’t available for PCs with Easy Anti-Cheat installed, so only a small number of people will have installed the update and then installed an incompatible game afterward. Either way, it’s all fixed now with an additional update.</span></li><li><span><strong>Did Microsoft just tease a Halo CE remaster? </strong>Regular Notepad readers will know I teased a <em>Halo CE</em> remaster <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172684/microsoft-xbox-showcase-2024">last year</a>, and Xbox chief Phil Spencer appears to have confirmed that it’s on the way. At the end of the Xbox Games Showcase, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682493/did-microsoft-just-tease-a-halo-ce-remaster">Spencer casually revealed</a> that “the next <em>Forza</em>” is coming next year, along with “the return of a classic that’s been with us since the beginning.” <em>Halo CE</em> was the launch title for the original Xbox, which turns 25 years old in 2026.</span></li><li><span><strong>Gears of War: E-Day is coming in 2026</strong>. Microsoft also confirmed this week that <em>E-Day</em> won’t be launching in 2025 and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682283/gears-of-war-e-day-release-date-2026">will debut in 2026 instead</a>. The latest entry in the sci-fi shooter series will be released in the year that marks the 20th anniversary of the original <em>Gears of War</em> game debuting on the Xbox 360. It also means that Xbox’s 25-year milestone will include new <em>Halo</em>, <em>Forza</em>, <em>Fable</em>, and <em>Gears </em>games.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft Edge’s picture-in-picture mode is getting better controls. </strong>The picture-in-picture window in Edge is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/681499/microsoft-edges-picture-in-picture-mode-is-getting-better-controls">getting the ability</a> to easily pause, play, and skip forward or backward. The UI looks a lot like the Windows Media Player, and it’s part of a new media control center for the Edge browser.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft is just leaving some Liquid Glass here. </strong>Who did the glass-like design first? Was it Apple with its Aqua transparency effects in 2000 or Microsoft with its Aero Glass theme in Windows Vista in 2007? Either way, Microsoft has <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@windows/video/7514445758280551722?embed_source=121374463%2C121468991%2C121439635%2C121433650%2C121404358%2C121497414%2C121477481%2C121351166%2C121487028%2C73347566%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%2C121503376%3Bnull%3Bembed_blank&amp;refer=embed&amp;referer_url=www.theverge.com%2Fnews%2F685325%2Fmicrosoft-is-just-leaving-some-liquid-glass-here&amp;referer_video_id=7514445758280551722">released a TikTok video</a> that makes it clear what the company thinks of Apple’s new Liquid Glass design. </span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft CEO says OpenAI alliance is changing but remains strong</strong>. In an interview with Bloomberg TV’s <strong>Emily Chang</strong>, Microsoft CEO <strong>Satya Nadella</strong> has admitted that the company’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-05/microsoft-ceo-says-openai-alliance-changing-but-remains-strong">OpenAI relationship is changing</a>. “Any company that has gone from being a research lab to one of the most successful product companies of this age — obviously things have to change for them and for us and in the context of the partnership,” Nadella says. Microsoft is increasingly focused on diversifying its AI model usage, instead of relying solely on OpenAI’s latest advancements.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft’s new Copilot Vision can “see” your apps on Windows. </strong>Microsoft is launching <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685963/microsoft-copilot-vision-windows-launch">Copilot Vision for Windows today</a>, an extension of its AI assistant that lets you share your screen or apps so that Copilot can do things like coach you through using Adobe Photoshop features or analyze the photos and webpages you’re looking at. I first tried this during the 50th anniversary event in April, and I was surprised to see it could guide me through playing Minecraft or using some Windows apps. It’s launching for Windows users in the US today.</span></li></ul></div><p>I’m always keen to hear from readers, so please drop a comment here, or you can reach me at <a href="mailto:notepad@theverge.com">notepad@theverge.com</a> if you want to discuss anything else.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/685748/steam-next-fest-june-2025-demos<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Steam’s June 2025 edition of its Next Fest is going on now through June 16th, and the event is packed with great-looking demos for games coming to PC. Seriously, it seems like there are a <em>lot</em> of demos; a search filter on my Next Fest homepage shows more than 2,500 English demos to pick from.</p><p>If you open up the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsale%2Fnextfest" rel="sponsored">Next Fest page</a> and are overwhelmed, I get it – admittedly, I am, too. But I’ve played a few and have four to recommend.</p><div><p id="mina-the-hollower"><h3>Mina the Hollower</h3></p></div><p><em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3741460%2FMina_the_Hollower_Demo%2F" rel="sponsored">Mina the Hollower</a></em>, the next game from <em>Shovel Knight</em> creators Yacht Club Games, feels like a Game Boy Color title made in the modern era. You play as Mina the mouse in a top-down action-adventure game that reminds me a lot of <em>Link’s Awakening</em>. <em>Mina’s</em> signature move is a slick burrowing ability that lets you zip around underground for a few seconds, and even in the short demo, I found it immensely useful to get under obstacles or create space during hairy fights. </p><p>The demo ends with an exciting boss fight, and I was sad when it was over after about 30 minutes. I’m really looking forward to the game’s full release on October 31st. </p><div><p id="ninja-gaiden-ragebound"><h3>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</h3></p></div><p><em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2542120%2FNINJA_GAIDEN_Ragebound%2F" rel="sponsored">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a></em> is a retro-style side-scrolling action-platformer with gorgeous pixel art and an electric guitar-filled soundtrack. Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/684438/ninja-gaiden-4-hands-on-xbox-showcase-2025">other <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> games</a>, it’s filled with flashy combat and a lot of blood, but I also quite liked the old-school platforming – there’s a lot of double-jumping off enemies, which never gets old. Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/677300/dotemu-ceo-games-retro-ninja-gaiden-marvel-absolum">other Dotemu games</a>, <em>Ragebound</em> seems to perfectly capture an old-school vibe but with a game made in 2025. And after finishing the three levels in the demo, I’m eager to play the rest of the game when it’s out on July 31st.</p><div><p id="ball-x-pit"><h3>Ball X Pit</h3></p></div><p>Within moments of starting <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3651790%2FBALL_x_PIT_Demo%2F" rel="sponsored">the <em>Ball X Pit</em> demo</a>, I openly said to myself, “oh no.” Not because it’s bad. But because it immediately grabbed me as an engrossing blend of roguelikes, <em>Puzzle Bobble</em>, <em>Breakout</em>, and <em>Vampire Survivors</em>.</p><p>As enemies slowly advance toward you, you move your character around and fire balls at them, which you can bounce off walls or even between enemies. (Naturally, you’ll have to dodge bullets from the bad guys, too.) Dead enemies drop experience gems, and when you level up, you can pick from various upgrades, like balls that shock nearby foes. You can even fuse balls together, and between runs there’s a land management game. And for the people that this will matter to, your health meter looks like it was taken right from <em>Diablo</em>.</p><p>I can see losing a lot of time to <em>Ball X Pit</em> when it’s out later this year.</p><div><p id="word-play"><h3>Word Play</h3></p></div><div><p><cite>Image: Game Maker’s Toolkit</cite></p></div><p><em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3586660%2FWord_Play%2F" rel="sponsored">Word Play</a></em>, from Mark Brown of Game Maker’s Toolkit, mixes ideas from <em>Balatro</em> and word games.</p><p>Each round, you’re tasked with getting a specific score by spelling words that can be up to ten characters long before you run out of turns. As with games like <em>Scrabble</em>, different letter tiles have different point values, and words with five letters or more will get added bonus points that will help you reach the goal score more quickly.</p><p>When you reach the goal score, you move on to the next round, which will have a higher goal. But you’ll also be able to pick from an upgrade of some kind, like a modifier that automatically applies a 3x multiplier to the second tile of any word you spell.</p><p>Unlike the rest of the demos I’ve recommended here, <em>Word Play</em> is a chill puzzle game, but like with <em>Balatro</em>, I found myself trying to sneak in one more run instead of going to bed. The game is set to launch on July 14th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
