            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/673515/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-controller-launch-restock<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sheena-vasani">Sheena Vasani</a> <span>writes about tech news, reviews gadgets, and helps readers save money by highlighting deals and product recommendations for <em>The Verge</em>.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you missed your chance the first time around, you now have another opportunity to pick up Nintendo’s GameCube Controller for the Switch 2. It’s available once again from the <strong><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-2-nintendo-gamecube-controller-120833%2F" rel="sponsored">My Nintendo Store</a></strong> for $64.99, giving fans another shot at securing the wireless gamepad.</p><p>To place an order, you’ll need to be logged into your Nintendo Switch Online account, as the controller is currently only available to those with a premium membership (which starts at $19.99 a year). Once you have access to the product landing page, you can complete your purchase, which is limited to one controller per account.</p><p>Although Nintendo’s new gamepad closely resembles the original GameCube controller, the Switch 2 version introduces a few modern updates. It’s now fully wireless and features Nintendo’s new “C” button for pulling up GameChat — a voice chat feature that’s free to use through March 31st, 2026. It also has additional buttons for screenshot capture and pairing, along with a USB-C charging port.</p><p>That said, its compatibility is limited. It won’t work with standard Switch 2 games and is instead restricted to the GameCube titles available through the Switch Online Expansion Pack. At launch, this includes <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em> and <em>Soulcalibur II</em>, with more titles expected to roll out gradually.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
