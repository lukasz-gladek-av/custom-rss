            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/632679/analogue-pocket-dock-update-nintendo-switch-online-wireless-controllers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Analogue has released a new firmware update for its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22831589/analogue-pocket-review">Pocket handheld</a> with bug fixes and expanded support for wireless controllers. PocketOS v2.5 — <a href="https://www.analogue.co/support/pocket/firmware/2.5">available for download here</a> — fixes an issue with backup save exports for Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, but also introduces a long list of updates for the Pocket’s TV dock accessory that improves wireless gamepad compatibility and adds official support for Nintendo’s NES and Sega Genesis controllers.</p><p>Similar to the dock that streamlines connecting the Nintendo Switch to a TV, the Analogue Dock is an optional accessory for the Pocket that lets you play retro games on a larger screen. The Dock also includes wireless controller connectivity, and over time has expanded support to include everything from PlayStation controllers to the Switch’s Joy-Cons.</p><div><p>PocketOS 2.5 fixes button mapping issues with the wireless Super Nintendo and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688780/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-64-sega-genesis-controllers">N64 controllers Nintendo released</a> to make the experience of playing retro games through its Switch Online service feel more authentic. The new update also adds support for Nintendo’s NES and Genesis wireless gamepads to the Dock, as <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/03/analogue-pocket-now-supports-every-nintendo-switch-online-controller">spotted by <em>Time Extension</em></a>, which previously only <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnaloguePocket/comments/y1qo5l/nso_nes_controller/">worked when used with a third-party Bluetooth dongle</a>.</p></div><p>The Analogue Pocket’s support for game cartridges is limited to mostly older handhelds (TurboGrafx-16 games are supported through an adapter) including the Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Game Gear. But it was designed with additional field-programmable gate array (FPGA) architecture allowing it to replicate the behavior of many different consoles. That includes the <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/guides/all-analogue-pocket-openfpga-cores-and-where-to-download-them">Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis</a> through the use of ROM files instead of cartridges, which can now be played using the appropriate gamepads.</p><div><p>Analogue also announced yesterday that its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631816/analogue-3d-delay-nintendo-64-modretro-teaser">reimagined 4K Nintendo 64 console was delayed yet again</a> and is now expected to ship “by July 2025.”</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/632610/game-informer-returning-gamestop<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Last year, GameStop <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24212016/game-informer-shutting-down-layoffs-gamestop">shut down <em>Game Informer</em></a>, laying off all its staff and putting an end to one of the last remaining video game magazines still published in the United States. But now, cryptic posts on social media hint that the publication may make a return.</p><p>On Bluesky, the <em>Game Informer</em> account, which had not posted since July of last year, returned to life with a short video featuring the publication’s farewell message. At the bottom of the screen, code appears with the words “Continue” as though it were an arcade game asking if you wanted to put in more quarters to keep playing. The screen then flashes to black with a date, March 25th, suggesting a launch or announcement next week.</p><p>At the same time, several former <em>Game Informer</em> staff, including director Brian Shea, shared the post, strengthening the idea the magazine is on its way back while also icing the fear that GameStop was somehow reviving the publication without the staff the company laid off in August. Additionally, former staff members posted videos of a “continue” screen with a copy of <em>Game Informer</em> in the background, with the animation moving the cursor onto “yes.” Taken together, the teasers suggest <em>Game Informer</em> is coming back with its former staff returning to lead the publication.</p><p><em>The Verge</em> has reached out to GameStop and former staff at <em>Game Informer</em> to confirm the news. In an email, Shea said that he can’t comment at this time but encouraged checking out the social media posts of his former colleagues. With the continued shrinking of digital media putting thousands of journalists out of work, especially in video games, it’s incredibly rare that something good happens. While we don’t quite know what form this announcement will take on March 25th, I think we can tentatively say, <em>Game Informer</em>’s getting the band back together.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
