            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/643827/your-house-review-pc-ios-android<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Your House</em> is a visual novel that is the closest game I’ve played to reading an actual book.</p><p>In <em>Your House,</em> you play as Debbie, a girl who receives a mysterious postcard on her birthday with an address and a key. The address leads to a mansion that’s filled with secrets and puzzles for you to solve, and the game’s presentation does a lot to sell the feeling of curling up on the couch with a good mystery novel.</p><p>Much of how you interact with the game is by reading through pages of text to know what room you’re in, what’s going on, what you can interact with, and where you can go next. As you scroll down the “page” you’re reading, certain words, rooms, or locations will show up in bold. Click on those, and something will happen, whether it’s more text appearing on the page or a little animation that shows Debbie moving from one room to another. When you reach a dead end, you’ll usually be offered a link back to a hub area like a living room.</p><p>Many pages also have gorgeous pictures in a ​​noir comic style that you can click on to investigate in more detail or interact with to solve puzzles. One had me note the number of consonants and vowels in a name under a picture to access a secret area; in another, I had to click on bathroom tiles aligned with buildings on a map to uncover a secret. </p><p>As you flip back and forth between the different areas to search for clues and think through puzzles, it really feels like you’re jumping between different sections from a physical book. The game even has a narrow aspect ratio that helps you feel like you’re reading a paper page.</p><p>The game is short, which I liked; I finished my playthrough in about three hours. (Though I did rely on a lot of in-game hints, which may have helped me get through the game faster.) The plot, while interesting on a moment-by-moment basis, wasn’t particularly shocking or revolutionary. I also thought things wrapped up a little <em>too</em> neatly at the end. </p><p>But <em>Your House’s</em> choose-your-own adventure atmosphere was excellent, and the puzzles were satisfying to figure out. I’d happily “read” another game like it.</p><p><sup>Your House</sup><em><sup> is available now on PC, iOS, and Android.</sup></em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/644117/microsoft-quake-ii-ai-generated-tech-demo-muse-ai-model-copilot<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615048/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-model-gaming-muse">unveiled its Xbox AI era</a> earlier this year with a new Muse AI model that can generate gameplay. While it looked like Muse was still an early Microsoft Research project, the Xbox maker is now allowing Copilot users to try out Muse through an AI-generated version of <em>Quake II</em>.</p><p><a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/wham">The tech demo</a> is part of Microsoft’s Copilot for Gaming push, and features an AI-generated replica of <em>Quake II</em> that is playable in a browser. The <em>Quake II</em> level is very basic and includes blurry enemies and interactions, and Microsoft is limiting the amount of time you can even play this tech demo.</p><p>While Microsoft originally demonstrated its Muse AI model at 10fps and a 300 x 180 resolution, this latest demo runs at a playable frame rate and at a slightly higher resolution of 640 x 360. It’s still a very limited experience though, and more of hint at what might be possible in the future.</p><p>Microsoft is still positioning Muse as an AI model that can help game developers prototype games. When <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615048/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-model-gaming-muse">Muse was unveiled in February</a>, Microsoft also mentioned it was exploring how this AI model could help improve classic games, just like <em>Quake II</em>, and bring them to modern hardware.</p><p>“You could imagine a world where from gameplay data and video that a model could learn old games and really make them portable to any platform where these models could run,” said Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer in February. “We’ve talked about game preservation as an activity for us, and these models and their ability to learn completely how a game plays without the necessity of the original engine running on the original hardware opens up a ton of opportunity.”</p><p>It’s clear that Microsoft is now training Muse on more games than just <em>Bleeding Edge</em>, and it’s likely we’ll see more short interactive AI game experiences in Copilot Labs soon. Microsoft is also working on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628666/microsoft-xbox-copilot-for-gaming">turning Copilot into a coach for games</a>, allowing the AI assistant to see what you’re playing and help with tips and guides. Part of that experience will be available to Windows Insiders <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643235/microsoft-copilot-vision-windows-desktop-apps-mobile">through Copilot Vision</a> soon.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
