On Tuesday, the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/15/xbox-insiders-with-game-pass-ultimate-stream-your-own-game-on-the-xbox-pc-app/">company announced</a> that Xbox Insiders with a Game Pass Ultimate subscription can try streaming the Xbox games they own, including some that are available on console only, directly from the Xbox PC app.</p><div><p>Xbox <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/649958/xbox-purchase-games-mobile-app-launch">started letting Game Pass Ultimate</a> subscribers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318876/xbox-tests-streaming-games-console">stream games</a> from their library to the Xbox Series X | S and Xbox One consoles earlier this year. Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24300547/xbox-cloud-gaming-game-library-streaming">stream games from their TVs and browsers</a> on devices like smartphones, PCs, tablets, and Meta Quest headsets.</p></div><p>Bringing the feature to PC is especially helpful, as it will help users conserve storage when playing games with massive file sizes like <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, which requires 128GB of free SSD space.

The company says it plans on adding more console-only games and Play Anywhere titles to its list in the future.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/707739/xbox-stream-your-own-game-pc-app]]></content:encoded>
