Raven Software, which works on the <em>Call of Duty</em> series, was impacted as well.</p><p>“To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness,” Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer says in a memo to employees.</p><p>Last year, Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24151047/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-microsoft">shut down</a> the studios behind <em>Redfall</em> and <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> as part of a “reprioritization of titles and resources.”</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/696676/microsoft-forza-motorsport-turn-10-studios-layoffs-xbox-cuts]]></content:encoded>
