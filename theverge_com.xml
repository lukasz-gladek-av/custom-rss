There’s the sound of dial-up internet or the new message jingle on AIM or MSN Messenger. Most of these nostalgic noises have been replaced with new ones or lost to time, but PlayStation has revived one in celebration of its 30th anniversary. Yeah, you know the one.</p><p>For a limited time, players can customize their PS5 UI using themes from throughout PlayStation’s past. Choose a theme from any of the four previous PlayStation consoles and a special 30th anniversary theme. I’m guessing most players will go with the OG PSX theme while a fair number will likely settle on the PS2. </p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</p><div><figcaption>For a limited time, players can customize their PS5 with a number of themes from previous PlayStation generations.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: PlayStation</cite></p></div></div><p>In addition to these slick-ass PS5 themes, PlayStation has also <a href="https://youtu.be/KkmonzpHVRg?si=Uk46HwhFstwG60gU">shared a new video</a> thanking players for 30 years of support and has kicked off its anniversary sale in which <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/01/save-with-30th-anniversary-playstation-store-deals-live-dec-2/">goes on until December 20th</a>. You can check out the PlayStation Store for a full list of games on sale.</p><p>No matter which generation of PlayStation you grew up on, that old-school PSX boot screen just hits <em>different</em>. I’m going to be turning my PS5 on and off throughout the holidays to remember what it felt like being 14 and playing <em>Tomb Raider II</em> or <em>Tekken 3 </em>for the first time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
