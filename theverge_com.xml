            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister">Sean Hollister</a> <span>is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Yesterday, I mentioned how GPD is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/713576/gpd-win-5-ryzen-ai-max-395-strix-halo-tease">teasing the most potent handheld yet made</a> — a GPD Win 5 that will house the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chip, with AMD’s most powerful integrated graphics yet, inside a PlayStation Vita-shaped machine.</p><p>If you’ve been wondering how that huge chip could even fit, handheld expert Cary “The Phawx” Golomb <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udFaxaVvtQs">now has the answer</a>: the 7-inch handheld will apparently have no internal battery taking up space. The Win 5 is designed to either be plugged into the wall, with a gaming laptop sized 180-watt charger providing the juice — or powered by a big 80 watt-hour external battery “backpack” that will (only? additionally?) be sold separately.</p><p>We can see the full spec sheet for the new Win 5 in the Phawx’s video, and as he notes, GPD had to make its Win 5 larger than the Win 4<em> even before</em> you add that backpack battery.</p><p>While the Win 4 is a compact 6-inch handheld with a 45 watt-hour pack, the Win 5 with its 7-inch screen will be narrower but thicker than the Asus ROG Ally X handheld — which is an apt comparison, considering that handheld similarly pairs a 7-inch screen with an 80 watt-hour battery pack.</p><p>Here, though, the battery will add extra girth: it’s roughly 4 inches (110mm) wide and tall, and 0.7 inches (18mm) deep; it’s not clear how it attaches yet, as GPD has only shared the one dark video of the Win 5 filmed from the front, but the spec sheet mentions a “Battery to Host Dedicated Connector<strong>” </strong>as an accessory, so it might require plugging in a cable.</p><p>If you’re curious what the handheld’s controls might look like in better light, I tried brightening it up:</p><p>Other intriguing things we can see in the full spec sheet include:</p><div><ul><li><span>A 120Hz variable refresh rate screen, where the Win 4 was limited to 60Hz</span></li><li><span>Two configs: AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 (16C/32T/ Radeon 8060S) or AI Max 385 (8C/16T/ Radeon 8050S)</span></li><li><span>32, 64, or even the full 128GB of unified memory AMD offers for these chips</span></li><li><span>USB-4 with 100W PD charging and 8K/60 DP output</span></li><li><span>Two fans and four heat pipes for cooling</span></li><li><span>An optional HDMI and USB dock with a “battery charging slot,” presumably for the external battery</span></li><li><span>No mention of any integrated keyboard, whereas previous Win devices had a hidden keyboard underneath a sliding screen</span></li></ul></div><p>You can peruse the whole sheet at your leisure in the Phawx’s video or the screenshots we took from Phawx (with his permission) below. Be sure to tap a couple of times to make them large enough for full reading.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/714294/gpd-win-5-strix-halo-specs-revealed]]></content:encoded>
