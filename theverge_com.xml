            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/report/656783/gpu-prices-are-out-of-control-again<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Every so often, Central Computers — one of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/24/22298616/frys-electronics-going-out-of-business">last remaining</a> dedicated Silicon Valley computer stores — lets subscribers know it’s managed to obtain a small shipment of AMD graphics cards. Today, it informed me that I could now purchase a $600 Radeon RX 9070 XT <a href="https://www.centralcomputer.com/sapphire-pulse-radeon-rx-9070-xt-gaming-16gb-gddr6-graphics-card-pcie-5-0-3x-displayport-2-1-1x-hdmi-2-1-16-pin-power-connectors.html">for $850</a> — a $250 markup.</p><p>It’s not alone. I just checked every major US retailer and street prices on eBay, and I regret to inform you: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/1/23191634/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-over-3080-3070-3060-radeon-rx-6900-6800">the great GPU shortage</a> has returned. Many AMD cards are being marked up $100, $200, $250, even $280. The street price of an Nvidia RTX 5080 is now over $1,500, a full $500 higher than MSRP. And <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">an RTX 5090</a>, the most powerful consumer GPU? You can’t even get the $2,000 card for $3,000 today.</p><p>Here, I’ve built tables to show you:</p><div><h2>GPU street prices: April 2025</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Item</h3></th><th><h3>MSRP</h3></th><th><h3>Average eBay street price (Mar-Apr)</h3></th><th><h3>Best retail price (April 25th)</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT</td><td>$599</td><td>$957</td><td>$880</td></tr><tr><td>AMD Radeon RX 9070</td><td>$549</td><td>$761</td><td>$835</td></tr><tr><td>Nvidia RTX 5090</td><td>$1,999</td><td>$3,871</td><td>$3,140</td></tr><tr><td>Nvidia RTX 5080</td><td>$999</td><td>$1,533</td><td>$1,390</td></tr><tr><td>Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti</td><td>$749</td><td>$1,052</td><td>$825</td></tr><tr><td>Nvidia RTX 5070</td><td>$549</td><td>$715</td><td>$610</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>“Best retail price” is the actual price I saw a card for on April 25th — roughly the minimum you’d pay.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>You shouldn’t just blame tariffs for these price hikes. In early March, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628332/amd-9070-xt-gpu-retailer-partner-scalping">we found retailers were already scalping</a> their supposedly entry-level MSRP models of the new AMD graphics cards. Nor is this likely to just be high demand, given how few cards are changing hands on eBay: only around 1,100 new Nvidia GPUs, and around 266 new AMD GPUs were listed there over the past 30 days.</p><div><p>But tariffs may have an greater impact soon: on May 2nd, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/politics/646604/trump-tariffs-reciprocal-pause-canada-mexico-china-de-minimis">the de minimis exemption will no longer apply</a>, meaning shipments valued at $800 or less can be taxed, and many more shipments will likely get hit as a result. Stores like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/656165/shein-temu-price-increase-trump-tariffs-fast-fashion">Shein and Temu have already raised prices</a> in anticipation.</p></div><p>Here’s a deeper dive on the “MSRP” models of the AMD cards, which were all originally listed at $549 or $599:</p><div><h2>AMD “MSRP” GPU prices, April 2025</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Item</h3></th><th><h3>MSRP</h3></th><th><h3>April 25th, Newegg</h3></th><th><h3>April 25th, Micro Center</h3></th><th><h3>eBay street price (past 30 days)</h3></th><th><h3>Units on eBay (past 30 days)</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>PowerColor Reaper 9070 XT</td><td>$599</td><td>$699</td><td>$799</td><td>$755</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Sapphire Pulse 9070 XT</td><td>$599</td><td>$879</td><td>$849</td><td>$879</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>XFX Swift 9070 XT</td><td>$599</td><td>$839</td><td>$829</td><td>$949</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>ASRock Steel Legend 9070 XT</td><td>$599</td><td>$699</td><td>$699</td><td>$892</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Gigabyte Gaming 9070 XT</td><td>$599</td><td>$659</td><td>N/A</td><td>$913</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>PowerColor Reaper 9070</td><td>$549</td><td>$699</td><td>$679</td><td>$765</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Sapphire Pulse 9070</td><td>$549</td><td>$669</td><td>$789</td><td>$771</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>XFX Swift OC 9070</td><td>$549</td><td>$639</td><td>$749</td><td>$746</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>ASRock Challenger 9070</td><td>$549</td><td>$549</td><td>$609</td><td>$880</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Gigabyte Gaming OC 9070</td><td>$549</td><td>$669</td><td>$669</td><td>$893</td><td>36</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>eBay street prices are an average.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>I’ve focused this table on Newegg and Micro Center since they carry more models than any other retailer, though I also spotted “MSRP” 9070 XT cards at $800 and $850 at Amazon today, and an $830 card at Best Buy. Otherwise, these are the new sticker prices, not necessarily attainable prices, as most were out of stock.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay">From December 2020</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/1/23191634/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-over-3080-3070-3060-radeon-rx-6900-6800">July 2022</a>, I periodically tracked the prices of game consoles and GPUs during the covid-19 pandemic, when they were incredibly expensive to obtain. At one point, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards">some GPUs were worth triple their MSRP</a>. I’d love to hear from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24306571/verge-subscription-launch-fewer-ads-unlimited-access-full-text-rss"><em>Verge</em> subscribers</a> in particular: is this a valuable service we should continue in the tariff era? Or do you just want to know when it’s safe to enter the water again?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/656405/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-xbox-ps5-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>On paper, <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> doesn’t seem to stand out amidst a recent wave of prestige RPGs, from the newly polished high fantasy of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/654770/oblivion-remaster-hands-on-xbox-gamepass-bethesda"><em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> remake</a> to the medieval warfare of 15th century Bohemia in <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II. </em>For one, its fantastical conquests are set in a world reminiscent of France’s Belle Époque period, an era known for its economic prosperity and radical artistic movements, from Art Nouveau to Expressionism. Add a tinge of melodrama and an emotional backstory, and its setting resembles a medley of games that take place in vaguely European worlds like <em>Greedfall</em>, <em>Bloodborne,</em> and <em>Dishonored</em>. At the same time, <em>Expedition 33</em> boasts a turn-based combat system inspired by Japanese RPGs like <em>Final Fantasy</em> and <em>Dragon Ques</em>t.</p><p>All this is to say that <em>Expedition 33</em> risks appearing banal and cliche. Fending off impossible odds in a world, where everyone wants to swing their very imposing weapons at your head amidst medieval ruins, isn’t all that unique these days. But <em>Expedition 33</em> isn’t cowered by the lineage of RPGs that came before. Instead, it displays a sense of quiet confidence, understanding that the keys of the genre — narrative and combat — need to be distinct enough to weave a poignant tale.</p><p>This is embodied in the prologue, which takes its time to unfold the game’s emotional stakes. At the start you’re introduced to the scraggly-but-charismatic Gustav, who’s nervous about his meeting with ex-partner Sophie. Apart from going through the basics of combat, Gustav spends the first half of the chapter on a leisurely stroll with her along the town’s boulevard, as they make their way toward the harbor. It’s then that the game’s conceit is revealed: the Paintress, a malignant, immortal being of sorts, wakes up once a year to paint a number on a massive monolith, culling the town’s dwindling population. When this happens, everyone of that particular age simply dissipates into petals. It’s a moment that could easily tip into mawkishness, but a palpable feeling of melancholia sets in. A lump in your throat lingers.</p><p>This scene sets the tone for the rest of <em>Expedition 33</em>. You guide a group of doomed Expeditioners like Gustav, who are embarking on a last-ditch attempt to stop the Paintress. It would’ve been easy for <em>Expedition 33</em> to plunge into an never-ending cycle of abject hopelessness, but there’s a genuine sense of wonder in traveling beyond the small town of Lumiere, and toward the vast expanse of its larger, phantasmagoric world.</p><p>One landscape has towering pink corals and shimmering sea flora, swaying like underwater tendrils, with bubbling streams rising from the ground. Another showcases the remnants of Art Nouveau architecture, with dilapidated buildings rife with elegant curves and floral patterns, as well as marble faces carved onto their surfaces. It’s as if these lands, once rich with history and biodiversity, have long been wrecked by a cataclysmic war. Despite the looming threat of certain death, even the Expeditioners were awed by the painterly allure of their surroundings, almost thrilled to be on such a lustrous journey. </p><p>Equally — and unexpectedly — resplendent is the game’s combat. Encounters typically begin with the crew striking some monstrous titans with an initial, vibrant blow (or, in unlucky instances, with enemies walking into them), and being transported to a grandiose arena. These scenes are beautiful tableaus, with every attack depicted with the finesse and flourish of stylish sword fights.</p><p><em>Expedition 33</em>’s turn-based combat appears deceptively straightforward. You can issue commands to each Expeditioner every turn, who have their own impressive set of moves. The backbone of Gustav’s attacks, for instance, is his prosthetic arm, which allows him to charge up his assaults and subsequently land a powerful finisher. Whereas another Expeditioner, Lune, embodies the mage archetype with several elemental spells at her disposal.</p><p>Adding a wrinkle to this turn-based formula is that enemy attacks can be dodged and parried. When timed right, this allows you to collect more action points for pulling off a string of attacks, or launching a countermove. Performing twitchy maneuvers like these are incredibly satisfying. A perfectly timed parry can easily turn the tide of combat, letting you deal a massive amount of damage. That’s not to say that battles are easy; executing these moves, at the right time, is contingent on your understanding of enemy movements, some of whom are prone to feigning their attacks. Most enemies even present their own twists to combat, which makes every tussle substantial.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Sandfall Interactive</cite></p></div><p>Adding some tactical diversity to combat are Pictos, which are items the Expeditioners can equip to buff their attacks. This is, by far, one of the smartest tricks <em>Expedition 33</em> has up its sleeve. There are plenty of these to collect across the map, so you can further customize each Expeditioner to a specific, preferred build. Gustav’s Overcharge, for instance, requires him to land a flurry of melee assaults to charge up the skill, so I prefer to equip him with Pictos that increase the potency of his attacks.</p><p>This is how <em>Expedition 33</em> lets you subtly refine the cadence of battles. And then there’s the joy of the grind; if an enemy proves to be too overwhelming, you can always plow through ramshackle bands of mechanical titans for experience points. That’s because the ritual of grinding in <em>Expedition 33</em> is deeply cerebral, rather than mindlessly tedious, with every encounter a sizable, yet surmountable challenge. Plus, swinging enormous swords and scythes at the heads of Expedition 33’s monstrous giants — accompanied by a rousing, atmospheric soundtrack — lets your attacks land with a really meaty thump. Fighting is a grand, stupendous affair.</p><p>There’s much more to say about the sheer extravagance of <em>Expedition 33</em>. Its characters carry shades of complexity and compassion that surface in their conversations. Its music swells and swirls with orchestral lavishness, punctuating every interaction with a note of majesty or calamity. Its tale is heart-wrenching, stirring, and humorous in equal measure. Some parts of <em>Expedition 33 </em>can be a tad superfluous — like the need to put a numerical value in the Expeditioners’ relationships, and certain dialog choices that make little sense — but these do little to mar its experience.</p><p><em>Expedition 33</em> is built upon the conventional anchors of its genre. But its grandiose tale, bolstered by a downright robust combat system, turns it into something much more than just a scrappy underdog.</p><p><sub>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33<em> is available now on Xbox, PS5, and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
