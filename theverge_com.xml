With <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/798848/pokemon-legends-za-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> behind us and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/876285/pokemon-pokopia-hands-on-preview"><em>Pokémon Pokopia</em></a> right around the corner, chances are high that we’re finally going to get some new information about the franchise’s next mainline game. But there’s also a chance that we’ll see more from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/620196/pokemon-champions-online-pokemon-battles-nintendo-switch-mobile"><em>Pokémon Champions</em></a> and hear about updates for other spin-off games like <em>Pokémon Unite</em>, <em>TCG Pocket, </em>and <em>Pokémon Sleep.</em></p><p>In addition to announcing the next Presents stream, <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/the-pokemon-firered-version-and-pokemon-leafgreen-version-games-are-releasing-on-nintendo-switch?cid=&amp;utm_source=tw&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=vg&amp;utm_term=frlgnswitch">Nintendo also revealed today</a> that <em>Pokémon FireRed / LeafGreen </em>— which originally released for the Game Boy Advance in 2004 — will be coming to the Nintendo Switch family of consoles via the eShop next week (note: they won’t be available as part of the Switch Online subscription). The rereleased games don’t seem to feature any significant changes from their original versions. But they will be available to download as soon as next week’s Pokémon Presents concludes, and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260220159643/en/Nintendo-News-Pokmon-FireRed-Version-and-Pokmon-LeafGreen-Version-Are-Coming-to-Nintendo-Switch-in-Multiple-Languages">Nintendo also says</a> that the game will be “available at select retailers launch week for a suggested retail price of $19.99.”</p><p>The <em>FireRed / LeafGreen </em>news seems like the sort of surprise Nintendo and The Pokémon Company might have wanted to keep under wraps until the Presents stream. But this could easily be a sign that next week’s presentation is going to be packed with so much new info that the companies wanted to get the small stuff out of the way well in advance.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTE="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Charles Pulliam-Moore</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/881332/nintendo-pokemon-presents-pokemon-day]]></content:encoded>
