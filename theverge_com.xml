            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/662440/xbox-handheld-photos-microsoft-asus-rog-ally-2-fcc-listing<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/dominic-preston">Dominic Preston</a> <span>is a news editor with over a decade’s experience in journalism. He previously worked at <em>Android Police</em> and <em>Tech Advisor</em>.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The first photos of the Asus ROG Ally 2 have surfaced online thanks to regulatory listings, but with a twist: there are two versions of the gaming handheld, and one features a dedicated Xbox button.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/628073/microsoft-xbox-handheld-project-kennan-notepad">We reported two months ago</a> that Microsoft was working with Asus to develop an Xbox-branded handheld codenamed “Project Kennan,” and this appears to be it. It’s a black version of the otherwise almost identical white ROG Ally 2, with a small button in the top-left corner bearing an engraved Xbox logo. That button is blacked out on the regular ROG, though will likely be replaced or removed in its production version.</p><p><a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/id/hub/asus-rog-ally-2-diduga-segera-rilis-di-indonesia-dapat-sertifikat-sdppi-postel/"><em>91mobiles</em></a> found listings for the ROG Ally 2 at the Indonesian certificate, and <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-rog-ally-2-and-rog-ally-2-xbox-edition-gaming-handhelds-leaked"><em>VideoCardz</em></a> linked those to an <a href="https://device.report/fccid/msq-mt7922a12l">FCC listing</a> for the Wi-Fi module included in the two devices, which includes photos of the hardware. That listing also reveals some limited specs, which include a 7-inch, 120Hz LCD display — about the same as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review">the first generation</a> — with an 8-core, 36W AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme CPU included in the Xbox edition, and a less powerful 4-core, 20W chip in the white version.</p><p>The design has also been altered, with more molded controller grips on each edge, rather than the blocky, sloped design of the ROG Ally. That leaves the hardware as a whole looking thicker than before, but perhaps it’ll be more comfortable to hold.</p><p>With certification already under way, it’s likely that a release is around the corner. Asus often launches hardware at Computex, which begins on May 20th — just one day after Microsoft’s own Build conference begins on May 19th.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/662200/elden-ring-movie-nexus-point-news-be-careful<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>On Tuesday, a publication called <em>Nexus Point News</em> published a headline for what looked to be a major piece of entertainment news: “EXCLUSIVE: Alex Garland Set To Direct ‘Elden Ring’ Film For A24.” The article claimed that <em>Elden Ring</em> “is expected to be Garland’s next film” and that shooting is expected to start in 2026.</p><p>But don’t get your hopes up: soon after the article was published, <em>Nexus Point News</em> pulled it, and the publication won’t say why. How this article made the rounds is an interesting case study in the way news travels on the internet.</p><p>We first saw the <em>Nexus Point News</em> article from a Wario64 post on X. Generally, Wario64 is a great account to follow to see breaking news in video games almost as soon as it happens. And the account is quite popular, with more than 1 million followers on X. But none of us at <em>The Verge</em> had ever heard of <em>Nexus Point News</em>, let alone recognized it as a place that reliably breaks entertainment news, so something didn’t seem right.</p><p>(Another recent <em>Nexus Point News</em> “exclusive” includes a potential cast member “being eyed” <a href="https://www.nexuspointnews.com/post/exclusive-dacre-montgomery-is-being-eyed-to-join-star-wars-starfighter">for one of the male leads</a> of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/651695/star-wars-starfighter-date-ryan-gosling"><em>Star Wars: Starfighter</em></a>, but the article includes an update that says “a LucasFilm spokesperson has denied this reporting.”)</p><p>So I messaged Wario64, asking why he reposted it. He said that the person who posted a thread on the gaming forum ResetEra claimed the site was reliable and that “I guess I’m sharing cause I too think it’s absurd lol.”</p><p>That thread appears to be <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/alex-garland-set-to-direct-%E2%80%98elden-ring%E2%80%99-film-for-a24.1182474/">this one</a>, where the poster says, in a reply to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/alex-garland-set-to-direct-%E2%80%98elden-ring%E2%80%99-film-for-a24.1182474/#post-139592964">somebody asking</a> “bro what the fuck is this source lmaooo,” <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/alex-garland-set-to-direct-%E2%80%98elden-ring%E2%80%99-film-for-a24.1182474/#post-139593192">that</a> “Nexus point news is pretty reliable, they are breaking more and more news before the traditional trades.”</p><p>Soon after, I refreshed the <em>Nexus Point News</em> story and saw that it had been taken down. I told Wario64 that we were looking into the story on our end and about its removal. Soon after, Wario64 posted <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1919831651968024694">about the removal</a> and deleted the original tweet.</p><p>Then, I emailed <em>Nexus Point News’</em> press line to see if somebody could say what was going on. Demet Koc, the publication’s editor-in-chief, replied two minutes later but declined to comment.</p><p>A24’s Sophia Shin also declined to comment on the record.</p><p>The possibility of an <em>Elden Ring </em>adaptation seems likely. FromSoftware said in early 2022 that it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/16/22981060/fromsoftware-elden-ring-franchise-intellectual-properties-future-expansion">hoped to</a> expand the franchise “beyond the realm of games.” George R.R. Martin, who provided <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22643950/elden-ring-preview-fromsoftware-george-rr-martin">the “mythos”</a> for the world of <em>Elden Ring</em>, hinted <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/1/24189979/george-r-r-martin-on-a-potential-elden-ring-adaptation">last year</a> that some kind of adaptation might be in the works. And FromSoftware is about to release <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a>, a multiplayer-focused spinoff, so announcing a film around now would make some sense. But for the moment, there’s nothing official about an <em>Elden Ring</em> movie.</p><p>A ResetEra admin locked the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/alex-garland-set-to-direct-%E2%80%98elden-ring%E2%80%99-film-for-a24.1182474/page-2#post-139593882">thread</a> about the article and another one. “For a site no one’s heard of, they sure have a lot of exclusives,” <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexus-point-news-alex-garland-set-to-direct-%E2%80%98elden-ring%E2%80%99-film-for-a24.1182531/#post-139593768">the admin said</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
