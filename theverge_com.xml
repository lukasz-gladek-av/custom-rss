            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/624423/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review-benchmarks-price<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia’s dominance over the latest generation of graphics cards ends today. AMD might have surrendered the high end of the GPU market, but its new $549 Radeon RX 9070 and $599 RX 9070 XT look set to bring Nvidia back to reality, at least in the midrange. </p><p>After a disappointing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/623441/nvidia-rtx-5070-review-test-benchmark">$549 RTX 5070</a>, a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/verge/posts/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-review-a-cheaper-rtx-4080/1022046466451493/">$749 RTX 5070 Ti</a> that’s near impossible to buy for anything less than $899, and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">$1,999 RTX 5090</a> whose only competition is other Nvidia cards, AMD’s next-gen GPUs look perfectly timed and deliver on performance and price. </p><p>The RX 9070 is around 17 percent faster than Nvidia’s RTX 5070 in 4K without upscaling enabled, cruising past Nvidia’s card for the same price. The RX 9070 XT is as fast as the RTX 5070 Ti for $150 less.</p><p>Pricing is key with these cards, particularly as <a href="https://www.jonpeddie.com/news/q324-pc-graphics-add-in-board-shipments-decreased-14-5-from-last-quarter/">only 10 percent</a> of GPU sales right now are from AMD. The company needs a big win with its latest generation of cards if it wants to regain ground from Nvidia, and the RX 9070 series might be just what the GPU market needs.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->549</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>16GB of VRAM</li><li>FSR 4 image quality improvements</li><li>Lower power draw than previous Radeon cards</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>No AMD reference design</li><li>Big and bulky card</li></ul></div></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->598</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>The $599 price tag</li><li>FSR 4 image quality improvements</li><li>Lower power draw than previous Radeon cards</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>I wish it had a little more VRAM</li><li>No AMD reference design</li><li>Big and bulky card</li></ul></div></div></div><div><p id="hardware"><h2>Hardware</h2></p></div><p>AMD hasn’t created reference cards for the RX 9070 series, so the end result is designs from add-in board partners that look very similar to the ones used for previous generations of Radeon GPUs. The Gigabyte RX 9070 I’ve been testing is longer and bulkier than the RTX 5070.</p><p>The XFX 9070 XT I’ve been testing is also a 3.5-slot card, so it takes up far more space in a case than the two-slot RTX 5080 or 5090 Founders Edition or even the 2.5-slot RTX 5070 Ti card I reviewed. I far prefer the reference designs AMD has used in the past, and the RX 9070-series cards are big and bulky in comparison. AMD has also stuck to using two 8-pin PCIe power connectors with the RX 9070 series, instead of switching to 12VHPWR. It does mean you’ll need to run two PCIe connectors to both the RX 9070 and 9070 XT, but you won’t need to worry about PSU compatibility or the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/609207/nvidia-rtx-5090-power-connector-melting-burning-issues">risk of a 12VHPWR connector melting</a>.</p><p>Both the RX 9070 and 9070 XT ship with 16GB of VRAM, which is a good amount at these prices. Nvidia only has 12GB of VRAM on its $549 RTX 5070, so you’re certainly getting more value from a $549 RX 9070 here — especially if you’re looking at 4K gaming where VRAM demands are higher.</p><div><p id="1440p-and-4k-benchmarks"><h2><strong>1440p and 4K benchmarks</strong></h2></p></div><div><div><p id="test-machine"><h2>Test machine:</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>CPU:</strong> AMD Ryzen 9 9800X3D</span></li><li><span><strong>CPU cooler:</strong> Corsair H150i Elite LCD</span></li><li><span><strong>Motherboard:</strong> Gigabyte Aorus Master</span></li><li><span><strong>RAM:</strong> 32GB G.Skill DDR5-6000</span></li><li><span><strong>Storage:</strong> Samsung 970 Evo Plus 2TB</span></li><li><span><strong>PSU: </strong>Corsair HX1000W</span></li><li><span><strong>Case: </strong>Streacom BC1 V2 open benchtable</span></li></ul></div></div><p>I’ve been testing AMD’s RX 9070 and 9070 XT cards with an AMD Ryzen 9 9800X3D processor and Asus’ 32-inch 4K OLED PG32UCDP. I’ve put the RX 9070 and 9070 XT up against Nvidia’s RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti as well as its existing RX 7900 XT and XTX GPUs. </p><p>I’ve tested a variety of games at both 1440p and 4K, including more demanding titles like <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> and benchmarking favorites like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>. All games have been tested at very high or ultra settings, and I enabled ray tracing in some titles like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Metro Exodus</em> to see what AMD’s latest GPUs can deliver there.</p><p>The RX 9070 comfortably beats Nvidia’s RTX 5070 at both 4K and 1440p. It’s 17 percent faster at 4K and nearly 20 percent faster at 1440p. It’s not even close. In some games, like <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, the RX 9070 is more than 30 percent faster, with or without FSR enabled.</p><p>The $599 RX 9070 XT competes with Nvidia’s $749 RTX 5070 Ti, with an average frame rate difference of less than 1 percent without upscaling across the nine games we tested. The differences between these two cards really come down to the individual games, with the RX 9070 XT less than 5 percent behind the RTX 5070 Ti in titles like <em>Returnal </em>and <em>Metro Exodus Enhanced</em>.</p><div><p>The RX 9070 comfortably beats Nvidia’s RTX 5070 at both 4K and 1440p</p></div><p>The RX 9070 XT isn’t that far behind AMD’s previous flagship, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499697/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xt-xtx-review-benchmarks-price">$999 RX 7900 XTX</a>, either. I found the XTX was less than 2 percent faster at 4K and 1440p tests without upscaling enabled. That’s a small performance gap, considering the price differences between these cards.</p><p>I think the RX 9070 makes the most sense at 1440p, and the RX 9070 XT is definitely worth the extra $50 if you want to move to 4K gaming. Considering the small price gap, it’s worth paying the extra $50 for better 1440p performance, too. </p><div><p id="fsr-4-and-rdna-4"><h2><strong>FSR 4 and RDNA 4</strong></h2></p></div><p>AMD’s 9000-series GPUs are built on top of the company’s RDNA 4 architecture, which AMD says offers twice the rasterization graphics performance per compute unit as RDNA 2. This new architecture also includes improvements to boost ray-tracing performance.</p><p>In <em>Metro Exodus Enhanced</em> with ultra ray tracing enabled, the RX 9070 XT is nearly 7 percent faster than the RX 7900 XTX, but it’s 4 percent behind the RTX 5070 Ti. Nvidia still reigns supreme in <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>at 4K with ray tracing and upscaling enabled, though, with the RTX 5070 Ti 16 percent ahead of the RX 9070 XT.</p><p>The RDNA 4 architecture also includes a new version of AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) upscaling, which now uses dedicated AI accelerator hardware to improve frame rates and image quality — much like Nvidia’s DLSS. FSR 4 is exclusive to these new RX 9070 graphics cards, and it works in all games that have FSR 3.1 integrated. All you have to do is flick a switch in the AMD software, and FSR 4 will be enabled automatically in supported games.</p><p>With FSR 4, AMD hasn’t followed Nvidia with Multi Frame Generation, instead focusing on improving image quality in upscaled games. I tested FSR 4 in both <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </em>and <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>The FSR 4 changes are more obvious in </em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6<em>.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>In <em>Black Ops 6</em>, the advances are immediately obvious. The current FSR 3.1 implementation often results in a more soft or blurry image, which is especially noticeable in text on walls or objects that are slightly further away. FSR 4 makes the overall image look a lot sharper and, in some cases, even better than the native 4K output. A police car has a blurry numberplate and logo in FSR 3.1 quality mode. But in FSR 4 quality, it’s upscaled correctly, and the entire car looks a lot sharper as a result. Details on buildings are also more clear, and even enemies look more detailed in motion with FSR 4. And this all comes without a noticeable performance hit, which is great. </p><p>The FSR 4 improvements are less obvious in <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>, and I struggled to notice any difference between FSR 3.1 quality and FSR 4 quality modes. While this might suggest your mileage may vary with FSR 4 quality, I was able to use ultra performance FSR 4 and get surprisingly good visual quality and higher frame rates from the game.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>You have to look really closely at rocks to notice FSR 4 improvements in </em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered<em>.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Beyond gaming, the RX 9070 cards are both a lot more capable for AI workloads. In Procyon’s AI XL (FP16) test, the RX 9070 XT is more than 40 percent faster than the RX 7900 XTX, but it’s around 20 percent behind the AI performance of the RTX 5070. The RX 9070 is also more than 40 percent faster in the AI XL test over the RX 7900 XT, but the RTX 5070 is nearly 40 percent faster in this AI workload test.</p><p>I normally test video editing capabilities with PugetBench’s DaVinci Resolve benchmark, but it gets around 20 percent into the test and crashes on AMD’s GPUs.</p><div><p id="power-draw-and-heat"><h2><strong>Power draw and heat</strong></h2></p></div><p>It’s great to see AMD lower power supply requirements and power draw on its latest Radeon GPUs. AMD recommends a 750-watt power supply for the RX 9070 XT, for its 304 watts of total board power. I’ve found it delivers performance close to the RX 7900 XTX while using 40 watts less power at 4K. The 9070 XT averaged at 303 watts during my tests, while the 7900 XTX averaged 346 watts.</p><p>It’s the same story for the RX 9070. AMD recommends a 650-watt power supply for this card, 100 watts less than the 750-watt recommendation for the 7900 XT. In my tests, the RX 9070 averaged 244 watts, while the 7900 XT averaged more than 25 percent more power draw at 307 watts. That’s a big efficiency improvement, and it’s only 34 more watts of power draw than the RTX 5070 for a noticeable performance gap between these two $549 cards.</p><p>The RX 9070 also hit a maximum temperature of 60 degrees Celsius in my open testbench, compared to 70C for the RX 7900 XT. The RX 9070 XT reached just 55C in my testing, compared to 71C for the RX 7900 XTX. Nvidia’s RTX 5070 Founders Edition card reached 77C in the same tests, with MSI’s Ventus 3 RTX 5070 Ti reaching 68C. </p><p>AMD’s latest generation of Radeon GPUs are more efficient and run cooler than its previous generation, and they also run cooler than Nvidia’s direct competitors. That’s a clear win for AMD.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Nvidia’s new GPUs are big and bulky compared to Nvidia’s sleek Founders Edition cards.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>AMD has priced its RX 9070-series cards really aggressively, particularly with the $599 RX 9070 XT being $150 cheaper than the RTX 5070 Ti. The $549 RX 9070 is the same price as Nvidia’s RTX 5070, but it beats the 5070 in every game I’ve tested, sometimes by a big margin.</p><p>If AMD manages to have these cards in stock at these prices, then it’s going to shake up the important midrange of the GPU market.</p><p>The question is whether it can chip away at Nvidia’s dominance. In addition to (or because of) its 90 percent market share, Nvidia also has an advantage in how many more games support DLSS than FSR. And DLSS is so popular that 80 percent of RTX owners <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/15/24344212/nvidias-dlss-is-surprisingly-popular">activate it in games</a>. FSR 4 improves image quality to compete more closely with DLSS, but AMD still needs game developers to implement it. Nvidia lets you simply force DLSS 4 in games, so you don’t need to wait on developers at all.</p><p>The stickiness of DLSS could tempt PC gamers to spend a little more to stay with Nvidia, and I haven’t seen enough from FSR 4 yet to know whether it can compete with the upscaling improvements Nvidia made with DLSS 4.</p><p>Nvidia’s Game Ready Drivers are also an advantage; the company works with developers to optimize drivers for games before they launch, whereas AMD has long had driver issues with a variety of games. I haven’t run into any issues while testing the RX 9070 series, but I can’t promise that will be the case when new games are released. While AMD says it has been working hard on improving its drivers, only time will tell.</p><p>Either way, AMD’s RX 9070-series cards are a clear indication that it’s not giving the entire GPU market to Nvidia. It’s willing to compete on performance and price, and that’s a winning formula if AMD manages to keep those prices under control.</p><p><em>Photography by Tom Warren / The Verge</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
