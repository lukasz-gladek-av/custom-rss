            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/660815/nintendo-lawsuit-genki-switch-2-accessories<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/wes-davis">Wes Davis</a> <span>is a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Earlier this year, accessory maker Genki showed off a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">3D-printed mockup</a> it said was based on the Nintendo Switch 2’s official dimensions just days before the console’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">first official reveal</a>. The company has since started offering Switch 2 accessories that it says will be compatible with the system at launch. Now, Nintendo is suing the company, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/nintendo-lawsuit-against-genki-switch-2-mockups-ces-2025/">reports <em>The Game Post</em></a>.</p><p>Filed May 2nd, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015.1.0.pdf">Nintendo’s complaint</a> alleges that Genki is guilty of five counts of “trademark infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising,” and that its actions violated multiple laws, including the Trademark Act of 1946. It claims that Genki’s use of Nintendo’s trademarks is confusing to buyers, who are “likely to impute any shortcomings, defects, or lack of quality in Genki’s products to Nintendo” itself.</p><p>Nintendo’s lawyers write that although Genki has promoted its products as compatible with the Switch 2 at launch, it has been inconsistent about whether their designs are truly based on unofficial access to the console itself. Nevertheless, they claim customers will probably think the products are Nintendo-authorized, and that Genki is “taking advantage of the trust and loyalty that Nintendo fans have for the Nintendo brand and mark and causing actionable harm.”</p><p>Nintendo asks that the court require Genki to stop selling products marketed with Nintendo’s trademarks, and for compensation for any damages Nintendo sustained from the the alleged offenses, and more.</p><div><p>Genki addresses the lawsuit in a statement <a href="https://x.com/GenkiThings/status/1918852177046737231">posted to X</a>, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-began-working-on-switch-2-shortly-after-the-release-of-switch-1-new-genki-lawsuit-papers-reveal"><em>Eurogamer</em> spotted</a>:</p></div><div><blockquote><p>You may have seen that Nintendo recently filed a lawsuit against us. We’re taking it seriously and working with legal counsel to respond thoughtfully.</p><p>What we can say is this: Genki has always been an independent company focused on building innovative gaming accessories for the community we love. We’re proud of the work we’ve done, and we stand by the quality and originality of our products.</p><p>While we can’t comment in detail, we’re continuing preparations to fulfill orders and showcase our newest products at PAX East this week.</p><p>We’re grateful for the overwhelming support we’ve received so far. We’ll share more when we can, but for now, we’re staying focused on doing what we do best: building gear for gamers. —Team Genki</p></blockquote></div><p>Genki isn’t the only company that unveiled accessories for the Switch 2 before Nintendo officially revealed it. Dbrand announced a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">Switch 2 case</a> in December, and before that, smaller accessory makers announced things like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">screen protectors</a>. These sorts of early accessory announcements aren’t unusual in the world of smartphones, where case makers turn to leaked specifications to make risky bets <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23892671/iphone-15-pro-action-button-case-maker-problems">that don’t always pan out</a>. But for Nintendo, Genki at least seems to have crossed a line that it simply isn’t willing to tolerate.</p><p>Nintendo did not immediately respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shotgun-cop-man-is-a-weird-as-hell-platformer-about-arresting-satan.1180722/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/660272/shotgun-cop-man-review-pc-switch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Shotgun Cop Man</em> is a strange platformer. You play as a square man with a round, bald head who’s chasing Satan to arrest him. At the beginning of each of the game’s nine worlds, Satan gives you the middle finger. And you don’t just use guns for fighting, but for traversal as well.</p><p>You start each world with two guns: a rapid-fire but weak pistol and a more powerful shotgun that only has three blasts. When you’re on the ground, your ammo constantly refills, meaning you essentially have infinite ammo. But when you’re in the air, if you run out of bullets, you won’t get a refill until you touch the ground.</p><p>This all matters because there’s no jump button. That means you get into the air by shooting your guns: the pistol lets you hover, while the shotgun can rocket you upward to reach high platforms. You can aim in any direction, so the shotgun can blast you backward and forward, too — it’s a speedy and fun way to get around. It’s all a little bit like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/15/9538815/downwell-hp-lovecraft-game-iphone-steam">Downwell</a></em>, but sideways.</p><p>You’ll need to get around quickly to dodge Satan’s minions. Most often, you’ll take on little devils that spit bullets and are generally a nuisance. But there are a few more difficult enemies, such as flying sentient saws with one eye. There are bosses at the end of each world, too, like a flying skull with horns that can manifest a body to attack you with.</p><p>If you get hit by an enemy or stung by a spike, your heart will fly a short distance away from your body. If you get the heart back, you’ll survive another hit and the heart will float away again. It’s similar to a <em>Sonic</em> game, where you can take a hit so long as you have at least one ring. If you’re hit while your heart is out, you’ll die — though thanks to the game’s generous checkpoint system, you usually won’t start too far from where you were killed.</p><p>Each world has 17 short levels that are filled with typical platforming dangers including baddies, spikes, moving platforms, lasers, and block pushing puzzles. (Block shooting puzzles?) Individual levels generally take 30 seconds to a couple minutes to beat, so depending on how skillful you are with your guns, you can zip to the goal quickly and feel like a speedrunner.</p><p>You’ll frequently find new guns, too. I was a big fan of one that made bullets bounce off walls, which doubled as a useful puzzle-solving tool. The sniper rifle was a welcome upgrade because it could blast through multiple enemies at once.</p><p>Visually, the game looks like a platformer in dark mode: black is the primary color, and enemies are generally a shade of red. Throughout the game, you’ll hear a persistent, thumping, and unnerving soundtrack that sounds like what you’d hear at some kind of Satan-worshipping club. The whole vibe makes you feel as if you’re actually descending into the pits of some dark hell.</p><p>My favorite part of the game was that you could accomplish a lot in a short amount of time. My full playthrough was about three and a half hours, and I could get through most of the nine worlds in about 20 or 30 minutes. I appreciated the brevity, because even though I very much enjoyed the game, the intentionally uncomfortable atmosphere got under my skin, and I could only play it in short bursts.</p><p>Once you understand how to navigate just with <em>Shotgun Cop Man’s</em> guns, you can really fly around the levels like some kind of cartoony action hero. By the end, you’ll use those guns to give the finger right back to Satan.</p><p><em><sub>Shotgun Cop Man is now available on PC and Nintendo Switch.</sub></em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
