It was already down to six <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23953640/sony-pushes-back-its-live-service-game-ambitions">by the end of 2023</a>, before the well-received launch of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337875/sony-playstation-horizon-zero-dawn-helldivers-2-ghosts-of-tsushima-movie-tv-show"><em>Helldivers II</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234909/sony-concord-ps5-shutdown-poor-sales-launch-pc">the disaster that was <em>Concord </em></a>in 2024. Now, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects"><em>Bloomberg’s</em> Jason Schreier has confirmed</a> with Sony that two unannounced live service projects have been canceled.</p></div><p>One was from <em>Syphon Filter</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18514683/days-gone-review-ps4-open-world-zombie-game"><em>Days Gone</em></a> developer Bend Games, while Schreier <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lfvfm2febc2e">reports</a> the other shuttered title was a live-service <em>God of War </em>game that Bluepoint Games “has been working on for the last couple of years.”</p><p>Bluepoint Games is one of several developers Sony <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22665426/sony-buys-bluepoint-games-remake-remaster-demons-souls-shadow-ico-uncharted">acquired in recent years</a> as it was building up a queue of live service projects, with many ports and remasters under its belt, including <em>Demon’s Souls</em>, the first three <em>Uncharted </em>games, <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>, and others. Now, Schreier says the studios won’t close, but there’s no word yet on what their next projects will be. </p><p>The live service approach to gaming once seemed wide open following the success of <em>Fortnite </em>and other titles, but games like <em>Concord</em>, <em>Anthem</em>, and <em>Redfall </em>have shown how difficult it can be. At Sony alone, the list of canceled service titles <em>Bloomberg </em>has already reported on included the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-22/playstation-employees-at-insomniac-studio-fear-identity-theft-after-massive-hack">Spider-Man game</a> revealed by the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/19/24007570/insomniac-games-hack-wolverine-x-men-ryhsida">Insomniac ransomware breach</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-27/sony-cuts-900-jobs-in-gaming-shuts-down-london-division"><em>Twisted Metal</em></a>, and a Destiny-linked game <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-02/sony-s-bungie-maker-of-halo-and-destiny-faces-reckoning-after-mass-layoff">from Bungie</a> called <em>Payback. </em></p><p>However, we’re still expecting to hear more about Bungie’s revived <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23735830/bungie-marathon-sci-fi-pvp-extraction-shooter"><em>Marathon</em></a><em> </em>extraction shooter and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23732791/fairgames-playstation-showcase-ps5-sony-haven-studios"><em>Fairgames</em></a>, a PvP heist title from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/21/22989187/sony-playstation-haven-studios-acquisition-jade-raymond-new-multiplayer-game">Haven Studios</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
