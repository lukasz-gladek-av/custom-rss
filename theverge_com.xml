            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24290671/sega-classic-games-delisted<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega is planning to delist a lot of its classic games from digital storefronts as of December 6th at 11:59PM PT.</p><p>Steam will be affected the most, losing 62 titles including <em>Crazy Taxi</em>, <em>Dr. Robotnik’s Mean Bean Machine</em>, <em>Jet Set Radio, NiGHTS into Dreams, </em>and<em> Sonic 3D Blast.</em> Sega is pulling 12 titles from the Xbox store. The Nintendo eShop and the PlayStation Store will “just” lose <em>SEGA Genesis Classics — </em>but that title includes more than 50 old Genesis games, so it still means a lot will be unavailable. You can see the full lists of what’s getting pulled on <a href="https://support.sega.com/hc/en-us/articles/29776767664145-SEGA-Classics-FAQ#h_01JBWBD2TRQDGP79RFEAY1YVBZ">a Sega support page</a>.</p><p>Any games that you have purchased will still be available to download and play after they’re delisted from the storefronts, so if you’ve had your eye on any of them, you might want to buy them before they’re gone.</p><p>The delistings are happening ahead of Sega’s planned reboots for <em>Jet Set Radio</em>,&nbsp;<em>Shinobi</em>, <em>Golden Axe</em>,&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi</em>, but those revivals aren’t expected <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2023/12/7/23992993/sega-is-bringing-back-some-classics">anytime soon</a>. And it wouldn’t be the first time Sega has delisted games ahead of releasing them in a different form: the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/26/23043398/sega-pulls-classic-sonic-the-hedgehog-games-digital-stores-origins">pulled the vast majority of classic <em>Sonic</em> games</a> from digital stores&nbsp;before it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/20/23033583/sonic-origins-sega-hedgehog-ps5-xbox">launched <em>Sonic Origins</em></a>.</p><p>Hopefully, the games getting removed in December will be available to buy again at some point down the line — keeping video game classics alive <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23850347/video-game-preservation">is already hard enough</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24290596/mass-effect-tv-show-amazon-fallout<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After its success with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126474/fallout-review-amazon-prime-video"><em>Fallout</em></a> and the recently released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24278893/amazon-like-a-dragon-yakuza-prime-tv"><em>Like A Dragon: Yakuza</em> show</a>, <em>Mass Effect</em> is the next game Amazon wants to adapt. According to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/mass-effect-tv-series-amazon-writer-marvel-1236203755/"><em>Variety</em></a>, a show based on BioWare’s military space opera RPG is officially in production at Amazon MGM Studios. <em>Variety</em> has reported that <em>F9: The Fast Saga </em>writer Daniel Casey has signed on to write the show with BioWare producer Mike Gamble serving as executive produce along with Ari Arad.</p><p>Though BioWare released the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22256806/mass-effect-legendary-edition-pc-ps4-xbox-one-mac-walters-release-date"><em>Mass Effect Legendary Edition</em></a> — a collection of the first three games updated for modern consoles — back in 2021, the <em>Mass Effect</em> series hasn’t had an original entry since the release of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/20/14961928/mass-effect-andromeda-review-xbox-ps4-pc"><em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em></a> back in 2017. After <em>Andromeda</em>, BioWare released <em>Anthem</em>, a live-service action game that was significant departure from the studio’s tradition of making single-player, story-driven RPGs. In 2020, BioWare announced that a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168973/mass-effect-returns-teaser-trailer-game-awards-2020"><em>Mass Effect</em> game was in-development</a>.</p><p>News of a <em>Mass Effec</em>t TV show comes on what is known as N7 Day, a semi-official, fan-created holiday that celebrates all things <em>Mass Effect</em>. On previous N7 Days, BioWare has teased information about the next game in the series including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23951253/mass-effect-5-helmets-confirmed">a trailer that possibly suggested the return of fan-favorite protagonist Commander Shepard</a> whose story ended with the original trilogy. Though no story details have been revealed about the show, it’s a pretty safe bet to guess it’ll focus on the Commander and I personally can’t wait to see <em>her.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
