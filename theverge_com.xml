            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324626/balatro-localthunk-18-plus-rating-europe-pegi<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The creator of the poker roguelike <em>Balatro</em>, who goes by the alias LocalThunk, has been sharing some frustrations over the game’s 18-plus rating in Europe.</p><p>“Since PEGI gave us an 18-plus rating for having evil playing cards maybe I should add microtransactions / loot boxes / real gambling to lower that rating to 3-plus like <em>EA Sports FC,</em>” <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1868142749108797590">LocalThunk posted on X over the weekend</a>.</p><p><em>Balatro’s</em> 18-plus rating isn’t new. The game was originally rated 3-plus, but shortly after its February launch, PEGI bumped it up to 18-plus, as spelled out at the time <a href="https://x.com/PlaystackGames/status/1763614758043795909">by Playstack</a>, <em>Balatro’s</em> publisher. The game was briefly delisted from “a number of digital stores in some countries” as a result.</p><p>According to <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=balatro&amp;op=Search&amp;age%5B%5D=&amp;descriptor%5B%5D=&amp;publisher=&amp;platform%5B%5D=&amp;release_year%5B%5D=&amp;page=1&amp;form_build_id=form-UHS_qJPR8y3wmOQu29CLnMnZt4aDd3pN6XBAA02hku8&amp;form_id=pegi_search_form">PEGI’s page for <em>Balatro</em></a>, the rating was given because the game “features prominent gambling imagery.” PEGI also spells out the following “content specific issues”: </p><div><blockquote><p>This game teaches — by way of images, information and gameplay — skills and knowledge that are used in poker. During gameplay, the player is rewarded with ‘chips’ for playing certain hands. The player is able to access a list of poker hand names. As the player hovers over these poker hands, the game explains what types of cards the player would need in order to play certain hands. As the game goes on, the player becomes increasingly familiar with which hands would earn more points. Because these are hands that exist in the real world, this knowledge and skill could be transferred to a real-life game of poker.</p></blockquote></div><p>While it’s true that the game does feature poker imagery and poker hands that a player could translate into an actual game of poker, it’s worth noting that <em>Balatro</em> doesn’t actually have any gambling as part of playing the game. (LocalThunk has even <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1820752209765961746">stipulated in their will</a> that <em>Balatro</em> can’t be sold or licensed to a gambling company.)</p><p>Games like <em>EA Sports FC</em> include in-game purchases <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/fifa/fut-packs-explained">with randomized content</a>, which is what LocalThunk takes issue with. “I’m way more irked at the 3-plus for these games with actual gambling mechanics for children than I am about <em>Balatro</em> having an 18-plus rating,” <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1868540666869121033">he said on Sunday</a>.</p><p>LocalThunk <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/localthunk.bsky.social/post/3ldmanyal7k2d">said Wednesday</a> that they attempted to discuss <em>Balatro’s</em> rating with PEGI, but “they do not see anything wrong <em>Balatro</em> being rated 18-plus, nor with <em>EA Sports FC</em> (and similar games) having a 3-plus rating.” PEGI was “blaming EU laws, blaming storefronts, waiting for the future,” LocalThunk said.</p><p>PEGI didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324594/intel-performance-arrow-lake-core-ultra-200s-cpus<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Intel’s new Arrow Lake CPUs came out in October promising high performance at lower power levels, but reviews, including ours, noted surprisingly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278407/intel-ultra-9-285k-benchmarks-performance-hands-on">lackluster gaming performance</a>. Tom Warren said of the Core Ultra 9 285K, “...in many titles, it provides worse performance than the 14th Gen chips it was designed to replace.”</p><div><p>Now, <a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Field-Update-1-of-2-Intel-Core-Ultra-200S-Series-Performance/post/1650490">the troubled chipmaker says</a> it has been gradually releasing updates that fixed most of the issues it identified, as <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intels-arrow-lake-performance-fix-is-now-available-another-update-coming-next-month">reported earlier by <em>Tom’s Hardware</em></a>.</p></div><p>“At the end of the day, there were four root issues that we needed to address, and fixes for those are actually already in the field right now,” Robert Hallock, Intel’s VP and GM of client AI and technical marketing said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6rwTGJTcOQ">during an interview with <em>HotHardware</em></a>. “They’ve been coming out over the last two weeks or so in drips and drabs, as update schedules allow.”</p><p>One issue stemmed from a “mistimed” update that was supposed to optimize Windows’ processor power management (PPM) system for Intel’s Core Ultra 200S-series processors. (PPM adjusts the performance of a CPU based on the current power plan, such as Balanced, High Performance, Power Saver, etc). </p><p>Instead of releasing the PPM update before reviewers got their hands on the processors, Intel says it scheduled the update to go out when it became widely available, which may have caused reviewers to see worse-than-expected performance. Due to the missing PPM update, Intel’s performance-boosting Application Performance Optimizer (APO) also couldn’t take effect in games, while “misconfigured” performance settings also had a negative impact on reviewers’ benchmarks.</p><p>A fix was already applied for these issues in&nbsp;Windows 11 build 26100.2161. Intel also says Epic Games resolved a driver compatibility issue <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24h2#3448msgdesc">causing the blue screen of death</a> when running games with Easy Anti-Cheat, such as <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>.</p><p>Intel is planning to release another set of performance upgrades for Arrow Lake CPUs in January, and it will “provide a comprehensive performance update” at CES. For now, Intel recommends updating Windows and applying the latest BIOS update to your motherboard if you haven’t already. Otherwise, you can wait until the “final” performance update next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
