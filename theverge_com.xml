            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284707/playdate-season-2-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025390/playdate-handheld-portable-gaming-console-review">the Playdate first launched</a>, one of the hooks was that the little yellow handheld came with a “season” of 24 games from notable developers like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21025916/keita-takahashi-interview-wattam-katamari">Keita Takahashi</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24283527/puzzmo-weather-memoku">Zach Gage</a>. And now Panic has confirmed that a second season is coming at some point in 2025.</p><p>As for what will be included, we don’t have a lot to go on right now. Panic says that “details on price, the exact number of games, and the developers behind the games of season 2 will come in 2025.” But during a livestream today, the company said it would probably feature “about a dozen games” and will also include a “really cool surprise.”</p><p>Last year Panic launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/7/23627413/playdate-catalog-store-launch-date-best-games">a Playdate store called Catalog</a> where developers could release games outside of the season structure, and during today’s presentation the company said that the shop had surpassed 200 available games. We also got a glimpse at some titles in development, including the adorable word game <em>Bwirds</em> (launching November 26th), a grappling hook-powered platformer called <em>Owlet’s Embrace </em>(later 2025), the cozy puzzle adventure <em>Comet </em>(listed as coming soon), and the self-explanatory <em>Office Chair Curling</em> (also coming soon).</p><p>You can check out the full presentation for more on these games:</p><p>There’s also some good news on the hardware front: Panic said that the hard-to-find handheld is available to order now with an expected shipping date of December.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
