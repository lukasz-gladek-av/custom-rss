One of the screenshots listed in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nintendo-today/id6736725704">App Store</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.nintendo.znsa" rel="sponsored">Google Play</a> shows a Switch 2, and <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-today-app-promo-image-reveals-the-marking-on-the-switch-2s-c-button/">as<em> VGC </em>pointed out</a>, features a “C” label on the right-side Joy-Con’s new button for the first time.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Nintendo (App Store)</cite></p></div><p>The Switch 2 images and teaser clips revealed by Nintendo until now have carefully hidden the labeling on that button, even though it’s been referred to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">in earlier leaks</a>. We still don’t know exactly what it does, although <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24344718/nintendo-switch-2-specs-date-price-launch-games-mario-kart#:~:text=What%20does%20that%20new%20button%20do%3F">there’s been speculation that C could refer to chat or community features</a>, or that it could tie in to the rumored mouse-like functionality. Mostly, it’s just surprising that Nintendo appears to have revealed anything about its next console outside of the planned launch — we’ll keep an eye on Nintendo Today to see if it has any other secrets waiting.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
