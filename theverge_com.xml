            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/606504/nintendo-switch-2-direct-new-time<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny, culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>As we settle in for the long, excruciating wait for more tangible news on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">Switch 2</a>, Nintendo has thrown us a little extra nugget of information. While we knew the company was planning to share more about the Switch 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24236766/nintendo-switch-2-games-direct-date-time">on April 2nd</a>, now we have a time: 9 AM ET / 6 AM PT / 10 PM JST. If you were taking bets on this time, you would have won handily as this is generally the usual time Nintendo holds its big events. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fsuccessor%2Fen-us%2Fnintendo-direct%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored">The announcement on Nintendo’s website</a> didn’t contain any extra detail about the duration of the event or the exact breakdown of topics that’ll be covered, other than to say it “will share a closer look” at the new device.</p><p>Last month, the company finally confirmed the existence of its new console dubbed, helpfully, the Switch 2. The reveal itself was sparse on detail, only confirming that the console would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345191/nintendo-switch-2-bigger-screen">be larger than its predecessor</a> and that its Joy-Con controllers appear to attach <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo">via some kind of magnetic action</a>. Because of the reveal’s relative lack of concrete information, we’re left with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24344718/nintendo-switch-2-specs-date-price-launch-games-mario-kart">so many questions about the new console</a>. Nevertheless, there was still lots of speculation about what the Switch 2 could possibly do. Theories were put forth that the new Joy-Cons contained some kind of mouse functionality and that the extra button on the right Joy-Con was related to some kind of party chat feature. Hopefully, Nintendo will let us know those if theories were correct during the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct on Wednesday, April 2nd bright and early at 9 AM.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/605588/rift-of-the-necrodancer-review-music-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Rift of the NecroDancer</em>, a new music game from the creators of the music roguelike <em>Crypt of the NecroDancer</em>, solves the problem of exploring a big library of tracks with a simple idea: a story mode.</p><p>In <em>Rift</em>, you have to press buttons in time with notes that appear on lanes in front of you, similar to games like <em>Guitar Hero</em>. You only have three lanes to worry about, but the tracks get complex because the “notes” are actually enemies with different movement patterns. A green slime just takes one hit to defeat, for example, but a gold bat takes three beats to eliminate, and with each hit, it hops to another lane.</p><p>If you want, you can immediately jump into the game’s library, which features more than 30 tracks. (Though you’ll need to accrue “diamonds” to unlock some of them.) The songs are killer — I happily tapped my foot to just about every one I played. But because the songs are originals, there aren’t familiar licensed tunes to jump into like with <em>Guitar Hero,</em> so it can be daunting to know where to start.</p><p>That’s why I played <em>Rift</em>’s story mode. The plot doesn’t really matter — you play as Cadence, the main character from <em>Crypt</em>, as you try and solve the mystery of the rifts that spawn the monsters in the songs — but it provides a logical way to work through the music, especially as the songs ramp up in difficulty. It’s kind of like an album: <em>Rift</em>’s songs have clearly been put in a certain order with intention, and playing through that order through the story mode is a great way to experience them, at least at first. There are fun <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/3/11157462/rhythm-heaven-megamix-nintendo-3ds"><em>Rhythm Heaven</em>-like minigames</a>, epic boss battles, and charming cartoon art to accompany the story beats, too. (If you’ve played <em>Crypt</em>, you’ll recognize some familiar faces.)</p><p>Even on medium difficulty, <em>Rift</em> can get <em>tough</em>. In some of the later tracks, the tempo is fast, and the monsters fly down the lanes at a rapid rate and in tricky combinations. Fortunately, the game has a great practice mode that lets you repeat specific portions of songs at a significantly reduced speed so that you can get your timing down. You can also ease down to a lower difficulty whenever you want. And one time, I failed a song enough times that the game told me I could move on without finishing it. While I appreciated the gesture, it made me more determined to beat it. Which I did!</p><p>It took me about five hours to play through <em>Rift</em>’s story. When I was done, I was surprised to find myself immediately jumping into the game’s full tracklist to play some songs again. If I hadn’t played through the story mode, I might not have discovered some of the game’s best music.</p><p>Rift of the NecroDancer<em> launches today on PC.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
