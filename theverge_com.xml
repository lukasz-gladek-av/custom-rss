            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/681361/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-edition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Last night, I stayed up way too late playing through the Great Plateau section of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em>, and I’m falling in love with the game all over again.</p><p>The opening moments of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> are iconic. The wide shot of Hyrule you see after leaving that first cave is breathtaking, showing you the world of possibilities ahead. Solving the puzzles on the Great Plateau requires some real creativity and experimentation, especially to survive the colder parts of the area. All of that magic is still there with the Switch 2 version of the game, which you can get as a $9.99 upgrade if you already own the Switch version or as a standalone $69.99 purchase, but it all plays better.</p><p>As far as I could tell, the frame rate stayed at a steady 60fps no matter where I went in my initial explorations, which makes the game feel much smoother and more responsive. That was nice for my skirmishes with the Great Plateau’s Bokoblins; they’re basic enemies, but I liked sparring with them at the faster frame rate all the same. The game also has a higher resolution on Switch 2, and while the graphics aren’t improved too dramatically from the original game, I thought the Switch 2 version looked great on my 4K TV. (I did notice things like grass or rocks popping in as I got close to them, though.)</p><p>Best of all, the load times are <em>much</em> faster, which could be the improvement that really makes the Switch 2 version worth it. On the original Switch, the load times weren’t too bad, but they would regularly force you to pause as you waited for the next area to load. On the Switch 2, it felt like I was loading into shrines or a fast-travel point with only a brief delay, and over the course of an entire playthrough, those shorter loads will add up.</p><p>In my initial testing, the Zelda Notes companion app’s navigation tool (found within the Nintendo Switch app) also seems like it could be a big time-saver. The feature functions like a GPS for all sorts of things you can discover, including shrines, towers, enemies, and even Korok seeds. I opened it up, picked a Korok seed that was apparently near me, and the app guided me toward it by showing my position on the map in the app and telling me what direction to go. It even nudged me to climb upward, which was helpful because I happened to pick the Korok that’s found on the highest spire of the Temple of Time.</p><p>The navigation feature arguably takes away from the self-guided exploration that makes <em>Breath of the Wild</em> so special. Since it’s an optional feature, though, I don’t think it takes away from the experience too much — especially since it requires booting up an entirely separate app on a separate device, so you have to do some work to get it up and running. If you’re playing through the game on the Switch 2 for the first time, I’d recommend that you don’t use it. But if you want to find every single Korok seed, it could be a lifesaver.</p><p>What surprised me most with my first couple hours with the Switch 2 version of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> was that I was getting into its captivating loop all over again. Even though I’ve played through the game multiple times on the original Switch, I still found myself darting around the Great Plateau to take on random camps of baddies, diving into a pond to get a Korok that I knew was hidden there, and marking shrines and towers on my map. On the Switch 2, it’s all much more refined, making it an excellent way to play one of Nintendo’s best games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/679542/access-ability-summer-showcase-2025-best-games-trailers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Now in its third year, the Access-Ability Summer Showcase is back to redress the lack of meaningful accessibility information across the ongoing video game showcase season. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/669419/gaming-industry-accessibility-cutbacks">As we see progress broadly slow down</a>, it’s also a timely reminder of the good work that’s still happening in pursuit of greater accessibility in gaming.</p><p>“At a time where we are seeing a slowdown in accessibility adoption in the AAA games space,” organizer <a href="https://access-ability.uk/">Laura Kate Dale</a> says, “we’re showing that there are interesting accessible games being made, games with unique and interesting features, and that being accessible is something that can bring an additional audience to purchase and play your games.”</p><p>The showcase is growing, too. In 2025, it’s longer, more packed with games, and streamed concurrently on Twitch, Youtube (where it’s also available on-demand), and on Steam’s front page. That growth comes with its own challenges — mitigated this year by Many Cats Studio stepping in as sponsor — but the AA Summer Showcase provides an accessible platform in response to the eye-watering costs of showcasing elsewhere (<a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a61006534/summer-game-fest-explained/">it has previously been reported that presenting trailers across Summer Game Fest starts at $250,000</a>), while providing disabled viewers with the information they need to know if they can actually get excited about new and upcoming releases.</p><p>It’s lesson Dale hopes other platforms might take on board. “I grow the show in the hopes that other showcases copy what we’re doing and make this the norm,” she says. “If I could quit hosting the AA Summer Showcase next year because every other show in June committed to talking about accessibility as part of their announcements, that would be wonderful news.”</p><p>To help that along (sorry, Laura, don’t quit just yet), <em>The Verge </em>has collated the games featured in this year’s Access-Ability Summer Showcase below.</p><div><p id="visual-accessibility-in-focus"><h2><strong>Visual accessibility in focus</strong></h2></p></div><p>A major theme that emerged from this year’s showcase is color blind considerations. The showcase kicked off with <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2982340%2FChromaGun_2_Dye_Hard%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>ChromaGun2: Dye Hard</em></a> by Pixel Maniacs, a first-person color-based puzzler. In its color blind mode, colors are paired with symbols for better parsing and those symbols combine when colors are mixed.</p><p>A similar spirit is echoed in Sword and Quill’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3505230%2FSoulblaze%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Soulblaze</em></a>, a creature-collecting roguelike that’s a bit of <em>Pokémon</em> mixed with tabletop RPGs (dice included). It also pairs colors and icons, adding a high level of customization to color indicators, difficulty, and an extensive text-to-speech function that supports native text-to-speech systems and <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/">NVDA</a>.</p><p>Later, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1878490%2FGales_of_Nayeli%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Gales of Nayeli</em></a> from Blindcoco Studios, a grid-based strategy RPG, showcased its own color blind considerations and an impressive array of visual customization options.</p><div><p id="room-to-breathe"><h2><strong>Room to breathe</strong></h2></p></div><p>A welcome trend carried over from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172897/access-ability-showcase-best-games-trailers-2024">last year</a>, games continue to eschew time pressure and fail states. Dire Kittens Games’ <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2113350%2FHeartspell_Horizon_Academy%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Heartspell: Horizon Academy</em></a> is a puzzle dating simulator that feels like <em>Bejeweled </em>meets <em>Hatoful Boyfriend</em>. Perhaps its most welcome feature is the ability to skip puzzles altogether, though it also features customization for puzzle difficulty. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1451120%2FSunlight%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Sunlight</em></a> from Krillbite Studio is a chill hiking adventure that tasks the player with picking flowers while walking through a serene forest. It does away with navigation as you’ll always be heading the right way, while sound cues direct you to nearby flowers.</p><p>This year’s showcase featured two titles from DarZal Games. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2604920%2FQuest_Giver%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Quest Giver</em></a> is a low-stakes management visual novel which casts the player as an NPC handing quests out to RPG heroes, while <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2785330%2F6Sided_Stories%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>6-Sided Stories</em></a> is a puzzle game involving flipping tiles to reveal an image. The games were presented by Darzington, a developer with chronic hand pain who develops with those needs in mind and, interestingly, with their voice (thanks to <a href="https://talonvoice.com/">Talon Voice</a>). Both games feature no time pressure, no input holds or combos, and allow for one-handed play.</p><p>Single-handed controls are also a highlight of Crayonix Games’ <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3274880%2FRollick_N_Roll%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Rollick N’ Roll</em></a>, a puzzle game in which you control the level itself to get toy cars to their goal without the burden of a ticking clock.</p><div><p id="highlighting-highlights"><h2><strong>Highlighting highlights</strong></h2></p></div><p>Speaking of highlights, this was another interesting trend to emerge from this year’s showcase. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1811340%2FSpray_Paint_Simulator%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Spray Paint Simulator</em></a> by Whitethorn Games is, in essence, <em>PowerWash Simulator </em>in reverse. Among a suite of accessibility features that help players chill out and paint everything from walls and bridges to what looks like Iron Man’s foot, the game allows you to highlight painting tasks and grants a significant level of control over how those highlights appear and how long they last. Whitethorn Games provides accessibility information for all its games <a href="https://whitethorngames.com/accessibility">here</a>.</p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1588550%2FCairn%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Cairn</em></a><em>, </em>by contrast, is a challenging climbing game from The Game Bakers which looks like transplanting <em>Octodad</em> onto El Capitan. As it encourages players to find new routes up its mountains, the game allows players to highlight their character’s limbs, as well as skip quick reaction minigames and rewind falls completely.</p><p>Highlights are also important to Half Sunk Games’ <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2301940%2FBLOWUP_AVENGE_HUMANITY%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Blow-up: Avenge Humanity</em></a>, in which players can desaturate the background and customize the size and tone of enemy outlines to make its chaotic gunplay more visible. Something Qudical’s <em>Coming Home</em>, which debuted during the showcase, also offers in its tense horror gameplay as you evade a group of murderers. You can switch on a high-contrast mode that highlights objects to distinguish them from the environment (including said killers).</p><div><p id="unsighted"><h2><strong>Unsighted</strong></h2></p></div><p>If this year’s been challenging for accessibility, it’s been even more disappointing for blind players when it comes to games that are playable independently. The AA Summer Showcase, however, included an interlude showing off the best titles from the recent <a href="https://itch.io/jam/games-for-blind-gamers-4">Games for Blind Gamers 4</a>, a game jam in which all games are designed with unsighted play in mind and judged by blind players. Four games were featured: <em>Lacus Opportunitas </em>by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24225210/periphery-synthetic-accessible-audio-game-steam">one of last year’s standouts shiftBacktick</a>, <em>The Unseen Awakening</em>, <em>Barista</em>, and <em>Necromancer Nonsense</em>. This was chased by a look at Tempo Labs Games’ <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1929290%2FBits__Bops%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Bits &amp; Bops</em></a>, a collection of rhythm games with simple controls and designed to be playable in its entirety without sighted assistance.</p><div><p id="a-difficult-subject"><h2><strong>A difficult subject</strong></h2></p></div><p>Accessible indie games often favor the cozy, but this year’s AA Summer Showcase brought a standout game that bucked that trend. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2747770%2FWednesdays%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Wednesdays</em></a> by ARTE France is a game that deals with the aftermath of childhood abuse. That’s certainly in keeping with the host of trauma-driven indie games out there. <em>Wednesdays</em>, however, positions itself as a more hopeful examination of that trauma, both through its visual novel style memories and theme park manager gameplay.</p><p>Like so many of the showcase’s games this year, <em>Wednesdays </em>includes mitigations for color blindness — though no essential information is tied to color in-game — as well as a comprehensive text log for cognitive support, manual and automated text scrolling, and customization options for cursor speed, animations, fonts, inputs, and more. Better yet, all those options are displayed at launch and the game always opens in a windowed mode to allow for easier setup of external accessibility tools.</p><p>It’s a curious title, for its wealth of accessibility features, naturally, but also for how it handles its subject matter — because maybe we all need a little more hope this year, yeah?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
