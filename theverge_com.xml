            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/666867/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-canceled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Square Enix has announced that it is cancelling the mobile spinoff <em>Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link</em>. In <a href="https://www.kingdomhearts.com/missinglink/">a statement on the game’s website</a>, Square Enix apologized to fans who were anticipating the game. The announcement also mentioned that Square was still hard at work on <em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em> perhaps to allay fears that this cancellation might indicate problems for other games in the sprawling Disney video game series.</p><p><em>Kingdom Hearts: Missing-Link</em> <a href="http://v/">was announced in 2022 alongside <em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em></a><em>.</em> It was billed as a mobile action game that made use of GPS technology to give players the ability to “travel the world without stepping outside,” according to one trailer. However, apparently that goal was a bit too lofty as Square Enix wrote, “We determined that it would be difficult for us to offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time, leading us to the decision to cancel development.”</p><p>Square Enix’s statement provided insight as to the reason for a game’s cancellation – something most game studios do not often offer. And while making any game is a miracle, making a successful live-service game is like asking for lightning to strike the head of a pin in a forest. After all, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">how</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312584/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-refunds">many</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317407/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-final-season-offline-mode">live-service games</a> (some of them <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/foamstars-season-pass-ends-with-ironically-titled-party-goes-on">even made by Square Enix itself</a>) were released only to die shortly thereafter while the concurrent player counts for <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Roblox</em>, and <em>Call of Duty</em> remain largely unmoved. So it’s a rare and refreshing bit of honesty, especially in an industry as opaque as game development, that Square Enix was willing to name the reason for cancelling <em>Missing-Link</em> and I hope more studios follow suit in the future. </p><p>But it’s not all bad news for Square Enix. As reported by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/square-enix-and-tbs-television-announce-collaboration-to-develop-original-ip-game"><em>Gematsu</em></a>, Square has also started a new partnership with the Tokyo Broadcasting System Television. Known as TBS, it’s a Japanese TV and media company which produced <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/shopping/article/takeshis-castle-reboot-amazon-prime-17048691.php"><em>Takeshi’s Castle</em></a> – an internationally popular physical competition show known in the US as <em>Most Extreme Elimination Challenge</em> or <em>MXC</em>. TBS started its own games division in 2023 and with Square Enix, the two companies will work on a new gaming property.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
