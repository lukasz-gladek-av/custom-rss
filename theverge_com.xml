The game will also get support for Sony’s DualSense controllers and their adaptive triggers.</p><p>PC players will be able to take advantage of <em>GTA Online</em> features that are already accessible on PS5 and Xbox Series X / S, too, including new vehicles and upgrades at Hao’s Special Works auto shop and the ability to purchase <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/25/22996408/gta-online-rockstar-games-subscription-service">a GTA Plus membership</a>.</p><p>However, Rockstar says that the original version of <em>GTA Online</em> on PC is going to be split off into a “separate instance,” and “players who remain on that version will not be able to play in sessions together with those on the upgraded version.” Both versions will be available to current players and “first-time purchasers.”</p><p>Rockstar is also still working on <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>, which is set to launch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158510/gta-6-release-date-fall-2025">this fall</a> on PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But according to an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/falconbrickstudios/">Instagram account </a>that <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lego-game-boy-price-release-date-and-piece-count-appear-online/"><em>Video Games Chronicle</em> says has a reliable track record</a> for sharing accurate details about new sets before Lego does, the brick-built Game Boy will sell for $59.99 when it launches on October 1st, and will include 421 pieces.</p></div><p>Falconbricks Studios shared the details on Instagram earlier today, including the set number 72046 that <a href="https://www.bricksup.co.uk/post/lego-super-mario-72046-game-boy-rumoured-for-october-2025">matches earlier leaks</a>, but pricing that’s slightly cheaper than what has been anticipated.</p><p>However, $59.99 for 421 pieces — which works out to about 14 cents per brick — makes this upcoming set one of the more expensive Nintendo and Lego collaborations.

Non-themed sets, like the recently released $59.99 Medieval Dragon, sell for about eight cents per brick.</p><div><p>The Lego Game Boy will likely be the second most anticipated Nintendo handheld this year, following the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">official reveal of the Switch 2</a> last month.
