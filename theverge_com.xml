            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve’s Steam Deck has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/618709/steam-deck-3-year-anniversary-handheld-gaming-shipments-idc">dominated the handheld gaming PC space</a> since its 2022 debut. But even as more powerful Windows handhelds arrived to keep up with more demanding games, none have beaten the Steam Deck’s combination of ease-of-use, ergonomics, power, and battery life at an affordable price.</p><p>That still hasn’t changed. The Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS is not the Steam Deck killer that <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/handheld-gaming/lenovo-legion-go-steamos-review">some headlines</a> <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/lenovo-legion-go-s-review">would</a> <a href="https://gizmodo.com/lenovos-legion-go-s-with-steamos-is-the-only-real-alternative-to-a-steam-deck-2000621525">have</a> you believe.</p><div><p>This was supposed to be <em>a moment</em> for handhelds. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">When the Legion Go S was revealed as the first authorized third-party handheld to run SteamOS</a>, with a $499 starting price, it looked like a true Steam Deck competitor was finally on the way. It even had the blessing and support of the Steam Deck’s creators — something we’d never seen before.</p></div><p>With an actual price of $599 and tradeoffs galore, the base Legion Go S with SteamOS is not a match for the $550 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a>. The more powerful AMD Z1 Extreme model is not half bad, but it’s far more expensive at $829.</p><p>But within the disappointment, there is some good news: it’s better than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/617613/lenovo-legion-go-s-review-feels-good-plays-bad">the $730 Windows version with the same hardware</a> that came out last February, and SteamOS is definitely a better experience than Windows.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->600</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>SteamOS is a huge improvement over Windows</li><li>Good ergonomics</li><li>Great, variable refresh rate screen</li><li>Powerful cooling</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Z2 Go performance only on par with Steam Deck</li><li>Battery life falls behind Steam Deck</li><li>Somewhat slippery texture</li><li>Nearly useless touchpad</li></ul></div></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->830</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>SteamOS is a huge improvement over Windows</li><li>Good ergonomics</li><li>Good performance</li><li>Great, variable refresh rate screen</li><li>Powerful cooling</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Battery falls behind top Windows handhelds</li><li>Somewhat slippery texture</li><li>Nearly useless touchpad</li></ul></div></div></div><div><p>Back in February, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/617613/lenovo-legion-go-s-review-feels-good-plays-bad">I couldn’t believe just how poor the Windows gaming experience was</a> on this handheld’s AMD Z2 Go chip. A $550 Steam Deck ran <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> faster <em>on battery</em> than a $730 Lenovo did while plugged in at maximum boost! And as usual, Windows was a pig: the less you know about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/617613/lenovo-legion-go-s-review-feels-good-plays-bad#:~:text=I%20spent%20nearly%2045%20minutes">the Windows out-of-box experience</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/617613/lenovo-legion-go-s-review-feels-good-plays-bad#:~:text=it%20does%20not%20reliably%20go%20to%20sleep%20and%20wake%20up%20again">wake / sleep issues</a>, the better.</p></div><p>Thankfully, SteamOS washes away the Windows stains. Imagine <em>just pressing a power button</em> to pause a game, then seamlessly resuming the next time you press it! Imagine simply picking a language and scanning a Steam Guard QR code to log into your handheld for the first time, instead of spending 45 minutes batting away upsells for Microsoft 365 Copilot and kin.</p><p>And even though the Windows version has also (slightly) improved since I first tested it, the Legion Go S is<em> so much faster</em> with SteamOS: roughly 17 percent faster, in my tests.</p><div><h2>Windows vs. SteamOS with the Legion Go S</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power mode</h3></th><th><h3>Z2 Go Windows (spring ‘25)</h3></th><th><h3>Z2 Go Windows (summer ‘25)</h3></th><th><h3>Z2 Go SteamOS (summer ‘25)</h3></th><th><h3>Windows improvement since spring</h3></th><th><h3>SteamOS improvement over Windows</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AC Valhalla, 15-watt TDP</td><td>44</td><td>46</td><td>60</td><td>4.55%</td><td>30.43%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td>55</td><td>69</td><td>0.00%</td><td>25.45%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>60</td><td>60</td><td>73</td><td>0.00%</td><td>21.67%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>62</td><td>64</td><td>76</td><td>3.23%</td><td>18.75%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>65</td><td>68</td><td>77</td><td>4.62%</td><td>13.24%</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>36</td><td>39</td><td>50</td><td>8.33%</td><td>28.21%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>41</td><td>46</td><td>59</td><td>12.20%</td><td>28.26%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>45</td><td>50</td><td>63</td><td>11.11%</td><td>26.00%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>46</td><td>52</td><td>66</td><td>13.04%</td><td>26.92%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>49</td><td>56</td><td>62</td><td>14.29%</td><td>10.71%</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>56</td><td>58</td><td>67</td><td>3.57%</td><td>15.52%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>63</td><td>67</td><td>74</td><td>6.35%</td><td>10.45%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>71</td><td>77</td><td>7.58%</td><td>8.45%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>67</td><td>72</td><td>78</td><td>7.46%</td><td>8.33%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>70</td><td>73</td><td>79</td><td>4.29%</td><td>8.22%</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>24</td><td>25</td><td>21</td><td>4.17%</td><td>-16.00%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>26</td><td>30</td><td>24</td><td>15.38%</td><td>-20.00%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>29</td><td>31</td><td>26</td><td>6.90%</td><td>-16.13%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>30</td><td>33</td><td>27</td><td>10.00%</td><td>-18.18%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>32</td><td>35</td><td>27</td><td>9.38%</td><td>-22.86%</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>53</td><td>48</td><td>54</td><td>-9.43%</td><td>12.50%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>53</td><td>56</td><td>59</td><td>5.66%</td><td>5.36%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td>60</td><td>61</td><td>9.09%</td><td>1.67%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>64</td><td>62</td><td>62</td><td>-3.13%</td><td>0.00%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>65</td><td>65</td><td>71</td><td>0.00%</td><td>9.23%</td></tr><tr><td>HZD Remastered, 15-watt TDP</td><td>18</td><td>18</td><td>30</td><td>0.00%</td><td>66.67%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>21</td><td>20</td><td>32</td><td>-4.76%</td><td>60.00%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>24</td><td>21</td><td>33</td><td>-12.50%</td><td>57.14%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>24</td><td>21</td><td>34</td><td>-12.50%</td><td>61.90%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>24</td><td>25</td><td>39</td><td>4.17%</td><td>56.00%</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>All values are average framerates at 720p and low settings, save Cyberpunk at “Steam Deck” setting.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>SteamOS’s performance increase can translate to better battery life, too. On the Windows model, playing 2020’s <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla </em>at 720p resolution and 60fps at low settings required an average of 36 watts — enough to drain the Legion Go S’s 55 watt-hour battery in 1.5 hours. But with SteamOS, the same 60fps gameplay requires just 22 watts, giving you an entire extra hour of gameplay (55 watt-hours divided by 22 watts = 2.5 hours) <em>just by installing a different OS. </em></p><p>Not all games see as dramatic a boost, but the same is true of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>: if you play at 50fps, you get up to an extra hour of battery life from SteamOS.</p><p>SteamOS also makes it so much easier to change those power modes, map out new control schemes, and monitor your performance and battery life. You can simply hold down a button and flick a joystick to change your screen brightness or summon a virtual mouse, so there’s no need to dive into menus. You can even install <a href="https://decky.xyz/">Decky</a>, the unofficial SteamOS plugin loader, on a Legion Go S, to flesh out your Steam Library with game art or more easily install Epic Game Store titles.</p><p>But all that is also true of the Steam Deck, which costs less, excels at games that don’t require the horsepower of <em>Cyberpunk</em> <em>2077</em>, and makes it easier to play decades of PC titles that <em>weren’t</em> built for gamepad controls.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->13</strong><span><figcaption><em>The Steam Deck OLED next to the Legion Go S. Tap through my gallery for more hardware images.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>The Steam Deck has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22955238/valve-steam-controller-trackpad-deck-pc-gaming-controller-mouse-button">two large, responsive touchpads</a> that can emulate a trackball, pull up a radial menu, or each act as an extra set of four buttons to map your keyboard commands. The Legion Go S has a single ultra-tiny touchpad that puts up such a fight whenever I try to use it that I’ve already given up. The Steam Deck has four back buttons, enough so you can bind ABXY and never have to take your thumb off the right analog stick; the Legion Go S only has two.</p><p>More importantly to me: perhaps because of these differences in controls, the Legion Go S is missing the mountain of community controller layouts that Steam Deck, PlayStation, and Xbox controller users have been creating for years. Those layouts, which map the games’ commands to the controllers’ buttons and joysticks, make it a cinch to play mouse-and-keyboard games on a handheld without the tedious work of figuring out a control scheme from scratch. On a Steam Deck, or on any PC with a common controller plugged in, those layout options show up automatically if you go looking. With the Legion Go S, the repository of custom controller profiles is totally empty. The Legion Go S’s layout is nearly identical to Xbox, so why doesn’t it pull up Xbox controller profiles at least? This honestly feels like an oversight, and I hope it’ll be fixed.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The Community Layouts section is just… empty.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>As I explained in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/617613/lenovo-legion-go-s-review-feels-good-plays-bad">my review of the Windows Legion Go S</a>, though, this hardware does feel great. It’s solid, reassuringly well-built, with my second-favorite screen on a handheld after the Steam Deck OLED. While it doesn’t have the true HDR or deep blacks of Valve’s OLED, the 8-inch IPS touchscreen makes the Steam Deck’s 7.4-inch screen seem cramped by comparison, to say nothing of the 7-inch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">ROG Ally X</a>. And like the Ally, Lenovo’s 120Hz variable refresh rate can make for smoother gameplay, particularly on the model with AMD’s Z1 Extreme chip.</p><p>The Steam Deck’s one notable disadvantage is that its performance has only slightly improved in three and a half years as games continue to get more demanding. Big hits like <em>Expedition 33</em> and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> have pushed it out of its comfort zone, and where rivals like the Legion Go S can unlock better performance when plugged into the wall or draining their batteries at very high rates, the Steam Deck can’t.</p><p>The Legion Go S officially brings those “turbo” modes to SteamOS, as well. But if that’s why you’re buying, don’t get the $599 Z2 Go model.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power mode</h3></th><th><h3>Z2 Go FPS</h3></th><th><h3>Z1 Extreme FPS</h3></th><th><h3>Deck OLED FPS</h3></th><th><h3>Z2G battery drain</h3></th><th><h3>Z1E battery drain</h3></th><th><h3>Deck battery drain</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>50</td><td>57</td><td>50</td><td>22W (~2.5h)</td><td>25W (~2.2h)</td><td>23.5W (~2.1h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>59</td><td>73</td><td>N/A</td><td>29W (~1.9h)</td><td>32W (~1.7h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>63</td><td>79</td><td>N/A</td><td>36W (~1.5h)</td><td>38W (~1.4h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>82</td><td>N/A</td><td>42.5W (~1.3h)</td><td>44.5W (~1.2h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>67</td><td>74</td><td>61</td><td>22.5W (~2.4h)</td><td>25.5W (~2.2h)</td><td>22W (~2.2h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>74</td><td>92</td><td>N/A</td><td>29W (~1.9h)</td><td>32W (~1.7h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>77</td><td>99</td><td>N/A</td><td>35.5W (~1.5h)</td><td>38.5W (~1.4h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>78</td><td>100</td><td>N/A</td><td>41.5W (~1.3h)</td><td>45W (~1.2h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>21</td><td>24</td><td>25</td><td>22.5W (~2.4h)</td><td>25.5W (~2.2h)</td><td>23W (~2.1h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>24</td><td>30</td><td>N/A</td><td>30W (~1.8h)</td><td>32W (~1.7h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>26</td><td>32</td><td>N/A</td><td>36W (~1.5h)</td><td>38.5W (~1.4h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>27</td><td>33</td><td>N/A</td><td>42.5W (~1.3h)</td><td>45.5W (~1.2h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>54</td><td>62</td><td>57</td><td>23W (~2.4h)</td><td>25W (~2.2h)</td><td>23.5W (~2.1h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>59</td><td>83</td><td>N/A</td><td>29W (~1.9h)</td><td>31.5W (~1.7h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>61</td><td>89</td><td>N/A</td><td>36W (~1.5h)</td><td>37.5W (~1.5h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>62</td><td>93</td><td>N/A</td><td>42.5W (~1.3h)</td><td>43.5W (~1.3h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>HZD Remastered, 15-watt TDP</td><td>30</td><td>37</td><td>33</td><td>23.5W (~2.3h)</td><td>25W (~2.2h)</td><td>23W (~2.1h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>32</td><td>47</td><td>N/A</td><td>29W (~1.9h)</td><td>32W (~1.7h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>33</td><td>50</td><td>N/A</td><td>35.5W (~1.5h)</td><td>37.5W (~1.5h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>34</td><td>52</td><td>N/A</td><td>43W (~1.3h)</td><td>44W (~1.3h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Balatro, 3 to 5-watt TDP, 60fps cap</td><td>60</td><td>60</td><td>60</td><td>8.1W (~6.8h)</td><td>8.2W (~6.7h)</td><td>6.9W (~7.1h)</td></tr><tr><td>Balatro, lowest playable wattage and brightness, 30-40fps</td><td>30-40</td><td>30-40</td><td>30-40</td><td>7.6W (~7.2w)</td><td>8.0 (~6.9h)</td><td>5.2W (~9.4h)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>It’s not that the Z2 Go is slower than the Steam Deck overall. At max boost on wall power, the base Legion Go S can offer <em>up to</em> 35 percent better framerates. But the Z1 Extreme model offered up to 72 percent faster framerates than the Steam Deck and was 29 percent faster on average than the Z2 Go model. That’s enough to make a game feel smooth that was barely playable — like <em>Expedition 33</em> at the lowest settings — or comfortably go up an entire graphics preset in most games when you’re plugged into the wall.</p><p>(If you do plan to plug the Legion Go S into the wall, you may want to turn on fast charging in the BIOS — hold down Power + Volume Up when booting, then change Charging Speed Selection — and get yourself a 100W power adapter, because Lenovo’s stock 65W adapter isn’t enough to keep the battery from draining while you’re playing full bore.)</p><div><p><figcaption><em>I’ve been playing a lot of Expedition 33 on handhelds. Anecdotally, the MSI Claw 8 AI Plus runs it best and with the longest battery life; the Legion Go S Z1 Extreme is good for shorter sessions</em>.</figcaption></p></div><p>The Steam Deck OLED can’t do turbo at all, but its custom chip can hold its own against the Z2 Go in unplugged “balanced” power modes. When I capped both at the same 15 watt power draw, the Steam Deck won in <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> <em>Valhalla </em>and <em>Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</em> and tied in <em>Cyberpunk</em> <em>2077</em>, even as it lost in <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Horizon Zero Dawn, </em>and <em>Returnal</em>.</p><p>Another surprise in the Steam Deck’s favor: I played a <em>lot</em> of fiendish mansion-building mystery <em>Blue Prince </em>while testing the Legion Go S, and it’s far choppier on Lenovo’s handhelds. I don’t know if it’s had Steam Deck-specific optimizations, but I found I needed turbo mode on the Z1 Extreme for it to run as smoothly as it does on the Steam Deck.</p><p>If you do find yourself choosing between the two Lenovo Legion Go models, you won’t sacrifice much battery life by picking the beefier chip. In my tests, the Z1 Extreme model only drew 1 to 3 watts more than the Z2 Go on battery power — we’re talking about five minutes shorter battery life in the most intensive games and 15 minutes in less intensive ones.</p><p>But in those less intensive games like <em>Dirt Rally</em> or <em>Balatro</em>, the Steam Deck OLED is still the champ. Despite having a smaller 49Wh battery, it lasted over 50 minutes longer than either Legion Go S in my <em>Dirt Rally</em> battery drain test (where I set each handheld’s screen to the same brightness using a calibration tool) and managed two extra hours of magic poker game <em>Balatro </em>with battery-saving tweaks: 9 hours for Steam Deck vs. 7 hours for the Legion Go S.</p><p>I have to hand it to Lenovo and Valve: after tangling with the Windows model, I thought the entire Legion Go S lineup was going to be dead on arrival. But that’s not the case. Even the Z2 Go runs faster and more efficiently than it did on Windows, and the Z1 Extreme version is a legitimately good handheld if you get it with SteamOS. (You can technically install SteamOS on the Windows-based Legion Go S, but Valve tells me that’s not officially supported, and I ran into several issues when I tried it in early June.)</p><p>Valve and Lenovo have also moved swiftly to address some of the bugs the SteamOS version launched with. In the month and change since release, it’s fixed wonkiness around the power modes and the variable refresh rate screen, and how both the tiny touchpad and joystick LEDs can sometimes stop working when the handheld goes to sleep. (We’re still waiting on a way to control those RGB joystick LEDs in SteamOS, though.)</p><p>But while you might be happy with the $829 Z1 Extreme model around your home or otherwise close to an outlet, it’s not the best handheld you can buy. The Steam Deck OLED has it beat on price vs. performance and battery life for less intensive games, plus those community controller profiles and twin trackpads.

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Ever since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/31/22911274/wordle-new-york-times-free-word-game-acquisition">the <em>New York Times</em> acquired <em>Wordle</em></a> and went all-in on games, there’s been something of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279439/news-games-crossword-wordle">a slow-brewing arms race in the space</a>. The <em>Times</em> continues to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/682063/the-new-york-times-nyt-games-crossplay-scrabble-pips">release new games</a>, and it’s now up against intriguing competitors like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23929222/puzzmo-newspaper-games-crossword-zach-gage">Puzzmo</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276945/netflix-is-getting-a-daily-word-game-from-ted">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/687721/the-atlantic-games-hub-bracket-city"><em>The Atlantic</em></a>, and even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24145605/linkedin-gaming-puzzle-game-nyt-wordle-netflix-games">LinkedIn</a>, while established games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24295846/words-with-friends-single-player-daily-puzzles-wordle"><em>Words With Friends</em></a> have adjusted their offerings in response. Also in that mix is Apple News Plus, which just launched a game that’s a bit like <em>Wordle</em> crossed with emoji.</p></div><p>It’s called simply <em>Emoji Game</em>, and each day you’re presented with three phrases, which have some letters filled in, but are mostly blank. There’s a partial hint as to what the word or phrase is that you’re trying to complete, and then a whole bunch of emoji at the bottom. The idea is to take the words or sounds the emoji represent and use them to fill in the blanks. So — and this is just an example I made up, so it’s not a spoiler — you might be presented with SH_ _ _, and an emoji of an elf. Stick it in there and you have a “shelf.”</p><p>It’s a novel twist on word games, which have become ubiquitous online over the last three years. It’s really forced me to use my brain in a different way, though I’m not sure if I enjoy it just yet. Maybe once it becomes a routine. That said, it’s nice that there doesn’t appear to be a fail state; when you guess wrong there’s no real punishment, though the game does count the number of moves it takes you to complete each puzzle, so there is a competitive element. The most recent few puzzles are also free to play, so you can get a feel for it even if you don’t currently have an Apple News Plus subscription. (It’s currently available only in the US and Canada.)</p><p>The <em>Emoji Game</em> is a small daily diversion, and one that points to the fascinating innovation and experimentation happening in the word game space. After <em>Wordle</em> and the subsequent rush of clones, there hasn’t really been a word game that has gone viral in the same way, and so designers are crafting interesting new twists on the formula to stand out. The idea is that you don’t necessarily need one blockbuster hit, but instead a varied collection that will keep folks coming back daily. Puzzmo, for instance, has steadily grown since it launched, with everything from an accessible crossword to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24283527/puzzmo-weather-memoku">a weather-based take on sudoku</a>. It just launched an experimental word game called <em>Missing Link</em> that’s like an elevated take on word search puzzles.</p><p>As subscriptions continue to become an established part of modern life — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24306571/verge-subscription-launch-fewer-ads-unlimited-access-full-text-rss">no shade</a> — these sorts of daily games have proven to be a successful retention tactic. Habits are hard to break, and that’s especially true when they provide a brief, welcome respite in the form of clever word play. Or emoji.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/708935/apple-news-plus-emoji-game-wordle]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> didn’t make the best first impression, though I’m not talking about the game itself. The concept of a gritty reboot of <em>Pac-Man</em> first reared its strange head in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24313309/secret-level-review-amazon-prime-video"><em>Secret Level</em></a>, an anthology that turned notable video games into animated shorts that mostly felt like extended commercials. And that’s exactly what the episode “Circle,” which reimagined <em>Pac-Man</em> as a blood-soaked survival story, turned out to be. But as off-putting as the episode was, it turns out that the premise actually works for a <em>Metroid</em>-style action game.</p><p>For those who didn’t watch <em>Secret Level</em>, <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> puts you in the role of an unnamed, hooded swordmaster, who awakens to find himself inside some sort of dark alien labyrinth. He’s greeted by a floating drone named Puck, who serves as both a guide and a partner to survive in this treacherous world. Puck, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICElL6dBsrQ">of course</a>, is Pac-Man.</p><p>For the most part, the game plays a lot like a typical Metroidvania. It’s a side-scrolling game that’s heavy on action, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22710468/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Metroid Dread</em></a>, and as you defeat bosses and collect gold, you’ll slowly expand your arsenal of skills, which opens up the game further. The twisting, maze-like map is full of dead ends that you can’t explore until you get the right ability, which include staples like a double jump and grappling hook. You can also craft various upgrades, both permanent and temporary, so you can customize the character to your liking. It’s a satisfying loop of exploration, combat, and problem-solving (usually involving some kind of platforming sequence), punctuated by tense, elaborate boss fights that depend a lot on pattern memorization.</p><p>I could be describing a lot of other games here, but there are a few elements that make <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> unique. And it mostly has to do with Puck. Scattered throughout the labyrinth are rails that Puck can ride on, sort of like Pac-Man moving his way through a classic arcade maze. It’s reminiscent of Samus’ morph ball ability, except it’s relegated to predetermined areas of the map. Later on, there are actual <em>Pac-Man</em> mazes to play through, too, complete with pellets and ghosts to eat.</p><p>The game is at its best when you’re quickly swapping between Puck and the swordmaster, either to navigate a tricky platforming sequence or defeat enemies. In one early boss battle, I was able to use a rail on the ceiling to avoid projectiles, and then drop behind the enemy for some quick sneak attacks. Early on, Puck and the swordmaster gain the ability to temporarily fuse together to create a power-up that’s sort of like a mech suit, which you can use to devastate most enemies and even avoid environmental hazards. Oh, and when you’re a mech, you can eat your enemies to gain materials needed for those important unlocks.</p><p>One of the nice things about <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> is that, unlike the animated short that preceded it, it doesn’t overdo it with the grim tone. It can get a little bloody when you’re slicing through creatures, but it’s not gratuitous. In fact, much like <em>Dread</em>, the oppressive tone creates an interesting kind of tension, one that makes the rare moments of respite feel especially welcome. That said, the cutscenes are self-serious and convoluted, and there are silly moments where Puck becomes giant and eats the corpses of bosses, but these are mostly easy to ignore if all you want to do is explore a complex map, <em>Metroid</em>-style.</p><p>That’s really what the game offers. The combat is solid, the platforming is challenging, and the bosses are exciting. And thankfully, the tone mostly doesn’t intrude on the experience, while the <em>Pac-Man</em> theme brings <em>just enough</em> new to add an interesting twist for those well-versed in Metroidvanias. <em>Secret Level</em> may have been a commercial, but it was a pretty poor one: it missed what actually makes <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> worth playing.</p><p><sub>Shadow Labyrinth <em>launches on July 18th on the PS5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/708833/shadow-labyrinth-review-gritty-pac-man]]></content:encoded>
