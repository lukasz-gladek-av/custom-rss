            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony announced a $50 price increase on all PlayStation 5 “slim” models in the US <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762410/sony-ps5-price-hike-raise-digital-pro">starting tomorrow</a>, August 21st. The upcoming prices for a PS5 Digital Edition, the standard PS5, and the PS5 Pro are $499.99, $549.99, and $749.99, respectively; however, you can avoid paying the higher prices by picking up a PS5 at Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart today.</p><p>The disc-based PS5 is already sold out at Amazon, and your options may get even more limited the longer you wait. As of right now, you can get the PS5 Digital Edition for around $449 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-Digital-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL5KNB9M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fplaystation-5-slim-console-digital-edition-playstation-5%2FJXHQ3CCTY4" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-Digital-Console-Slim%2F5113183757" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-digital-edition-console-slim%2F-%2FA-90188800" rel="sponsored">Target</a>, while the standard PS5 can be had for around $499 at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fplaystation-5-slim-console-playstation-5%2FJXHQ3CCTYR" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-Disc-Console-Slim%2F5113183756" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-console-slim%2F-%2FA-90188801" rel="sponsored">Target</a>. You can also pick up the newer PS5 Pro for around $699 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-5-Pro-Console/dp/B0DGY63Z2H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fplaystation-5-pro-console-playstation-5%2FJXHQ3CX294" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Pro-Console-PS5-Pro%2F11839818124" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-pro-console%2F-%2FA-93620188" rel="sponsored">Target</a>.</p><p>All three PS5 consoles can play the same library of games, but have slight differences. The PS5 Digital Edition features rearranged port selection and lacks a built-in disc drive, which means it can only play digital games downloaded from the PlayStation Store. (Sony sells an optional external drive you can add after the fact for <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-accessories%2Fdisc-drive-for-ps5-digital-edition-consoles" rel="sponsored">$79.99</a> if you’d like to play physical games or Blu-rays.) The standard, disc-based PS5 features the same tech specs, but with an internal disc drive.</p><p>The PS5 Pro, meanwhile, has a better GPU, faster memory, improved ray tracing, support for Wi-Fi 7, and AI-powered upscaling. It lacks an internal disc drive, but it’s compatible with the external disc drive developed for the original PS5. It also comes with 2TB of internal storage instead of the 1TB SSD found in the non-Pro models, so you have additional space for stowing digital games. The beefed-up system doesn’t have exclusive titles, but select PS5 titles have received updates to look better.</p><p>Sony’s price hike comes less than a month after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717610/nintendo-switch-original-price-increase">Nintendo introduced</a> a similar $30 increase on the original Nintendo Switch models. Nintendo also recently raised the prices of certain <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fnintendo-switch-pricing-update%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopp0WuE8FGaJWInVOiTyinGftvdeBiwNUcQHQbpLvLvIm03uZAR" rel="sponsored">Nintendo Switch 2 accessories</a>, but Sony says “the recommended retail prices for PS5 accessories remain unchanged.” The price adjustments from both companies are attributable to tariffs on international goods, which were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643041/trump-tariff-consumer-electronics-gadgets-smartphones-laptops-wearables">first announced in April</a> and have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">continued to change</a> in response to President Donald Trump’s on-again-of-again policy.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandt Ranj</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/763043/sony-playstation-5-ps5-tariff-price-increase-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Framework, the modular computer company, just released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/749404/framework-desktop-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-max-385-395-plus-review">its first delightful tiny desktop PC</a>, on top of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/688959/framework-laptop-12-review-modular-touchscreen-intel">smallest laptop yet</a>. But it’s already teasing its next big live announcement <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZRG7Og61mw">on YouTube</a> for August 26th at 8am PT / 11am ET, saying it’ll reveal how “something big just got better.”</p><p>While that may seem like a vague phrase, it might narrow things down quite a bit! Framework only has one existing “big” product other than the Framework Desktop, the one that mysteriously <em>didn’t</em> get an update at its last event in February.</p><div><p>I’m talking, of course, about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24047424/framework-laptop-16-review">the Framework Laptop 16, the most ambitious and most modular laptop ever made</a>. When I tracked down Framework CEO Nirav Patel in February, he told me that the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619586/framework-laptop-16-update-one-key-but-not-done">was “nowhere near done”</a> with the laptop just yet.</p></div><p>Or, maybe Framework will help fisherman change how they catch fish in New England? That’s what Google Search tells me, anyhow:</p><p>I think the Framework Laptop 16 is a safer bet, though.</p><p>I’ve been quietly frustrated that I haven’t been able to give the Laptop 16 my full recommendation yet — because I want products like this to exist! — partly because of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24185827/framework-laptop-16-six-months-later-review">early cooling and build quality</a> deficiencies, and partly because Framework has never truly promised that you’ll be able to actually upgrade its GPU to a more powerful one down the road.</p><p>But with Framework’s Laptop 13, the company has proved again and again that truly modular and upgradable laptops can be a reality, and it’s ironed out many issues along the way. Here’s hoping August 26th is the day it fulfills the promise of modular gaming / creator laptops as well.</p><div><p>BTW, in case you missed it: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/the-vergecast/623633/james-bond-amazon-framework-laptop-desktop-vergecast">We had Nirav on <em>The Vergecast</em> in March</a> to chat all things Framework.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/763037/framework-is-teasing-a-big-update-for-august-26th-could-it-be-framework-16]]></content:encoded>

According <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-20/take-two-guts-bioshock-studio-after-a-decade-of-development">to <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, Take-Two is laying off more than 80 people at Cloud Chamber, which has been working on a new <em>BioShock</em> title, and the game has been delayed from a planned launch in late 2026 or early 2027.</p><p>The game has already had a rocky development, and the changes likely mean that the new title may still be years away. The last game in the series, <em>BioShock Infinite</em>, was released in 2013.</p><p>To help get this new entry back on track, 2K Games, the division of Take-Two that oversees Cloud Chamber, has hired Rod Fergusson, formerly the head of the <em>Diablo</em> team at Blizzard and helped get <em>BioShock Infinite</em> over the finish line, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:7stk6kdxhyemi6fdsk23q3ta/post/3lwr7mrw2gc2e?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.theverge.com%252Fnews%252F761490%252Fthe-bioshock-franchise-has-a-new-boss">to lead the Cloud Chamber team</a>. “I’m deeply grateful for the work the studio has done so far, and I’m committed to building a BioShock game we’ll be proud of and that our players will love,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rodfergusson.bsky.social/post/3lwr7mrw2gc2e">Fergusson wrote yesterday</a>.</p><p>In an internal memo announcing the Cloud Chamber layoffs, 2K Games president David Ismailer said that “while we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a <em>BioShock</em> game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development,” per a memo published <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/bioshock-layoffs-2k-rod-fergusson-head-cloud-chamber-1236492902/">by <em>Variety</em></a>.</p><p>Take-Two didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from <em>The Verge</em>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/762933/bioshock-cloud-chamber-take-two-2k-layoffs]]></content:encoded>
