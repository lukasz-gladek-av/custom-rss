Its upcoming Echo Aviation Controller is about the size of a console gamepad but squeezes standard features like joysticks and buttons to one side to make room for flight-specific controls like throttle levers and a dedicated trim wheel.</p><p>The Echo Aviation Controller is expected to be available in mid-December 2025 for $149.99 through the <a href="https://flyhoneycomb.com/">company’s online store</a>. It’s fully compatible with various PC-based flight simulators, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/785181/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-release-date"><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em></a>, and it connects to a computer with a USB-C cable or wirelessly using a dongle, <a href="https://fselite.net/content/honeycomb-aeronautical-has-completely-revamped-the-echo-aviation-controller-for-the-better/">according to Calum Martin at <em>FSElite</em></a>, who went hands on with the gamepad at a recent event.</p><p>On the left side of the main controller you’ll find a thumbstick, four action buttons, and a second conical joystick used to control a simulator’s camera. Meanwhile, the right side is where all the flight specific controls are located: four throttle levers accompanied by a trim wheel that can be adjusted to maintain a plane’s altitude without additional inputs.</p><p>On the bottom of the Echo Aviation Controller are dedicated controls for adjusting the aircraft’s flaps, raising or lowering the landing gear, and activating the parking brake so you don’t have to reach for your keyboard as frequently. There are also two sets of shoulder buttons on the top edge, and on the back you’ll find a pair of sliding paddles that move in opposition and function as rudders, controlling the side-to-side movement of your aircraft’s nose and aiding in steering while navigating an airport and runways.</p><p>In addition to a hard shell carrying case, the Echo Aviation Controller will come with a collection of interchangeable caps for the throttle levers and other controls so you can customize and easily differentiate each of them by their shape or color if you’ve remapped their functionality.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/823018/honeycomb-aeronautical-echo-aviation-controller-gamepad-pc-flight-simulator]]></content:encoded>
