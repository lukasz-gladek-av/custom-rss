            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/614519/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-sets<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> has revealed a look at its forthcoming <a href="https://www.polygon.com/mtg-magic-the-gathering/470491/final-fantasy-art-reveal-universes-beyond-standard-legal-announcement"><em>Final Fantasy</em>-themed set</a>. In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-deck-reveal-spoilers">an interview with <em>IGN</em></a>, senior game designer Daniel Holt talked about the collaboration and this initial look, which focuses on four major character cards and their associated pre-constructed Commander decks.</p><p>The revealed cards include Terra from <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, Tidus from <em>Final Fantasy X</em>, Y’shtola from (<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-critically-acclaimed-mmorpg">critically acclaimed MMORPG</a>)<em> <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></em>, and of course, Cloud from <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>. What’s interesting about these Commander decks is that instead of being constructed to simply support a single powerful card (known as the Commander), each deck’s mechanics and cards are designed to tell the story of a specific<em> Final Fantasy</em> game.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->5</strong><span><cite>Image: Magic: The Gathering</cite></span></p></section><p>Since the back half of <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> is all about rebuilding the world Kefka destroyed, its associated deck is all about returning creatures from the graveyard to the battlefield, for example. Cloud’s deck is all about equipment — you gotta have the right materia for the job, right? <em>Magic</em> has always been really good with how it marries the story of a set to gameplay mechanics, and seeing that applied to<em> Final Fantasy</em> is really cool. </p><p>In the <em>IGN</em> interview, Holt assured fans that even though these Commander decks are focused on only four games, the rest of the Standard-legal set will feature cards that represent all 16 mainline <em>Final Fantasy</em> games.</p><p>You can see previews for some of those cards’ artwork on the set’s official website <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/final-fantasy">here</a>. There will be even more cards revealed during an <a href="https://x.com/wizards_magic/status/1891549077654954031">official <em>MT</em>G x <em>Final Fantasy</em> livestream</a> taking place on February 18th at 1PM ET.</p><div><p>The full set launches on June 13th and will feature artwork from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2012/10/15/3506952/final-fantasy-designer-on-breaking-creative-boundaries-and-wearing">famed <em>Final Fantasy </em>artist Yoshitaka Amano</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
