This year feels different, though. Apple is reportedly planning a redesign that will touch all its operating systems, and a new naming scheme to tie them all more closely together. Is that enough for a company under this much pressure? Regulators are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/679946/apple-rejected-court-attempt-to-stop-app-store-web-links">changing the way Apple’s business works</a>; developers continue to be frustrated with Apple’s rules and machinations; competitors are <a href="http://[How Apple botched the rollout of AI-powered Siri | The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/the-vergecast/629652/siri-delay-bad-apple-tesla-trump-vergecast)">leaving Apple’s AI efforts behind</a>.

(Here’s <a href="http://[WWDC 2025: Everything We Know | MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/)">a good <em>MacRumors</em> rundown</a> of it all.) We’re likely to hear more about AI integrations, and more ways developers can access those integrations. We might hear a lot about Shortcuts. Will we see more multitasking options, both on the iPhone and iPad? Will your AirPods <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/679930/apple-airpods-camera-controls-sleep-detection-wwdc-rumor">turn into remote camera shutters</a>? Can AI fix your battery life? Rumors are flying, and as ever we won’t know for sure until Monday.</p><p>After that, we turn to the other big gadget news of the week: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/679393/nintendo-switch-2-launch-release-buy-restock">the Nintendo Switch 2</a>. David explains his oddly easy experience getting one, and the hosts talk through the current vibes around the launch. We’ll have lots more to say once we’ve been able to thoroughly test the new device, too, so stay tuned.
