            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/2/24284956/windblown-roguelikes-friends-multiplayer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some of the most beloved roguelikes are single-player — the likes of <em>Hades</em>, <em>Balatro</em>, and <em>Dead Cells</em> are all solo titles. But <em>Windblown</em>, the new roguelike from Motion Twin, the studio that created <em>Dead Cells</em>, showed me just how cool it can be to play a roguelike with other people.</p><p>In <em>Windblown</em>, your character, one of a few adorable animal adventurers like an axolotl or a bat, is shot out of a cannon into a mysterious giant tornado to fight your way through various zones. Like <em>Dead Cells</em>, you can equip up to two main weapons. I typically have one for close-range bouts and another for long-distance attacks. But with every weapon, you’re also able to pull off a combo that uses a special move from the <em>other weapon</em> called an “Alterattack.”</p><p>Here’s an example. I love using a crossbow to attack enemies from a distance, and I pair it with a giant heavy blade. I rarely use the blade on its own; instead, I use its Alterattack that cracks open the earth in a straight line to continue to wallop on enemies at range. That turns a run into a steady rhythm of slinging arrows and using the Alterattack at <em>exactly</em> the right time, and with my five hours so far with the game, I haven’t gotten tired of the pattern.</p><p><em>Windblown</em> just launched in early access, and you can already unlock more than a dozen weapons, meaning there are a lot of combinations that I haven’t messed around with. And with four different biomes to get through on a run, there’s a lot to see, too.</p><div><figcaption><em>The bosses are no joke.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Motion Twin</cite></p></div><p>All of that would be enough to make <em>Windblown</em> part of my regular rotation of roguelikes I use to wind down at the end of a long day. But the game’s multiplayer is making <em>Windblown</em> the game I turn to every time I turn on my Steam Deck.</p><p><em>Windblown’s</em> multiplayer lobbies, which you unlock fairly early on, let you play a full run with a team of three people. You can use voice and text chat to communicate, but it’s not required; I haven’t used those at all, instead relying on four in-game emoji. I also like that you can name your lobbies. I created one titled “help me get 1st win” and immediately had two helpful people join up to help me tackle the tornado. (Sadly, we did not get the win.)&nbsp;</p><p>When playing solo, I’ve found that I’m somewhat cautious and strategic as I think about how to use weapons and positioning to take on the game’s aggressive enemies and dodge their attacks. With the help of a team, battles are speedier and become delightful explosions of light, color, sound, and damage. It’s <em>so</em> fun to absolutely annihilate baddies with other people, and it’s comforting to know that they’ve got your back in a pinch.</p><p>There are <em>a lot</em> of great roguelikes to play right now; <em>Hades II</em> just got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271897/hades-ii-2-major-update-olympic">a huge update</a>, <em>Balatro</em> is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">nearly impossible</a> to put down (especially now that it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24256010/how-to-play-balatro-mobile-localthunk-playstack">on mobile</a>), and I’ve wanted to get back into <em>Shogun Showdown</em>, which I think <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/15/24243908/shogun-showdown-review">everyone is sleeping on</a>. <em>Windblown</em> needed more than just its Motion Twin pedigree to stand out, but so far, the multiplayer is the hook that keeps me coming back.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
