            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/678895/the-witcher-4-ue5-tech-demo-ps5-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Arguably the highlight of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/677653/epic-games-unreal-fest-2025-orlando-news-announcements">Epic’s State of Unreal keynote</a> was the opening:<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678463/unreal-engine-5-witcher-4-tech-demo"> a sprawling technical demo that showed just how good <em>The Witcher 4</em> looks in Unreal Engine 5</a>. It showcased a bustling market in a port city, a beautiful forest landscape, and a horse that looked and acted like, well, a horse. Even more impressive was the fact that the demo was running at 60 frames per second on a base model PlayStation 5. According to Julius Girbig, a senior technical animator at Witcher developer CD Projekt Red, the choice of hardware for the demo was very intentional.</p><p>“Everyone has the idea of how fast a PS5 is and what kinds of games it can run,” he tells <em>The Verge</em>. “That’s why we specifically wanted to go that route of: let’s start with the consoles, let’s show how much we can optimize this engine together with Epic and make it work on current gen, instead of running it on some high-end hardware.”</p><p>Now, to be clear, the UE5 demo is not actually a slice of the final game. Girbig describes it as “a demonstration of the tools that we are currently building that will eventually power <em>The Witcher 4</em>,” and something that “does show the style and direction that we’re going for, and the fidelity that we’re aiming at with the final game.”</p><div><p>But whatever it ends up being, and whenever it launches, <em>The Witcher 4</em> will be a pivotal release for CDPR. After previously creating open-world games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/12/23505545/the-witcher-3-next-gen-update-ps5-xbox-pc-hands-on"><em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22157995/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-review-xbox-ps4-ps5-pc-stadia"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a> with its own proprietary engine — sometimes with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195728/cyberpunk-2077-sales-copies-sold-launch-refunds">technically disastrous results</a> —<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/21/22989313/cd-projekt-red-new-witcher-game-unreal-engine-5-announcement">the studio announced in 2022 that it was switching to Unreal</a>.</p></div><p>According to Girbig, who didn’t work at CDPR until after the shift to Unreal, the decision was made because UE5 “across the board, gives us what we’re looking for.” That includes an increased sense of scale necessary for open-world games, with the ability to render hundreds of non-playable characters with more elaborate AI guiding their actions, and also a better production pipeline for managing multiple projects. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/26/23424463/witcher-remake-cd-projekt-red-unreal-engine-5">An upcoming remake of the first <em>Witcher</em> game is also being made in UE5</a>.)</p><p>But from an artistic perspective, Girbig says, the move to Epic’s engine has a different kind of impact: getting out of the way to allow for more ambitious ideas. “It allows an artist to express themselves much more easily when the engine isn’t a limitation anymore,” he says. “That’s what we’re aiming for here. As an artist, for me, this unlocked myself to think bigger, and on bigger scales.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/678888/razer-hyperflux-v2-mouse-pad-wireless-charging<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Razer has announced a new mousepad that can wirelessly charge your wireless mouse while you’re using it. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/9/16867292/razer-wireless-charging-hyperflux-mamba-firefly-mouse-pad-ces-2018">It’s not Razer’s first attempt at the idea</a>, but the new <a href="https://press.razer.com/product-news/razer-hyperflux-v2-wireless-charging-system/">HyperFlux V2</a> doesn’t require you to use a single specific mouse — it works with several models in Razer’s current lineup, charging their batteries continuously using an included adapter puck. It looks and sounds very similar to Logitech’s patented <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23005435/magic-mouse-apple-logitech-powerplay">Powerplay Wireless Charging System</a>.</p><p>The HyperFlux V2 Wireless Charging System comes in two versions for $119.99. One with a hard surface that’s available now, and one with a softer cloth surface, which is expected to launch later this year. The original Razer HyperFlux was sold as part of a $249.99 bundle that included the Mamba HyperFlux mouse. The V2 model doesn’t come with a mouse, but is compatible with the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro 35K, Basilisk V3 Pro, Cobra Pro, and Naga V2 Pro mice, which range in price from $129.99 to $179.99.</p><p>The Mamba HyperFlux mouse that worked with the original version of the HyperFlux pad featured a supercapacitor inside that retained power for about 5 to 10 seconds when it was lifted off the pad. That was enough time to allow you to reposition the mouse without it dying, but to use it anywhere else required a USB cable.</p><p>The new HyperFlux V2 instead uses a puck inserted into the bottom of the supported mouse models that charges their batteries wirelessly while they’re on the pad, like its Logitech competitor. An LED indicator at the top of the pad indicates the battery’s charge level by changing colors.</p><p>Like the original version, the new HyperFlux V2 mouse pad also serves as a receiver, allowing Razer’s mice and keyboards to wirelessly connect to a PC (through the pad, which connects to a computer over USB) using its proprietary HyperSpeed technology that’s faster and more reliable than Bluetooth. The mouse pad is also compatible with Razer’s wireless keyboards, including the BlackWidow V3 Pro and DeathStalker V2 Pro, but it can’t charge them wirelessly.</p><p><em>The Verge</em> has reached out to Logitech for comment and to Razer to clarify if its new wirelessly charging mouse pad is using a different approach than the patented Powerplay system. We will update this story if they respond.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
