            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/660233/gta-6-trailer-rewatch-delay<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660057/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026">delay of <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> into next year</a> is a big deal. The game is the follow-up to arguably the biggest entertainment release of all time, one that originally debuted well over a decade ago. Even if <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/655394/gta-5-most-watched-twitch-game-gta-vi"><em>GTAV</em> is still going strong</a>, now spanning multiple console generations and with a surprisingly enduring online component, the hype for its sequel has been steadily building since 2013. Adding to the sheer amount of time is the mystery — we still know very little about what <em>GTAVI</em> actually is. So it’s a good time to revisit what we do know; namely, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23988446/gta-vi-trailer-leaked-vice-city">the single trailer released in 2023</a>.</p><p>Our first glimpse of the game runs almost entirely on vibes. Instead of gameplay or story, it covers a feeling, which is to say the feeling of Florida. <em>GTAVI</em> takes place in Leonida, Rockstar’s take on the Sunshine State, and the trailer is filled with those purple-pink skies, airboats plowing through the everglades, late-night streets races, a whole lot of pool parties, and of course alligators getting into mischief. Much of it is captured on a TikTok-like social network. There’s a slight introduction to the Bonnie and Clyde–style lead characters, including a woman named Lucia and her unnamed counterpart, but it’s not really clear what they’re up to (aside from the obvious crime).</p><p>And that’s it really. Even the official press release didn’t detail much more, saying simply that the game “heads to the state of Leonida, home to the neon-soaked streets of Vice City and beyond in the biggest, most immersive evolution of the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> series yet.” Anything else we know about the game (which isn’t much) comes from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/19/23360773/gta-6-leak-confirmed-hack-rockstar-games">a massive leak back in 2022</a>.</p><p>Even still, the trailer does a remarkable job of setting up what players are actually in for. Because really, <em>GTA</em> is a vibe. The series has never had the best action or driving or shooting. Instead, what has turned into a behemoth following <em>GTAIII</em> is the huge, expansive worlds it lets players explore. Even as open world games from other developers have continued to impress — whether it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/631744/assassins-creed-shadows-review-ubisoft"><em>Assassin’s Creed</em> in Japan</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/3/22959702/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-open-world-five-year-anniversary">Nintendo expanding Hyrule</a> — there’s still nothing quite like Rockstar’s realistic rendition of Americana. And the initial <em>GTAVI</em> trailer promises just that, only bigger, and with an absurd Florida twist.</p><p>Rockstar is one of the few developers that can not only make a game of this scale, but also afford to take its time like this. <em>GTAV</em> is a cash cow, and in between the studio has also filled that time up with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18021082/red-dead-redemption-2-review-xbox-one-ps4">a new <em>Red Dead Redemption</em></a>. When announcing today’s delay, <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258aa538o412ok/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-coming-may-26-2026">Rockstar explained that </a>“the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.” The hype for <em>GTAVI </em>has hit such a degree that it <em>has</em> to be right at launch — and when we’ve already waited 12 years, what’s one more?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
