            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>LeapFrog has announced a new electronic learning system that swaps controllers for a camera. In fact, the LeapMove looks like an oversized, kid-friendly webcam, but is designed to connect to TVs like a console and get kids off the couch using educational games that require full-body movements to play. It’s reminiscent of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/638490/microsoft-kinect-ghost-hunting">Xbox Kinect</a> or the PlayStation 2’s EyeToy, but simpler and much cheaper than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/705269/nex-playground-kid-friendly-gaming-console-amazon-prime-day-deal">competitors’ products</a> like the $249 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Playground-AI-Powered-Transforms-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0D2JGYX3F/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Nex Playground</a>.</p><p>The LeapMove will be available through retailers including Target, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMAGIC-CAM%2F14840114967%3F" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and Amazon for $69.99, and comes with 25 motion-based games designed for kids aged 4 to 7. It might be hard to pull the older end of that demographic away from games like Roblox, <em>Among Us</em>, and even <em>Fortnite</em>, but in addition to motion detection, the LeapMove uses its camera to make players appear as themselves or “whimsical characters” in several games, which may appeal to younger kids.</p><p>The games cover “foundational school subjects” including math, reading, and spelling, and require players to do everything from dancing around to waving their arms and even attempting to catch on-screen objects. The LeapMove connects to a TV over HDMI, and instead of rechargeable batteries it needs access to a power outlet. It can be used either sitting beneath a TV or perched atop it like a webcam using a fold-out support.</p><p>LeapFrog says additional games will be made available for the LeapMove at a later date, which can be loaded by connecting the device to a computer and using the company’s <a href="https://www.leapfrog.com/en-us/support/connect">LeapFrog Connect</a> desktop app. They won’t be free, but unlike the Nex Playground, the LeapMove doesn’t come with any subscription fees.</p><p>Parents concerned about privacy, particularly with devices that rely heavily on a camera, may appreciate that the LeapMove has no wireless connectivity. In 2018, VTech, LeapFrog’s parent company, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/8/16865652/vtech-connected-toy-ftc-fine-child-privacy">agreed to settle for a $650,000 fine</a> after the FTC alleged it collected kids’ personal information, including names, emails, and genders, through its <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.vtech.mobile.kidiconnect.useng" rel="sponsored">KidiConnect mobile app</a>. The LeapMove is completely standalone and keeps track of up to three players’ progress locally.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/717018/leapfrog-leapmove-motion-detection-gaming]]></content:encoded>
