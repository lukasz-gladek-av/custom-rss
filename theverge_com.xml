The feature, powered by Nvidia’s GeForce Now cloud gaming service, provides two 30-minute trial sessions per week to Discord users who don’t have Fortnite installed on their PC.</p><p>The <em>Fortnite</em> trial will be available until October 30th, with sessions updated every Tuesday at 9:59AM ET, according to Epic’s announcement. You can access the demos by <a href="https://fortnitetrial.fortnite.com/en-US/">clicking the sign-up link</a> on Epic’s announcement page, which will then redirect you to Discord. Availability is limited to PC players in the US, UK, Mexico, Canada, and several European countries. However, it’s worth flagging that myself and another UK-based colleague were unable to launch the experience in Discord without using a VPN that connected to the US.</p><p>There are no requirements to install <em>Fortnite</em> to play the demos, but users need to be signed into both their Discord and Epic Games accounts to connect them for the trial. Epic says that it doesn’t share players’ data with Nvidia or Discord, but notes that the companies “may independently” collect it. The <em>Fortnite</em> trials are the first of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760894/play-instantly-on-discord-fortnite-will-be-nvidia-try-before-you-buy-geforce-now">Nvidia and Discord’s instant game demo experiments</a>, which may enable Discord users to instantly try out other titles in the future.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/795897/epic-fortnite-discord-instant-game-demo-availability]]></content:encoded>
