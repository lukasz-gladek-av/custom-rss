He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Vampire Survivors</em> is finally launching cross-saves today, but they won’t be available on PlayStation to start and have a “very slim” chance of coming to the platform because of a “legal issue.” </p><p>“Last month, we told everyone that cross-save would be available on PlayStation 4 / 5, PC, Xbox, Android and iOS alongside our next free <em>VS</em> update in April,” according to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1794680%2Fview%2F529842339955345357" rel="sponsored">a Steam post from Poncle</a>, the game’s developer. “But at last [sic] minute, we’ve run into a legal issue on PlayStation we weren’t aware of that requires us to share info on our partners that we’re unable to. The chances of Cross-Save coming to PlayStation consoles are now very slim, but not impossible, so we’re going to keep working alongside PlayStation to resolve these problems.”</p><p>Poncle and PlayStation didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><p>Cross-saves are now available on Android, iOS, PC, and Xbox, Poncle says. <em>Vampire Survivors</em> on Nintendo Switch will also get cross-saves, but “at a later date.” Poncle wants to bring them to the Apple Arcade version of the game, but only “if we can do so without breaching any privacy commitments.” </p><p>If you want to turn on cross-saves, <a href="https://poncle.games/accounts">check out Poncle’s guide</a>. Note that cross-saves aren’t automatically synced, meaning you’ll have to manually save and load your save data across platforms as needed.</p><p>Alongside the cross-saves news, Poncle also released a free <em>Vampire Survivors</em> DLC expansion based on the Square Enix’s <em>SaGa</em> franchise titled <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3451100%2FVampire_Survivors_Emerald_Diorama%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Emerald Diorama</em></a> and a chicken-themed update to the main game that Poncle calls “The Coop.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
