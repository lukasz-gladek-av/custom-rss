As described in the blog post, “That means every cloud-enabled title, from original Xbox classics to Xbox Series X|S exclusives, is now in one place whether you own it or play through Xbox Game Pass.”</p><p>On console, you can find your recently played games through the “Play history” tile on the home page. Your recent titles will also surface on the Xbox PC app within the “Play history” tab beneath the “Most Recent” section, as well as in your library.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/767697/xbox-cross-device-play-history-cloud-gaming#comments">0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/767697/xbox-cross-device-play-history-cloud-gaming]]></content:encoded>

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/pc-portal-experience#pc-specs">EA is promising <em>Battlefield 6</em></a> will offer “the best PC experience in the history of the franchise,” including 4K resolution, 21:9 and 32:9 ultrawide monitors, HDR, uncapped framerates, both PS5 and Xbox gamepad support on PC, the ability to create and browse servers, streamer and incognito modes, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/faq#pc-faq">and more</a> — but it won’t require powerful hardware or even an SSD to get a bare-minimum experience. A 7-year-old budget gaming PC might do the job.</p><p>If you’re willing to settle for 1080p at 30fps in a online shooter (I won’t judge!) an RTX 2060 or RX 5600 XT or Arc A380 GPU with 6GB of video memory is apparently enough, with 16GB of RAM, 55GB of hard drive space, and a Core i5-8400 or Ryzen 5 2600 or equivalent.</p><p>That’s even slightly lower than the open beta required, which needed 75GB of storage, and today’s the first time we’re seeing what developers say it’ll take to play at 4K60 Ultra (you’ll want pretty potent CPU <em>and</em> GPU for that).</p><p>Though, BF6 is offering a full complement of Nvidia, AMD, and Intel super-resolution and latency reduction techniques (DLSS 4, FSR 4, XeSS 2) with frame generation if you don’t need a native 4K image.</p><p>Unfortunately, I won’t be able to get my friends to play it with me: they’re boycotting over <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2807960">its lack of Linux support</a>, as <em>BF6</em>’s anti-cheat spares no thought for those of us trying to ditch Windows. I liked the couple hours I spent with the beta, but I do <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/after-20-hours-with-the-battlefield-6-beta-i-believe-ea-has-a-ticking-time-bomb-on-its-hands-though-its-not-too-late-to-defuse-it/">share <em>PC Gamer</em>’s concerns</a> about the fast, <em>Call of Duty</em>-esque pacing and was glad to hear about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bunnyhop-elsewhere-streamers-ea-are-making-battlefield-6-more-strategic-less-run-and-gun-following-the-beta">the changes.</a></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/767582/battlefield-6-pc-requirements-are-pretty-chill-if-you-dont-mind-30fps#comments">3<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/767582/battlefield-6-pc-requirements-are-pretty-chill-if-you-dont-mind-30fps]]></content:encoded>
