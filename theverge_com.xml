The developers say there will be even more bots to find but they’re being kept secret for now. The new levels launch July 10th.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>A new challenger approaches.</p><p>Here’s the equation for a new fighting game. (<em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> - Capcom) + Arc Systems Works = <em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em>. The developers of the <em>Guilty Gea</em>r series have teamed up with Marvel to make a 4v4 tag team fighting game that harkens to the good ol’ days of <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em>.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>More ghosts.</p><p>We already knew that <em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> — the sequel to <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/654227/ghost-of-yotei-ps5-release-date-trailer">was launching on October 2nd</a>. And ahead of that debut, we got one more trailer showing off its samurai world. Meanwhile, a deeper look at the gameplay <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/state-of-play-ghost-of-yotei-gameplay-deep-dive-coming-july-2025/">is coming in July</a>.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6Njc5OTA5" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/679909/007-first-light-trailer-james-bond">James Bond game 007&nbsp;First Light gets first trailer</a></h2><div><p>Sony’s showcase had a pleasant surprise: the debut trailer for <em>007 First Light</em>. The James Bond game — which has some definite <em>Uncharted</em> vibes — doesn’t have a release date, but is slated to launch some time in 2026. And while it was announced at a PlayStation event, the debut trailer confirms it’s coming to Xbox, PC, and the Switch 2 in addition to the PS5.</p><p>The game appears to be an origin story, as players will follow a much younger version of Bond, at least compared to the films. <em>Hitman</em> developer IO Interactive announced that it was working on the franchise <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575090/james-bond-game-origin-io-interactive-007-project-hitman">way back in 2020</a>, so it’s been a long wait to see the actual game in action. The announcement also comes at an interesting time for the franchise overall, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/616488/amazon-now-has-creative-control-over-the-james-bond-franchise">which is now under the Amazon umbrella</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/679909/007-first-light-trailer-james-bond">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjgwMDE5" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/680019/playstation-project-defiant-arcade-fight-stick">PlayStation reveals a new arcade-style fighting stick</a></h2><div><p>PlayStation has announced Project Defiant, an arcade-style fighting stick that looks like it’ll be perfect to use with the newly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/679983/get-over-here">announced <em>Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</em></a>. Sony teased the device during the State of Play on Wednesday before revealing more <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/introducing-project-defiant-the-first-wireless-fight-stick-designed-by-sony-interactive-entertainment-for-ps5-and-pc/">details in a blog post</a>, which says the controller will let you wirelessly connect it to your PS5 or PC with PlayStation Link technology.</p><p>Sony says PlayStation Link offers “ultra-low latency” connectivity, allowing for precise responses to button inputs and stick movement.

Play the klassic titles including <em>MK 1, 2,</em> and <em>3</em>, their arcade, console, and even handheld editions. And because it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23848883/karateka-making-of-digital-eclipse-game-preservation">Digital Eclipse</a>, expect a ton of behind the scenes archival footage from the game’s earliest days in development.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Virtual thievery.</p><p>The <em>Thief</em> series is coming to VR with a new game called <em>Legacy of Shadow</em>. It looks to be exactly what it sounds like: an attempt to bring the stealth gameplay into a new level of immersion. It’s launching later this year on PSVR 2</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>F is for freaky.</p><p>That’s certainly the vibe I’m getting from the gameplay of <em>Silent Hill F</em>, which looks even creepier than the recent remake of <em>Silent Hill 2</em>. It’s launching on September 25th.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Digimon returns with another story in October.</p><p>It’s been years since we saw an entry in <em>Digimon</em>’s Story series, and now it’s returning with <em>Digimon Story Time Stranger</em> on October 3rd, 2025. The <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/games/digimon-story-time-stranger">game’s description</a> says it tells an “epic story that unravels the mystery of the world’s collapse” as you carry out turn-based battles with a variety of Digimon collected throughout the game.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6Njc5ODgw" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/679880/final-fantasy-tactics-remake-square-enix-ps5">Square Enix surprise announced a Final Fantasy Tactics remaster</a></h2><div><p>Not to be upstaged by all the Nintendo Switch 2 shenanigans, PlayStation decided to steal some of that attention back in the form of a major, nostalgia-fueled announcement: <em>Final Fantasy Tactic</em>s is getting a remake and it’s coming in September.</p><p><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> <em>The Ivalice Chronicles </em>will take players back to a time when <em>Final Fantasy</em> wasn’t an action RPG or even a turn-based RPG but an isometric strategy game. Take control of Ramza Beoulve as he fights in the Lion War and build an army of powerful fighters utilizing the game’s job system. But don’t expect just the standard RPG classes like Fighter, Black Mage, or Summoner. <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> has a host of unique, often arcane, and never-seen-again job types like Geomancer, Chemist, and Oracle. For this new edition, players will be able to choose between the classic version of the 1998 original PlayStation game or an enhanced version with fully-voiced dialogue and other quality of life improvements.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/679880/final-fantasy-tactics-remake-square-enix-ps5">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Take some Baby Steps this fall.</p><p>The latest infuriating game from Bennett Foddy and friends now has a release date: September 8th. I played the game earlier this year, so you can read all about what the open-world exploration experience is like below.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>More blood stains.</p><p>Koji Igarashi’s <em>Castlevania</em>-like gothic action series is getting a new sequel. It’s called <em>The Scarlet Engagement </em> and is “set in a haunting world years before” the original <em>Bloodstained</em>. It’s due out in 2026.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>The dad games will continue until morale improves.</p><p>PlayStation’s summer State of Play is going on right now and Capcom showed us a bit more of <em>Pragmata</em>, a game that looks like the developers crossed one of the Great America Dad Games like <em>Bioshock Infinite</em> or <em>God of War</em> with the slick hyper-realistic visuals of <em>Stellar Blade</em>. Not much of the gameplay was shown but we were given a 2026 launch window and introduced to our Elizabeth/Atreus analogue, an adorable little robot child named Diana.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Romeo must die.</p><p>At least I assume that’s what will happen in this ultra-violent action game <em>Romeo is a Deadman</em>. It looks wild and confusing, but what else would you expect from Suda51 and Grasshopper Manufacture. It launches in 2026.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Lumines rises.</p><p>The classic puzzler from Tetsuya Mizuguchi is coming back with <em>Lumines Arise</em>, and the new version looks a whole lot like <em>Tetris Effect.</em> No word on a release date, but it will have VR support.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>It’s (almost) Sony’s turn.</p><p>A week of gaming news chugs on, and up next is PlayStation’s latest State of Play. It kicks off at 5PM ET and is expected to last around 40 minutes.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjY5NTI3" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/669527/playstation-state-of-play-summer-2025-ps5">Playstation is holding its State of Play summer showcase this week</a></h2><div><p>Sony has announced it will hold a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/03/state-of-play-returns-june-4/">summer State of Play presentation</a> on Wednesday, June 4th, making this first week of June an all-timer for the video game industry.
