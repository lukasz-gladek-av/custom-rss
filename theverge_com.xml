            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/18/24299376/lg-ultragear-gx7-480hz-oled-gaming-monitor-price-availability<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>LG’s 27-inch OLED gaming monitor is one of the fastest models we’ve seen to date and it’s finally ready for preorder. The <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2024/11/lg-unveils-new-ultragear-oled-gaming-monitor-with-480hz-refresh-rate/">UltraGear 27GX790A</a> (or GX7 for short) is priced at $999.99 and is built around a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/3/24024042/lg-display-oled-480hz-oled-gaming-monitor">480Hz panel from LG Display</a> announced in early January with a 2560 x 1440 resolution and 0.03ms response time.</p><p>The base specs of the GX7 are on par with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24253167/sony-inzone-gaming-monitor-m10s-480hz-oled">$1,100 InZone M10S that Sony released</a> in September. That makes the UltraGear GX7 a smidge cheaper, but it lacks some of the performance modes and variable refresh rate features available on Sony’s offering.</p><p>The UltraGear GX7 is listed as <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-27gx790a-b-gaming-monitor">available for preorder on LG’s US website</a>, but there’s no mention of a delivery date and it can’t yet be added to the basket for checkout. We’ve reached out to LG for more information and will update here if we hear back.</p><div><figcaption><em>Here’s a shot of the UltraGear GX7 from the rear, showing the port locations behind the adjustable stand.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: LG</cite></p></div><p>The UltraGear GX7 is compatible with both Nvidia’s G-Sync and AMD’s FreeSync technology to help eliminate flickering and screen tearing issues. The display carries a DisplayHDR True Black 400 certification that supports a wide color gamut and impressive black levels, and an “Anti-Glare and Low Reflection” coating to improve the viewing experience in brightly lit environments.</p><p>The monitor features ports for HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 2.1, USB 3.0, and a headphone jack. It also comes with a slim, height-adjustable stand that can tilt up to 15 degrees, and swivel up to 30 degrees.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
