            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/615263/xbox-game-pass-microsoft-cloud-gaming-future<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Hello, and welcome to a special episode of <em>Decoder</em>! This is David Pierce, editor-at-large at <em>The Verge</em>. Nilay is off this week for a much-deserved break from what I can only describe as a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/612069/fcc-brendan-carr-elon-musk-donald-trump-first-amendment-free-speech-censorship">pretty bleak</a> news cycle. So I’m filling in for him, and the <em>Decoder</em> team thought this would be a good opportunity to switch gears a little bit from the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24348851/donald-trump-presidency-tech-science-news">political apocalypse beat</a> and talk about something completely different. </p><p>So today we’re diving into the video game industry and discussing a particular set of thorny problems facing Microsoft and its Xbox division. Microsoft is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, and for nearly half of that history, Xbox has been a central pillar of the company’s consumer hardware and software businesses. The first Xbox launched in 2001, and it has sat alongside Sony’s PlayStation and Nintendo as the Big Three of console gaming for the last quarter century. </p><p>But things in Xbox land have not been that great lately. In fact, Xbox has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242790/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-turmoil-notepad">struggling for quite some time now</a>. And a lot of the issues it’s facing can be traced back to core problems at the heart of software distribution: as video games get more expensive to make, and the demands for their scope, size, and quality become greater, how do you produce certifiable hits that get people to buy your hardware? How do you finance those hits, and when they launch, how do you get them into the hands of more consumers — consumers who may not want to buy an Xbox anymore and balk at the idea of shelling out $70 for a new game?</p><p>Nintendo and Sony seem to have this pretty much figured out, and both companies have been reaping the benefits of dominating the console-gaming market, albeit in different ways, since at least 2017. That’s when the first Switch launched and when it became clear Sony’s PS4 had cemented the PlayStation as the clear winner of the 2010s. But 2017 is also when Microsoft launched Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service designed to be a bit like Netflix for gaming. </p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer developed a master plan to shift the Xbox business model. After the better part of 20 years having proprietary hardware at the center of its strategy, Microsoft pivoted. The idea was it would lean on its expertise in cloud computing and its considerable war chest of software profits from Windows to try something new. It would mix subscription gaming, cloud streaming, and a willingness to put its software on competing platforms to try and break free from a losing race against its rivals. </p><div><p>Listen to <em>Decoder</em>, a show hosted by <em>The Verge</em>’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems.

Xbox is still in a distant third place in the console race, with some estimates putting Xbox hardware sales at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/612105/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-platform-changes-notepad">less than half the number of PS5’s Sony has sold</a>. That’s despite some record-breaking game studio acquisitions that have cost Microsoft almost $100 billion dollars. </p><p>Meanwhile, Nintendo is off in a league of its own. It has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/605948/nintendo-switch-lifetime-sales-nintendo-ds">sold more than 150 million Switch units</a> since that console launched, and the eventual Switch 2, coming later this year, is also expected to be a smash hit.</p><p>So, sure, GamePass is reasonably successful for what it is — but it definitely hasn’t changed the world like Netflix did to Hollywood. People are still mostly buying new games, sometimes even still on a disc from Best Buy or Walmart. Streaming a game to your phone or TV over the cloud remains pretty niche. </p><p>So, what exactly happened here? Why did Microsoft’s master plan not pan out? And can it still succeed if the right combination of factors comes together over the next several years? To break all this down, I invited Ash Parrish, <em>The Verge</em>’s video game reporter, on the show to talk all about the struggles of Xbox and Game Pass, as well as where she sees the future of the game industry headed next. </p><p>If you’d like to learn more about the topics we discussed in this episode, check out the links below:</p><div><ul><li><span>Xbox continues its push beyond consoles with new ad campaign | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296420/microsoft-this-is-an-xbox-marketing-campaign-xbox-everywhere"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></li><li><span>Why the video game industry is such a mess | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172733/summer-game-fest-video-game-announcements-layoffs-labor-live-service-fortnite"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></li><li><span>The next Xbox is going to be very different | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/612105/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-platform-changes-notepad"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></li><li><span>2025 looks like a great year for Xbox | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24351055/xbox-game-pass-releases-2025-notepad"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></li><li><span>Microsoft prepares to take Xbox everywhere | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24067370/microsoft-xbox-playstation-switch-games-future-hardware"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></li><li><span>Microsoft and Google are fighting over the future of Xbox | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313976/microsoft-google-xbox-app-android-future-notepad"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></li><li><span>Microsoft was the No.1 games publisher in the world last December | <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/microsoft-was-the-no-1-games-publisher-in-the-world-last-month/"><em>VGC</em></a></span></li><li><span>Xbox games in Game Pass ‘can lose 80% of premium sales’ | <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xbox-games-in-game-pass-can-reportedly-lose-80-of-premium-sales/"><em>VGC</em></a></span></li><li><span>Phil Spencer: No ‘red lines’ over Xbox games coming to Switch, PlayStation | <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation"><em>Eurogamer</em></a></span></li><li><span>Microsoft’s Xbox turmoil isn’t slowing down | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242790/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-turmoil-notepad"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></li><li><span>Microsoft says Game Pass is profitable as subscription growth slows | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/26/23425029/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-profitable-revenues"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></li></ul></div><div><div><h2>Decoder with Nilay Patel</h2><p>A podcast from <em>The Verge</em> about big ideas and other problems.</p></div><p><a href="https://pod.link/decoder"><span>SUBSCRIBE NOW!</span></a></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Developer Funcom announced that its upcoming multiplayer survival game <em>Dune: Awakening</em> will be launching on Steam on May 20th. But there are a pair of apps launching today that will help tide you over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24112467/dune-awakening-survival-game-preview-xbox-ps5-pc">until you can drink the blood of your enemies</a>.</p><p>First up is the character creator, which appears to take the form of <a href="https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Gom_Jabbar">the infamous Gom Jabbar test</a>. According to the developer, you’ll not only be able to set how your character looks but also choose “your home planet, caste, and mentor, be it Swordmaster, Bene Gesserit, Mentat, or Trooper,” which, in turn, will impact the abilities you have to start the game. Your choices can then carry over when the full game launches.</p><p>Also available today is a benchmark mode, which lets players test their systems to see if they can handle the game. Funcom says that players will be “treated to some epic scenes from the game, including soaring with an ornithopter and a dramatic encounter with a colossal sandworm.” Both the benchmark tool and the character creator are available <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1172710%2FDune_Awakening%2F" rel="sponsored">via Steam</a> for free.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/616019/scuf-valor-pro-hands-on-impressions-wired-xbox-controller<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Scuf just announced its latest pro-style controller for Xbox and PC, the first to come close to the $100 price point. The $99.99 Scuf Valor Pro — <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D1025X1701640%26xs%3D1%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fscufgaming.com%252Fxbox%252Fscuf-valor-pro-steel-gray" rel="sponsored">available for purchase starting today</a> in 15 different styles — isn’t exactly a budget controller in its own right, but context matters.</p><p>I’ve tested the delightfully translucent version of the controller for nearly two weeks now to see where exactly it fits among Scuf’s current Xbox lineup, consisting of the $169.99 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Instinct-Custom-Wireless-Performance-Controller-Mobile/dp/B06VTRJGCP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Instinct</a> and the $219.99 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22627413/scuf-instinct-pro-microsoft-xbox-controller-wireless-series-x-s-one-pc-features-price">Instinct Pro</a> (our previous pick for the best pro-style Xbox controller), both wireless. The wired-only and Valor Pro somehow sits in the middle. </p><p>It has the Instinct’s smooth thumb sticks with replaceable tops, now with Hall effect magnetism to reduce the chance of developing stick drift. It also borrows the flagship Instinct’s four programmable rear buttons, its dedicated switch for swapping between its three mapping profiles, and the interchangeable faceplates. </p><p>At the same time, you get the Instinct Pro’s rubberized rear grips (adding comfort while retaining that premium feel) and trigger stops. And yet, neither has the Valor Pro’s dedicated dials to adjust game volume and chat mix, nor the dedicated mute buttons embedded beneath both.</p><p>As a long-time Xbox gamer, I felt at home using the Valor Pro, which still largely takes after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/31/24210403/microsoft-xbox-controller-translucent-blue-model">the official Xbox Wireless Controller’s</a> ergonomic design. Scuf’s refinements to that winning formula seem minimal, but can make a meaningful difference. For example, the bumpers are a bit wider and a few millimeters longer than you’ll find on most controllers, draping further down each side. This makes it easier to shift my finger from the trigger to the bumper. </p><p>I don’t even have to remove my fingers from the triggers to press the bumpers. The design allows me to use the sides of my index fingers to actuate them with a light press. That meant I could lob grenades in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> while staying at the ready for a gunfight or jump out of fights as Doctor Strange in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> without lowering my shield. The travel and feel are consistent across the entire surface, so it doesn’t feel stabby or straining. </p><p>I immediately noticed the redesigned rear paddles, which felt off to me on the Instinct Pro. They’re in roughly the same position as the Instinct’s, designed for all four buttons to be comfortably reachable where your middle and ring fingers drape when gripping the controller.</p><p>But the two inside buttons have a bit more topside surface and use a downward vertical force for actuation instead of the horizontal motion required on the Instinct Pro. They’re easier to press while maintaining control over the bigger side paddles. They also don’t require as much force as they did on the Instinct Pro, but the give isn’t so light that misfires become problematic (and you can disable them entirely, if so).</p><div id=":R5irarr6:"><div><div><p><cite>Photo: Quentyn Kennemer / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p><cite>Photo: Quentyn Kennemer / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><div><div><p><cite>Photo: Quentyn Kennemer / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p><cite>Photo: Quentyn Kennemer / The Verge</cite></p></div></div></div><p>As much as I’ve tried, I’m simply not a back-button gamer. My proportionally stubby fingers combined with cast iron skillets I call palms make it difficult for me to use them effectively in most games. The Scuf Valor Pro is the first controller with four rear buttons that feel natural and don’t make me feel cramped.</p><p>PC gamers will soon get support for a 1KHz polling rate in a post-launch update. That update wasn’t available as of writing, but I’d wager you’d find the intended reduced input lag imperceptible if you aren’t the type to qualify for tournaments. I sure couldn’t tell the difference on other controllers I’ve tested with the feature.</p><p>Should you buy a Valor Pro? That depends. Although you can swap thumbstick sizes and remove two of the rear paddles, it’s not quite as customizable as something like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features">Xbox Elite Series 2</a>, but also not nearly as expensive. There are also considerably cheaper wired options with comparable features I’ve tested recently like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-FUSION-Controller-gamepad-Windows-Console/dp/B0D8T82K5C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$69.99 PowerA Fusion Pro 4</a>, which offers four rear buttons, Hall effect sticks with adjustable height, <em>and</em> Hall effect triggers with three stop levels. </p><p>Most don’t remain as faithful to the patented Xbox shape, however, and that might be a deciding factor. Perhaps after an eventual sale, the Valor Pro can be a great first stop for someone new to Scuf, so long as you don’t mind playing with a cable.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
