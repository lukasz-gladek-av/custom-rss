            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After recently admitting that it had a “spectacularly terrible response” to Joy-Con grip detachment complaints with its Killswitch Nintendo Switch 2 case, Dbrand <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lwrl9q/joycon_detachment_update_part_3_we_fixed_it/">has some good news</a>: it says its redesigned Joy-Con grips fix the issue <em>and</em> the company will be able to mass produce them.</p><p>Dbrand had already promised it would be replacing the grips for everyone, and now we know that the replacement will be the redesign instead of a refined version of what’s already available. Here’s a video from Dbrand showing the Joy-Con not detaching while being held from the Joy-Con with the updated grips.</p><p>In addition to the modification to the Joy-Con grips — which Dbrand is calling Joy-Lock — the company says it will be sending out silicone friction pads to place on the Killswitch adapter for Nintendo’s dock to address “the issue of one-handed undocking on our Dock Adapter” and keep the adapter “snugly seated” on the dock.</p><p>By “early next week,” Dbrand says it will “share a production schedule that outlines when you’ll be able to claim your free Joy-Lock replacements, and when you can expect them to ship.” New production and any unshipped orders will include the Joy-Lock Grips and have the silicone friction pads preinstalled on the Dock Adapter.</p><p>In June, some users of the original Killswitch Switch 2 case found that if they held the console primarily by a Joy-Con while the case and grips were on, the controller <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lgav3g/i_love_my_killswitch_2_buttttttt/">would pop off</a> and the console would drop down. Probably not what you want to have happen to your brand-new Nintendo console.</p><p>Dbrand published a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/">lengthy post</a> about the issue where it argued that “nobody routinely holds their Switch 2 like this” and that Joy-Con detachment only happens if you hold the console in a very specific way. But many users compared that response to when Steve Jobs told people running into iPhone 4 reception issues to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/06/25/iphone.problems.response/index.html">“just avoid holding it that way.”</a></p><p>The company soon after published <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1ljlhwy/joycon_detachment_update_part_2_were_fixing_it/">a mea culpa post</a> where it said that “you should be allowed to hold it however the fuck you want, without detachment occurring” and outlined how it was working on two potential fixes: a slightly tweaked version of the original grip and the one with a bigger redesign.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/704767/dbrand-switch-2-killswitch-joy-con-lock-grip-detachment-fixed]]></content:encoded>

Just getting that out of the way. The fastest-selling console ever came out on June 5th, and only <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/701385/amazon-nintendo-switch-2-listings">just hit Amazon’s storefront</a> for reservation a couple of days ago. Nevertheless, I thought it’d be fun to share some Prime Day deals I found on Switch 2 accessories and games that have been patched to run better on the new console. Whether you already have a Switch 2 or you’ll be getting one soon, there are some great money-saving opportunities below (ones that I wish I had a couple of weeks ago).</p><div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->30</span></p><div><p>This hard case has a soft touch and a slim fit, and includes a flap that can hold up to 12 cartridges as it protects the console’s screen.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->25</span></p><div><p>The official Nintendo Switch 2 webcam is expensive, so we suggest getting this cheaper Logitech 1080p model instead.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->10</span></p><div><p>For when you want to wire in when you’re on-the-go (and away from the dock), I can verify that this model works with the Switch 2.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->63</span></p><div><p>For something cheaper — and in some ways better — than Nintendo’s official Pro controller, there’s 8BitDo’s Ultimate 2, which works with the original Switch and Switch 2.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->50</span></p><div><p>While I haven’t tried it yet, many report that the Switch 2 works nearly perfectly with this model.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/antonio-g-di-benedetto">Antonio G. Di Benedetto</a> <span>is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget. He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Razer is <a href="https://press.razer.com/product-news/razer-unveils-the-ultra-lightweight-deathadder-v4-pro/">announcing</a> a new gaming mouse, the $169.99 <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Frazer-deathadder-v4-pro%2FRZ01-05330100-R3U1" rel="sponsored">DeathAdder V4 Pro</a>. This fresh version of its popular wireless mouse promises to be faster, lighter, and yet more power efficient than its <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Frazer-deathadder-v3-pro%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOoqtJ4YABIVV4jz3ZbSQH90nDRypdGLfQ-5R7dpuWcOav8dj-PY-" rel="sponsored">V3 Pro</a> predecessor. </p><p>The V4 Pro now uses <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Ftechnology%2Frazer-focus-pro-sensor" rel="sponsored">optical sensors</a> for its left- and right-click buttons that are rated for 100 million clicks. It’s also Razer’s first model to use a scroll wheel with an optical sensor rather than being mechanical. Razer claims the optical scroll wheel sensor is more precise, offering “triple the durability and consistent, tactile control even under intense gameplay.”</p><p>The new DeathAdder Pro supports up to 8,000Hz polling rate in both wireless and wired modes, thanks to its HyperSpeed Wireless Gen 2 connectivity. However, to get Razer’s claim of up to 150 hours of battery life you’ll have to use the mouse at a much slower 1,000Hz polling (which is, to be fair, still pretty quick).</p><p>Since this mouse is designed for fast-action use in twitchy esports matches, its 45K optical sensor supports up to 45,000 DPI tracking. And the black version of the new DeathAdder weighs just 56 grams, while the model in white weighs one gram more. </p><p>The promised specs are impressive. But on the downside, the DeathAdder remains an asymmetrical design for right-handed users. And with its slightly oversized shape, the mouse caters to users with larger hands that can grip it without discomfort. The DeathAdder V4 Pro is up for preorder now <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2FRazer-DeathAdder-V4-Pro%2FRZ01-05330200-R3U1" rel="sponsored">on Razer’s site</a>, estimated to ship July 24th.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/704581/razer-deathadder-v4-pro-wireless-gaming-mouse-specs]]></content:encoded>
