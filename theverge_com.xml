            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/617730/hades-2-getting-better-early-access<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Hades II</em> just received its second major update as part of its early access development, which was a great excuse for me to jump back in. Since its initial release, I’ve logged more than 30 hours and actually held myself back from playing much more – I don’t want to get tired of the game before it hits 1.0 – but with the new update, I wanted to see what’s new and try to beat the new final boss on my very first run.</p><p>Sadly, I haven’t even been able to see what the boss is yet. I <em>did</em> make it to the update’s new region, but I got destroyed by a dangerous miniboss. Still, I’ve still been really impressed with what Supergiant Games has added since May to make what’s already a very good game even better.</p><p>The big additions are impressive. <em>Hades II</em> initially launched with six regions — four for an Underworld route and two for a “surface” route — and with each major update, Supergiant has added a new region with new enemies, characters, and music to round out that surface route.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271897/hades-ii-2-major-update-olympic">first major update</a>, which came out in October, added the game’s first new region, Mount Olympus, and it feels as epic as Mount Olympus should. It has grand architecture, fearsome enemies, and a fiery boss fight against Prometheus, all backed by an incredible orchestral soundtrack. (I’ve spent more time than I’d like to admit listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjiYUgx74rU">this song on loop</a>.)</p><p>That update also added the game’s sixth and final weapon – a witch-y, <em>Hades</em>-style interpretation of a mech suit. Seriously: your primary attack is punching baddies with giant fists while your special attack shoots projectiles that home in on nearby targets. You also have cool wings.</p><p>In the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615857/hades-ii-2-warsong-update">second major update</a>, there’s a new region and boss, too, but I’ve also noticed a lot of smaller details that feel just as impactful. For example, the Altar of Ashes, a place where you pick from various passive effects in the form of arcana cards that can help your runs, got a visual redesign to add intricately-illustrated custom cards. (One of them features Theseus and the Minotaur, who you may remember as bosses from the first <em>Hades</em>, in thongs, lol.) I also spotted a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/1itjeu2/this_new_mel_portrait_is_so_adorable/">charming new portrait for Melinoë</a>, the game’s protagonist, that added some levity to a character that’s usually pretty serious.</p><p>And throughout the major updates and many smaller patches, Supergiant has rebalanced and changed all sorts of mechanics and details in ways that I can honestly barely begin to keep track of. The studio isn’t afraid to take the hatchet to things that need to go, too; with this most recent patch, Supergiant scrapped an entire mechanic tied to gathering.</p><p>Overall, the changes have made the game feel better to play over time – and browsing patch notes, Supergiant uses an emoji to indicate which changes are inspired by community feedback, which I think is a good way to acknowledge how players are contributing to the game, which is one of the main benefits of this type of early access release. (I should also acknowledge that <em>Hades II</em> has the advantage of building from the already-great foundation of the first <em>Hades.</em>)</p><p><em>Hades II</em> might not launch in 1.0 for a long time. Supergiant hasn’t committed to a timeframe for that, and it’s still working on a third major update that’s set to release “some months from now.” Because of the success of Supergiant’s other games, like <em>Bastion</em> and <em>Transistor</em>, the studio probably doesn’t need to rush.</p><p>But given how it’s treated <em>Hades II’s</em> early access so far, I’m fine if Supergiant takes its time. Even though <em>Hades II</em> isn’t finished, I have no qualms about recommending the game to anyone that’s interested. And jumping in now lets you experience just how much an already-great game can improve over time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
