            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/8/24316130/apple-vision-pro-sony-psvr2-controller-support-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Vision Pro could gain support for Sony PSVR2 controllers soon, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-12-08/apple-sony-talk-playstation-vr-ps-vr2-hand-controller-support-for-vision-pro?srnd=undefined">according to Mark Gurman</a> in today’s <em>Power On</em> newsletter for <em>Bloomberg. </em>Apple and Sony apparently planned to announce support for the controllers “weeks ago” but have pushed back the rollout. Under this rumored partnership, Apple would begin selling Sony’s controllers, which aren’t currently available on their own.</p><p>Sony has apparently been working on adding the support for months, while Apple has asked third-party developers if they would take advantage of Sony’s VR controllers. That’s potentially great news for Vision Pro owners who wish the headset had more gaming chops. (There are precious few good, native visionOS games — <em>Thrasher, </em>a mesmerizing game where you fling a giant worm / dragon thing around a psychadelic space using just hand movements, comes to mind.) </p><p>Gurman writes that Apple also wants to use the controllers for more than gaming — the controllers will be able to navigate visionOS, and would offer more precise controls in apps like Final Cut Pro and Adobe Photoshop. Right now, you can pair a standard Bluetooth controller and navigate visionOS — tapping buttons to select things, scrolling with the analog sticks, and so on. They also work for gaming, but you’re mostly limited to iPad and iPhone games with controller support or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24139004/apple-app-store-retro-game-emulators-ios-console-ports-storystream">made-for-iOS emulators</a> or that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/10/24217643/vision-pro-nintendo-virtual-boy-emulator-virtualfriend-impressions">native Virtual Boy one</a>.</p><p>Will this partnership bear fruit and help games actually flourish on the platform? I’m not immediately hopeful, given the Vision Pro’s sales and Apple’s track record of support from game publishers.</p><p>Still, the Vision Pro is fundamentally different from Apple’s other devices, and VR is its own landscape. And there are signs the community wants this, with at least one <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/surreal-interactive/surreal-touch-1-controllers-for-apple-vision-pro">fully-funded Kickstarter project</a> to develop Meta Quest 3-style controllers, called the Surreal Touch, for the Vision Pro. Maybe the Vision Pro will get some great VR games — whether anyone will be around to buy them is another question entirely.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24315781/gamers-nexus-video-reply-nzxt-defense-misleading-customers-flex-pc-rentals<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Gamers Nexus has released a video deconstructing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313974/nzxt-flex-pc-rental-response">NZXT’s defense</a> of its Flex gaming PC purchase and rental program. In it, host Steve Burke says the company is still misleading customers, despite adjustments made in response to his previous video in which he <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/1/24310181/nzxt-pc-rental-program-gamers-nexus-investigation">called the program</a> “a scam.”</p><p>NZXT <a href="https://nzxt.com/news/nzxt-update-addressing-your-concerns-about-the-flex-subscription-program">said in its response</a> this week that it would clarify details about its Flex program, which Gamers Nexus had criticized for having specs that would change sometimes “day-to-day.” The company has appeared to update specs and performance numbers for its purchase builds. But Gamers Nexus reports it still spotted issues like inconsistent FPS numbers and a FAQ that implied NZXT’s for-sale Player: Three Prime build uses an RTX 4090 graphics card, despite its specs saying otherwise. </p><p>The FAQ entry Burke mentions seems to be gone now, but as of this writing, there’s still an entry titled “What GPU is right for me?” that lists the RTX 4090 and its benefits. Such inconsistencies are a problem for potential customers, Burke says.</p><div><blockquote><p>The fact that NZXT misrepresented its product, even after its statement, as having a 4090 when it still had a 4080 Super ... seemingly indicates that even NZXT can’t keep up with its own specs changes. If NZXT can’t keep up with it ... how are they expecting the customer to keep up with it?</p></blockquote></div><p>Gamers Nexus offers other criticisms of the company’s rental program, from “improper packaging” damage fees with upper bounds that exceed the cost of equivalent non-rental versions of the PCs to the creator-based ad videos that continue to exist, despite the company saying it had “pulled all influencer-led Flex advertising.” NZXT did not immediately respond to our request for comment on the new video.</p><p>Gamers Nexus said Thursday that it’s working on a deeper investigation, and its video today ends with Burke saying he’s received “a number of very concerning tips” from former employees and customers. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
