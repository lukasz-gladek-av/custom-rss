Out of the roughly 1,000 reviews posted today, more than 300 have been negative.</p><p>Along with <em>Palworld</em> and <em>Helldivers 2</em>, <em>Marvel Rivals </em>has proved one of the standouts in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312584/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-refunds">series </a>of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">live-service</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317407/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-final-season-offline-mode">flops</a> in the face of stiff competition from entrenched live-service games like <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Fortnite</em>. It’s in the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lihyilygps2s">top 5 games</a> based on weekly active users across Xbox, PlayStation, and Steam and it’s currently sitting at number three on <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/">Steam’s most-played games chart</a>. And yet, apparently, that wild success wasn’t enough to insulate its US team from layoffs.</p><p>Sasser vocalized the disconnect in his LinkedIn post, writing, “This is such a weird industry…”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
