Last December it introduced several <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/840068/analogue-3d-transparent-funtastic-limited-edition">transparent versions of the Analogue 3D</a> inspired by Nintendo’s Funtastic N64 series, but this time the company says it drew inspiration from colored versions of the nearly 30-year-old console that Nintendo prototyped, but never released to the public.</p><p>The Prototype Limited Editions versions of the Analogue 3D will be <a href="https://www.analogue.co/3d">available for purchase through the company’s website</a> in limited quantities starting on February 9th at 8AM PT / 11AM ET, and are expected to ship 24 to 48 hours after that. Each will be $299.99, which is slightly more expensive than the $269.99 black or white versions of the console. The new colors include extreme green, ocean, atomic purple, ghost, and glacier, with the last three options being subtler alternatives to the colored collection that launched last December.</p><p>Alongside the new color options, and also available in limited quantities, will be color-matched versions of the 8BitDo 64 Bluetooth controller launching on the same day for $44.99 — which is about $5 more expensive than the standard version. However, the controllers are not expected to ship until sometime in April.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/874494/analogue-3d-4k-n64-console-prototype-limited-editions]]></content:encoded>
