The Xbox app will let LG TV owners stream Xbox games directly to their TVs, and use a wireless controller to play them.</p><p>The Xbox app will be available for LG’s 2022 OLED TVs, select 2023 smart TVs, and newer models and smart monitors that are running webOS24 or higher. It will also soon be available for LG’s portable StanbyME screens. The Xbox app is built into the LG gaming portal on the latest 2025 LG TVs, but for older models you’ll have to head into the LG app store and download the Xbox app.</p><p>LG’s 2022 OLED TVs and select 2023 smart TVs will also need the latest firmware upgrade to run the Xbox app, and you’ll have to connect a Bluetooth-enabled controller and subscribe to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to stream Xbox games to your TV.</p><p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/9/23159460/microsoft-xbox-tv-app-samsung-2022-tv-xbox-cloud-gaming-streaming">first launched its Xbox TV app</a> on Samsung’s range of smart TVs in 2022, before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/14/23959795/samsung-cloud-gaming-hub-boosteroid-tvs">expanding it</a> to older models a year later. The app looks very similar to the web version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, and aims to provide a console-like experience without the need to purchase an Xbox Series S / X device. The Xbox TV app is a big part of Microsoft’s strategy to expand Xbox to multiple devices and make it clear that it thinks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296420/microsoft-this-is-an-xbox-marketing-campaign-xbox-everywhere">every screen is an Xbox now</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Most major retailers — including <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-2-System%2F15949610846%2F" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fnintendo-switch-2-system-multi%2F6614313.p" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-2-console%2F-%2FA-94693225%23lnk%3Dsametab" rel="sponsored">Target</a> — will open preorders at 12AM ET on April 24th / 9PM PT on April 23rd, offering gamers a chance to reserve Nintendo’s forthcoming console ahead of its release on June 5th. Nintendo is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Fhow-to-buy%2F" rel="sponsored">also accepting sign-ups</a> for those looking to secure a Switch 2, though, if you do go that route, be aware that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641559/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gameplay-requirements">there are strict requirements</a>.</p><p>Overall, Nintendo appears to be hopeful that it has built up sufficient inventory of its next-generation portable gaming system to meet US demand — something Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645534/nintendo-switch-2-supply-demand-inventory-us-tariffs-doug-bowser" target="_blank">reiterated during a recent CNBC appearance</a>. Still, there’s no guarantee, which is why we recommend taking taking a few moments ahead of the preorder window to best improve your chances of securing a console.</p><p>Here’s what you should know.</p><div><nav><h2>In this article</h2><ul><li><a href="#landing-pages-and-online-start-times">Landing pages and online start times</a></li><li><a href="#what-switch-2-configurations-will-be-available">What Switch 2 configurations will be available?</a></li><li><span><a href="#how-should-i-prepare-for-preorders">How should I prepare for preorders?</a></span><ul><li><a href="#create-accounts-at-every-retailer">Create accounts at every retailer</a></li><li><a href="#download-the-mobile-apps">Download the mobile apps</a></li><li><a href="#sign-up-for-retailer-notifications">Sign up for retailer notifications</a></li><li><a href="#skip-the-accessories-for-now">Skip the accessories (for now)</a></li><li><a href="#bookmark-this-page">Bookmark this page</a></li></ul></li><li><span><a href="#where-can-i-preorder-the-switch-2">Where can I preorder the Switch 2?</a></span><ul><li><a href="#walmart">Walmart</a></li><li><a href="#how-to-preorder-at-target">GameStop</a></li><li><a href="#best-buy">Best Buy</a></li><li><a href="#target">Target</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div><div><p id="landing-pages-and-online-start-times"><h2>Landing pages and online start times</h2></p></div><div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->449</span></p><div><p>Preorders start at 12AM ET on April 24th / 9PM PT on April 23rd.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->450</span></p><div><p>Preorders start at 12AM ET on April 24th / 9PM PT on April 23rd.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->450</span></p><div><p>Preorders start at 12AM ET on April 24th / 9PM PT on April 23rd.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->450</span></p><div><p>Preorders start at 11AM ET / 8AM PT on April 24th.</p></div></div></div><div><p id="what-switch-2-configurations-will-be-available"><h2>What Switch 2 configurations will be available?</h2></p></div><p>At launch, the Nintendo Switch 2 will be available in two distinct configurations: a $449.99 standard version and a $499.99 bundle that includes the latest <em>Mario Kart</em> title, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em>. Nintendo is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641933/switch-2-mario-kart-world-bundle-limited-time-production">on record saying</a> the bundle will only be available through fall 2025 (or while supplies last), which is a shame, considering picking up the console / game combo saves you $30 on what is likely to be the Switch 2’s biggest launch title. If you don’t manage to secure the bundle, you can pick up <em>Mario Kart World</em> separately <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMario-Kart-World-U-S-Version%2F15940407280" rel="sponsored">for a whopping $79.99</a>.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that prices could change down the line. Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643616/nintendo-switch-2-us-preorders-date">recently raised the price</a> of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642024/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controllers-mouse-magnetic-attach-c-button">Switch 2 Joy-Con</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637833/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-details">Pro Controller</a> in response to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">US tariffs</a>, and has said that “other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future depending on market conditions.” The starting price of the Nintendo Switch 2 remains unchanged, but at this point, it feels like the only way to guarantee a console at $449.99 is to purchase one at launch.</p><div><p id="how-should-i-prepare-for-preorders"><h2>How should I prepare for preorders?</h2></p></div><p>If the the rollout of Sony’s PlayStation 5 is any indication, retailers aren’t always well-equipped to handle the massive influx of interest when it comes to console preorders. Inventory for the Switch 2 is likely to be limited as well, which is why we suggest taking a few steps to set yourself up for success <em>ahead</em> of when preorders open on Thursday, April 24th. We’ll do our best to let you know which retailers still have inventory as the night proceeds, but in the meantime, we’ve rounded up a few helpful tips that should help you improve your odds.</p><div><p id="create-accounts-at-every-retailer"><h3>Create accounts at every retailer</h3></p></div><p>First things first: create accounts at Walmart, GameStop, Target, Best Buy, and Amazon if you haven’t done so already. So far, none of the confirmed retailers for the Switch 2 have announced plans to implement a digital queue; however, Best Buy and Walmart have done so with prior console launches in an effort to deter scalpers. That being the case, ensure your account is set up with the appropriate credentials. Confirm your location and delivery info, get your payment details in order, and log in to your account ahead of time.</p><div><p>... most retailers won’t hold your console while you’re in the checkout line</p></div><p>Setting up and verifying this information in advance will help streamline the checkout process, thus allowing you to save precious seconds. This is crucial, given most retailers won’t hold your console while you’re in the checkout line.</p><div><p id="download-the-mobile-apps"><h3>Download the mobile apps</h3></p></div><p>If you own a smartphone, we recommend downloading — and logging into — the respective retailer apps for Walmart, Amazon, GameStop, Best Buy, and Target. In the past, we’ve found that the dedicated mobile apps for various retailers are faster than using a traditional browser; they also provide an additional means of procuring a console, thus increasing your chances of securing a Switch 2 at launch.</p><div><p id="sign-up-for-retailer-notifications"><h3>Sign up for retailer notifications</h3></p></div><p>A couple of retailers, specifically <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fnintendo%2Fnintendo-notifications%2Fpcmcat1736965129196.c%3F" rel="sponsored" target="_blank">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2F20019700.html" rel="sponsored" target="_blank">GameStop,</a> allow you to sign up for preorder updates regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, games, and accessories. So far, neither retailer has divulged much beyond what is available on their retail sites; however, they do serve as yet another opportunity to stay informed regarding how each retailer plans to handle the Switch 2 rollout going forward.</p><div><p id="skip-the-accessories-for-now"><h3>Skip the accessories (for now)</h3></p></div><p>Nintendo will have a raft of new accessories available for the Switch 2 at launch, including a Switch 2 Pro Controller, carrying cases, and even a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641352/nintendo-switch-2-camera-launch">camera accessory for video chats</a>. And while it might be tempting to stack your cart with add-ons, preordering Nintendo’s first-party peripherals takes time that’s better spent on securing a console. Plus, accessory preorders don’t typically sell out nearly as fast as consoles, meaning you can always circle back for extras at Walmart, Best Buy, and other retailers once you’ve managed to reserve your Switch 2.</p><div><p id="bookmark-this-page"><h3>Bookmark this page</h3></p></div><p>This should come as no surprise, but we’ll be updating this page when preorders go live at midnight on April 24th, allowing you to see at a glance which retailers are still accepting preorders on either the standalone console or the pricier <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle.</p><p>A number of other social media accounts — including <a href="https://x.com/Wario64">Wario64</a> and <a href="https://x.com/mattswider">Matt Swider of <em>The Shortcut</em></a> — are likely going to be tracking preorder inventory as well, if you’re looking for additional publications / users to follow in the run-up to the Switch 2 launch.</p><div><p id="where-can-i-preorder-the-switch-2"><h2>Where can I preorder the Switch 2?</h2></p></div><p>Right now, the only confirmed retailers for the Nintendo Switch 2 are Walmart, GameStop, Best Buy, and Target. We anticipate Amazon opening preorders at some point, but based on our previous experience covering console launches, the rollout at Amazon is likely to be sporadic and unpredictable. Either way, we’ll update this post accordingly if Amazon and other retailers begin offering preorders.</p><div><p id="walmart"><h3>Walmart</h3></p></div><p>According to a countdown timer at the top of <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fshop%2Fswitch2" rel="sponsored">Walmart’s Switch 2 landing page</a>, the retailer will open online preorders at 12AM ET on April 24th. Walmart’s website also indicates that, if you preorder the console before 8AM ET on June 4th, you should receive it before 9AM ET on June 5th. There are also already dedicated landing pages for both the <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-2-System%2F15949610846%2F" rel="sponsored">standalone Switch 2</a> ($449) and the <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-2-Mario-Kart-World-Bundle%2F15928868255%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Mario Kart World </em>bundle</a> ($499), along with games like <em><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FDonkey-Kong-Bananza-U-S-Version%2F15949810208%2F" rel="sponsored">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></em> ($69) and accessories such as the <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-2-Pro-Controller%2F15955005005%2F" rel="sponsored">Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> ($84).</p><div><p id="how-to-preorder-at-target"><h3>GameStop</h3></p></div><p>GameStop <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1913334018604716304">confirmed on X</a> that in-store preorders for the Switch 2 will begin when “doors open” on April 24th, with online preorders starting the same day at 11AM ET. The retailer has already published dedicated landing pages for the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2F424543.html" rel="sponsored">standalone console</a> and the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-2-console-and-mario-kart-world-bundle%2F424542.html" rel="sponsored"><em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle</a>, and the company has announced that “all stores” will open on June 5th at 12AM ET / June 4th at 9PM PT for the console’s launch.</p><p>If you’re looking to bring the cost down, GameStop will be offering up to $175 off a Switch 2 when you trade in a Switch OLED, or up to $125 off when you trade in a regular Switch. In both instances, you’ll need everything that came with your console — specifically the Switch, its dock, two working Joy-Con controllers (with wrist straps), an HDMI cable, and a power cord. GameStop also <a href="https://gizmodo.com/switch-2-buyers-hold-on-to-your-original-switch-the-resale-is-not-worth-it-2000592660">confirmed to <em>Gizmodo</em></a> that exact valuation will depend on the condition of your console, including whether your Joy-Cons are experiencing the dreaded stick drift.</p><div><p id="best-buy"><h3>Best Buy</h3></p></div><p>As of this writing, Best Buy has provided the most details about preorder availability, both online and in-store. Online preorders <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo%2Fpcmcat1742407305710.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1742407305710" rel="sponsored">begin at 12AM on April 24th</a> via the Best Buy app and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fnintendo%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fpcmcat1476977522176.c" rel="sponsored">BestBuy.com</a>, or in-store on April 24th at the “start of regular store hours.” Furthermore, most Best Buy stores in the US will open at 12AM ET, 11PM CT, 10PM MT, and 9PM PT on June 5th for preorder pickup.</p><p>Additionally, if you’re a My Best Buy Plus and or Total member, you’ll be able to score $20 in credit for every $150 you spend (up to $100) on Nintendo games and gear. That means if you are a member of Best Buy’s loyalty program, you’ll receive a $60 certificate when you buy a standalone console or the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle. That privilege will <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Felectronics%2Fbest-buy-membership%2Fpcmcat1679668833285.c" rel="sponsored">run you at least $49.99 a year</a>, though both tiers also grant you access to exclusive discounts, free two-day shipping, and other perks.</p><p>Unfortunately, we’re currently unsure whether the retailer intends to implement a queue system, as it did with the PS5 release.
