The fantasy-inspired game got its first trailer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/8/23500114/earthblade-trailer-extremely-ok-games-the-game-awards-2022">in late 2022</a>, and the game would have let you explore a “free-roaming, dynamically-loading map,” Extremely OK Games’ Maddy Thorson said at the time. But the team decided to cancel the game in December after a team conflict and because of the pressure of trying to follow up on <em>Celeste</em>, Thorson says <a href="https://exok.com/posts/2025-01-22-earthblade-final-update/">in a post detailing what happened</a>.</p><p>The “disagreement” was between Thorson and Noel Berry (Thorson refers to the two of them as “us”) and Pedro Medeiros over “the IP rights of <em>Celeste</em>,” Thorson says. “We eventually reached a resolution, but both parties also agreed in the end that we should go our separate ways,” and Medeiros is currently working on <a href="https://saint11.art/games/neverway/">a game called <em>Neverway</em></a>. “Losing Pedro wasn’t the only factor in cancelling the game, but it did prompt us to take a serious look at whether fighting through to finish <em>Earthblade</em> was the right path forward,” Thorson says.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20857240/celeste-farewell-dlc-expansion-masterpiece-platformer-game-release-date">huge success of <em>Celeste</em></a> also “applied pressure on us to deliver something bigger and better with <em>Earthblade</em>, and that pressure is a large part of why working on it has become so exhausting,” Thorson says. “Pedro isn’t to blame for this — in fact the split with him has given us the clarity to see that we have lost our way, and the opportunity to admit defeat.”</p><p>Thorson and Berry want to refocus on “smaller-scale projects” and are “prototyping again” to try and “rediscover game development in a manner closer to how we approached it at <em>Celeste’s</em> or <em>TowerFall’s</em> inception.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349781/nvidia-quad-slot-titan-ada-4090-gpu-cooler-prototype-real<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia has posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDr1pr_c6ts">a new video</a> showcasing a history of Founders Edition graphics card designs that explores the design of its new RTX 5090 and confirms a previously leaked prototype that used an unconventionally large four-slot design. </p><p>As noted by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-finally-shows-off-its-quad-slot-triple-fan-rtx-40-titan-prototype-with-rotated-pcb"><em>VideoCardz</em></a>,&nbsp;the prototype “Titan ADA” card first revealed by leaker Kopite7kimi included a triple-fan cooling system, and earlier this month, Gamers Nexus <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyliMCnrANI">tested and tore down</a> a working version of the prototype.</p><p>In the video published today, Nvidia’s EVP of system products, Andrew Bell, explains that Nvidia cards were trending larger and larger, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24168870/nvidia-sff-ready-enthusiast-geforce-card">and they wanted to change that</a>. “We didn’t like the idea of it taking up four slots; it was big, it was unwieldy, it worked in a limited number of chassis,” Bell said.</p><p>Bell says that the prototype triple-fan cooling system influenced Nvidia’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/18/24105157/nvidia-blackwell-gpu-b200-ai">Blackwell architecture</a>. However, the latest RTX 5090 Founders Edition card that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24347693/nvidia-rtx-5090-vs-rtx-4090-design-fans-hardware">we are currently testing</a> achieves its goals through a modular four-part design with a separate I/O board that allows air to flow through for a more efficient and compact cooler. According to Nvidia, these changes are why the new 5090 fits in two slots on the motherboard compared to the previous three-slot 4090. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
