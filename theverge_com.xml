Unlike the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24187539/gamesir-g8-bluetooth-mobile-controller-ios-android-nintendo-switch-pc">GameSir G8 Plus</a> that offers similar functionality by clamping on to the top and bottom of a phone turned sideways recreating the ergonomics of the Nintendo Switch, this new controller is much smaller and keeps the phone vertical. GameSir didn’t make any formal announcements of what the accessory is called, what it will cost, compatibility, or when it will be released.</p><p>Although the accessory is visible in the background of a <a href="https://x.com/mygamesir/status/1971130648166564029">photo GameSir shared of its TGS booth on X</a>, better photos were shared by the <a href="https://x.com/yoshivesmovie">X account, @Yoshivesmovie</a>, after getting the chance to go hands-on with the controller. The C-shaped accessory slides on to the bottom of a smartphone and features a D-pad, Start and Select buttons, and four action buttons that are all styled after the Game Boy’s. There’s also a pair of additional face buttons plus shoulder buttons on the back ensuring it can be used to play more than just <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24150467/delta-emulator-apple-app-voice-notes-ai-vergecast">emulated Game Boy titles</a>.</p><p>It’s not known how the controller will connect to a smartphone, but the photos seem to show a cutout on the bottom that may keep a phone’s charging port accessible. If the accessory isn’t relying on a USB-C connection, it will probably use Bluetooth which also means it will have its own rechargeable battery. Having yet another accessory to remember to charge isn’t ideal, but the ergonomics look much better than the recently announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/785720/xiaomi-retro-handheld-phone-case-17-pro-gaming">Retro Handheld Console Case for the Xiaomi 17 series smartphones</a> that only works with the camera bump screen on the back of the phone.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/787200/gamesir-controller-smartphone-nintendo-game-boy-tokyo-game-show]]></content:encoded>

If approved, it will mark one of the biggest buyouts of a publicly traded company.</p><div><blockquote><p>The transaction was approved by EA’s Board of Directors, is expected to close in Q1 FY27 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and approval by EA stockholders. Following the close of the transaction, EA’s common stock will no longer be listed on any public market.</p><p>The transaction will be funded by a combination of cash from each of PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners as well as roll-over of PIF’s existing stake in EA, constituting an equity investment of approximately $36 billion, and $20 billion of debt financing fully and solely committed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., $18 billion of which is expected to be funded at close. Each of PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners plan to fund the equity component of the financing entirely from capital under their respective control.</p></blockquote></div><div><blockquote><p>Upon completion of the transaction, EA will remain headquartered in Redwood City, California and continue to be led by Andrew Wilson as CEO.</p></blockquote></div><p>PIF, which already holds a nearly 10 percent stake in EA and has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/10/us/jared-kushner-saudi-investment-fund.html">poured money</a> into Affinity Partners, also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/1/23948992/saudi-arabia-gaming-investment">invests in other gaming giants</a> like Nintendo, Take-Two Interactive, and Capcom. The companies announced the agreement just days before EA plans to launch <em>Battlefield 6</em> on October 10th.</p><p>Like other game publishers, EA’s business has experienced some turbulence in recent months, with the company laying off staff and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/658468/ea-layoffs-respawn-entertainment-titanfall-canceled">canceling upcoming <em>Titanfall</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675923/black-panther-cancelled-cliffhanger-studios-shut-down-ea"><em>Black Panther</em> titles</a>.
