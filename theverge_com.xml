Nintendo’s latest console officially launches in the US tomorrow, June 5th, bringing with it more processing power, a larger 7.9-inch LCD display, and an all-new racing title in the form of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em>. Preorders for the $449 hybrid console remain sold out; however, if you’re looking to grab one on launch day, rest assured that a handful of retailers have announced availability, both in-store and online.</p><p>So far, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-2-System%2F15949610846%2F" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2F424543.html" rel="sponsored">GameStop</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fnintendo-switch-2-system-multi%2F6614313.p" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-2-console%2F-%2FA-94693225%2F" rel="sponsored">Target</a> have all confirmed that they will have limited console stock on Thursday, June 5th.

Target employees will distribute physical or digital tickets either until all tickets have been claimed or 10 minutes prior to opening. If you do manage to obtain one, your console purchase is guaranteed.</p><p>As expected, Target will offer “additional software, amiibo and accessories” while supplies last.
