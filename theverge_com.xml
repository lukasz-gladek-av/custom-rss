He joined in 2018, and after a stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The 2025-2026 college football season kicked off last week. If you want something to do while you wait for your favorite team to hit the field every week through the fall, I encourage you to check out <strong>EA Sports’ <em>College Football 26</em></strong>, which is $49.99 ($20 off) at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fcollege-football-26-standard-edition-playstation-5%2FJ7CYF9Y4VF" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Fcollege-football-26%2F0%2F0%3F_refineresult%3Dtrue%26_be_shelf_id%3D1446165%26search_sort%3D100%26facet%3Dshelf_id%3A1446165%26povid%3Dets_collegefootball_pov" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/EA-SPORTS-College-Football-26-PlayStation/dp/B0F64HM6B5?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> on PS5 (disc) and Xbox Series X (disc or digital). This game builds on the stellar <em>College Football 25</em>, EA’s first college football game in over a decade.</p><p>In case you missed its big relaunch last year, EA’s back to making annual college football games now that it has a way to pay players who opt in to have their name, image, and likeness included. Athletes <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/ea-sports-college-football-26-nil-payment-more-than-doubles-for-players-opting-to-participate-in-video-game/">were paid $1,500 each</a> to be in this year’s title, and were given a free copy.</p><div><p id="some-more-verge-approved-deals"><h2>Some more Verge-approved deals</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Anker’s compact Nano Travel Adapter in white or black</strong> is down to $19.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Adapter-Temperature-Compatible-Countries/dp/B0DHVNPN7J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. It’s just small $5 discount, but this is something that’s worth jumping on if you’re planning international travel any time soon. Its slim design aside, I like that it has four ports (two USB-C, two USB-A), and support for Type A, I, G, and C plugs, which allows it to work in over 200 countries and regions, according to Anker. In terms of USB power, it’s on the slow side — best for when you want to charge gadgets overnight. For instance, one of the USB-C ports can deliver 20W to a device, or you’ll get 15W total when you’ve got two USB-C devices plugged in. Using all four ports will split 15W across devices.</span></li><li><span>Another inexpensive accessory that’d be great for travel, or even just for your daily commute, is <strong>Anker’s Soundcore Space A40 wireless earbuds</strong> that have active noise cancellation. They’re typically priced at around $79.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-Auto-Adjustable-Cancelling-Wireless-Headphone/dp/B0B1LVC5VZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, but they recently dropped down to $44.99 in the white, blue, or black. This model can last 10 hours on a charge, and its wireless charging-supported case can fully recharge them five times, totaling 50 hours of playback. These also support multipoint, letting you connect to two devices at once via Bluetooth.</span></li><li><span>Lastly, there’s a solid deal happening <strong>Logitech’s G203 wired gaming mouse</strong> at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YN82X3B/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, where the black version with RGB LED detailing costs $18.99. This half-price discount is great for PC gamers on a budget, as well as for others who want a comfortable mouse with some customizable buttons and lighting. In addition to its two main buttons, the G203 has two thumb buttons, a tactile scroll wheel, and a DPI switcher on its top to change pointer sensitivity. It’s nothing fancy, but you may find this sub-$20 mouse meets all (or at least most) of your criteria.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/773698/college-football-26-ea-sports-ps5-xbox-deal-sale#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/773698/college-football-26-ea-sports-ps5-xbox-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
