The Ultimate tier, which offers the most games and features (as well as access to PC Game Pass), went from $19.99 per month to $29.99.

The Series S, meanwhile, is designed for 1440p gaming and offers less built-in storage at 512GB. Notably, like the Xbox Series X Digital Edition, it also lacks an optical drive, so you can only play digital games.</p><p>Other than that, though, both consoles play all the same games and work with Xbox Game Pass, so whichever one you choose, you’ll still get access to the dozens of new titles recently added, ranging from <em>Hogwarts Legacy </em>and multiple <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>games to <em>Hades</em>, <em>Cities: Skylines – Remastered</em>, <em>Stardew Valley</em>, and more.</p><div><p id="three-more-good-deals"><h2>Three more good deals </h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong><em>Kirby Air Riders</em></strong> won’t hit stores until November 20th, but you can already buy the <em>Kirby Air Rider </em>sequel for $64.99 ($5 off) when you place your <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.costco.com/kirby-air-riders---nintendo-switch-2.product.4000404894.html" rel="sponsored">preorder at Costco</a>.

The USB-C screwdriver comes with 16 durable steel bits in a magnetic case, and runs on a rechargeable 2000mAh battery.
