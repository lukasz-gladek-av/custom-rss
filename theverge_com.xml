They’re currently $143.98 ($86 off) at <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Felectronics%2Faudio%2Fheadphones%2Fearbuds-in-ear-headphones%2Fproducts%2Fsony-inzone-buds-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-gaming-earbuds-for-playstation-5-and-pc---white%2F412019.html" rel="sponsored">GameStop</a>, dropping them to a new all-time low price. <em>The Verge’s</em> commerce editor, Cameron Faulkner, says they deliver excellent sound quality and versatility, with a USB-C audio transmitter that allows them to connect to everything from a PlayStation 5 to a Steam Deck and a Nintendo Switch 2.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->144</span></p><div><p>Sony’s wireless gaming buds offer low latency, active noise cancellation, and support for both Bluetooth and USB-C.</p></div></div><p>Sony’s InZone Buds offer many of the same features as the company’s flagship earbuds, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23803374/sony-wf-1000xm5-earbuds-review">WF-1000XM5</a>, which remain <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds">our favorite overall earbuds</a>. They use the same drivers, and they borrow the XM5’s active noise cancellation and mic transparency capabilities. Additionally, they offer up to 12 hours of battery life on a single charge, or a total of 24 hours with the charging case (which can fit the USB-C transmitter).</p><p>The InZone Buds feature multiple sizes of silicone ear tips, and if you have a PC, Sony’s InZone app can perform a sound test to help you choose the right ear tip for your inner ear shape. If you struggle to find a comfortable fit, a feature like this can be seriously useful. The earbuds also include a microphone, plus touch gestures for muting the mic, adjusting the volume of your audio, and toggling between noise cancellation settings — all of which can be customized via the InZone app.</p><div><p id="other-deals-worth-checking-out"><h2>Other deals worth checking out</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>If you’re looking for something to charge your phone, wireless earbuds, and smartwatch, the <strong>Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station</strong> is down to $65.99 ($45 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-Charging-%C3%AF%C2%BC%C5%92Cable-Bundle-White/dp/B0CFXQMZJT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. The Qi2 charger features a tree-like design, with three different charging areas. The main charging pad delivers up to 15W to a phone, while a second charging pad can quickly replenish the Apple Watch. Meanwhile, the base features a pad for wireless earbuds. The 3-in-1 charging station comes with a 40W USB-C PD wall charger and a USB-C cable, so you won’t need to buy any additional accessories to start charging your devices.</span></li><li><span>Preorders for the upcoming <strong>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Trilogy</strong> 4K release are now live, with a prelaunch discount of $70 ($30 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Mutant-Turtles-Trilogy-Limited/dp/B0FMGKJTY8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. The trilogy includes the original live-action <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>, <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze</em>, and <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III</em>. The first <em>TMNT</em> movie from 1990 is still the best one 35 years later, with turtle costumes from Jim Henson’s Creature Shop that still hold up. I remember watching it as a kid and being completely terrified by the building fire fight scene.</span></li><li><span>The <strong>Samsung Music Frame</strong> is currently down to an all-time low price of $127.99 ($260 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Q-Symphony-Customizable-HW-LS60D-ZA/dp/B0CTKT886K/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1803388-REG%2Fsamsung_hw_ls60d_za_music_frame.html" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H Photo</a>. The 12.9 x 12.9-inch picture frame can connect to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi with support for surround sound when paired with one of Samsung’s new TVs or soundbars. It also boasts Dolby Atmos support for more immersive audio and a pair of woofers, tweeters, and midrange drivers. The Music Frame can be mounted on the wall or displayed on media furniture with a stand, and it can actually be customized with a physical photo, unlike the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573890/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-picture-frame-speaker-review">Sonos / Ikea Symfonisk frame speaker</a> from a few years back.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/776630/sony-inzone-buds-samsung-music-frame-deal-sale#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzE5"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandon Russell</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/776630/sony-inzone-buds-samsung-music-frame-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, one of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/771461/silksong-release-steam-nintendo-eshop-crash">hottest games of the year</a> with <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/silksong-passed-5m-players-in-three">a reported five million players</a> in its first week, <em>didn’t</em> launch on smartphones. But that won’t stop you from playing it on Android — because a new leap in Windows to Android emulation means you can easily install and run the Steam version on flagship phones like my Galaxy S25.</p><p>I’m talking <a href="https://gamehub.xiaoji.com/">about GameHub</a>, the app from Chinese mobile gamepad manufacturer GameSir, which just launched version 5.0 with two key features that help it rise above the Windows-on-phone emulation scene.</p><p>First, it automatically configures itself with the right graphics drivers, translation layer, and other components when you launch the game — something that I spent hours trying to do manually with rivals Winlator, GameNative, and an earlier version of GameHub with far worse results. Second and just as importantly: it can download your Steam savegames from your PC.</p><p>The result: you can download this app, log into your Steam account, tap to install the game, tap to play the game, tap a couple more times to enable Steam cloud saves… and then you’re playing a Steam game on a phone! Unfortunately, it doesn’t <em>yet</em> work the other way around: as of September 11th, GameSir was actively working on getting your savegames to upload and sync back to your Steam PCs, too, but it’s still not working in <em>Silksong. </em></p><p>Is it worth it? On my vanilla Samsung Galaxy S25, this PC game really does feel playable on a phone, at least once I attach a USB-C gamepad with an integrated cooler like the <a href="https://gamesir.com/products/gamesir-x3-pro">GameSir X3 Pro</a> I’m testing right now. I played over an hour yesterday and didn’t feel the need to pick up my Steam Deck instead.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->8</strong><span><cite>Image by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>With a normal PS5 controller, I saw framerates anywhere between 50 and 120 frames per second at my phone’s full, widescreen native resolution — did I mention GameHub supports widescreen and HDR? — and it runs a bit better at 720p.</p><p>But with the X3 Pro I was able to maintain framerates of over 100fps even in big fights, so long as I plugged the gamepad’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_heat_pump">Peltier cooling plate</a> and noisy fan into USB-C power. I guess I shouldn’t <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/28/24143845/phone-cooler-fans-ice-graphics">make fun of phone coolers</a> anymore!</p><p>It’s not as smooth as my Steam Deck or other handhelds without that added cooling: when my phone is thermally throttling, moments where it hits 50 or 60fps don’t feel like 50fps or 60fps, they feel like the game is borderline unplayable. But I was pleased to see the cooling solution do its job! I imagine a larger Galaxy phone, or a phone designed for gaming, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/711116/onexsugar-sugar-1-hands-on-preview-transforming-dual-screen">a dedicated Android handheld</a>, would have an easier time.</p><p>You probably won’t want to use a phone <em>much</em> weaker than the S25 for this quick-reflex game. When I tried GameHub and <em>Silksong</em> on an older Pixel 9 with a Tensor G4, it balanced on the knife’s edge of playability, and definitely fell off without a cooler attached. The Pixel 9 also doesn’t currently let me watch the game’s cutscenes, a bit of a dealbreaker if you’re buying the game to play on phone, though the Galaxy S25 plays cutscenes fine as of this latest GameHub release.</p><p>Some in the Android emulation community have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmulationOnAndroid/comments/1n8yikp/silksong_runs_better_on_switch_emulation_than/">turned to the Nintendo Switch emulator Eden</a> for better sustained performance in <em>Silksong</em>, and I’ve heard that one runs at a stable 120fps without extra cooling. But that would require somehow obtaining a downloadable copy of the Switch version of the game, and it might be difficult to transfer saves with a real Switch.</p><p>With GameHub, I’m downloading my legitimately purchased games and saves from Steam itself. That’s amazing.</p><p>Windows emulation on Android is looking like a game-changer. And <em>Silksong</em> is just one of the games it might be about to change. Today, that’s because this game requires an incredibly low amount of performance and power to play, but future phones might carve out more and more of the PC game library.</p><p>Just don’t rely on GameHub too much yet. Even though many are enthusiastic about the big improvements in GameHub 5.0, others are complaining that it broke games that were previously working. It could be worth waiting for the dust to settle.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/776180/hollow-knight-silksong-android-phone-windows-emulation-gamehub#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/776180/hollow-knight-silksong-android-phone-windows-emulation-gamehub]]></content:encoded>
