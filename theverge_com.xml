            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/9/24292221/intel-acknowledged-arrow-lake-performance-issues-robert-hallock-exec<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Reviews of Intel’s new Arrow Lake-based Core Ultra 9 200S-series processor have been lackluster, specifically when it comes to gaming performance, but Intel says that’s not the end of the story. Its new chips should be performing better, and the company will have an ETA on getting them there soon, according to Robert Hallock, Intel’s VP and GM of client AI and technical marketing, in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/P2OHRH7221w?t=637s">new interview</a> with <em>HotHardware</em>’s Dave Altavilla and Marco Chiappetta.</p><p>Intel was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24265928/intel-core-ultra-200s-series-specs-release-date-pricing">up-front in saying</a> these new chips wouldn’t beat AMD’s chips for gaming. But reviewers’ findings have been unexpectedly poor. Despite some efficiency gains like those noted in Tom Warren’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24265928/intel-core-ultra-200s-series-specs-release-date-pricing"><em>Verge</em> review</a> of the Core Ultra 9 285K, the new chip seems to lag behind even Intel’s earlier Raptor Lake chips in gaming. That’s to say nothing of its performance versus <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24288948/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-review-cpu-processor-benchmark-test">AMD’s very good Ryzen 9800X3D</a>.</p><p>Intel’s Arrow Lake chips’ “bones are solid,” Hallock said during the interview. Still, the company has identified factors “that can combine to produce some pretty wild unintended effects.” Hallock was also clear that the new Arrow Lake performance issues are strictly Intel’s responsibility, and not the fault of Microsoft or anyone else. </p><p>As for when Intel will provide an ETA on fixes, Hallock said Intel hopes to give a “comprehensive update” on what the chip’s issues are and what’s causing them by the end of November or early December. The good news is that the fix will be easy, according to Hallock, who called it a “flash the BIOS and update Windows kinda situation.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/9/24291552/seagate-storage-expansion-card-xbox-series-x-s-fitbit-charge-6-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Black Friday won’t be here for several more weeks, but the holiday promos are beginning to take shape at Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers. We expect to see steep discounts on a number of gaming goods when many of the early sales <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569881/black-friday-deals-start-time-hours-cyber-monday-stores">kick off next week</a>, but if you want to shop ahead of time, <strong>Seagate’s 2TB Storage Expansion Card for the Xbox Series X / S<em> </em></strong>is already matching its all-time low of $199.99 ($160 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BJYXMDW/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/7x46p0sfha73r">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://www.seagate.com/products/gaming-drives/xbox-gaming/storage-expansion-for-xbox-series-x/">Seagate’s online storefront</a>.</p><p>While pricey, Seagate’s proprietary expansion cards are a great way to expand the storage capacity of your Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S. The NVMe-based, Microsoft-licensed cards — of which there are currently two — are incredibly easy to install, fast, and allow you to run games as if they were loaded on your console’s internal memory. That means they support Microsoft’s Quick Resume function and prevent you from having to shuffle downloads around, which you’d have to do if you were to purchase a USB-based external hard drive (those are limited to playing backward-compatible games).</p><p>Understandably, Sony’s approach to expandable storage, which lets PlayStation 5 owners upgrade their console with any PS5-compatible M.2 SSD, is still far more inviting. But Seagate’s proprietary option has been coming down in price since the introduction of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/2/23666795/western-digital-xbox-storage-expansion-card">Western Digital’s WD_Black C50</a>, and Seagate’s 2TB model is far easier to stomach now than with its original starting price of $399.99. Here’s hoping the current price drop is a sign of steeper cuts to come.</p><div><p>Proprietary SSD expansion for the Xbox Series X / S consoles. The plug-and-play drives are designed to be as fast as the Xbox internal SSD and are sold in 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB configurations.</p></div><p><h3>Other deals and discounts of note</h3></p><div><ul><li><strong>Google’s Pixel Buds Pro 2</strong> are on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Buds-Pro-Cancellation/dp/B0D79ND3N7/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/txk86dj781imt">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;u=1225169&amp;m=83747&amp;urllink=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellbots.com%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle-pixel-buds-pro-2">Wellbots</a> for an all-time low of $179 ($50 off), with the latter retailer offering an additional $10 off when you use offer code <strong>VERGEBF60</strong> at checkout. They’re a pretty notable step up from the prior model — particularly if you use a Pixel phone — with a smaller build, an excellent transparency mode, and some of the best battery life you can get in a pair of noise-canceling earbuds. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24254109/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Read our review</a>.</li><li><strong>Nomad</strong> is running an <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://nomadgoods.com/">early Black Friday sale</a> through the end of today, November 9th, allowing you to save 20 percent on a variety of accessories when you use coupon code <strong>EARLY20</strong>. The promo applies to a few <em>Verge </em>favorites, including the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://nomadgoods.com/products/traditional-leather-case-brown-iphone-16-pro">Traditional Leather Case</a> for the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max ($12 off) and a selection of <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://nomadgoods.com/products/sport-band-naval">Apple Watch Sport Bands</a> ($12 off), along with the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://nomadgoods.com/products/stand-one-silver">Nomad Stand One</a> ($22 off). The latter isn’t as capable as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24224358/nomad-stand-one-max-third-gen-magsafe-qi2-charger-price-specs">Stand One Max</a>, but it still offers up to 15W MagSafe speeds and an ultra-premium design made of metal and glass. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24224358/nomad-stand-one-max-third-gen-magsafe-qi2-charger-price-specs">Read our Stand One review</a>.</li><li>In some ways, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22982833/best-fitbit-watch-fitness-tracker">best Fitbit you can buy</a> is actually the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24239115/google-pixel-watch-3-review-smartwatch-wear-os-wearable">Google Pixel Watch 3</a>. The <strong>Fitbit Charge 6 </strong>isn’t a bad alternative for fitness tracking, though, especially since it’s fallen to $99.95 ($100 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Exercise-Equipment-6-Months-Membership/dp/B0CC62ZG1M/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FFitbit-Charge-6-Black-aluminum-activity-tracker-with-infinity-band-silicone-obsidian-NFC-Bluetooth-1-33-oz%2F5087333627">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://howl.link/bxj1pg5hp12dh">Best Buy</a>. The high-end band features a color OLED screen and a solid suite of fitness-tracking tools, plus EKG, EDA, and SpO2 sensors. It also offers turn-by-turn navigation via Google Maps and a haptic side button, one that’s far better than the inductive groove on the previous model. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23958997/fitbit-charge-6-review-fitness-tracker-side-button">Read our review</a>.</li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
