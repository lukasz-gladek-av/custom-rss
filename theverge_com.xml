It’s joined by a new version of Corsair’s M75 wireless mouse, and both peripherals are available in Mac-exclusive colors including glacier blue and a white version the company calls frost.</p><p>The frost versions of the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HRYZ2ZM/A/corsair-k65-plus-wireless-mechanical-gaming-keyboard-for-mac">K65 Plus wireless keyboard</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HRYT2ZM/A/corsair-m75-wireless-lightweight-rgb-gaming-mouse">M75 wireless mouse</a> are available now from Apple’s online and retail stores for $179.95 and $129.95, respectively. The glacier blue versions will be available for the same price, but at a later date.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Mac version of the Corsair K65 Plus wireless keyboard is exclusively available in glacier blue and frost (white) colorways.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Corsair</cite></p></div><p>The K65 Plus wireless keyboard features a 75% tenkeyless design that uses “pre-lubricated CORSAIR MLX Red v2 linear switches” with integrated sound dampening to make it quieter than other mechanical options. The new version includes command and option keys with Mac-specific icons as well as a row of function keys matching the layout of Apple’s own keyboards. But you can also customize the functionality of each key and the keyboard’s LED lighting using Corsair’s optional iCue software that’s now available for macOS.</p><p>Corsair claims a battery life of up to 266 hours on a full charge, but doesn’t specify if that’s when the keyboard is connected to Macs or other Apple devices using a USB cable, Bluetooth, or wireless 2.4GHz connection for reduced lag. A 2.4GHz dongle is included, but <a href="https://gizmodo.com/hands-on-apples-corsair-gaming-keyboard-and-mouse-2000525304">according to <em>Gizmodo</em></a>, it requires the use of a bundled USB-C to USB-A converter from Anker to actually connect it to Apple devices which abandoned USB-A a while ago.</p><div><figcaption><em>The M75 Plus wireless mouse features an ambidextrous design for right or left-handed users.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Corsair</cite></p></div><p>The M75 wireless gaming mouse weighs in at 89 grams and features an ambidextrous design for either right- or left-handed gamers. It uses Corsair’s 26,000 DPI Marksman optical sensor and connects to devices either over Bluetooth or using the company’s proprietary Slipstream wireless technology — which also requires a dedicated dongle. The mouse’s lighting, DPI, and button assignments can be configured using the same Corsair iCue software the K65 Plus keyboard utilizes.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
