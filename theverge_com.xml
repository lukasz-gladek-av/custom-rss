That puts the audio near your ears while you’re wearing it, and in my brief time trying the device at Valve’s headquarters recently, I thought the sound was just fine. But the choice to have those dual drivers also helps reduce audio vibrations, which helps the headset with tracking while you’re playing games in VR, Valve hardware engineer Jeremy Selan tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>The Frame, like many other VR headsets, uses outward-facing cameras built into the main part of the headset for tracking. However, audio with good bass “induces vibrations into the headset,” which can affect that tracking, according to Selan. But on the Frame’s included head strap, the dual drivers per side are “mounted opposite to each other,” which creates “vibration cancellation inherent in the design.” That allows for “better tracking, even with good audio,” Selan says.</p><p>Pretty cool! The headset is modular, too, so theoretically, you might be able to use other head straps with other audio solutions later. It’s a really interesting headset — I recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">got to try it for myself</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/818599/valve-steam-frame-headset-speakers-head-strap-vibration-cancellation]]></content:encoded>

It’s called foveated streaming, and it means the headset requests a higher-quality image for the content that’s right in front of your eyes while lowering the resolution of your peripheral vision to reduce bandwidth and processing demands.</p><p>The headset relies on a couple pieces of hardware to make that happen. The first is a dedicated wireless streaming adapter that sends games from a PC to the headset. The second is a pair of eye-tracking cameras inside the headset that follow where you’re looking. If you’re familiar with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/22/12260430/nvidia-foveated-rendering-vr-graphics-smi-eye-tracking-siggraph">foveated rendering</a>, which headsets like Apple’s Vision Pro deploy for on-device processing, it’s a similar idea.</p><p>Valve tells <em>The Verge</em> that foveated streaming won’t be exclusive to the Frame. While it’s currently optimized for the Steam Frame, foveated streaming can work with “any headset that supports eye tracking” and that is “compatible with our Steam Link streaming app,” according to hardware engineer Jeremy Selan.</p><div><div><p id="got-any-burning-questions-about-valves-new-hardware"><h2>Got any burning questions about Valve’s new hardware?</h2></p></div><div><blockquote><p>We’re holding a subscriber-exclusive AMA today, November 12th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve just announced the Steam Frame, a new standalone VR headset that can both stream games from a PC and play games locally thanks to an onboard Arm chip. The headset is quite a bit different from Valve’s previous model, the Index, which had to be tethered to a gaming computer with a physical wire. But it also stands out from a lot of other major VR headsets on the market right now, like the Meta Quest 3, Samsung Galaxy XR, and Apple Vision Pro.</p><p>A big way the Frame separates itself from the pack is its focus on streaming your games. That’s all made possible thanks to a wireless dongle that comes with every Frame: plug it into your PC, and you can stream both your flat and VR games to the headset over a low-latency connection. I got to try the streaming for myself at Valve’s headquarters while playing <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>, and I didn’t notice any discernible lag.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Category</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Frame</h3></th><th><h3>Meta Quest 3</h3></th><th><h3>Apple Vision Pro</h3></th><th><h3>Samsung Galaxy XR</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Colors</td><td>Black</td><td>White</td><td>Silver</td><td>Silver</td></tr><tr><td>Weight (grams)</td><td>185g (core unit), 440g (with head strap that adds audio and rear battery)</td><td>515g</td><td>750–800g (depending on light seal and headband configuration)</td><td>545g, though weight may vary if you wear the light shield or not</td></tr><tr><td>OS</td><td>SteamOS</td><td>Meta Horizon OS</td><td>visionOS</td><td>Android XR</td></tr><tr><td>Lenses</td><td>Pancake</td><td>Pancake</td><td>Pancake</td><td>Pancake</td></tr><tr><td>Screen type</td><td>LCD</td><td>LCD</td><td>micro-OLED</td><td>micro-OLED</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution</td><td>2160 x 2160 per eye</td><td>2064 x 2208 per eye</td><td>3660 x 3200 per eye</td><td>4K per eye</td></tr><tr><td>Refresh rate</td><td>72-144Hz refresh rate (144Hz experimental)</td><td>72Hz, 90Hz, 120Hz</td><td>90Hz, 96Hz, 100Hz, 120Hz</td><td>60Hz, 72Hz (default), up to 90Hz</td></tr><tr><td>Processor</td><td>Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</td><td>Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2</td><td>Apple M5 chip</td><td>Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2</td></tr><tr><td>FOV</td><td>Up to 110 degrees</td><td>Up to 100 degrees horizontal and 96 degrees vertical</td><td>Estimated to be about 100 degrees</td><td>109 degrees horizontal and 100 degrees vertical</td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>16GB unified LPDDR5 RAM</td><td>8GB</td><td>16GB, reportedly</td><td>16GB</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>256GB / 1TB UFS storage options, microSD card slot</td><td>512GB</td><td>256GB, 512GB, 1TB</td><td>256GB</td></tr><tr><td>Connectivity</td><td>Wi-Fi 7, includes dedicated Wi-Fi 6E adapter for low-latency streaming games</td><td>Wi-Fi 6E</td><td>Wi‑Fi 6</td><td>Wi-Fi 7</td></tr><tr><td>Tracking, passthrough, and sensors</td><td>4 outward-facing monochrome cameras forcontroller and headset tracking, 2 interior cameras for eye tracking, outward IR illuminator</td><td>2 RGB cameras with 18 PPD for full-color passthrough</td><td>2 high‑resolution main cameras, 6 world‑facing tracking cameras, 4 eye‑tracking cameras, TrueDepth camera, LiDAR Scanner, 4 inertial measurement units (IMUs), flicker sensor, ambient light sensor</td><td>2 high-resolution passthrough cameras, 6 world-facing tracking cameras, 4 eye-tracking cameras, 5 Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), depth sensor, flicker sensor</td></tr><tr><td>Eye tracking</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Battery capacity</td><td>21.6Wh</td><td>19.44Wh</td><td>Up to 2.5 hours of “general use”</td><td>Up to 2 hours of “general usage”</td></tr><tr><td>Starting price</td><td>TBA</td><td>$499.99</td><td>$3,499.00</td><td>$1,799.99</td></tr><tr><td>Availability</td><td>Early 2026</td><td>October 2023</td><td>October 2025</td><td>October 2025</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>You can also play games right on the Frame itself because Valve has gotten SteamOS working on Arm; the headset is equipped with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip. Other headsets can play games locally, too — typically games built specifically for their respective platforms. But the Frame is actually able to run Windows x86 code and recompile it in real time using an emulator, meaning that a vast amount of the Steam library will be playable directly on the headset without you or any developers having to do anything.</p><p>That said, you shouldn’t expect to be able to play high-end games locally on the Frame. Valve designer Lawrence Yang tells <em>The Verge</em> that developers should target lower performance than they would for a game on Steam Deck. The Frame’s real-time emulation could affect performance; while playing <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> and <em>Hades II</em> on the headset, both of which are relatively lower-end games, I saw some stutters that I never see on my Steam Deck. (According to Valve hardware engineer Jeremy Selan, this was a bug and the company expects to make improvements leading up to and after launch.)</p><div><div><p id="got-any-burning-questions-about-valves-new-hardware"><h2>Got any burning questions about Valve’s new hardware?</h2></p></div><div><blockquote><p>We’re holding a subscriber-exclusive AMA today, November 12th, at 3PM ET.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Valve won’t talk <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818313/valve-has-no-news-about-a-steam-deck-2">about a Steam Deck 2</a>. It probably wants to keep the attention on its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">just-announced living room console</a>, comfy new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">controller</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">Arm-based headset</a> instead. But now that the company is preparing to sell an Arm headset, one that can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818672/valve-android-apps-steam-frame">even run Android apps</a>, there’s an obvious question. Is Arm a one-off experiment for Valve, or might it power future SteamOS hardware?</p></div><p>Valve software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais makes it sound like the sky’s the limit. I don’t want to oversell what he said — he was excited about the <em>potential</em>, not any specific devices, and you’ll see that in more context when we publish the interview later this week.</p><p>But when I ask whether he thinks there’ll be other SteamOS devices with Arm chips, he says the answer is yes, and that he’s excited about it.</p><p>“I think that it paves the way for a bunch of different, maybe ultraportables, maybe more powerful laptops being Arm-based,” he begins. “Handhelds, there’s a lot of potential for Arm, of course, and one might see desktop chips as well at some point in the Arm world.” I immediately think about how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678000/nvidia-arm-gaming-laptop-mediatek-alienware">Nvidia reportedly has an Arm-powered gaming laptop coming</a>, and how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/785068/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-x2-elite-and-extreme-for-windows-pcs#:~:text=Razer%E2%80%99s%20Min%2DLiang%20Tan">Razer showed up</a> at Qualcomm’s last coming-out party for laptop chips.</p><p>“We’ll keep greasing the wheels, so to speak, so that SteamOS can work on a wider variety of Arm devices, but also so that the catalog becomes more reliable there in terms of compatibility and performance,” says Griffais.</p><div><div><p id="got-any-burning-questions-about-valves-new-hardware"><h2>Got any burning questions about Valve’s new hardware?</h2></p></div><div><blockquote><p>We’re holding a subscriber-exclusive AMA today, November 12th, at 3PM ET.
