            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/645131/elon-musk-path-of-exile-2-livestream<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Elon Musk, seemingly keen to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/29/elon-musk-video-games-diablo-path-exile/">repair some of his gamer cred</a> after <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/elon-musk-admits-account-boosting-on-poe2-and-diablo-4-but-says-deal-with-it-what-would-i-be-apologizing-for/">he admitted to account boosting</a>, streamed himself playing <em>Path of Exile 2</em> during a flight as a part of an “airborne continuity test” of his Starlink internet service. But <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/554062/path-of-exile-2-players-bully-elon-musk-during-eerie-airplane-stream">during the stream</a>, he was bombarded by messages from viewers bullying him for his work <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/644186/hands-off-washington-dc-protest-musk-trump-doge">dismantling the US government</a> and his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/8/23200141/elon-musk-shivon-zilis-twins-twitter">tumultuous personal life</a>.</p></div><p>The stream, which, as of this writing, <a href="https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1mrGmPleodQKy">is still available to view on X</a>, lasted for roughly an hour and 45 minutes, in which Musk himself rarely spoke. He stared silently and solemnly at the camera as he played through the early parts of the game, released in early access back in December. During the stream he died a few times, forcing him to create new characters as he played on hardcore (i.e. perma-death) difficulty. Here’s one of them.</p><p>A few minutes into the stream, Musk started to receive private messages from other players. Some were celebratory, calling him a “god gamer,” but the messages quickly veered into spammy, then abusive territory. One message asked him to “make it clap for daddy.” Another was a player claiming to be Ashley St. Clair, a former partner of Musk’s who is currently <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2025%2F04%2F01%2Felon-musk-ashley-st-clair-paternity-dispute%2F82760786007%2F" rel="sponsored">locked in a custody battle with him</a> for their five-month-old child. While yet more seemingly cut to the heart of Musk’s destructive ego trip with the American government, “Elon, deep down you will always be cringe no matter how much money or power you have.”</p><p>Some viewers tried to be helpful, suggesting that Musk use the command to disable messages, but he took no action. In the last minutes of the stream, Musk made a hardcore difficulty character he named Kekius Maximus, a 4chan-esque meme name he’s used as his display name on X. But Kekius Maximus was not long for the world. Musk died to one of the game’s tutorial bosses due to a bad connection, which subsequently concluded the stream, ending another sad, weird data point in the Elon Musk fake gamer saga.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
