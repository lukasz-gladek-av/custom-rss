It’s now available from <a href="https://www.hallmark.com/ornaments/keepsake-ornaments/xbox-360-console-ornament-with-light-and-sound-5QXI8292.html">Hallmark’s online store</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hallmark-Keepsake-Christmas-Ornament-Console/dp/B0DR39V41B/ref=sr_1_1_sspa??tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon for $28.99</a> and pressing its power button <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIuNrejw4EA">plays the console’s swooshy startup sound</a> and then about 20 seconds of the <em>Behold a Pale Horse</em> track from the <em>Halo 3</em> soundtrack that incorporates elements of the <em>Halo</em> theme, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-360-hallmark-keepsake-ornament-is-available-now-and-looks-awesome">according to <em>IGN</em></a>.</p><p>The 3.25-inch tall replica of Microsoft’s nearly 20-year-old console (the 360 launched in November 2005) is surprisingly detailed for something that’s going to get lost amongst a sea of ornaments on your tree, and includes a matching mini controller permanently leaning up against the console’s base.</p><p>It’s powered by a trio of replaceable button batteries should you get overly nostalgic and hit the button ad nauseam. The Xbox 360’s power button even lights up green when pressed, and although green and red is often considered the official colors of the holiday season, it doesn’t appear as if you can create the 360’s Red Ring of Death, despite Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/10/24318401/microsoft-has-created-an-xbox-360-red-ring-of-death-ugly-sweater">not shying away from making other merchandise</a> featuring the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832667/microsoft-xbox-red-ring-of-death-poster-power-on-docuseries">infamous error message</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/803728/hallmark-keepsake-ornament-microsoft-xbox-360-console-halo-3-theme]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After raising prices on Xbox consoles and subscriptions, Microsoft is now turning its attention to Xbox developers. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell <em>The Verge</em> that the company is significantly increasing the price of its Xbox Development Kit (XDK) — the custom hardware used by developers to build Xbox games.</p><p>The current Xbox dev kit is moving from $1,500 to $2,000, a 33 percent jump in price. “The adjustment reflects macroeconomic developments,” says Microsoft in an announcement to Xbox developers, seen by <em>The Verge</em>. “We remain committed to providing high-quality tools and support for your development efforts.” I asked Microsoft to comment on the price rise, but the company didn’t respond in time for publication.</p><p>The price increases to the Xbox dev kit come just a month after Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">hiked the price of its Xbox Series X</a> console for the second time this year. The second price increase to the Series X means the console is now $150 more than it was just six months ago.</p><p>Microsoft also blamed “changes in the macroeconomic environment” for its latest Xbox console price hike last month, and both the increases to consoles and dev kits, 30 percent and 33 percent respectively, align with the Trump administration’s 30 percent tariff on imports from China. A recent report suggested that Microsoft is pushing to produce more <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/800538/microsoft-surface-manufacturing-china-move-report">Xbox consoles outside of China</a>, in a clear attempt to reduce the impact of the tariffs.</p><p>The short announcement from Microsoft’s Xbox developer relations team makes it clear that this price increase goes into effect immediately. I understand it’s not just impacting US developers, as the price of these development kits is also going up across Europe and elsewhere. That’s likely because those “macroeconomic” conditions extend beyond just US tariffs, with currency fluctuations, production costs, and other elements impacting pricing.</p><p>Microsoft’s Xbox dev kit was already expensive because it comes with additional hardware on the inside and out, to let developers build and test Xbox games for both the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles. Microsoft has equipped its latest dev kit with 40GB of GDDR6 memory, instead of the 16GB found on the Xbox Series X console. It also has a more compute units enabled, the all-important debugging tools onboard for testing games, and three USB ports at the front. Microsoft also equips its Xbox dev kits with a front panel display and five programmable buttons.</p><div><p>The dev kit price hikes also come just weeks after Microsoft hiked the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">price of its Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> subscription by 50 percent.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/803237/microsoft-xbox-devkit-price-hikes-developers]]></content:encoded>
