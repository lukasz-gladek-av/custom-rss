The designation doesn’t impose sanctions or a ban, but it could make it more difficult for the companies to do business in the US.</p><div><p>Along with owning the popular messaging app WeChat, Tencent is a major name in the gaming industry, as it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/17/10410952/riot-games-league-of-legends-acquired-tencent">owns <em>League of Legends</em> developer Riot Games</a> and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/every-game-company-that-tencent-has-invested-in/">has invested in many others</a>, including Epic Games, Larian Studios, Ubisoft, and FromSoftware. Meanwhile, CATL is the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296777/tesla-catl-ev-battery-maker-elon-musk-4860-cell">world’s biggest electric vehicle battery maker</a>, with its products appearing across EVs from Tesla, Ford, Volkswagen, BMW, and more.</p></div><div><p>The designations originate from <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/12/trump-bans-investments-in-companies-that-aid-chinas-military.html">President-elect Donald Trump’s executive order</a> in 2020, which prevented US companies from investing in entities with ties to the Chinese military. DJI, which was put on the list in 2022, says <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24272188/dji-blames-us-customs-block-import-some-drones">US Customs is blocking its drone imports</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/19/24274153/dji-sues-us-dod-chinese-military-company">eventually filed a lawsuit</a> claiming the designation has resulted in “lost business deals” and a stigma “as a national security threat.”</p></div><p>These companies don’t always stay on the Department of Defense’s list, as the US <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454292/xiaomi-blacklist-removed-communist-chinese-military-company">removed Chinese phone maker Xiaomi</a> just months <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231786/trump-administration-blacklists-xiaomi-communist-chinese-military-company">after adding it in 2021</a>. Both Tencent and CATL plan to push back on the designations. “We are not a military company or supplier,” Tencent spokesperson Danny Marti said in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business. We will nonetheless work with the Department of Defense to address any misunderstanding.” CATL similarly told <em>Bloomberg</em> that its inclusion was “clearly a mistake.”</p><p><em>The Verge</em> reached out to CATL with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/4/24307731/ces-2025-tvs-gaming-smart-home-wearables-news"><h2>CES 2025: all the news, gadgets, and surprises</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336154/samsung-the-frame-pro-features-specs"><h2>Samsung announces The Frame Pro: could this be the perfect TV?</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336198/e-bike-battery-lock-bosch-anti-theft-date-ota"><h2>Stolen e-bike batteries could be made worthless if Bosch was less greedy</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24334030/halliday-smart-glasses-ai-tiny-display-frame-availability-price-ces"><h2>These smart glasses have a tiny little screen hidden in the frame</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336168/lg-2025-oled-tv-m5-g5-c5-b5-features-specs"><h2>LG’s 2025 OLED TVs are its best yet — but they risk going overboard with AI</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The 27-inch and 32-inch 4K UltraSharp Thunderbolt displays announced at CES have been updated with new IPS panels that provide 120Hz refresh rates alongside features designed to enhance visual comfort.</p><p>The UltraSharp line is a popular choice for working professionals who need a no-frills 4K monitor that supports Windows, macOS, and multi-monitor setups — the 27-inch model in particular tops <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-4k-monitors/">a lot</a> <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-4k-monitors">of</a> <a href="https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/best/by-resolution/4k-ultra-hd-uhd">lists</a> for best 4K monitor. 120Hz refresh rates are usually targeted toward gamers who can benefit from higher frame rates and smoother, more responsive gameplay, which now makes the 27-inch UltraSharp 4K in particular a decent solution for people who want a single display that’s suitable for both work <em>and</em> play.</p><p>The improvements come at a cost though: the 27-inch UltraSharp 4K is increasing to $699.99 (<a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-27-4k-usb-c-hub-monitor-u2723qe/apd/210-bdpf/monitors-monitor-accessories">up from $639.99 for the 60Hz model</a>), and the larger 32-inch UltraSharp 4K now costs $949.99 (<a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-32-4k-usb-c-hub-monitor-u3223qe/apd/210-bdph/monitors-monitor-accessories">up from $919.99</a>). Both will be available to buy globally starting February 25th, according to Dell.</p><div><figcaption><em>Here’s a look at what the new 32-inch Dell UltraSharp 4K monitor looks like from the front.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Dell</cite></p></div><p>Dell introduced several <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/3/23944722/dell-ultrasharp-u2424h-u2424he-u2724d-u2724de-120hz-price-release-date-specs-features">120Hz monitors to the UltraSharp lineup in 2023</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/4/24024951/dell-ultrasharp-curved-thunderbolt-monitor-u4025qw-u3425we-price-release-date-specs-features">2024</a>, but this is the first time that the popular 27-inch 4K model has seen a similar refresh rate boost. Other improvements for the new UltraSharp 4K models include up to 140W power delivery via USB-C (up from 90W), and a 3,000:1 contrast ratio, thanks to its use of “enhanced IPS Black technology” that provides 47 percent deeper blacks compared to conventional IPS panels, according to Dell. The prior version of IPS Black offered a 2,000:1 contrast ratio. A comparison showing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPXQdLfKMRs">improvements in contrast ratio can be seen in this YouTube video</a>.</p><div><figcaption><em>Besides some changes to the port selection and a new ventilation grill, the new UltraSharp 4K monitors look visually similar to the previous models.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Dell</cite></p></div><p>Dell says the monitors include an ambient light sensor that automatically adjusts brightness and color temperature to help reduce eye fatigue. Otherwise, the 27-inch and 32-inch 4K UltraSharp share near-identical designs with their predecessors. The new models include VESA DisplayHDR 600 and ports for USB-A, USB-C, Thunderbolt 4, HDMI, and DisplayPort, with ventilation grills now surrounding the ports located on the back of the monitors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336246/amd-radeon-rx-9070-series-rdna-4-fsr-4-ces-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>AMD is previewing its next generation of GPUs at CES today, based on its latest RDNA 4 architecture that includes AI-powered FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 (FSR 4) upscaling. The Radeon RX 9070 XT and Radeon RX 9070 will both be available in Q1 from a variety of video card manufacturers, but AMD isn’t detailing specifications, pricing, or exact release dates just yet.</p><p>The announcement is light on concrete information. AMD says it has built this architecture from the ground up and that the GPUs built on RDNA 4 will include “a significant boost in AI.” AMD has optimized the compute units in RNDA 4, improved its ray-tracing engine and performance, and upgraded its media encoding quality. Built on a 4nm process, the RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 cards will include AMD’s second-generation AI accelerators, third-generation ray-tracing accelerators, and second-generation radiance display engine.</p><div><figcaption><em>AMD is only providing small details about its RDNA 4 architecture.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: AMD</cite></p></div><p>This RDNA 4 architecture will also enable AMD to launch FSR 4 with these 9000-series GPUs. FSR 4 is a machine learning-powered update to AMD’s <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/technologies/fidelityfx/super-resolution.html">upscaling and frame-generation technology</a> that’s been developed specifically for RDNA 4 and its dedicated AI accelerator hardware. That means you’ll only be able to get FSR 4 with a Radeon RX 9070-series graphics card right now, and it will be supported in games with FSR 3.1 already integrated.</p><p>Matt Booty, president of game content and studios at Microsoft, appeared on stage at AMD’s CES keynote earlier today to confirm FSR 4 will be available in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </em>later this year.</p><p>AMD hasn’t hinted at how FSR 4 will compare to Nvidia’s DLSS technology or what type of performance uplift or image quality improvement we should expect to see with this next generation of FSR.</p><p>It’s also not clear exactly what performance the RX 9070 series of GPUs will deliver against the competition, but in a branding slide for RDNA 4, AMD appears to suggest the 9070 series will offer similar performance to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti and RTX 4070 Super. Nvidia is expected to announce its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336321/nvidia-rtx-5090-32gb-vram-gddr7-memory-ces-leak-rumor">RTX 50-series GPUs</a> later today.</p><div><figcaption><em>FSR 4 will use dedicated AI accelerators on next-gen GPUs to upscale games.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: AMD</cite></p></div><p>AMD is also adding new AI-powered features to its Adrenalin software. These include the ability to generate images with AI models, summarize local documents, and ask an AMD chatbot questions about graphics settings and more.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re wondering why AMD has jumped from the Radeon 7000 series straight to 9000-series GPUs, the company says it will use the 8000-series branding for RDNA 3.5 mobile GPUs. AMD is only previewing FSR 4 at CES and promises to provide more details on the upscaling technology and its latest RDNA 4 GPUs ahead of the Q1 launch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s absurd!</p><p>In addition to that enormous screen — which is a 144 Hz WQXGA touch display that can top out at 500 nits of brightness — the Nitro Blaze 11 is equipped with an AMD Ryzen 8040HS processor, 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM, and up to 2TB of storage, according to a press release. The Nitro Blaze 11 also has detachable controllers, a built-in kickstand, Hall Effect joysticks, and two back buttons. (The original Blaze, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235413/acer-nitro-blaze-7-handheld-gaming-pc-specs">announced last year</a> with a 7-inch screen, lacked back buttons.)</p><div><figcaption><em>The Nitro Blaze 11 with its controllers removed.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Acer</cite></p></div><p>Acer’s other new handheld PC, the Nitro Blaze 8, is mercifully smaller, with an 8.8-inch screen. It has many of the same specs as the Nitro Blaze 11, though it lacks the detachable controllers and built-in stand.</p><p>Both new Blazes will be available in Q2 2025, Acer says. The Nitro Blaze 11 will start at $1,099.99, while the Nitro Blaze 8 will start at $899.99.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
