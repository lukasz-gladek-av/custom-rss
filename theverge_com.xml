However, if you don’t want to wait for what’s next, you can currently save on the <strong>Samsung Galaxy Buds FE</strong>, which are down to $46.99 ($53 off) at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-samsung-galaxy-buds-fe-true-wireless-bluetooth-earbuds-9" rel="sponsored">Woot</a>. That’s their best price yet and a deal that will run until September 2nd or while supplies last.</p><p>Despite being nearly two years old, the Buds FE remain a solid pair of wireless earbuds. They offer good sound and impressive noise cancellation for the price, but it’s the fit that really stands out. Unlike the pricier Galaxy Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro, the Buds FE feature a wing tip design that provides a more comfortable, secure fit. Meanwhile, a flattened touchpad area makes pausing, playing, and skipping tracks more foolproof.</p><p>The Buds FE miss out on more advanced features, including a conversation mode and proper multipoint Bluetooth support. They also lack wireless charging and carry a meager IPX2 rating for water resistance, which means they could get damaged if dropped into a pool of water. That being said, a transparency mode ensures you stay aware of your surroundings by letting ambient noise in, and battery life is solid enough to last a full day.</p><div><p id="more-deals-to-check-out"><h2>More deals to check out</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>The <strong>second-gen Backbone One with USB-C</strong> is down to $69.99 ($30 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BACKBONE-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Lightning-iOS/dp/B0CCT2LWT8?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fbackbone-one-usb-c-mobile-gaming-controller-for-iphone-15-16-series-and-android-2nd-generation-black%2F6558725.p" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, and <a rel="sponsored" href="https://backbone.sjv.io/c/482924/2186621/25186?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbackbone.com%2Fproducts%2Fbackbone-one-usb-c">Backbone’s storefront</a>, matching the largest discount we’ve seen this year. The controller is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review">one of our favorites</a> for gaming on the go, especially when playing titles like <em>Resident Evil 2</em>. It boasts a compact design complete with analog sticks, a D-pad, and a 3.5mm headphone jack to connect wired headphones. Meanwhile, its USB-C connector means it can work with both Android smartphones and the iPhone 15 or newer. It also supports passthrough charging, so you don’t have to stop your game because of a low battery notification.</span></li><li><span>The <strong>Dyson Zone</strong> are currently down to $199 ($500 off) at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-dyson-zone-active-noise-cancelling-headphones-5" rel="sponsored">Woot</a> through the end of the day, the lowest price we’ve seen on the noise canceling headphones. What makes them unique — aside from their retro-future look — is the Zone come with an air purifier you wear over your mouth. The magnetic visor does a decent job filtering pollutants, giving you clean air wherever you may be. They also deliver top-notch noise cancellation — better than the AirPods Max — and are comfortable despite being relatively heavy at 1.3 pounds. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23698352/dyson-zone-review-headphones-wearables-air-purifier">Read our review</a>.</span></li><li><span>The starting price of the <strong>Switch 2 Pro Controller</strong> was recently raised to $89.99 following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717610/nintendo-switch-original-price-increase">Nintendo’s sweeping price hikes</a>. However, you can still get it for $74.99 ($15 off) at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.costco.com/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller.product.4000371761.html" rel="sponsored">Costco</a> if you have a membership. The controller features two extra programmable buttons embedded into its grips, a dedicated GameChat button, and a 3.5mm headphone jack that can output game audio to wired headphones. While it’s a nice upgrade over the original Switch Pro Controller, it still includes drift-prone potentiometer joysticks instead of the more durable Hall effect or TMR joysticks. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">Read our review</a>.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzE5"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandon Russell</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/756210/samsung-galaxy-buds-fe-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
