Now the company has taken that same haptic technology and incorporated it into a <a href="https://www.woojer.com/products/mat?srsltid=AfmBOoqvxTBIe161h8eqF7JGeJahgCy7sRaUNebBSMOLdenILvuaKjwN">new mattress topper called the Woojer Mat</a> that will let you feel those same vibrations across your entire body to make what you’re watching or playing feel more immersive. But the company claims that the Mat is also designed to reduce stress, relieve pain and tension, and improve the quality of your sleep.</p><p>The Woojer Mat is available now for $799 through the company’s online store, but is currently discounted to $699. It’s described as a mattress topper but unlike those memory foam pads that stay permanently atop your mattress and under your sheets, at 30-inches wide the Woojer Mat is narrower than even a twin-sized mattress and is instead designed to be unfolded and used only as needed. It’s not a permanent bedroom upgrade.</p><p>Underneath an outer layer of breathable fabric is thin padding embedded with six haptic transducers capable of producing low frequencies up to 250Hz. The mat connects to any device that’s compatible with headphones and speakers using Bluetooth, USB-C, or an analog audio cable, including your smartphone. If you want to continue to listen to a movie, song, or game while their audio is being turned into soothing vibrations, the mat can wirelessly connect to headphones or you can plug them into a built-in amplifier using a cable.</p><p>Connecting the Woojer Mat to its accompanying mobile app also provides access to a “rich library of dedicated vibroacoustic sessions designed for everything from back pain relief to deep relaxation and mental clarity.” If you want to use it without distractions, you can adjust volume and the intensity of the vibrations using a strip of buttons on the mat without reaching for your phone or other devices.</p><p>We haven’t tested the mat and can’t vouch for Woojer’s wellness claims. But like those elaborate chairs that provide an intense full-body massage experience or a white noise machine, the mat’s biggest benefit could be as sensory distraction so you temporarily forget mental stresses that leave you tense or unable to fall asleep.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/837482/woojer-haptic-wellness-mat-vibrations-bluetooth]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-exit-crucial-consumer-business">an announcement on Wednesday</a>, Micron says winding down its consumer-focused business will “improve supply and support for our larger, strategic customers in faster-growing segments” — a.k.a. AI companies.</p><p>The brand’s shutdown is a huge blow for PC builders and hobbyists, who are already dealing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/828337/ram-memory-shortage-crunch-market-prices-central-micro-center">with skyrocketing RAM prices</a> linked to a surge in demand from AI companies. OpenAI, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/openai-ropes-in-samsung-sk-hynix-to-source-memory-chips-for-stargate/">struck a deal with SK Hynix and Samsung</a> to make up to 900,000 DRAM per month for its Stargate project.</p><p>Now, there’s going to be one less brand selling consumer-focused memory for PCs, potentially intensifying the global memory shortage.
