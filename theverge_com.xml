            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314133/pc-gaming-show-2024-best-trailers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Before we all settle in for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/18/24299681/and-the-nominees-are">The Game Awards next week</a>, this year’s PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted had its own assortment of interesting reveals and excellent trailers. It was an indie-focused showcase, which means that there was quite a bit of inventiveness on display; everything from a unique take on TMNT to a platformer where you jump around computer windows. If you missed the show live — which also included some news updates, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313965/pubg-brendan-playerunknown-greene-new-games-krafton">like PlayerUnknown’s ambitious plans for the future</a> — here’s a curated list of some of the best stuff that was on display.</p><p><h3><em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em></h3></p><p>The original <em>Moonlighter</em> mixed action RPG gameplay with the mundanity of running a shop, and the sequel looks like much of the same: only this time, players are transported to another dimension they need to escape. <em>The Endless Vault</em> launches in 2025 on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.</p><p><h3><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em></h3></p><p>One of the biggest surprises was<em> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em>, from indie studio Strange Scaffold. It’s billed as a turn-based take on the turtles, which is billed as an experience designed in part for “quick-play sessions that feel meaningful.” It takes place in a timeline without icons Shredder and Splinter. Given the studio’s history — see <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3011440%2FCLICKOLDING%2F"><em>Clickolding</em></a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1246250%2FAn_Airport_for_Aliens_Currently_Run_by_Dogs%2F%3Fcurator_clanid%3D41064705"><em>An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs</em></a> — it will hopefully also be weird in a good way. <em>Tactical Takedown </em>launches on PC in 2025.</p><p><h3><em>Cairn</em></h3></p><div><p>This rock-climbing adventure / survival game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24171651/day-of-the-devs-showcase-summer-game-fest-2024-best">has been looking good for a while now</a>, and you can finally check it out for yourself: <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1588550%2FCairn%2F"><em>Cairn</em> just got a free demo on Steam</a>.</p></div><p><h3><em>Sol Mates</em></h3></p><p>There can never be enough co-op games. This release from Daruma Games supports local and online co-op for up to four players, who are tasked with surviving in the great expanse of space by doing “odd jobs through the galaxy.” It’s also pretty darn cute. <em>Sol Mates</em> launches in early access next year.</p><p><h3><em>The Legend of Baboo</em></h3></p><p>Billed as a “heartfelt nod to Middle Eastern fables,” this game looks like a potentially great mix of adventure, action, and puzzle solving, with a great big fluffy dog to ride on. In fact, you play as both the boy and the dog, who form a bond over the course of the game. Let’s hope it has a happier ending than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/5/13837896/the-last-guardian-review-ps4"><em>The Last Guardian</em></a>. <em>The Legend of Baboo</em> is launching in 2025 on both PC and Xbox.</p><p><h3><em>Abyssus</em></h3></p><p>Thanks to this game, I’ve learned of a fictional genre called “brinepunk,” where tech is powered by sea brine. It sounds weird, but this co-op shooter does take place in the fascinating underwater ruins of a long-gone civilization. Developer DoubleMoose says <em>Abyssus</em> will go into alpha on December 6th, with a full release next year.</p><p><h3><em>MainFrames</em></h3></p><p>All you really need to know is that this is a platformer where you’re jumping across a desktop PC interface, rearranging icons to solve puzzles, and fighting bosses controlled by the OS. It launches on both PC and the Nintendo Switch on March 6th.</p><p><h3><em>Deepest Fear</em></h3></p><p>Developed by Variable State, the indie studio behind games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2016/9/22/13001942/virginia-game-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"><em>Virginia</em></a> and <em>Last Stop</em>, <em>Deepest Fear</em> is an immersive sci-fi horror title with distinct shades of <em>Alien</em> and <em>The Thing</em>. The developers say that it “combines Metroidvania level design in the context of a classic FPS immersive sim, where the game’s setting is a puzzle to unravel and where creativity and improvisation are your greatest assets.” There’s no release date yet, but <em>Deepest Fear</em> will (obviously) be launching on PC whenever it’s ready.</p><p><h3><em>Blue Prince</em></h3></p><p>It looks a bit like a more colorful take on <em>Myst</em>, and <em>Blue Prince</em> is described as a game that “combines compelling mystery, strategy, and puzzle elements to create an unpredictable journey through Mt. Holly, a peculiar manor with ever-changing rooms.” It doesn’t have a release date yet, but according to the new trailer, it’s due out next spring.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But now, Greene’s studio, PlayerUnknown Productions, is detailing what it’s working on — and there are multiple games in the works, all pointing toward a big final project.</p><p>First up is a game called <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2943740%2FPrologue_Go_Wayback%2F"><em>Prologue: Go Wayback!</em></a>, described as a “single-player open-world emergent game within the&nbsp;survival genre,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22656508/player-unknown-brendan-green-pubg-prologue-open-world">which was previously teased in 2021</a>. The big hook, it seems, is technical, as the game is being built with “machine-learning-driven terrain generation technology, allowing the instant creation of millions of maps.” <em>Prologue </em>is expected to launch in early access on Steam in 2025, following a series of playtests. To showcase what players can expect, the studio is launching a free tech demo on Steam today called <em>Preface: Undiscovered World</em>. You can check it out <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2820060%2FPreface_Undiscovered_World%2F">right here</a>.</p><p>According to the studio, these games are building blocks on the way to a more ambitious game currently codenamed “Artemis,” which will be a “massive multiplayer sandbox experience.” Greene previously talked about Artemis back in 2022; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/29/23377207/playerunknown-artemis-melba-open-world-prologue-player-content-nft">it was originally billed as a game with NFT support</a>, though today’s announcement has no mention of NFTs. Here’s Greene on what players can eventually expect as the studio builds toward its big game:</p><div><blockquote><p>My vision for Artemis is challenging,&nbsp;but we plan to take it one step at a time and the&nbsp;three games aim to give us a solid tech foundation&nbsp;on which to scale up. After <em>Prologue</em>, two more&nbsp;games are planned for release in the coming&nbsp;years, each addressing critical technical&nbsp;challenges that will bring the studio closer to the&nbsp;final product. With <em>Prologue</em>, we aim to engage&nbsp;players and introduce them to the emergent&nbsp;mechanics and expansive worlds we’re developing.</p></blockquote></div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18283804/pubg-brendan-greene-playerunknown-interview-special-projects-gdc-2019">Greene first stepped away from <em>PUBG</em> with a new studio in 2019</a> — it was known under the name “PUBG Special Projects” — and two years later announced that he was leaving <em>PUBG</em> parent company Krafton to go independent. “Today, I’m excited to take the next step on my journey to create the kind of experience I’ve envisaged for years,” he said at the time.</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313251/verizon-admin-and-telco-recovery-charge-fee-increase"><h2>Verizon is once again raising its fees</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313130/sam-altman-openai-agi-lower-the-bar"><h2>Sam Altman lowers the bar for AGI</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24312352/openai-sora-o1-reasoning-12-days-shipmas"><h2>OpenAI’s 12 days of ‘shipmas’ include Sora and new reasoning model</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24313309/secret-level-review-amazon-prime-video"><h2>Amazon’s Secret Level is a hollow anthology of video game cutscenes</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314147/openai-reasoning-model-o1-strawberry-chatgpt-pro-new-tier"><h2>OpenAI is charging $200 a month for an exclusive version of its o1 ‘reasoning’ model</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
