He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Nintendo Switch is now eight years old and the company is announcing <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250304659858/en/">what could be its final retail bundle</a> push before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24284512/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-games-features">the introduction of the Switch 2</a>. The new bundle includes the Nintendo Switch OLED system with a digital copy of <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> and a 3-month Nintendo Switch Online individual membership for $349.99 — a $67.98 savings if bought separately at regular prices.</p><p>Nintendo is releasing the new bundle on March 10th to celebrate “MAR10 Day.” On March 9th, the company will also offer a bunch of its <em>Mario</em> titles on discount at retail stores including Best Buy, GameStop, Target, and Walmart. You can get <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, <em>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury</em>, <em>Super Mario RPG</em>, <em>Princess Peach: Showtime!,</em> and <em>Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</em> for $39.99 each, as well as <em>Mario vs. Donkey Kong</em> for $29.99.</p><p>After eight years, the Nintendo Switch is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/605948/nintendo-switch-lifetime-sales-nintendo-ds">on the cusp of outselling the Nintendo DS</a> and becoming the company’s best selling gaming system of all time. Nintendo says it’s “taking risks” with the Switch’s successor as it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606817/nintendo-switch-2-production-demand-q-a">proceeds with production</a>. The company is planning a Switch 2-focused Nintendo Direct <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606504/nintendo-switch-2-direct-new-time">on April 2nd</a> to share more details about the console.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/617038/see-you-at-the-warehouse">a whole lot of teasing</a>, it’s now official: remakes of <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3</em> and <em>4</em> are on the way. Activision officially announced the new release — called <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</em> — which will include remakes of both seminal skateboarding games and is launching on Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and the Switch on July 11th. It’ll also be available for subscribers of Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC.</p><p>Just like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21419054/tony-hawk-pro-skater-1-2-review-xbox-pc-ps4">the previous remakes</a>, the new collection will include all of the content from the original games, alongside some modern additions, including brand-new parks and a handful of current skaters like Olympic stars Rayssa Leal and Yuto Horigome. They’ll join the original cast, including the likes of Bucky Lasek, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Elissa Steamer, Chad Muska, Rodney Mullen, and, obviously, Tony Hawk.</p><p>The new game is being developed by Iron Galaxy Studios, which worked with Vicarious Visions — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244924/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-remake-studio-vicarious-visions-blizzard-entertainment-merger">now a part of Blizzard</a> — on the previous remake. Here’s a little before-and-after image comparing the original games to the updated version:</p><p>Activision says that the soundtrack — always an important part of a <em>Tony Hawk</em> game — will include classic songs from Motörhead, Gang Starr, KRS-One, and others, “alongside new tracks that capture the spirit of modern skate culture.” The game will also support cross-platform online multiplayer for up to eight skaters.</p><p>The original remakes were well-received updates of some true classics, and the new game will be launching at a very interesting time for skateboarding games. In addition to clever indie releases like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24339211/skate-city-new-york-review-apple-arcade">Skate City</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22915054/olliolli-world-review-switch-ps5-xbox-pc">OlliOlli World</a></em>, and the upcoming <em><a href="https://www.devolverdigital.com/games/skate-story">Skate Story</a></em>, EA is also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/30/23189958/ea-skate-trailer-progress-update-playtest-sign-up">bringing back its long-dormant <em>Skate</em> series</a>.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s a nice change from previous <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/31/23813778/sony-playstation-5-dolby-atmos-support-8tb-m2-storage">PS5</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/8/22924049/ps5-beta-voice-commands-party-chats">betas</a>, which have required individual signups and codes to access.</p><p>You should be able to <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/beta-program-at-playstation/">sign up for the program here</a> starting today, though as I write this, the page is 404-ing for me. The post suggests that you should “check back later if the page is not yet available in your region.”</p><p>Signing up for the program doesn’t guarantee that you’ll get picked for a beta, Shuman says.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
