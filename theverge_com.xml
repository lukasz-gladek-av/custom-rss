CEO Andrew Wilson and president of EA Entertainment and technology Laura Miele sent emails to staff about the change, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring"><em>IGN</em> reports</a>. <em>Kotaku’s</em> Ethan Gach <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/667401/eas-ceo-is-asking-staff-to-return-to-the-office">also reported</a> on Wilson’s email.</p><p>Corporate communications VP Justin Higgs confirmed the new hybrid model to <em>The Verge</em>. “We’ve adopted a globally consistent hybrid work model to bring teams together with greater clarity and intent – enabling faster decisions, sharper execution, and stronger connection to one another,” Higgs says. Hybrid roles will spend “at least three days a week in the office,” though there will be “flexibility” on other roles.</p><p>Miele’s email details how EA locations will have a 30-mile radius around them to help determine if an employee falls under the on site, hybrid, or remote model for work, IGN reports. Here’s what Miele says, per <em>IGN</em>:</p><div><ul><li><span>Employees who live within 30-miles/48-km of an EA location will transition to a Hybrid work model.</span></li><li><span>Employees who live outside the 30-mile/48-km radius will be considered remote unless their role is designated as On Site or Hybrid.</span></li></ul></div><p>The “offsite local” work model is going to be sunset within 3 to 24 months. In addition, “any work model exception and future Remote hires will require a CEO Direct’s /my approval,” Miele’s email says, according to IGN.</p><p><em><strong>Update, May 14th</strong>: Noted that Ethan Gach also reported on Wilson’s email.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A leak of old text messages sent to Steam customers with one-time codes for logins was “not a breach of Steam systems,” Valve says in <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F593110%2Fview%2F533224478739530145%3Fl%3Denglish" rel="sponsored">a post published Wednesday</a>.</p><p>Valve’s response follows news that a hacker is allegedly in possession of 89 million user records and put them up for sale for $5,000, as <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/twilio-denies-breach-following-leak-of-alleged-steam-2fa-codes/"><em>BleepingComputer</em> reports</a>. <em>BleepingComputer</em> looked at 3,000 leaked files and found “historic SMS text messages with one-time passcodes for Steam, including the recipient’s phone number.”</p><p>While one X user <a href="https://x.com/MellowOnline1/status/1921682082025115818">claimed that there is</a> evidence tying the breach to Twilio, a Twilio spokesperson told <em>BleepingComputer</em> that “there is no evidence to suggest that Twilio was breached” and that “we have reviewed a sampling of the data found online, and see no indication that this data was obtained from Twilio.” Valve also told the X user that <a href="https://x.com/MellowOnline1/status/1922458687316074640">it does not use Twilio</a>.</p><p>“The leak consisted of older text messages that included one-time codes that were only valid for 15-minute time frames and the phone numbers they were sent to,” Valve says in its post. “The leaked data did not associate the phone numbers with a Steam account, password information, payment information or other personal data. Old text messages cannot be used to breach the security of your Steam account, and whenever a code is used to change your Steam email or password using SMS, you will receive a confirmation via email and/or Steam secure messages.”</p><p>Valve adds that you don’t need to change your password or phone number following this leak, though it does recommend setting up the Steam Mobile Authenticator.</p><p>The company says it’s “still digging into the source of the leak.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
