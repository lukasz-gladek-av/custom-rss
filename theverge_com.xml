            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/14/24343428/legend-of-zelda-wind-waker-soundtrack-nintendo-music-app<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Break out your batons and call the King of Red Lions because <em>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</em> music has been added to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284073/nintendo-music-streaming-app-switch-online-subscribers">the Nintendo Music app</a>. The game’s arrival adds 133 new tracks to the app along with three <em>Wind Waker</em> themed playlists: Makar, Tetra, and Medli. Wind Waker joins a growing list of Zelda soundtracks in the app, including <em>Skyward Sword</em>, <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, and <em>Ocarina of Time</em>.</p><p>While its great that <em>Wind Waker</em> music is available for your study or work sessions, the announcement couldn’t not have come at a busier time. With all eyes watching for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342802/get-ready-for-the-switch-2-announcement-this-week">imminent reveal of the company’s next console</a>, getting a push notification — any push notification — from the Big Red Company is likely to cause a bit of a commotion. In fact, it seems like Nintendo’s doing a bit of plate clearing ahead of its Switch 2 reveal, announcing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342984/nintendo-alarmo-wide-release-date">Alarmo retail sales</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339971/nintendo-game-boy-lego-release-date-october-2025">Lego Game Boy set</a>.</p><p>Stand down, this isn’t The Announcement just yet, but it is coming. At least for now we can all chill out to “Makar’s Prayer” while we wait.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
