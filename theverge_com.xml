The announcement comes months after Crytek put the development of its next <em>Crysis </em>game “on hold” in Q3, 2024.</p><p>“Like so many of our peers, we aren’t immune to the complex, unfavorable market dynamics that have hit our industry these past several years,” says Crytek in a statement. “It pains us greatly to share today that we must lay off an estimated 15 percent of our around 400 employees.”</p><p>Crytek has been shifting developers over to <em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>, its multiplayer extraction shooter. “While <em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em> is still growing, Crytek cannot continue as before and remain financially sustainable,” says Crytek. “We firmly believe in the future of Crytek. With <em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>, we have a very strong gaming service and remain fully committed to its operation.“</p><p><em>Crysis 4</em> was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/26/22902394/crysis-4-teaser-trailer">originally announced</a> three years ago with a teaser trailer, when the game was in the early stages of development. Crytek now appears to be focused primarily on its live service game, instead of the single player <em>Crysis</em> franchise that created the “But can it run <em>Crysis</em>?” meme that mocked the original game’s hardware requirements.</p><div><p>Crytek’s layoffs come just a day after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610165/unity-layoffs-2025-runtime-fee">Unity announced a fresh round of layoffs</a>, and after a report revealed last month that one in 10 game developers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349728/gdc-state-of-the-industry-survey-2025-results">lost their jobs in 2024</a> alone.
