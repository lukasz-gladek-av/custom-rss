            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24283508/fortnite-remix-chapter-2-concert-snoop-dogg-ice-spice<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fortnite</em> is rewinding the clock once again. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285464/fortnite-remix-the-prelude-event-how-to-watch">After a bit of teasing</a>, Epic is about to kick off a new period in the battle royale game dubbed <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-run-it-back-with-snoop-eminem-ice-spice-and-juice-wrld-in-battle-royale">The Remix: Chapter 2</a> — and it’s not only looking back in time, it’s integrating music in an ambitious new way.</p><p>The launch of the remixed season was preceded by a musical event, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/2/23978521/fortnite-the-big-bang-eminem-chapter-5">similar to the Eminem concert that teased a new era for <em>Fortnite</em></a>. This time around, Snoop Dogg and Ice Spice took the stage — both in the game and IRL at Times Square in New York — and once the season kicks off, the musical aspects will go a step farther. </p><p>As the name implies, the new mini season brings back many of the characters, gameplay elements, and locations of the game’s second chapter, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20916237/fortnite-chapter-2-new-map-season-11-black-hole-design-epic-games">which launched in 2019</a>. Chapter 2 was notable in particular because it erased the original battle royale map to start over fresh for the first time. (The Chapter 2 map itself would be swapped out in 2021 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22815391/fortnite-the-end-event-chapter-2-recap-highlights-news">when it flipped over in dramatic fashion</a>.) The month-long event will change things up weekly, with new elements themed around a different musical artist. Snoop Dogg is up first, followed by Eminem, Ice Spice, and culminating with Juice WRLD.</p><p>The remixed version of Chapter 2 begins on November 2nd and will run through November 30th, with Epic teasing a “finale” event to wrap things up. It’s also introducing a new cosmetic item: kicks, so that you can put a pair of Nikes on Peely the banana.</p><div><p>Going back in time isn’t new for the game. A year ago <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23948555/fortnite-og-new-season">Epic kicked off <em>Fortnite OG</em></a>, a throwback mini season that was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23993686/fortnite-og-new-players-lego-fortnite">designed specifically to lure back lapsed players</a>, before the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic">dramatically expanded with new experiences like <em>Lego Fortnite</em></a>. Similarly, music has long been a large focus for the game, with virtual concerts from the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report">Travis Scott</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling">Ariana Grande</a>, along with a rhythm game called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23992574/fortnite-festival-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band"><em>Fortnite Festival</em></a> featuring stars like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137317/billie-eilish-fortnite-festival-date">Billie Eilish</a>.</p></div><div><p>More recently, Epic has started <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24282075/fortnite-streamlining-battle-passes-music-lego-festival">streamlining <em>Fortnite</em>’s battle passes to better accommodate all of its many games</a>. Meanwhile, a number of notable places have been crafting <em>Fortnite</em> islands of late, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261095/hasbro-board-games-fortnite">Hasbro</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24279789/fortnite-espn-football-island-disney">ESPN</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24281908/where-we-voting-boys">the Kamala Harris campaign</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
