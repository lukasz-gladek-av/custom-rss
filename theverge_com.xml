In a short trailer, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> developer Net Ease has announced that season 1 begins later this week on January 10th. </p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/zATLJ6Cqt0c?si=0AmAYqhdKelPw7p0">According to the trailer</a>, season 1 features the arrival of Dracula who plunges New York City into eternal night by <em>*checks notes*</em> teaming up with Dr. Doom to tamper with the moon’s orbit. (Hey, it’s a comic book game, weird nonsensical stuff is supposed to happen.)  Apparently Dracula has imprisoned Dr. Strange in a pocket dimension and has also unleashed a horde of vampires because messing with the moon just wasn’t enough. </p><p>To fight against this nefarious plot,<em> Rivals</em> will add four new characters to the game’s roster — The Invisible Woman, The Human Torch, Mr. Fantastic, and The Thing — the hero collective known as The Fantastic Four. Throughout the week leading up to season’s launch, players will be get a first look at the new heroes and their abilities starting January 7th. The addition also has a bit of synergy with the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/14/24072910/marvel-studios-fantastic-four-cast-pedro-pascal"><em>The Fantastic Four</em> movie starring Pedro Pascal and Vanessa Kirby</a> releases in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/27/24207887/fantastic-four-has-a-real-title">July of this year</a>. </p><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> appears to be scratching the hero shooter itch reminiscent of the early days of the original <em>Overwatch</em>. Developer Net Ease announced that the game <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1869080172814848471">has surpassed 20 million players</a> shortly after the free-to-play game’s launch in early December. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
