            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/618431/annapurna-interactive-2025-games-showcase<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Annapurna Interactive is hosting its first showcase of the year, and it’s an important one. Last year, Annapurna Interactive’s entire staff <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/9/12/24243317/annapurna-interactive-staff-reportedly-resigns">resigned en masse</a> after negotiations to spin off the respected indie game publisher into its own independent entity broke down. Since then, those employees have formed their own company and even have a new crop of games to manage since it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338274/annapurna-interactive-new-company-take-two-private-division">took over publishing duties for Take-Two’s former indie label Private Division</a>. But where does that leave Annapurna?</p><p>After the resignations, the company issued a statement assuring players that its games would still be published as normal. With this showcase (which you can watch in full <a href="https://youtu.be/5XTSFLFV7e8?si=mTgy-svDE5xaefi4">here</a>), we will get more details on what to expect from Annapurna in the first half of 2025. </p><div><p id="to-a-t"><h2><em>To a T</em></h2></p></div><p><em>To a T </em>is the latest release from <em>Katamari Damacy</em> creator <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21025916/keita-takahashi-interview-wattam-katamari">Keita Takahashi</a>, and damn, if it ain’t adorable <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21021203/wattam-review-ps4-pc-katamari">like most of his games</a>. The game tells the story of Teen, a young person with a… we’ll say “unique” posture, and it’s up to you to help them navigate the challenges that come with being born stuck in a permanent “T” pose. For the showcase, <em>To a T </em>got a special music video a la “<a href="https://youtu.be/sQTk4eK2fP4?si=cBFDxOYSEBkOFSN5">It’s Bugsnax!</a>” featuring the vocal stylings of <em>Steven Universe</em> creator Rebecca Sugar. <em>To a T</em> launches on May 28th on Xbox, PS5, and PC, and a demo is available now on Steam.</p><div><p id="morsels"><h2><em>Morsels</em></h2></p></div><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1719040%2FMorsels%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Morsels</em></a> is a creature collector roguelite with a creepy / cute grossout vibe. Use your powers of transformation to turn into the right monster for the job and battle against evil cat creatures. (Finally, some cozy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/18/23220428/stray-video-game-review-ps4-ps5-steam">cat</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/14/23999288/neko-atsume-purrfect-kitty-collector-meta-quests-trailer-release-date">game</a> counterprogramming!) No release date on <em>Morsels</em> yet, but expect it to launch sometime in 2025 on PC and Nintendo Switch.</p><div><p id="wheel-world"><h2><em>Wheel World</em></h2></p></div><p>There’s something about the kinds of presentations that give a glimpse into the people and lives that make these games that really endears me to both the studio and the game. I’m not a bike person, but after seeing the behind-the-scenes presentation for <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1497460%2FWheel_World%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Wheel World</em></a>, I want to be. <em>Wheel World</em> is an open-world magical cycling adventure where you can ride, race, customize your bike, and ultimately save the world. It launches summer 2025, but you can check out the demo now during Steam’s Next Fest.</p><div><p id="faraway"><h2><em>Faraway</em></h2></p></div><p>According to its one-man development team, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2831000%2FFaraway%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Faraway</em></a> can be played with just one hand. In it, you play as a shooting star destined to flicker out but that keeps itself shining brightly by traveling the stars and making constellations. The game consists of a “story” mode that procedurally generates in response to players’ actions and skill levels. There’s also a puzzle mode designed to challenge players in their journey across the stars. Try out <em>Faraway</em> during Steam’s Next Fest or wait for the game’s release on PC later this year.</p><div><p id="geometric-interactive"><h2>Geometric Interactive</h2></p></div><p>Geometric, developer of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23939189/october-2023-games-hidden-gem-cocoon-subpar-pool-jusant">phenomenal puzzle platformer <em>Cocoon</em></a>, is back with some lo-fi vibes to carry orbs to. The studio is working with iam8bit to release a collector’s edition of the game as well as <em>Cocoon</em>’s soundtrack on vinyl. The studio also teased that it’s working on a completely new game but, of course, didn’t share any details yet. </p><div><p id="lushfoil-photography-sim"><h2><em>Lushfoil Photography Sim</em></h2></p></div><p>As the name suggests, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1749860%2FLushfoil_Photography_Sim%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Lushfoil</em></a> is all about taking pictures using true-to-life photography techniques. Explore different locations around the world, including the torii gates of Kyoto, Japan, the lush forests of Italy, and even the mountainous Annapurna region in Nepal. Each location is rendered in stunning detail and features photography objectives and collectible cameras that’ll encourage players to strive for the perfect shot. <em>Lushfoil</em> has a demo available on Steam and is slated to launch on April 15th, 2025, on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p><div><p id="wanderstop"><h2><em>Wanderstop</em></h2></p></div><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1299460%2FWanderstop%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Wanderstop</em></a> is a cozy adventure sim all about tea and navigating difficult life changes, but mostly about tea. Collect ingredients for tea, brew it in an elaborate contraption that looks more like a mad scientist chemistry kit, and thwart the designs of an apparently nefarious bird. <em>Wanderstop</em> is the first game from Ivy Road and is set to launch on Steam and PS5 on March 11th.</p><div><p id="skin-deep"><h2><em>Skin Deep</em></h2></p></div><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F301280%2FSkin_Deep%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Skin Deep</em></a> has one hell of a pitch. According to the developers at Blendo Games, the game is essentially “<em>Die Hard</em> with more comedy.” You play as Nina Pasadena, a legendary assassin turned “insurance commando” tasked with saving a starship from a space pirate invasion using whatever tools and weapons she can scrounge along the way. Based on the trailer, <em>Skin Deep </em>feels like a cross between <em>Hitman</em> and <em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/24/skibidi-toilet-movie-tv-franchise-youtube-michael-bay/">Skibidi Toilet</a>, </em>which, honestly, sounds like a neat vibe. You can test that vibe for yourself in the demo or wait for the game’s launch on April 30th.</p><div><p id="sayonara-wild-hearts"><h2><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em></h2></p></div><p><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em> was one of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20882183/sayonara-wild-hearts-interview-switch-ps4-apple-arcade-simogo">breakout hits of 2019</a>, and it’s back with next-gen updates and a brand-new game mode exclusively for PS5. Remix Arcade allows players to chase high scores in infinitely replayable, progressively faster, and more difficult sound bites with no loading. <em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em> on PS5 is out now and available as a free upgrade if you have the PS4 version.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
