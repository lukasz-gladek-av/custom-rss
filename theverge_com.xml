This AI model could allow computers and robots to understand and interact with the world in new ways, the company said in a blog post <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/right-wing-social-networks-don-t-work">spotted by <em>Garbage Day</em></a>.</p><p>The LGM’s “spatial intelligence” is built on the neural networks developed as part of Niantic’s Visual Positioning System. The blog post explains that “Over the past five years, Niantic has focused on building our Visual Positioning System (VPS), which uses a single image from a phone to determine its position and orientation using a 3D map built from people scanning interesting locations in our games and Scaniverse,” and “This data is unique because it is taken from a pedestrian perspective and includes places inaccessible to cars.”</p><p>Niantic Chief Scientist Victor Prisacariu was more explicit in a <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/news/q-and-a-with-victor-prisacariu?hl=en">2022 Q&amp;A</a>, saying, “Using the data our users upload when playing games like <em>Ingress</em> and<em> Pokémon Go</em>, we built high-fidelity 3D maps of the world, which include both 3D geometry (or the shape of things) and semantic understanding (what stuff in the map is, such as the ground, sky, trees, etc).”</p><p>As <em>404 Media</em> points out, nobody who downloaded <em>Pokémon Go</em> in 2016 could have predicted their data would “one day fuel this type of AI product.” </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When it first launched, the device was only able to stream games from your PS5 over Wi-Fi. But as part of <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/">a new system update</a> that’s rolling out starting later today, you’ll be able to stream select PS5 games from the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog to your PlayStation Portal.</p><p>Sony is launching the feature in beta, and you’ll need to be a PlayStation Plus Premium subscriber to take advantage of it. Sony says that to stream at 720p, you’ll need a minimum 7 Mbps connection, while 1080p quality will require a minimum 13 Mbps connection. </p><div><figcaption>Portal Cloud Streaming Beta</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony</cite></p></div><p>Some PlayStation Plus features won’t be available to start with cloud streaming to the PlayStation Portal, including Game Trials, party voice chat, game invites for select games, 3D audio, and “in-game commerce.” And you won’t be able to stream any PS4 games or PS3 games. Child accounts also won’t be able to use cloud streaming on the Portal.</p><p>The beta will be available in the following countries:</p><div><blockquote><p>Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Cyprus, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States</p></blockquote></div><p>Sony launched cloud streaming on PS5 consoles <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/17/23921324/ps5-cloud-streaming-japan-europe-usa">last year</a>.</p><p>As part of the new PlayStation Portal update, there are changes to audio, too, including a lower minimum volume level and the ability to tweak settings of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/30/23938722/sony-playstation-pulse-explore-elite-earbuds-headset-release-date">a PlayStation Link device</a> from your Portal’s settings.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300863/minecraft-movie-trailer-jack-black-steve<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24235698/minecraft-movie-trailer"><em>A Minecraft Movie</em></a> has a new trailer giving us a taste at the kind of story moviegoers can expect. The trailer predominately features Jack Black as Steve, the silent protagonist players embody in <em>Minecraft</em>. In the trailer, Black’s Steve is way more chatty, giving us his backstory as a child who quite literally yearns for the mines. As an adult, Steve finds a special blue cube that transports him to the <em>Minecraft</em> world where, “anything you can imagine is possible.” </p><p>It should come as no surprise that the movie, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a> before it, is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isekai">isekai</a>. A group of unsuspecting folks including Danielle Brooks, Jason Momoa, Emma Myers, and Sebastian Eugene Hansen are magically transported to the world to find a blocky paradise of Steve’s making. The trailer features another look at the movie versions of popular <em>Minecraft </em>devices like redstone-powered minecarts, crafting tables, and ender pearls. There’s even a reference to the crazy contraptions players can create in the game with an automatic chicken cooker that uses lava as a heating element.</p><p>In conjunction with the trailer’s release, Xbox has published a blog that goes into detail about all the devices seen in the trailer. Check it out <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/19/minecraft-movie-official-trailer-game-features/">here</a>. And you can watch Jack Black and Jason Momoa chew the scenery when <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> releases April 4th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
