            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/662440/xbox-handheld-photos-microsoft-asus-rog-ally-2-fcc-listing<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/dominic-preston">Dominic Preston</a> <span>is a news editor with over a decade’s experience in journalism. He previously worked at <em>Android Police</em> and <em>Tech Advisor</em>.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The first photos of the Asus ROG Ally 2 have surfaced online thanks to regulatory listings, but with a twist: there are two versions of the gaming handheld, and one features a dedicated Xbox button.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/628073/microsoft-xbox-handheld-project-kennan-notepad">We reported two months ago</a> that Microsoft was working with Asus to develop an Xbox-branded handheld codenamed “Project Kennan,” and this appears to be it. It’s a black version of the otherwise almost identical white ROG Ally 2, with a small button in the top-left corner bearing an engraved Xbox logo. That button is blacked out on the regular ROG, though will likely be replaced or removed in its production version.</p><p><a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/id/hub/asus-rog-ally-2-diduga-segera-rilis-di-indonesia-dapat-sertifikat-sdppi-postel/"><em>91mobiles</em></a> found listings for the ROG Ally 2 at the Indonesian certificate, and <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-rog-ally-2-and-rog-ally-2-xbox-edition-gaming-handhelds-leaked"><em>VideoCardz</em></a> linked those to an <a href="https://device.report/fccid/msq-mt7922a12l">FCC listing</a> for the Wi-Fi module included in the two devices, which includes photos of the hardware. That listing also reveals some limited specs, which include a 7-inch, 120Hz LCD display — about the same as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review">the first generation</a> — with an 8-core, 36W AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme CPU included in the Xbox edition, and a less powerful 4-core, 20W chip in the white version.</p><p>The design has also been altered, with more molded controller grips on each edge, rather than the blocky, sloped design of the ROG Ally. That leaves the hardware as a whole looking thicker than before, but perhaps it’ll be more comfortable to hold.</p><p>With certification already under way, it’s likely that a release is around the corner. Asus often launches hardware at Computex, which begins on May 20th — just one day after Microsoft’s own Build conference begins on May 19th.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
