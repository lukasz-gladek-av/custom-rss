            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/598008/atari-nubeo-asteroids-watch-retro-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Atari has released a collection of new watches with a unique design that celebrates the 45th anniversary of <em>Asteroids</em>. In the original version of the game that debuted in 1979, spotting and shooting a passing UFO would earn you extra points. On the Asteroids watch, a pair of orbiting UFOs are less of a threat and are instead used to represent the hour and minute hands — no numbers needed.</p><p>Created in collaboration with watchmaker Nubeo (which previously released a collection of <a href="https://nubeowatches.com/collections/space-invaders-limited-edition"><em>Space Invaders</em>-themed timepieces</a>) the new Asteroids collection features five styles, each with a differently colored band — nebula blue, plasma pumpkin, supernova red, nova nightfall, and celestial citrine — and varying colors for the watchface elements. They’re <a href="https://nubeowatches.com/collections/atari-limited-edition">available through Nubeo’s website</a>, which lists each watch’s price as being discounted to $499 from $1,650. You can also <a href="https://atari.com/collections/atari-x-nubeo-watches">order them through Atari’s website</a>, which just lists the price as $499 each, although some have already sold out. Each style is limited to just 125 pieces.</p><p>The watch uses a Japanese automatic movement that powers three spinning discs. The smallest features a recreation of the game’s simple triangular spaceship in the center that serves as the watch’s second hand, while two larger discs, rotating at different speeds, portray asteroids drifting through space and the UFOs that function as the hour and minute hands.</p><p>All of the graphical elements on the Asteroids watch’s face are printed with glow-in-the-dark “Swiss Super-LumiNova” pigments and are protected beneath a durable sapphire lens and a stainless steel case. The watch is water resistant with a 21 ATM (atmosphere) rating and a screw-down crown, making it durable enough for recreational diving. It comes in a protective case with an interior that borrows design elements from the Atari Video Computer System (VCS) that launched in 1977.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The studio is planning yet another quality-of-life update for the game with Patch 8.</p><p>“Arriving next year, this update will introduce some of the most eagerly awaited features to <em>BG3</em>: cross-play, and photo mode, along with 12 new subclasses,” <a rel="sponsored" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1086940%2Fview%2F4461474037375172735">Larian wrote on its Steam Community page</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24307746/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-cross-play-photo-mode">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTcxMzk=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24236649/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-now-live-evil-endings-mod-support">Baldur’s Gate 3 patch adds official in-game mod support</a></h2><div><p>The long-awaited <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/16/24199957/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-coming-soon">Patch 7 for <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a> is now live. The update adds new, gruesome cinematics for some of the game’s evil endings, new legendary actions for Honor Mode encounters, and official in-game mod support.</p><p>However, with Patch 7 comes a big ole asterisk from the game’s maker, Larian Studios. The patch is currently only available for PC, meaning that players will be unable to load cross-platform save files from PC on their console versions. PC / Mac multiplayer is also disabled. Larian says that it intends to launch Patch 7 on consoles and Mac sometime in October, so <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/10/23827343/baldurs-gate-3-reactivates-ps5-cross-saves">if you like to hop between desktop and console to play <em>BG3</em></a>, you’ll have to wait about a month. The compatibility issues can be avoided by simply declining to update the game on PC, but with all the other Patch 7 improvements, that might prove a difficult choice.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24236649/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-now-live-evil-endings-mod-support">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MjEyMDY=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/16/24199957/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-coming-soon">Larian Studios teases all the new features coming in the next Baldur’s Gate 3 patch</a></h2><div><p>In a new community update, Larian Studios <a rel="sponsored" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1086940%2Fview%2F4240783699885624491">has shared a brief overview</a> of all the things it’s working on for the next <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> patch.</p><p>Larian has previously announced that patch 7, due out in September, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170409/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-pc-consoles">will include the release of official mod support</a> and the introduction of a toolkit that will allow players the ability to create their own mods. According to Larian, the toolkit supports the creation of new items, classes and subclasses, races, and more.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/16/24199957/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-coming-soon">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MjU4ODk=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170409/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-pc-consoles">Baldur’s Gate 3 mod support is coming in September</a></h2><div><p>It’s gonna get pretty funky in Faerûn with official mod support coming to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23860060/baldurs-gate-3-news-reviews-updates"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>. Larian Studios announced that official mod support will roll out in phases, starting today with a closed alpha, before a closed beta test in July, culminating with the official release of Patch 7 in September. According to Larian, the staggered testing phases will give the community ample time to test the new mod tools before making them available across PC and consoles.</p><p>If you have experience with official mod support in games like <em>Skyrim</em> or <em>Fallout</em>, Larian’s approach will sound similar. On PC, mods will be tested to ensure terms of service compatibility and overall stability before approval. Those mods will then undergo additional approvals before coming to console. While PC players will have access to the full suite of mod creation tools, and mods can still be made, downloaded, and played without using the official mod browser, console players will only be able to browse and install mods officially approved by Larian.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170409/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-pc-consoles">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MzIzMDU=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/22/24108773/baldurs-gate-3-larian-dungeons-and-dragons">Baldur’s Gate 3 developer is moving on from Dungeons and Dragons</a></h2><div><p>With the sheer popularity surrounding <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, the game is ripe for an expansion — but if it ever happens, it won’t be made by its developer Larian Studios. During a panel at the Game Developers Conference on Thursday, Larian founder Swen Vincke revealed that the studio plans on moving away from <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>games, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-studios-wont-make-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-expansions-or-baldurs-gate-4">as first reported by <em>IGN</em></a>.</p><p>“We’re not going to make new expansions, which everybody is expecting us to do.
