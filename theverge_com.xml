Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>The popularity of Pokémon cards depicting shiny monsters is one of the reasons that physical packs have become <a href="https://gizmodo.com/hunting-for-pokemon-cards-has-become-a-different-kind-o-1846622862">so much harder to find in the wild these days</a>. The Pokémon Company has been trying to figure out <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/pokemon-center-online-store-implements-queue-system/">ways to solve the real world scarcity / scalping problem</a> for a while now, but that shouldn’t be an issue for <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s next set.</p></div><p>Today, TPC announced that <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s newest expansion, Shining Revelry, is set to drop next week on March 27th. As its name implies, Shining Revelry will feature multiple shiny (recolored) versions of older popular pokémon who have already appeared in the game like Charizard, Pachirisu, and Lucario. But the set will also introduce a variety of creatures and characters from the <em>Pokémon </em>franchise’s newer Switch games like grass starter Sprigatito and gym leader Iono.</p><p>Ranked competitive matches are also coming to <em>Pocket </em>beginning March 27th with an event built around Shining Revelry that will run until April 26th. And starting on April 1st, players will be able to start collecting shiny Charizard-themed in-game accessories — presumably by completing player objectives.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
