            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318876/xbox-tests-streaming-games-console<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft is going to let Xbox Insiders who also subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate test the ability to stream some Xbox games they already own to their Xbox <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/12/11/xbox-insiders-with-game-pass-ultimate-stream-your-own-game-on-xbox-consoles/">starting today</a>. The feature could be useful if you want to jump into a game without having to install the whole thing; given how big game file sizes can be nowadays, streaming a game via the cloud might be a faster way to play or save you from hitting a data cap. </p><p>Microsoft has published a list of games that support the feature <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fplay%2Fgallery%2Fbuy-and-stream">on its website</a>. There are some great games on the list, including <em>Animal Well</em>, <em>Balatro</em>, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, <em>Cyberpunk 2077,</em> and <em>Price of Persia: The Lost Crown</em>.</p><p>You’ll be able to stream games on Xbox Series X / S and Xbox One consoles, Microsoft says, and the feature is set to come out of testing next year. The company started letting Xbox players stream select games they own on TVs and browsers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24300547/xbox-cloud-gaming-game-library-streaming">last month</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318799/microsoft-xbox-app-new-games-homescreen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft is updating the Xbox app on Windows today with hundreds of PC games that weren’t previously available and a new home experience. It’s part of a broader effort to make the Xbox app <em>the </em>place to find PC games, regardless of whether they’re part of PC Game Pass or not.</p><p>“Earlier this summer, we began working with partners to bring all PC games with Xbox features into the Xbox app,” <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2024/12/updates-to-the-xbox-app/">explains Chris Charla</a>, general manager of content curation and programs at Xbox. “We’re super excited to see what Xbox games come to Windows PC from game creators in the future and to welcome nearly 400 titles that previously weren’t discoverable or purchasable in the Xbox app.”</p><div><figcaption><em>The new Xbox app homescreen.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Microsoft</cite></p></div><p>The 400 new games include titles from Japanese studios like Kemco and Kairosoft, alongside games like <em>The Invincible</em>&nbsp;by Double 11. More than 100 of these new titles are also Xbox Play Anywhere, so if you buy the Xbox console version then you can play the Xbox PC version too. “Universal Xbox ownership, as well as universal cloud saves on Xbox, and cross-play between Xbox versions on console and PC (and other platforms, at the developer’s discretion) are awesome features players love,” says Charla.</p><p>This update fixes a big problem with the Xbox app, where it wasn’t easy to find Xbox Play Anywhere games that might have otherwise been available in the Microsoft Store. The <a href="https://xboxera.com/2024/11/29/microsoft-is-slowly-fixing-the-xbox-pc-apps-biggest-problem/">XboxEra community</a> has been compiling lists of missing games from the Xbox app, and it looks like Microsoft has been taking note.</p><p>Microsoft has been gradually improving its Xbox app over the past year, including some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152252/microsoft-xbox-handheld-compact-mode-controller-improvements">handheld-focused improvements</a>. The software giant has also been trying to tempt game developers over to its Windows-based store in recent years, even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent">lowing its cut from 30 percent to just 12 percent</a> to try and shake up PC gaming. </p><p>Despite these efforts, there are plenty of PC games that have cross-play between the Xbox and PC version of the game but aren’t part of the Microsoft Store currently or the Xbox app. Microsoft now appears to be working to bring even more of these games into the Xbox app, and it will be interesting to see whether the company makes the bold move of listing Steam, Epic Games Store, or <a href="http://itch.io/">itch.io</a> games in the Xbox app soon, too. Microsoft says it will have more to share about its Xbox app plans at the game developers conference in March.</p><p>Microsoft is also rolling out a new home UI for the Xbox app on Windows today. The home UI now includes featured content from PC Game Pass and the Microsoft Store, alongside collections of deals and discounts. Microsoft has also added a “jump back in” section that lets you quickly get back into recent games just like you can on an Xbox console.</p><p><em><strong>Update, November 11th</strong>: Article updated with details on the Xbox app changes.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
