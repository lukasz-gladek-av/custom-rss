In an update <a href="https://www.analogue.co/support/resource/3d-preorder-faq">on its preorder website</a>, Analogue explained that it’s modern take on the Nintendo 64 “is now shipping in late August 2025,” after previously aiming for July. The company said in a separate statement that the decision was made due to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/699681/trump-south-korea-japan-tariff-25-percent">the ever-changing situation around US tariffs</a>.</p><p>“Following last week’s sudden tariff changes, Analogue 3D will now begin shipping next month,” the company explained in <a href="https://x.com/analogue/status/1945166565114081648">a post on X</a>. “We’re absorbing the costs — your preorder price stays the same. No additional charges. Late August, the wait ends: reviews go live with everything we’ve been saving for this moment.”</p><p>Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22831589/analogue-pocket-review">its previous hardware</a>, the $249.99 Analogue 3D is a modern console designed to play old games, in this case N64 cartridges. The new console can upscale classic games to 4K and includes multiple display modes to mimic the look and feel of a CRT display, and the company says that it supports 100 percent of N64 cartridges. It was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23915941/analogue-3d-nintendo-64">originally planned for a launch in 2024</a>, but has been hit with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24265587/analogue-3d-nintendo-64-price-preorder-date">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631816/analogue-3d-delay-nintendo-64-modretro-teaser">delays</a> since it was initially announced.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/707586/analogue-3d-4k-n64-delay-august-2025]]></content:encoded>
