            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>“Yesterday was an interesting day for the Helldivers community.” That’s the very obvious understatement that announced the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nfso8x/please_read_rhelldivers_has_been_reopened_a/">reopening</a> of the Helldivers gaming subreddit in the small hours of Saturday morning. On Friday it was discovered that Tyler Robinson, arrested for the alleged killing of Charlie Kirk, had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/politics/777313/charlie-kirks-alleged-killer-scratched-bullets-with-a-helldivers-combo-and-a-furry-sex-meme">inscribed messages</a> on the casings of several bullets found at the crime scene. One of those read “Hey fascist! Catch!” accompanied by an up arrow symbol, a right arrow, and three down arrows, a reference to the code to call down the <a href="https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki/Eagle_500kg_Bomb">500KG Bomb stratagem</a> in the cooperative shooter<em> Helldivers 2</em>.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, within minutes the official <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/">subreddit</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777614/discord-charlie-kirk-shooting-tyler-robinson">Discord</a> servers were thrown into chaos. Moderators quickly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nf6g7e/rhelldivers_is_locked_temporarily_requests_to/">locked</a> the Helldivers subreddit, pointing to a high number of posts that violated its rule against “Real-World Political Discussions.” Similarly, references to Robinson, Kirk, or the 500KG Bomb stratagem were quickly deleted on the Discord server, and some users speculated the code had been flagged for autodeletion. (Arrowhead Game Studios, makers of the Helldivers series, hasn’t released a public statement about the incident and didn’t respond to a request for comment.) Users merely asking why the subreddit was locked were shut down — “We are not allowed to discuss, I would suggest looking elsewhere,” one user was told.</p><p>Online and in conversations with <em>The Verge</em>, Helldivers fans mostly seemed confused and a little concerned about what might come along with all of this sudden attention. “I just don’t want to see a community I love get slandered to no fault of their own,” one Discord user, Inferionix, wrote.</p><p>Helldivers is hardly the first piece of media tied to an act of violence; the Columbine High School shooting famously put an unwelcome spotlight on <em>Doom</em> as commentators searched for a meaning behind the attack. But Kirk’s slaying inspired <a href="https://www.theverge.com/politics/776293/charlie-kirk-maga-influencer-violence">widespread calls for retaliatory violence</a> by Republicans, making the still-ongoing search for Robinson’s motive particularly high-stakes. Even discussing it is risky, as lawmakers and right-wing tycoon Elon Musk are surveilling social media to police social media users’ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/776840/charlie-kirk-death-social-media-jawboning">responses to Kirk’s death</a>, demanding firings at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777664/elon-musk-charlie-kirk-satya-nadella-fire">employers including Microsoft</a>. The subreddit mods said in their reopening post that nobody was banned during the initial flood of shooting-related comments, but anyone who discusses it in the future will be.</p><p>One brief bastion where fans of the game could share their feelings was the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/helldivers2/">Helldivers 2</a> subreddit, which doesn’t have the same strict ban on real life political discussions. A megathread there, at least for a while, was filled mostly was fans marveling at just how surreal the situation was. “Waking up and hearing a sitting governor of the United States say ‘Notices bulge OwO whats this?’ was a goddamn flashbang,” Reddit user Snaxwheels wrote, referring to one of the other, non-Helldivers-related inscriptions. But eventually that thread was also removed after moderators felt it had gotten out of hand.</p><p>Some posters there expressed concern that the attention could reignite the culture war around violent video games. One even pointed out that RFK Jr. had recently revived a largely dismissed theory <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/watch-kennedy-says-nih-is-studying-possible-causes-of-u-s-gun-violence">linking violent games to school shootings</a>. Isadora, an active community member who spoke with <em>The Verge</em>, was more dubious. “Givin [sic] the short news cycles and the fact that such a large portion of MAGAs youth base are among the [conservative games streamer] Asmongold/gamergate type I don’t see the admin and its media machine coming super hard against the game itself.”</p><p>One outstanding question is what — if anything — Robinson thought about Helldiver’s politics. The series, which draws from Robert Heinlein’s <em>Starship Troopers</em> and Paul Verhoeven’s film adaptation, is a satire where players take the role of brainwashed military grunts fighting to spread “managed democracy” for a quasi-fascist Super Earth government. Isadora calls the gameplay the biggest draw, but “its politics is what made me fall in love with it,” they said. “I’m a big Paul Verhoeven fan and <em>Starship Troopers</em> was one of my favorites.”</p><p>As with other satires on authoritarianism, like <em>Warhammer 40K</em>, there’s a persistent discussion about <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/helldivers-2-fascism-satire-debate-rcna140653">whether some players get the joke</a>. Isadora, largely, thinks they do. “I’m sad that this community has been drug into this as I think the game’s ironic criticism of fascism is a great outlet for so many people,” they told <em>The Verge</em>. “It reflects negatively on a community that largely understands the criticisms it lays out.”<br>Helldivers will almost certainly go down as a footnote in Kirk’s death. But for some players, the strangeness of using the 500KG Bomb combo — or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dnnzys/for_democracy/">having it as a tattoo</a> — might linger. One Redditor suggested starting a petition to encourage Arrowhead to change the button command. Most disagreed, littering his message with thumbs down and big red X reactions. “Please don’t bring it here,” said the only reply.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/777738/helldivers-community-reddit-discord-charlie-kirk#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjA5MzU0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Terrence O'Brien</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/777738/helldivers-community-reddit-discord-charlie-kirk]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I would not call the time I’m having with<em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/769489/hollow-knight-silksong-news-updates">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> </em>“fun,” and yet I’m still playing.</p><p>In the depths of The Marrow, the second major area of <em>Silksong</em>, there’s a particularly nasty midboss. I eventually beat him, but my reward wasn’t a new ability, item, or a bench where I could rest and save my progress. All I got was pain, suffering, and death. In <em>Silksong</em>, the only way out is through, but the “through” is a tunnel lined with spikes that occasionally spew gouts of flame.</p><p>I should have given up right then and there, but I have not abandoned <em>Silksong </em>the same way I do other unfun games. For the life of me, I couldn’t figure out why I didn’t just put <em>Silksong</em> down and chalk it up as another “not for me” game the way <em>Hollow Knight</em> just wasn’t for me. I enjoy Metroidvanias a great deal — <em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em> was one of my favorite games of last year. And for <em>Silksong</em>, I wanted to try Team Cherry’s work again and see if it would finally click. It has, and it’s because of the community (and a <em>lot </em>of spite).</p><p>I came to <em>Hollow Knight</em> late, long after the buzz about it had left my social media circle. With <em>Silksong</em>, I’m playing it at the same time as everyone else. My social media feed is full of people who love the game much more than I do, posting tips, commiserating about its moments of bullshit (hello, lantern fruit pogo platforming), and gushing over the adorable Sherma.</p><div><p><sub>“I have only known Sherma <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ive-only-had-arlo-for-a-day-and-a-half">for a day and a half</a>…”</sub></p></div><p>When I post lamenting the game’s bullshit, I get excited messages from my friends giving me advice on what I should do next. It’s like we’re all doing our own personal let’s plays together while being in each other’s chats. It feels good. I am not alone in my misery, and better yet, I’ve got friends to help. For <em>Silksong</em> it’s worked in such a way that’s kept me playing longer than I would have if I were going this alone.</p><p>This kind of collective, collaborative gaming experience has also taught me a new trick: taking a break. I’ve never been the kind of gamer that stops playing when I can’t overcome an obstacle. I either do something else in the game or keep running at my problem until I figure it out. Now, when I feel myself getting even the slightest bit mad because I was so close (or I <em>thought</em> I was so close) to surmounting a challenge, I turn off the game and come back later. It’s so silly that, once again, the “touch grass” people are right, but the strategy has gotten me through some of the game’s most egregious moments. (If the vendor Shakra wants to leave her post in Greymoor because of something I did, that’s fine. But taking her bench with her that’s in a room <em>right before a brutal combat gauntlet</em> is a unique and dastardly flavor of <em>Silksong</em> bullshit.)</p><p>And when I overcome that bullshit, I get this incredible frisson of thrill. When I easily beat a boss in fewer tries than I’m used to, I feel godly. I’m actually quite tickled to hear Team Cherry <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/774277/silksongs-first-patch-boss-difficulty">is working to nerf some of the early bosses</a>, because those were fine. (It’s the damn pogo platforming!)</p><p>I’m pretty sure I’m going to finish <em>Silksong </em>and whatever I feel at the end of that journey will be more like relief than joy. <em>Silksong</em> has shown me I don’t need to feel “happiness” or “joy” to continue playing a game. I just want to feel something — even if that something is pure spite.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/777653/silksong-impressions-team-cherry-metroidvania-sherma-is-cool#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/777653/silksong-impressions-team-cherry-metroidvania-sherma-is-cool]]></content:encoded>
