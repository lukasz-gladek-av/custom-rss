            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s Game Awards season, y’all. That special time of the year when we gather together to celebrate video games and the people who make them… by watching expensive commercials briefly punctuated by the odd awards speech or musical performance. For better or worse, The Game Awards is the biggest night on the video game event calendar. But with the way things have been going, lately it’s been more “worse” than it has been “better.”</p><p>Between host and industry hypeman Geoff Keighley’s two video game vanity projects, The Game Awards is older and ostensibly more mature than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/679598/summer-game-fest-2025-trailers-news">Summer Game Fest</a>. Conceived in 2014 as a way to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/7/18131058/game-awards-2018-geoff-keighly-creaotr-streaming-tga-hydrobot">celebrate both the people who make and play games,</a> the show has always been part awards ceremony, part commercial product. That idea has been executed with varying degrees of success. (Remember the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2016/12/02/the-good-the-bad-and-the-cringeworthy-of-the-2016-game-awards/">Schick Hydrobot</a>?) But for the last few years, it’s felt like the awards part was increasingly getting in the way of the commercial part.</p><p>That was felt most acutely <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23992402/geoff-keighley-the-game-awards-layoffs">during the 2023 Game Awards</a>. Developers accepting statues were often drowned out by music or cut off by teleprompters asking them to “please wrap it up” after their roughly 30 seconds of allotted time. Muppets and <em>Death Stranding</em> director Hideo Kojima, though, had no such time limits enforced on them, with <em>Aftermath </em>calculating that <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-many-game-awards-acceptance-speeches-could-have-taken-place-while-kojima-was-talking/#coral_thread">13 acceptance speeches</a> could have fit inside the five minutes Kojima took to explain his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/783409/od-kojima-xbox-game-trailer">game / not-game <em>OD</em></a>.</p><p>2023 was also the first full year into the now endemic <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24009039/video-game-layoffs-2023">video game labor crisis</a> that saw developers laid off by the tens of thousands while studios of popular games got shut down. That crisis went by that year’s game awards with no acknowledgement, angering developers further. “I’m incredibly disappointed in Geoff Keighley for his silence on the state of the industry this year,” Monomi Park senior environment artist Dillon Sommerville told <em>The Verge</em> in 2023.</p><div><div><p id="how-to-watch-the-game-awards"><h2>How to watch The Game Awards</h2></p></div><p>On Thursday, December 11th at 5PM PT / 8PM ET the TGAs will be streamed on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thegameawards">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/d-BDeU3R5ic?si=XC2AGGmUKLrak3rH">YouTube</a>. This year, Keighley has also signed a deal to beam the show live <a href="https://thegameawards.com/news/the-game-awards-adds-prime-video">via Prime Video</a> where it’ll be free to watch for Prime subscribers.</p></div><p>Keighley, perhaps responding to the bad optics, <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-awards-2024-future-class-game-changer-geoff-keighley/">acknowledged the continuing labor issue in 2024</a>. The Game Awards also introduced a new category, Game Changer, with its inaugural award going to Amir Satvat, a business development director at Tencent who created a resource to help laid-off developers find jobs.</p><p>But in the months since the 2024 awards, Keighley has once again been accused of poor treatment of the people he’s supposed to be celebrating. In 2020, The Game Awards <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-game-awards-announces-inaugural-future-class">announced a new initiative called The Future Class</a>, designed to celebrate game makers, “who represent the bright, bold and inclusive future of video games.” Inductees are honored during the broadcast and provided with networking opportunities, mentorship programs, and other resources throughout the following year. However, there have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/nov/11/future-class-gamings-oscars-game-awards">reports</a> alleging that Keighley has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23993630/game-awards-2023-developers-react-future-class">ignored Future Class concerns</a> and that resources from the program have been materially lacking.</p><p>In 2023, the Future Class wrote an open letter to The Game Awards and Keighley demanding recognition of the war in Gaza. This wasn’t without precedent. In 2022, the awards show acknowledged the war in Ukraine. But Keighley didn’t respond to the letter, nor has he mentioned the Future Class that much either. The Game Awards hasn’t named a Future Class in the last two years and won’t be naming anymore according to Future Class organizer Emily Weir. “At this time, we are not planning a new Future Class for this year and do not have any active programming plans for Future Class,” she said <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-game-awards-confirms-its-future-class-program-will-remain-on-ice">in a statement to <em>Game Developer.</em></a></p><p>Like a lot of diversity and inclusion-minded programs, Future Class got started in the wake of George Floyd’s murder in 2020. But as diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) have become publicly verboten in the rise of the Trump Administration and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/18/24104799/gamergate-2024-sweet-baby-inc-diversity">the online right</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24340846/meta-disbands-diversity-dei-team-charged">many</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/google/607012/google-dei-hiring-goals-internal-memo">companies</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/838079/microsoft-diversity-and-inclusion-changes-notepad">including game publishers</a>, have diminished or jettisoned their DEI programs. While there has been no explicitly stated reason for the seeming shut down of the Future Class, it seems like The Game Awards is just doing what it always does — whatever’s popular at the time.</p><p>For as much as The Game Awards has lost the veneer of respectability among some of the people whose work it’s meant to celebrate, rest assured, it ain’t going anywhere. The Game Awards broadcast nets millions of viewers <a href="https://thegameawards.com/news/tga-shatters-viewership-records-154-million-livestreams">with a record-breaking 154 million livestreams in 2024</a>. That’s a lot of eyeballs that <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-summer-games-fest-trailers-can-cost-devs-up-to-550k">developers pay a lot of money to get in front of</a>. And even for those who don’t buy airtime, having your game featured at all during the presentation can net a big boost in sales. After <em>Balatro</em> was nominated for and won multiple awards last year including best debut indie, its publisher PlayStack <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-awards-tga/486246/balatro-mobile-sales-game-awards-2024/">shouted out the awards specifically</a> for contributing to a huge increase in players.</p><p>More generally, the awards also provide a nice focal point for the disparate online gaming communities to gather around… and bitch about. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23998271/e3-gaming-convention-canceled-death">E3 is long gone</a>, and the other big events (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/689708/summer-game-fests-best-games-were-small-and-personal">not also run by Keighley</a>) are the publisher-specific direct livestreams. With everything so fractured now, yelling with your friends or colleagues about how <em>Hades</em> was robbed for game of the year (an event I will <em>never</em> get over) is fun and something TGAs are singularly suited to provide. It is not <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/17/24075044/dice-awards-video-game-developers-awards">the Oscars of gaming</a> — DICE, the BAFTAs, and the International Game Development Awards (IGDA) pretty well take care of that. But if you want popularity, production values, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/13/23507234/flute-guy-pedro-eustache-interview-the-game-awards">Flute Guy</a>, there’s nothing like The Game Awards — even though some of the shine is starting to wear off.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/841710/the-game-awards-2025-preview-geoff-keighley]]></content:encoded>
