He spent six years spearheading buying guides and consumer tech coverage at Digital Trends.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Last month, <em>Fortnite Festival</em>, the game’s <em>Rock Band</em>-like music mode, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24340770/fortnite-festival-local-multiplayer">rolled out local multiplayer</a> on PlayStation and Xbox. It’s a great addition if you and up to three buddies want to relive the halcyon days of ‘07 on a single TV, particularly if you’re using a nostalgia-inducing peripheral like the <strong>PDP Riffmaster</strong> — which is now available from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/RIFFMASTER-Controller-PlayStation-Rechargeable-Officially-5/dp/B0CWN15TRF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmAMlEcH9iA" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.turtlebeach.com%2Fproducts%2Friffmaster-wireless-guitar-controller" rel="sponsored">PDP</a> for an all-time low of $109.99 ($20 off).</p><p>Much like the old guitars developed for <em>Rock Band</em>, PDP’s wireless gamepad allows you to strum along with real songs in both <em>Rock Band 4</em> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/17/24041933/rock-band-4-dlc-songs-ending-fortnite-festival-harmonix">RIP</a>) and the free-to-play <em>Fortnite Festival</em>. It offers a lot of the same functionality as previous controllers, though, seeing as it’s been nearly a decade since Mad Catz’s last Stratocaster-style gamepad, the Riffmaster introduces a few modern tricks. That includes USB-C charging and a 3.5mm audio jack, along with a dedicated analog stick on the back of the neck for more straightforward navigation.</p><p>In true <em>RB4</em> fashion, the Riffmaster is also outfitted with five color-coded buttons higher up the neck and a second set lower down, each of which you can use to hammer out the various notes as they appear in their respective lanes. A strummer and a whammy bar make good on the classic <em>Rock Band</em> experience, letting you unleash vibrato on the Xbox, PlayStation, or PC with the included USB dongle.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->130</span></p><div><p>The wireless PDP Riffmaster is an alternative to Harmonix’s official <em>Rock Band 4</em> guitar. The PlayStation-licensed rhythm controller works for PS4 and PS5 and is usable with other games — including <em>Fortnite Festival</em>. It offers a 36-hour rechargeable battery, built-in volume control, an analog stick, and a collapsible neck design.</p></div></div><div><p id="more-ways-to-save-this-weekend"><h2>More ways to save this weekend</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>If you’re looking for a cheap way to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/15/24344628/super-bowl-lix-tubi-stream-free-fox">stream Super Bowl LIX</a> next weekend, <strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23882154/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-soundbar-announced">Amazon’s latest Fire TV Stick 4K</a></strong> is on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-TV-Stick-4K-streaming-device/dp/B0CJM1GNFQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/3pjhhydqhnqut">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-2024%2F-%2FA-91651394" rel="sponsored">Target</a> for $29.99 ($20 off), nearly matching its second-best price to date. It’s not quite as capable as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BP9SNVH9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">step-up Max model</a> — blame its lack of Wi-Fi 6E support and 8GB of storage — but the 4K streamer still offers Wi-Fi 6 and broad HDR support for Dolby Vision, HDR10, and HDR10 Plus.</span></li><li><span>The PlayStation version of <strong><em>Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition</em></strong> is down to an all-time low of $39.99 ($35 off) at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/square-enix-final-fantasy/" rel="sponsored">Woot</a> through 12:59AM ET on February 29th. The excellent remaster pulls together the first six <em>Final Fantasy </em>titles with revamped pixel graphics and rearranged orchestral scores, as well as an array of gameplay tweaks and quality-of-life improvements. I, for one, welcome the ability to turn off random encounters, which remain the bane of ‘90s-era JRPGs (sorry, not sorry).</span></li><li><span><strong>Lenovo’s Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition</strong>, a thin-and-light Windows laptop with an Intel Core Ultra 7 256V processor and 16GB of RAM, is going for $899.99 ($500 off) at <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/5bnwoqulwsbbc">Best Buy</a> through the end of today, February 2nd. That’s a new low on the 15-inch machine, which, despite its bummer trackpad and other shortcomings, remains a solid rec thanks to good all-around performance, fantastic port selection, and bright 120Hz LCD display. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24283884/lenovo-yoga-slim-7i-aura-edition-laptop-intel-lunar-lake-review">Read our review</a>.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
