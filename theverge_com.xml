            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Forty years ago today, the Nintendo Entertainment System launched in North America, and to help celebrate the anniversary, <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/nes-40th-anniversary/">8BitDo has announced a new NES40 collection</a>. It features updated versions of three of 8BitDo’s existing products, including its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619229/8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-tmr-anti-drift-joysticks">Ultimate 2 wireless controller</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/31/23813761/8bitdo-retro-mechanical-keyboard-nintendo-famicom">Retro 87 Keyboard N Edition</a>, and <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/cube-speaker/">Retro Cube Speaker</a>.</p></div><p>The updates made to the <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-2-bluetooth-nes-40th/">N40 version of 8BitDo’s Ultimate 2 controller</a> are mostly cosmetic, but it now features a black-and-gray design with bright red buttons and a charging dock that matches the aesthetics of the NES console. The controller will also include four swappable joystick caps while its grips are printed with dates that correlate to launches of notable Nintendo and 8BitDo products.</p><p>Functionality is the same as the original version of the Ultimate 2, including the TMR joysticks, Hall effect triggers, a ring of color-changing LEDs around the base of each joystick, reprogrammable bumper buttons, an extra pair of buttons on the back, and compatibility with the Switch, Switch 2, and Windows devices. The 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller - N40 is available for preorder starting today for $79.99 and comes with 8BitDo’s Retro Receiver for wirelessly connecting it to an original NES, and a 2.4GHz adapter providing a faster wireless connection for gaming. It will be released on November 15th, 2025, but will be limited to only 1,985 units.</p><p>For the new <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-68-keyboard-nes-40th/">8BitDo Retro 68 Keyboard N40</a>, the updates are the opposite. Despite being a little more compact than 8BitDo’s first mechanical keyboard because it features a 68-key layout instead of 87, the new N40 version looks very similar to the original but includes some significant hardware upgrades. The entire keyboard, including the shell, keycaps, and buttons, is made from aluminum alloy, and 8BitDo has switched from Kailh’s clicky Box White V2 switches to its linear Box Ice Cream Pro Max switches. The Retro 68 also includes a much larger 6,500mAh battery boosting usage to up to 300 hours between charges, and it comes with the original’s oversized programmable Super Buttons accessories that now wirelessly connect to the keyboard instead of being tethered by a 3.5mm cable.</p><p>The Retro 68 N40 keyboard is more than twice as heavy as the original, weighing in at a beefy 2,200 grams, and considerably more expensive. The Retro 87 debuted at $99.99 in 2023, but the new Retro 68 will be available for preorder starting today for $499.99 and is expected to ship sometime in January 2026.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-cube-2-speaker/">8BitDo Retro Cube 2 Speaker N Edition</a> also looks nearly identical to 8BitDo’s Retro Cube Speaker that has been NES-themed since it first launched in 2016. But the new version introduces dual stereo speakers with music and gaming modes, a built-in microphone, a larger 2,000mAh battery offering up to 30 hours of playtime on a full charge, and the option to switch to a 2.4GHz connection instead of Bluetooth using a bundled dongle. Its USB port has been upgraded from Micro USB to USB-C, but the speaker can be charged by simply placing it on a new wireless dock that’s included.</p><p>The original version launched nearly a decade ago for $35, while the new Retro Cube 2 speaker is available for preorder starting today for $49.99 and is expected to be released on December 8th, 2025.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/801832/8bitdo-nintendo-nes-ultimate-2-controller-retro-keyboard-bluetooth-cube-speaker]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/802089/pokemon-legends-z-a-shiny-hunting</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-makes-a-big-welcome-change-for-shiny-hunters.1328548/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> hadn’t been out even a few hours before the tweets started rolling in: <a href="https://x.com/SBCoop89/status/1978582662752178301">Shiny pokémon <em>don’t despawn</em></a>. You can walk away from a shiny, and it’ll still be there when you come back.</p><p>To shiny collectors, this is <em>big</em> news. In other <em>Pokémon </em>games, like <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>, pokémon despawn after you get a certain distance away from them or trigger a loading screen. I’ve missed out on my fair share of shiny pokémon this way, my heart sinking as I spotted them right before they disappeared forever.</p><p>You can still miss out on shiny pokémon in <em>Z-A</em>, but we’ll get to that in a bit.</p><p>I first discovered the new spawning mechanics myself. I heard the sparkly sound effect that signals a shiny, spotted an oddly colored Swirlix on top of a roof, and realized I had no way to get up to that roof without walking very far away. Not knowing any better, I figured I was just out of luck. (This Swirlix had a one in 4,096 chance of being shiny, so I guess I had <em>some</em> luck.)</p><p>I did try to get up to the roof, but night was about to change to day — which triggers a mini cutscene that I was sure would despawn the Swirlix — and I was in a hurry. I tried to take a shortcut through the adjacent Battle Zone. It was full of trainers ready to challenge me on sight, though, and I ended up in a battle immediately. I hadn’t forfeited one of these battles before, so I tried that, thinking maybe I’d get out of the battle and up a ladder in time to catch the shiny Swirlix… and ended up magically transported to a faraway Pokémon Center. If the night-to-day change wasn’t enough to despawn the Swirlix, I thought, surely that would do it.</p><p>A bit later, I was on some rooftops heading to an objective when I heard the shiny sound effect again. I realized it was the same Swirlix, an Alpha, still there and still shiny. I immediately messaged my colleague Charles Pulliam-Moore, who <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/798848/pokemon-legends-za-review-nintendo-switch-2">reviewed <em>Z-A</em> for <em>The Verge</em></a>, half in disbelief. I thought at first it was only because the Swirlix was an Alpha, since certain Alphas always spawn in the same locations. But after launch, players and <a href="https://www.serebii.net/legendsz-a/shinypokemon.shtml">other websites</a> quickly reported that persistent shiny spawns apply to <em>all</em> shinies.</p><p>There are some exceptions, though. Charles and I were chatting about this new spawning mechanic, and he sent me a clip of a shiny Patrat he’d encountered — and which he’d barely spotted before it ran away from his character and disappeared into the ether. Patrat is one of a handful of very skittish pokémon that will flee when you get too close, and the process of fleeing <em>does</em> despawn the pokémon in question, even if it’s shiny.</p><p>That also applies to any shiny pokémon you’ve defeated in battle but failed to catch, which isn’t great news for pokémon with lower catch rates. For those, you’ll have to rely on saving — and you can’t disable autosave in <em>Z-A</em>, unlike in other recent <em>Pokémon </em>games. That sounds bad, but I’ve found that the autosave doesn’t trigger too frequently as long as you don’t fast-travel to a new location or catch a pokémon. It should still be possible to save right before battling a shiny and reload that save if you knock it out.</p><p>Fleeing pokémon aside, the new shiny spawning mechanics are great for a game so heavy on roundabout, vertical, on-foot exploration. The shinies <em>have</em> to stay in one place because reaching a pokémon in order to catch it isn’t always as simple as walking over to it. Sometimes you have to run around looking for a ladder, or get past a lot of other people who want to fight you, or run away from a wild pokémon that’s about to knock you out. It’s a relief knowing that <em>most</em> shiny pokémon will be waiting for you to reach them on your own terms.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjY1MTI2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Kallie Plagge</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/802089/pokemon-legends-z-a-shiny-hunting]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Easy Delivery Co. is a cozy, Lynchian dream]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/800733/easy-delivery-co-review-steam</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/easy-delivery-co-is-a-cozy-lynchian-dream.1328512/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I have been a fan of David Lynch ever since a friend’s older brother interrupted a 13th birthday celebration to insist we all watch <em>Eraserhead</em>. In the realm of horror movies, it’s a common way to be introduced to a seminal film: be it in a friend’s basement, illicit underage viewings, or a stray recommendation from a pot-smoking sibling. It feels apt, then, that my first introduction to <em>Easy Delivery Co.</em> was a friend insisting I drop everything because a game exists that lets you play as a cat driving a kei truck.</p><p>I admit, those two things don’t immediately correlate. But it’s clear that Lynch, particularly <em>Twin Peaks</em>, was a major influence for developer Sam Cameron, in what the Steam description explains is “a relaxing driving game, with <em>definitely </em>no secrets.”</p><p><em>Easy Delivery Co. </em>starts you off gently. You are a nameless black cat, rendered in the style of <em>Animal Crossing </em>on the GameCube, working as a delivery driver in a sleepy mountain community. Day and night, you shuttle supplies between shops and businesses snowed in by a perpetual blizzard. Like most real-world delivery drivers, resting is discouraged. Instead, you neck energy drinks and coffee to keep at bay the biting cold that threatens to overcome you the moment you set foot outside the adorably small cabin of your kei truck.</p><p>That cold will likely be your first sign that all is not what it seems. Succumbing to the blizzard as you shuffle to a vending machine or take too long shutting your truck’s tailgate briefly transports you to a dark and ostensibly endless maze, before you wake to resume your deliveries. Yet, as your world expands to other towns, you’ll also find that, curiously, all the shopkeepers remain the same. Then there’s MK, the only character you’ll meet outside — and the only dog in town — who leads you away from the repeating web of deliveries to set you on the path to unraveling the mountain’s mysteries.</p><p><em>Easy Delivery Co. </em>is not a complex game. You drive, pick stuff up, and spend your earnings on the means to do more of that. This low-poly mix of <em>Lake </em>and <em>Silent Hill</em> makes for an interesting concept, even if, like many indie games that hit upon an intriguing hook, the story is a little clumsy — especially as the game shifts from a meandering string of ostensibly unrelated tasks toward its narrative climax.</p><p>There are rough edges, too. Among a few minor bugs I encountered, dropping cargo — which you’ll do often on these icy roads — can sometimes leave you unable to retrieve it even though it’s right in front of you. Those rough edges, however, are not terminal. That specific bug is easily remedied by aborting the job and picking another, as <em>Easy Delivery Co. </em>is pleasingly forgiving, levying few penalties for leaving a job or having a rough drive.</p><p>Driving, the thing you’ll do the most in this game, is relaxing without being passive, a hard balance to strike. Setting <em>Easy Delivery Co. </em>in a snowy tangle of mountain roads, delivering a variety of items that impact how your truck handles, is a smart turn. You can zone out somewhat, but not completely, as you have to adjust for the conditions and loads. This is something you’ll become accustomed to after you careen off the road and roll down the mountain a few times — something I did a little more often for playing with the perfectly manageable keyboard controls, rather than a controller. None of that is frustrating. In fact, more than once a mistake led to an accidental shortcut, achieved mostly by somehow surviving a lengthy cartwheel down an incline with my cargo intact.</p><p>If I have one glaring issue with <em>Easy Delivery Co.</em>, it’s the balance between direction and freedom. Many mechanics in-game are found in readable tutorials but also able to be puzzled out. For instance, I appreciated being able to ignore guidance and work out how to make coffee myself or that my lighter will let me stay out in the cold for longer. Being ushered through the game’s main quest by MK, I found myself — oddly for someone usually allergic to obfuscation — wishing there was more of the central mystery to discover independently, more secrets beyond the odd collectible to solve myself. Though that, I think, comes from a desire to spend more time in <em>Easy Delivery Co.</em>’s eerier side<em>.</em> Either that or I’m just a cat person.</p><p>It’s a sign of how versatile <em>Easy Delivery Co.</em> can be, however. You can, if you’re inclined, race through the game’s main story with minimal deliveries in the space of a few hours. You can also completely ignore it — and MK — and stay frozen in a sequence of deliveries, basking in the low-poly, nostalgic environment and listening to catchy jingles through the radio.</p><p>My favorite way to play was to make <em>Easy Delivery Co. </em>small in the corner of my screen, where it remained perfectly visible and playable, while watching YouTube or TV… which may have contributed to how much time I spent off-road. I might be biased, if only because <em>Easy Delivery Co. </em>feels like it’s been developed from a Venn diagram of my specific interests (especially adorably proportioned motor vehicles). But one of my gaming holy grails is something I can play and enjoy while watching something else to pass tired hours — in <em>Easy Delivery Co. </em>I’ve finally found that.</p><div><p><sub>Easy Delivery Co. <em>is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3293010%2FEasy_Delivery_Co%2F" rel="sponsored">available now on Steam</a>.</em></sub></p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTgxMTk="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Geoffrey Bunting</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/800733/easy-delivery-co-review-steam]]></content:encoded>
