Like other games in the genre, <em>Digimon Alysion </em>will allow players to build and play with decks depicting characters from different parts of the franchise. But in addition to card battles, <em>Alysion </em>will also seemingly feature an in-depth story mode, and give you the ability to raise Tamagotchi-like virtual pets.</p><p>A teaser trailer for the game introduces human protagonist Kanata Hondo, her in-game currency-inspired Digimon partner Gemmon, as well as a variety of other Digimon from the franchise’s past. Bandai Namco have yet to share a release window for <em>Alysion</em>, but a closed beta is supposed to be launching in the coming months.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
