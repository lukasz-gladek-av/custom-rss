            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313191/nothing-community-widgets-snake-game-nokia<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nothing has released a new Android app called <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.nothing.communitywidgets">Nothing Community Widgets</a> that will highlight home screen tools and games co-created by its users. The first widget it includes is a recreation of <em>Snake </em>which was the most memorable of the three games pre-installed on the Nokia 6110 when it launched 26 years ago.</p><p>Although the original game was played by pressing buttons as cellphones lacked touchscreens, the snake in Nothing’s version is steered using directional screen swipes, while a double tap pauses the action, <a href="https://retrododo.com/nothing-adds-retro-snake-game-to-their-smartphones-widgets/">according to <em>Retro Dodo</em></a>. But the gameplay is the same, with players scoring points by eating red dots while trying to avoid colliding with themselves as the snake grows longer and longer.</p><div><p>The inspiration for the new widget came from <a href="https://bento.me/rahuljanardhanan">Rahul Janardhanan</a>, an artist who earlier this year <a href="https://x.com/raonehere/status/1749069277960057048">designed and shared a collection of 10 concepts</a> for potential Nothing OS widgets. Janardhanan’s work <a href="https://nothing.community/d/20998-community-widgets-snake-game">caught the eye of the company</a> and Nothing’s software team worked with a community developer to create the widget.</p></div><p>The new <em>Snake</em> game widget, and Nothing’s new widgets app, follow a similar initiative by Nothing to work with its community of users. In October, the company announced its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24282844/nothing-phone-2a-plus-community-edition-glowing">Nothing Phone 2A Plus Community Edition</a> featuring an updated glow-in-the-dark design, new wallpapers, and even packaging that was created by the company’s “most talented followers.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

EA will be releasing a free, standalone version of the character creator for all platforms the game is available on (PS5, Xbox Series X / S, and PC), and you’ll be able to bring the character you make in the free creator over to the full game if you decide to buy it.</p><p>If you have any interest at all in <em>The Veilguard</em>, I really recommend checking out the free character creator when it’s available and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24176102/dragon-age-the-veilguard-preview-summer-game-fest-bioware">seeing all of the options</a>. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294829/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hair-technology-frostbite-bioware">Hair looks particularly good</a>.) And if you end up making a character, transfer them to the game, and want to make some tweaks, you’ll be able to do so early on in your adventure, so don’t sweat your decisions too much.</p><p>EA is also releasing <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-4-release-notes">a fourth patch for the game</a>, which adds a mission that will reward you with in-game items themed around the <em>Dragon Age II</em> protagonist, Hawke. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
