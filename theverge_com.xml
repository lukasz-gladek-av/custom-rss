The open-world racing game is launching on PS5 this spring and will include the same content as what’s available in its Xbox and PC versions, <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-5-comes-to-ps5">according to a blog post</a>. If you want to play the game online with your friends, crossplay between PS5, Xbox consoles, and PC will be available.</p><p><em>Forza Horizon 5</em> will also be getting a new content update on all platforms called Horizon Realms. “Realms will give players the chance to explore a curated collection of some of the community’s favorite previously released Evolving Worlds, alongside some other surprises,” developer Playground Games said in the post.</p><p>The game originally launched on Xbox and PC <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769985/forza-horizon-5-review">in 2021</a>, and my former colleague Sam Byford called it the “best Forza Horizon yet.” I also had a great time <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22762183/forza-horizon-5-perfect-portable-xbox-game-series-x-s-pc-steam">playing it as a portable game</a>, meaning it could be a lot of fun on a PlayStation Portal.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The library, which is launching in early access, includes things like “more than 1,500 full-text searchable out-of-print video game magazines, never-before-seen game development assets, artwork, promotional materials, and more gaming relics,” according to a press release.</p><div><p>In a blog post, the VGHF highlights things like documents <a href="https://library.gamehistory.org/repositories/2/resources/84">from retired video game producer Mark Flitman</a>, production materials <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/folder/22cf9aa2-812b-4f39-b42e-e87a3c153b8c">from <em>Myst</em> developers Cyan</a>, digitized CDs <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/folder/a5823d80-320b-41c9-9e3c-4dc28f79f2a2">of press assets received by <em>GamePro</em></a>, and a collection of <a href="https://gamehistory.org/vghf-library-launch/">FromSoftware promotional materials</a>. (Note that some of the links may not work; as I’ve been writing this story, the links have occasionally been broken.)</p></div><p>Library director Phil Salvador says <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tysm_Wf60Q">in a video</a> that this is just the “first wave of open access content” in the library and that VGHF will keep building the library “over the coming years.” I’d recommend watching this video to get an overview of the work involved to make things available; the details about scanning old video game magazines were particularly cool. </p><p>I really look forward to seeing what people discover from the library, but it will be hard to top my colleague Tristan Cooper’s great discovery of GamePro history <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tristanacooper.bsky.social/post/3lgxwnrcjas2s">regarding <em>Garfield</em></a>.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
