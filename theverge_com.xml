            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/638535/physical-digital-video-games-nintendo-xbox-ps5-disc-cart<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One of Sony’s best-ever PlayStation ads is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWSIFh8ICaA">a 21-second video</a> titled, “Official PlayStation Used Game Instructional Video.” It’s a “step-by-step” guide about how to lend your PS4 games to your friends. It has one step: one person hands another person a game box.</p><p>The ad succinctly clowns on Microsoft’s original and convoluted game sharing policy for the Xbox One, which let users ditch discs in exchange for daily DRM checks. The idea was so hated that Microsoft <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jun/19/xbox-one-drm-second-hand-restrictions-abandoned">walked it back</a> just over a week after the release of Sony’s ad and months before the console came out. The lesson was simple — don’t mess with people’s discs.</p><p>But more than a decade later, it’s not hard to imagine a future where Sony’s own ad doesn’t apply anymore. </p><p>Physical game sales in 2024 were less than half what they were as recently as 2021, and the market has been in decline since 2008, Circana analyst Mat Piscatella tells <em>The Verge</em>. “There has been a long trend of declining sales in physical games,” Piscatella says. “And now there’s declining distribution with retailers pulling back space, with companies making fewer physical games overall, and with the entire shift towards digital distribution.”</p><p>The writing has been on the wall since 2020, when Microsoft and Sony introduced their (at the time) next-generation Xbox and PlayStation consoles with versions that didn’t have a place to put your discs. Ultimately, they were responding to the emerging trend of people buying fewer physical games for consoles. Can you even remember the last time you bought a physical game for PC?</p><p>The primary reason for the shift to digital is because of connectivity: about 99 percent of consoles are connected to the internet, Piscatella says. (Players weren’t quite as online <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/insights/2015/game-consoles-in-2015-one-stop-shop-for-games-and-entertainment/">a decade ago</a>.) And once people got used to digital, “more and more often people would choose convenience over the practical positives of physical.”</p><p>Just look at this graph from Piscatella showing plummeting physical sales. The outlook is grim.</p><p>Microsoft hasn’t been particularly secretive about its interest in a heavily digital future. The latest Xbox generation launched with the all-digital Series S, and it added an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24174793/microsoft-xbox-series-x-white-digital-edition">all-digital Series X option</a> last year. Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296420/microsoft-this-is-an-xbox-marketing-campaign-xbox-everywhere">“This is an Xbox” campaign</a> positions basically every device with a screen as a potential console. The company’s Xbox Game Pass subscription is essentially a rental service for digital titles. And physical editions of <em>Avowed</em>, one of Microsoft’s biggest Xbox games of the year, only have <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-avowed-xbox-pc-premium-edition">a code for the game</a> in the box.</p><p>Of course, Microsoft is best known as a software company, so perhaps it’s not too surprising that it might want to bank its video game future entirely on digital games. And while I still think it will be a shame if the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24264129/halo-unreal-engine-5-halo-studios-announcement">next <em>Halo</em></a> isn’t available on a disc, it doesn’t seem unreasonable to expect that Xbox could drop discs entirely by the end of the decade.</p><p>Sony will probably take a little bit longer to make the all-digital jump. The company is certainly signaling it wants to move in that direction, perhaps most strongly by shipping the premium $699 PS5 Pro <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24241265/sony-ps5-pro-game-console-disc-drive-end">without a disc drive</a>. But it continues to sell drives separately for the Pro and for the slim PS5. And the company would simply face pushback on a different scale than Microsoft: there are far more PS4s and PS5s out there than Xboxes, and that means a lot more people who have bought a lot more physical games who may want ways to play them for the foreseeable future. </p><p>Piscatella also points out that some major mass-market games like <em>EA Sports College Football</em> and <em>Call of Duty</em> have a “pretty big physical presence” that console makers may not want to jeopardize.</p><p>Nintendo is where we see the argument for physical games — though maybe not <em>discs</em> — sticking around. The just-announced Switch 2 has a cartridge slot and is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343666/nintendo-switch-2-cartridge-backwards-compatibility">backward-compatible with Switch 1 games</a>. The console’s first generation lasted from 2017 until sometime this year, so if the Switch 2’s lifecycle also lasts eight years, physical media will be relevant for Nintendo well into the 2030s.</p><p>The company may have reason to stick with cartridges for even longer. Piscatella says that Nintendo platforms are still “heavier physical” than other platforms because its audience, especially families, expects the format; it’s a lot easier for kids in a family to share a game when they can just pass the cart to each other, as Sony adeptly showed in its ad. That advantage won’t last forever, though. Just last week, Nintendo announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637307/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-card-lending-system">a “virtual game card” lending system</a> that lets family members share digital games.</p><div><p>“Consumers on PlayStation and Xbox are speaking with their dollars”</p></div><p>It’s yet another sign that physical media is waning, even in its strongholds. “At this point, the consumers on PlayStation and Xbox are speaking with their dollars that digital-first is a fine way to go,” Piscatella says.</p><p>Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox did not respond to requests for comment on their future plans for physical media.</p><p>While physical media sales are on the decline, New York University games professor Joost van Dreunen points out that the sales of physical video game accessories have been “skyrocketing.” The PC <em>games </em>market may be mostly digital on Steam, but sales of things like custom controllers, screens, chairs, and headphones are a “huge category,” he says.</p><p>He believes that accessories and what he calls “the personalization of the physical experience of games and interactivity” will grow, which we can see manifested all the way to theme parks. (van Dreunen points out that Nintendo is particularly good at this: think <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/16/8050027/nintendo-amiibo-sales-charts">Amiibo</a>, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">Alarmo clock</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan">theme parks</a> filled with Nintendo goodies.)</p><p>Both van Dreunen and Piscatella ultimately made the comparison of video games to vinyl records, which is “kind of like on the extreme niche, but doing ok,” Piscatella says. There’s a key difference between vinyl and video games, of course — with a vinyl record, you can play it on a turntable, but a physical cart of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> can only slot into a Nintendo Switch. It’s more about the enthusiast crowd focusing on physical media.</p><p>Maybe that will be enough to keep physical formats around into the future. But the next time Sony makes a guide on how to share PlayStation games, I doubt it will be a crisp 21 seconds.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/638542/nintendo-switch-2-specs-details-relevance<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">official unveiling of the Switch 2</a> was an incredibly confident moment for Nintendo. It was brief and lacking almost entirely in details. There was no price, no release date, and no confirmed games outside of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24337198/switch-2-mario-kart-nintendo">a <em>Mario Kart</em> tease</a>. The 2 in the name implied a bigger and better Switch, but when it came to the how — the chips that will power the device, the screen that will make Zelda and Mario look great — Nintendo deemed it wasn’t important enough to share right away.</p><p>And it’s right: unlike the rest of the industry, Nintendo has carved out a path where specs no longer matter.</p><p>It wasn’t always this way. Previous Nintendo consoles were sold, as their contemporaries were, on horsepower. The Super Nintendo was a more-powerful NES, while the N64’s processor was deemed so important that the system was named after it. But things started to change around the time of the GameCube. Nintendo had experienced a steady decline in console sales over subsequent generations; while the NES and Famicom sold more than 60 million units, that was down to just over 20 million for the GameCube. At the same time, Nintendo’s direct competition had changed significantly. After getting a taste of going up against Sony during the N64 era, Nintendo was now up against a second tech behemoth in Microsoft. Competing on technological prowess no longer made much sense.</p><p>Something had to change — and that change came in the form of the Wii.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Britta Pedersen / picture alliance via Getty Images</cite></p></div><p>Once infamously described as “<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gdc-the-wii-is-a-piece-of-sht-says-hecker">two GameCubes and some duct tape</a>,” the Wii wasn’t a major advancement over its predecessor in terms of how games looked or ran. While the Xbox 360 touted blockbusters like <em>Halo 3</em>, and the PS3 was showing off next-gen visuals through <em>Resistance</em> and <em>MotorStorm</em>, the Wii was defined by <em>Wii Sports</em>, in which characters looked like eggs and didn’t even have arms. And yet, the game, which was bundled with the console everywhere but Japan, went on to become one of the best-selling games of all time because of how it played, rather than how it looked.</p><p>This shift came because of what Nintendo called its “blue ocean” strategy. The idea was that the increasing technological complexity of games was actually making them <em>less</em> appealing to many consumers. We’d come a long way from the simplicity of making Mario run and jump in the original <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. Just looking at a GameCube controller could be overwhelming for many. As former Nintendo of America president Reggile Fils-Aime <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090806203242/http://news.cnet.com/Nintendo-on-the-latest-technical-divide/2010-1041_3-6180215.html">wrote in 2007</a>, “While ardent players reliably responded to ever-advancing technology and complexity, those same attributes consistently chipped off potential new players from the total market, narrowing the consumers into a smaller niche.”</p><p>This meant the best path forward for Nintendo was to get out of the technological arms race and find a way to broaden the market. For the Wii, that was a console with specs that were mostly good enough to run modern 3D games, but where the focus was on its motion-sensitive controller that made games more intuitive to play, like with <em>Wii Sports</em>. This was followed by the Nintendo DS, a handheld that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24242128/nintendo-ds-touchscreen-games-2004-launch">introduced touchscreen controls before smartphones were ubiquitous</a>. Both were massive hits: the Wii sold more than 100 million units, while the DS topped 150 million. And both proved that specs are a minor concern — if they’re a concern at all — to most consumers, as they surpassed more powerful competitors in terms of sales. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24121232/sony-playstation-vita-steam-deck-switch">Sorry, Vita</a>.)</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Kiyoshi Ota / Bloomberg via Getty Images</cite></p></div><p>Finding the right direction for a console isn’t always easy, as evidenced by the Wii U, which was a failed early attempt to merge the worlds of home consoles and portable gaming. But by shifting away from specs and graphics to focus on player experience, Nintendo has not only carved out a space for itself, but it is arguably as successful as it has ever been at a time when the video game industry is struggling on many fronts.</p><p>The Switch is a pure expression of this philosophy. It’s an underpowered tablet that doubles as a home console, and despite going up against beefy PlayStations, Xboxes, and a burgeoning field of portable PCs, it’s on track to become <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/605948/nintendo-switch-lifetime-sales-nintendo-ds">Nintendo’s best-selling piece of hardware ever</a> (and it might even surpass the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24307463/a-big-milestone">record set by the PS2</a>). Its modest technical chops are overshadowed by a straightforward premise — you can take games with you anywhere — while also allowing Nintendo to develop lots of games in a more sustainable way than its competitors, who are struggling with the massive increasing costs of live service and blockbuster games.</p><p>That’s why Nintendo didn’t utter a single spec when revealing the Switch 2 — because they’re not the point. Whatever powers the company’s next device has will be mostly good enough <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch">for the next open-world <em>Zelda</em></a>, but the specs don’t need to be detailed in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24167932/ps5-pro-sony-specs-announcement">lengthy video that uses words like upscaling and teraflops</a>. Those details are coming, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606504/nintendo-switch-2-direct-new-time">of course</a>, but they’re secondary to the core idea: this will be just like your old Switch, only better. You don’t need specs to get that across.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
