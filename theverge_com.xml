            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349524/ted-price-retiring-insomniac-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After three decades at the helm, Insomniac Games founder and president Ted Price has <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/ted-price-announces-retirement/">announced he’s retiring</a>. Price will officially step away at the end of March, and he’s being replaced by <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/22/whats-next-for-insomniac-games/">three new studio heads</a> who will take over Insomniac moving forward.</p><p>According to Price, the succession process has been in the works for a while. “I actually made this decision last year,” he explains. “For me, after over 30 years of leading Insomniac, I felt it was simply time to step aside and let others pave the way for our team.”</p><div><p>Insomniac was founded in 1994, and since then has gone on to create multiple hit games and franchises, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523093/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-review-ps5"><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em></a>, <em>Resistance</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/27/7073527/sunset-overdrive-review"><em>Sunset Overdrive</em></a>, and, more recently, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23915605/spider-man-2-review-ps5"><em>Spider-Man</em></a>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/19/20812656/sony-insomniac-games-acquisition-spider-man-ratchet-clank-developer-playstation">In 2019 the studio was acquired by PlayStation</a>, and it’s currently working on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665529/insomniac-wolverine-ps5">a Wolverine game</a>.</p></div><p>Taking over for Price will be Chad Dezern, Ryan Schneider, and Jen Huang. Dezern previously served as Insomniac’s creative lead, and has been with the studio nearly since its inception, while Schneider was the Head of Franchise Strategy and Studio Relations and joined the studio during the PS2 years. Huang, meanwhile, has been Insomniac’s CFO for the past eight years.</p><p>“I believe strongly that for us to continue our success, we need leaders at the top who are intimately familiar with how we do things, leaders who have helped build our culture and our processes, and who have earned people’s trust,” Price said of the new co-studio heads.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
