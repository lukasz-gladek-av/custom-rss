And given what studio co-founder Gabe Newell has to say on the subject in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4">2-hour documentary</a> that the company released in tandem with the update, it seems less likely than ever that we’ll be seeing either follow-up anytime soon.</p><p>Newell explains what he calls his “personal failure” near the end of the video (<a href="https://youtu.be/YCjNT9qGjh4?t=7078">at this timestamp</a>):</p><div><blockquote><p>You can’t get lazy and say, “oh, we’re moving the story forward.” That’s copping out of your obligatiion to gamers, right? Yes, of course they love the story. They love many, many aspects of it. But sort of saying that your reason to do it is because people want to know what happens next... you know, we could’ve shipped it, like, it wouldn’t have been that hard. You know, the failure was — my personal failure was being stumped. Like, I couldn’t figure out why doing Episode 3 was pushing anything forward.</p></blockquote></div><p>That’s not to say the company didn’t try<em>. </em>One idea for <em>Episode 3</em> included an “Ice Gun” that Engineer David Speyrer says in the documentary would’ve let players spray “amorphous shapes” that could serve as barriers, platforms, or even “Silver Surfer mode” paths that they would shoot in front of themselves to cross gaps. Speyrer also talks about “blob” enemies that could move through grates or split into smaller “head-crabby things.” </p><p>But Speyrer and other Valve employees featured in the video echo Newell’s sentiment that they just couldn’t come up with ideas that seemed worth a new <em>Half-Life</em> game. One of its level designers said something similar in a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-explains-why-half-life-2-episode-3-was-never-made">2020 <em>IGN</em> interview</a>. He also blamed “scope creep” — the tendency of a project to slowly grow beyond its original plan — and the company wanting to get going on developing the Source 2 engine that drives VR prequel <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21188291/half-life-alyx-review-valve-index-oculus-quest-vr-shooter"><em>Half-Life: Alyx</em></a>. </p><p>“Newell sees <em>Half-Life 2 </em>as an engine, a platform, or at best a whole industry unto itself,” gaming journalist Geoff Keighley, who Newell <a href="https://www.theringer.com/video-games/2022/12/8/23498936/geoff-keighley-the-game-awards-video-games-oscars">once gave a key card</a> for Valve’s studios and told to “do whatever you want,” <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-final-hours-of-half-life-2/1100-6112889/">wrote for <em>Gamespot</em></a><em> </em>in 2016.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24295956/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-review-pc-playstation-xbox-netflix-mobile<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em> was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23433741/the-case-of-the-golden-idol-review-pc">a rewarding series of point-and-click murder mysteries</a> that became one of my favorite games of 2022. And while I felt there was more story to explore about the titular golden idol, I wasn’t sure if a potential sequel could live up to its clever puzzles and fascinating, slowly unfolding story. Turns out, I had nothing to fear: <em>The Rise of the Golden Idol</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24267159/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-release-date-trailer">the newly launched sequel</a>, easily surpasses the original by improving on just about everything.</p><p>At its core, <em>Rise</em> is a very similar game to <em>Case</em>. The new game takes place in the 1970s, around 200 years after the events of the original, and each of <em>Rise</em>’s cases drops you into a specific moment in time, typically during or shortly after a murder. You’re tasked with solving what’s going on. To figure that out, you first have to click around the scene to discover relevant words and names that get saved in a menu. Then you use those words to solve puzzles within the case, like the names of the individuals in a scene, a description of how the murder happened, or even things like how to interpret parts of a dance or who won a game show.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>Here’s an example of how you use the words you find to solve elements of a case.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Playstack / Color Gray Games</cite></p></div><p>It’s a clever system. Clicking around to collect all of the words forces you to scrutinize everything that’s going on, and having to fill in the blanks means you really have to think about how elements of the scene might be connected. I’ve come to think of it like an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/27/24278619/wilmot-works-it-out-review">elaborate jigsaw puzzle</a>: while the scattered elements may seem like a lot to tie together, as you slowly solve the disparate elements of the puzzles within cases, it’s easier to figure out how they connect.</p><p>There are more layers, too, as you have to solve puzzles encompassing the events of entire chapters, which typically have three or four cases within them, to be able to move on to the next one. A few recurring characters will pop up across chapters, meaning the game is able to tell a holistic story by forcing you to understand their actions across a bunch of different scenes. (You don’t need to have played <em>Case</em> to understand the events of <em>Rise</em>, though there are a few tidbits that will be familiar to fans of the first game.)</p><p>The system isn’t perfect. Like with <em>Case</em>, if you’re off the mark after you’ve slotted in words for a specific puzzle, <em>Rise</em> will tell you if your guess is incorrect or if you have two or fewer words in the wrong place. Usually, knowing that I was close meant I could reexamine my assumptions and tweak a few words to get things right. But as I also did with <em>Case</em>, if I couldn’t figure out the two or fewer incorrect words on my own, I would just brute-force a bunch of guesses until I got things right.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Rise</em> has some tough puzzles, but so far, I’ve been able to solve all of them without turning to an online guide like I had to do with the final few cases of <em>Case</em>. <em>Rise</em> also has an improved hint system that offers up to three hints for a specific part of a case, and often, checking those pointed me in the right direction when I was stuck. I’d also recommend having pen and paper handy to write things down, especially because some cases scatter details across multiple areas. And if you can play with someone else, that helps, too — my wife saw a bunch of things that I completely missed.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Playstack / Color Gray Games</cite></p></div><p>I will warn you that the game can be grotesque. <em>Case</em> generally erred on the side of creepy with its old-school pixel art style, but <em>Rise</em> looks more like a painting, and that means you’ll be seeing slightly more realistic dead bodies. Scenes and characters move in short loops, which makes them feel alive but also means you’ll see certain uncomfortable movements over and over again. The first case opens with a man actively strangling somebody else; another shows a person getting electrocuted. If you have a fear of birds, there’s one case you’re really not going to like. But like a good scary movie, those twisted scenes are part of what makes the game compelling. Every time I started a new case, I was always eager to see what terrible things I’d come across.</p><p>I’m not quite done with <em>Rise.</em> After more than 15 hours, I’m on one of the last of the game’s 20 cases, and this one is taking me a couple of days to muddle through. I think the eventual thrill of figuring it all out will be worth the pain, though, as there’s nothing better than that lightbulb moment of slotting the final word into the right place of the puzzle. And even when I’m done with all 20 cases, there will be <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F2716400%2Fview%2F4478360632965464065">four DLC packs</a> to look forward to next year — perhaps there’s even more that we don’t know about the mysterious golden idol.</p><p><small>The Rise of the Golden Idol<em> is now available for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and on mobile with a Netflix subscription.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
