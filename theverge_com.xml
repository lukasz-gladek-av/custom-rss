The console is Analogue’s reimagined and upgraded version of the Nintendo 64 with 4K output and full compatibility with original N64 cartridges from every region, including both PAL and NTSC versions.</p><p>Exactly a year after the original announcement, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24265587/analogue-3d-nintendo-64-price-preorder-date">Analogue shared more details about the Analogue 3D</a> including the console’s design, which looks similar to the N64’s. As with the company’s other <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22831589/analogue-pocket-review">consoles like the Pocket</a>, the Analogue 3D uses <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323002/mister-fpga-project-retro-computer-console-early-pc">FPGA technology</a> to exactly replicate the functionality of Nintendo’s original hardware which has proven to be notoriously difficult to accurately emulate, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746897/nintendo-switch-online-n64-emulation-quality-bad">even for Nintendo</a>. It also has four N64 controller ports plus Bluetooth for those wanting to play wirelessly, and includes optional display modes that mimic the appearance of games played on older CRT TVs.</p><p>Preorders for the $249.99 Analogue 3D opened on October 21st, 2024 with shipping expected sometime in Q1 2025, but that was followed by a string of delays that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631816/analogue-3d-delay-nintendo-64-modretro-teaser">pushed the console’s release to July 2025</a>, and then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707586/analogue-3d-4k-n64-delay-august-2025">August 2025</a>, and then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762883/analogue-3d-delay-q4-2025">sometime in Q4 2025</a>.

However, Analogue has expanded production runs of its previous consoles, and has released several versions of the Analogue Pocket in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24236829/analogue-pocket-handheld-gaming-game-boy-color">different colors</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/12/24197135/analogue-pocket-aluminum">finishes</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/819903/analogue-3d-nintendo-64-console-ship-date-november-18]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/magic-the-gathering%E2%80%99s-future-looks-like-fortnite-and-fans-are-split.1352506/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Over the last five years, <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> games have gotten a bit strange. Cards featuring characters from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/690509/how-to-play-final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-set"><em>Final Fantasy</em></a>, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/tabletop-gaming/magic-the-gatherings-spider-man-set-is-only-just-fine-which-isnt-good-enough/">Spider-Man</a>, and, in a few weeks, <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> are starting to show up with increasing frequency, making a typical Friday Night <em>Magic</em> game look more like a match in <em>Fortnite</em>. For some, this is a welcome change, allowing <em>Magic </em>to entice newcomers and invigorate existing players with properties they know and love. But others feel this focus on licensed sets comes at the expense of <em>Magic</em>’s identity, quality, and longevity.</p><p>Depending on who you talk to, <em>Magic</em> crossover sets have been around since the early days of the game with the Arabian Nights set released in 1994. But the modern idea started in 2020 with <em>Magic</em>’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/25/magic-the-gathering-reveals-new-secret-lair-drop-series-with-wild-art">Secret Lair</a> product. Originally, Secret Lair products weren’t full sets, or even original cards. Existing <em>Magic</em> cards were revamped with new art from popular artists or IPs and sold at a premium as collector’s items. However, with <em>The Walking Dead</em> Secret Lair, <em>Magic</em> publisher Wizards of the Coast decided to create totally new cards set within Robert Kirkman’s zombie universe — and it blew up.</p><p>“From Wizards’ side, it was a slam dunk,” said <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shivambhatt.bsky.social">Shivam Bhatt</a>, an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@casualmagicwithshivambhatt"><em>MTG</em> content creator</a> and former <em>MTG</em> consultant who’s been a player for most of the game’s 30-year history. “Make six cards, sell a gillion of them, and you get a chance of getting people to come into the game.”</p><p>From there, <em>Magic </em>expanded on that formula, going from six-card Secret Lair drops to developing whole decks for the game’s Commander format. To set this new family of cards apart from cards set within <em>Magic</em>’s own storytelling universe, Wizards of the Coast called these crossovers <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/magics-voyages-universes-beyond-2021-02-25">Universes Beyond</a>, or UB. These experiments sold so well that <em>Magic</em> decided to expand again into full sets, starting with <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, which, at the time, became <em>Magic</em>’s best-selling set ever. It was official: UB was a hit, which was a good thing for Wizards’ parent company, Hasbro.</p><p>“Ultimately, the reason Universes Beyond exists is because Hasbro is a dying company,” said <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/content/author/Emma-Partlow?srsltid=AfmBOorhzPSruQd-Yq23nG7zXmKUkofHXwwTJwJ54XwkR_jDRhqjkXLv">Emma Partlow,</a> <em>MTG</em> content editor at TCGPlayer, one of the biggest resources and retailers for collectible card games. “But if you put Wizards of the Coast in that they’re just breaking records every quarter, they’re one of the only things keeping Hasbro afloat.” (Hasbro’s <em>Monopoly GO!</em>, frequently at the top of most-downloaded mobile games lists, <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-reports-second-quarter-2025-financial-results">is the other</a>.)</p><p>These successes led to WotC going all in on Universes Beyond, so much that it’s starting to cause concern among <em>Magic</em>’s core player base. <em>Magic</em> is a heavily stratified game with different formats in which different sets of cards are legal to use. These different sets were arranged on two different release tracks: standard and supplemental. On the standard track are all the sets that are legal in the Standard format — the main competitive format of <em>Magic</em> — and form the core of <em>MTG</em>’s yearly release schedule. The supplemental tracks are the sets that are for different formats, like Commander and Modern.</p><p>Up until this point, Universes Beyond has largely been kept on the supplemental track, and in 2021, Wizards of the Coast said that’s where it’ll stay. “Universes Beyond cards will not be Standard legal,” <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/magics-voyages-universes-beyond-2021-02-25">read a blog explaining Universes Beyond</a>. “This is purely a cool thing we’re doing in addition to all the other cool things we’re already doing.”</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The </em>Final Fantasy MTG<em> set was the best-selling set in the game’s 30-year history.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>But that calculus changed in 2025 when the first Universes Beyond sets were permanently brought onto the standard track. <em>MTG</em>’s vice president of design, Aaron Forsythe, <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/aligning-the-universes-making-all-our-sets-legal-in-all-our-formats">explained</a> that the change was essentially to give the players outside the Standard format a new place to play their cards, but it seems to be coming at the expense of existing Standard players.</p><p>“The number one problem with Universes Beyond is that [Wizards] decided to put them in the core competitive formats so they’re no longer an opt-in product,” said writer, games journalist, and <em>Magic </em>enthusiast <a href="https://aidanmoher.com/">Aidan Moher</a>. “You can no longer ignore it.”</p><p>In 2025, the split between in-universe sets and UB sets was even at three apiece. Next year will feature a Ninja Turtles set, a Marvel superheroes set, <em>The Hobbit</em>, and <em>Star Trek</em>. For the first time, UB sets will outnumber the in-universe ones, which could be alienating to players who enjoy <em>Magic</em> for its own distinct storytelling universe. “I think a lot of people are feeling threatened in their space just because here’s all this advertisement seeping into <em>Magic</em>,” Partlow said.</p><div><p>“I think a lot of people are feeling threatened in their space”</p></div><p>There’s also a concern with these sets’ quality and price. While <em>Final Fantasy</em> was <a href="https://articles.starcitygames.com/magic-the-gathering/mtg-final-fantasy-already-the-best-selling-set-of-all-time/">a runaway success</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/mtg-magic-the-gathering-spider-man-survey-wizards/">the next UB set, Spider-Man, was not</a>. Like many games, <em>Magic</em> sets take years to design and develop. Spider-Man, being a UB set, was originally conceived as a supplemental set, which typically has fewer cards than a standard one. However, the decision to switch from supplemental to standard required that designers add more cards to fill out the set.</p><p>“It felt like it was just thrown together,” Bhatt said. “It felt cheap and rushed and unpleasant.” There’s also the setting of Spider-Man itself, which, according to Moher, didn’t quite match <em>Magic</em>’s high-fantasy identity. “All of a sudden you have a card that’s <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/651951/magic-marvels-spider-man-bagel-and-schmear?srsltid=AfmBOopwKGpX4Y1fJbWGrJj3am_8mwYZnUpmEaqHWgDhG4hxwHH5GwlJ&amp;Language=English">bagel and schmear</a> or like the guy on the computer,” he said. “It’s just strange and anachronistic.”</p><p>That antipathy is impacting the game’s secondhand market. Packs of Universes Beyond cards typically cost a few dollars more than in-universe packs. That cost increases for higher-end products like collector’s boxes and on the secondhand market. Like <em>Pokémon</em> cards, <em>Magic</em> has its own speculative market with people buying up product in hopes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/2/23817243/one-ring-magic-the-gathering-post-malone">selling at higher prices later</a>. But with the current cadence of UB sets combined with the poor reception of Spider-Man, even the collectors are tuning out.</p><p>“The audience is like, ‘I’m not going to buy it,’” Bhatt said. “‘I’m just not going to pay you $40 or $60 for a Spider-Man collector booster pack, because I don’t care.’”</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->5</strong><span><figcaption><em>An example of how some of the cards in the Spider-Man set create a dissonance with </em>Magic<em>’s traditional magical fantasy setting.</em></figcaption> <cite>Image: Wizards of the Coast</cite></span></p></section><p>Even though Spider-Man didn’t hit the mark the same way <em>Final Fantasy </em>or <em>Lord of the Rings</em> did, many fans are still enjoying these crossovers. On his personal blog, <a href="https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/766239595791810560/hey-mark-i-have-played-against-a-few-ub-decks-and"><em>MTG</em> head designer Mark Rosewater wrote</a>, “The reason Universes Beyond is so successful is because many longtime, invested, enfranchised <em>Magic</em> players enjoy it.”</p><p>The next UB set, <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, launches on November 21st. Based on pre-launch sentiment in the <em>MTG</em> community, it feels like a set that won’t suffer the same reception or quality issues that Spider-Man had. Universes Beyond is here to stay. When<em> Fortnite</em> first started incorporating characters like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/11/23301844/goku-dragon-ball-z-fortnite-new-crossover-teaser">Goku</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22954749/naomi-osaka-fortnite">Naomi Osaka</a>, it was mocked for being an unserious cash grab. Now, it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/streaming/789954/kpop-demon-hunters-fortnite-event">a celebrated feature</a> of a game that continues to dominate the most-played charts. <em>Magic </em>can have that too.</p><p>“In an ideal world, there would be more <em>Magic</em> sets than UB sets,” Partlow said. “I think that is the balance [Wizards] needs to strike. And if it wants to keep its core audience, that’s what it needs to do.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/819098/magic-the-gathering-universes-beyond-avatar-final-fantasy-spider-man]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve has created a PC-based game console that lives under your TV. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">Steam Machine</a> takes everything that’s great about the Steam Deck and adds the raw power to compete with the latest PlayStation and Xbox consoles. It also puts a huge amount of pressure on Microsoft to perfect its Windows and Xbox combination, as the Steam Machine brings Windows games to the living room in a way that Microsoft is dreaming up for its next-gen devices.</p><p>The Steam Machine looks like an Xbox Series X that has been cut in half into a miniature box. The 6-inch cube runs Windows PC games through Valve’s Linux-based SteamOS, and it should have enough power through its two AMD chips to deliver performance that’s close to an Xbox Series X or PS5. Inside, the Steam Machine’s components have all been compacted in a similar way to the Xbox Series X.</p><p>Beyond the hardware, it’s really SteamOS that makes the Steam Machine a viable Xbox and PS5 competitor. Valve failed to make Steam Machines a reality a decade ago, largely because developers had to port their games to Linux for them to run. Valve’s new Steam Machine utilizes its excellent Proton compatibility layer, which allows most Windows PC games to run seamlessly on the Steam Deck and often better than they do on equivalent Windows handhelds.</p><p>While the Steam Machine is a single device and Valve hasn’t announced OEM plans right now, I still think it represents a big threat to Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox plans — and even potentially to Windows PC gaming.</p><p>It’s no secret that Microsoft is working to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">combine the best bits of Xbox and Windows</a> for its next-gen consoles, and that means more PC-like hardware and software, just like the Steam Machine. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/799698/xbox-ally-x-review-asus-microsoft-full-screen-experience">Asus’ Xbox Ally handhelds</a> are an early look at the direction Microsoft is heading in for Xbox consoles, with Windows at the heart and an Xbox UI on top.</p><p>Microsoft’s combination of Windows and Xbox feels like a beta right now, though, and one that is shipping on a $1,000 device. Microsoft has effectively made the Xbox PC app into Steam’s Big Picture Mode and suppressed some of the annoying parts of Windows so they’re hidden away. It’s very early days for Microsoft’s vision here, and I personally feel it shipped far too early. The Windows and Xbox teams have a lot of work ahead to improve the Xbox full screen experience and hide the complexity of Windows away. Valve’s Steam Machine now heaps on the pressure for Microsoft to execute its vision perfectly.</p><p>That pressure will only increase if Valve can convince other PC OEMs to build Steam Machines in the future, just like it expanded SteamOS to Windows handhelds. While Microsoft is working on its own next-gen Xbox hardware, sources tell me it also wants OEMs to build future Xbox-branded hardware just like Asus has with the Xbox Ally. That puts Microsoft and Valve on an even bigger collision course.</p><p>Microsoft and Valve are both trying to attract similar audiences, gamers that are intrigued by PC gaming but want a simplified console-like experience, or those who are already PC gamers and want a reliable living room option that plays all the games they’ve already purchased.</p><p>The challenge for Microsoft is that Valve has already perfected SteamOS into a controller-friendly operating system, with a storefront that dominates PC gaming. All the pieces are ready to go for a Steam console, while Microsoft is building out its next-gen Xbox with a combination of Windows and Xbox and without being <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688407/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-cloud-amd">locked to a single store</a>. The next Xbox now looks set to embrace rival stores like Steam to entice people in, but Microsoft still faces a massive hurdle of convincing people to actually buy games in its own PC store instead of just buying them on Steam.</p><p>Microsoft will undoubtedly lean on its impressive Xbox cloud saves and Xbox Play Anywhere support as parts of its strength to battle Valve’s Steam Machine, but with SteamOS now available across consoles and handhelds it diminishes Microsoft’s cross-device effort. PC Game Pass is still exclusive to Windows, though, so Microsoft’s subscription service will play a big role in helping its next-gen hardware stand apart. Microsoft also has the huge advantage of games like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Battlefield 6</em>, and other multiplayer titles working seamlessly on Xbox, whereas they don’t run on SteamOS due to their complex anti-cheat systems.</p><p>Pricing will also be a big factor in Xbox + Windows vs. Steam Machine. Valve hasn’t finalized pricing yet, but it says “Steam Machine’s pricing is comparable to a PC with similar specs.” That sounds more pricey than a subsidized console, at a time when Microsoft and Sony are both bumping console prices beyond the norm. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/803824/microsoft-xbox-sarah-bond-next-gen-xbox-console-pc">Microsoft is also hinting</a> that its next-gen Xbox will be “a very premium, very high-end curated experience,” so expect more PC-like pricing for those consoles as well.</p><p>As the Steam Machine brings a simplified form of PC gaming to the living room, it also threatens to shine a bigger spotlight on Windows’ performance issues and the direction Microsoft is taking with its operating system. SteamOS has been outperforming Windows in a variety of titles already, leading some PC gamers to take a closer look at Linux for the first time. Combined with a simmering dislike of Microsoft’s direction with Windows from the PC gaming community, the Steam Machine should be a wake-up call for Microsoft to focus on performance and gaming instead of shoving Copilot buttons everywhere.</p><p>The Steam Machine now looks like a well-timed response to Microsoft’s Windows gaming struggles over the years, and an effort that has been in the works for a long time. Valve originally tried to put a box into everyone’s living room with its “Steam Box” effort more than a decade ago. I still remember encouraging my colleague T.C. Sottek to chase after <strong>Gabe Newell</strong> at CES in 2013. The Valve CEO <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3852144/gabe-newell-interview-steam-box-future-of-gaming">sat down with us</a> for a rare and wide-ranging interview about the future of Steam and Steam Machines. Much of what Valve was trying to do with the original Steam Box felt like a reaction to Windows 8, and Newell <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/7/25/3186615/valve-gabe-newell-gaming-interface-windows-8-interview">even described</a> the decision to launch Valve games on Linux as a “hedging strategy” against Microsoft. He also described Windows 8 as a “giant sadness” at the time, showing that Valve was frustrated at Microsoft’s direction with Windows more than a decade ago.</p><p>Valve’s hedging strategy now looks like it could deliver the dream of a PC in the living room that Microsoft has been chasing for decades — from Windows Media Center to the Xbox One’s big push with Windows underneath. Except it’s not Windows in the living room, it’s Linux.</p><p>You’d think that would be setting off alarm bells over at Microsoft. Instead, Microsoft Gaming CEO <strong>Phil Spencer</strong> was positive about Valve’s announcement during an all-hands with Xbox employees yesterday. He also <a href="https://x.com/XboxP3/status/1988677531801944496">posted on X</a> to congratulate Valve.</p><p>“Expanding access across PC, console, and handheld devices reflects a future built on choice, core values that have guided Xbox’s vision from the start,” said Spencer. “As one of the largest publishers on Steam, we welcome new options for players to access games everywhere.”</p><p>Microsoft is convinced its path for the next Xbox devices is the right one, but it now has to compete with Steam on its living room home turf to make a PC-like game console a reality. Game on.</p><div><p id="whats-happening-with-the-windows-insider-program"><h2>What’s happening with the Windows Insider program?</h2></p></div><p>In recent weeks the faces behind Microsoft’s Windows Insider program have all announced they’re moving on. <strong>Brandon LeBlanc</strong>, <strong>Amanda Langowski</strong>, and <strong>Jason Howard </strong>have all moved to separate roles inside Microsoft, and it’s not clear who will replace them yet.</p><p>Microsoft assures me that “there are no changes to the Windows Insider Program,” despite the trio all suddenly moving roles at the same time. “While we hire to backfill these roles, the Insider Program will be led by Alec Oot, Principal Group, Product Manager, Windows Servicing and Delivery,” says Chris Morrissey, senior director of communications for Windows servicing and delivery. “We remain committed to listening and learning from our Insiders, continuing our cadence of blog posts as we develop new experiences each week.”</p><p>The current Windows preview build blog posts are unnamed, and I do wonder if they’ll all just be written by AI agents in the future. Blog posts for new Windows features seem like an easy target for Microsoft’s AI push internally. Either way, I hope Microsoft continues to listen to Windows feedback through its Insider program, especially as it was introduced just as Windows 10 fixed Windows 8’s mistakes.</p><p>I’m always keen to hear from readers, so please drop a comment here, or you can reach me at <a href="mailto:notepad@theverge.com">notepad@theverge.com</a> if you want to discuss anything else.
