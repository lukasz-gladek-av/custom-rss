At 36 grams, it weighs just a bit more than seven US nickels. Is that <em>too </em>light? Maybe. Most of Corsair’s competitors haven’t shipped a mouse much below 50 grams (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/757680/sony-inzone-pc-gaming-headset-keyboard-mouse-hands-on">Sony’s new Inzone mouse</a> is 48 grams). I could flick it across my desk with relative ease, and that’s the point of lightweight mice. The Sabre V2 Pro is made to be easy to move so players can more quickly react in fast-paced games.</p><p>Even so, it doesn’t seem like Corsair cut too many corners to reduce the weight. The company claims its tiny 210mAh battery can last up to 70 hours per charge over a 2.4GHz wireless connection with its default 1,000Hz polling rate. The Sabre V2 Pro also supports 8,000Hz polling, letting your PC register a movement or input at 0.125ms, but battery life will dive to just 16 hours per charge in that mode. Peripheral makers love to brag about 8,000Hz polling, but most people’s reaction speeds aren’t anywhere close to sub-millisecond sensitivity, so you can probably save your battery.</p><p>The Sabre V2 Pro has a symmetrical shape, but is built for right-handed for PC gamers, with two thumb buttons on its left side. Corsair includes grip tape that can be applied to the main buttons and to the sides to customize how it feels to hold.</p><p>Tweaking this mouse’s DPI, macros, and other settings won’t require a software installation. Corsair is launching a browser-based configurator for the Sabre V2 Pro. This is slowly becoming the norm with PC gaming accessories geared toward pros. Allowing access to settings via a browser makes it easy to quickly make adjustments from any internet-connected PC, which makes them more useful during tournament play.</p><p>The Sabre V2 Pro is available now in black or white.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/776782/corsair-sabre-v2-pro-ultralight-gaming-mouse-weight-specs-price#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/776782/corsair-sabre-v2-pro-ultralight-gaming-mouse-weight-specs-price]]></content:encoded>
