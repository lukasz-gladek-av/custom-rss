In <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/passing_the_torch">an update on</a> Thursday, Parsons wrote that he has “decided to pass the torch” to longtime Bungie developer Justin Truman.</p><p>Parsons has worked at Bungie for over 20 years and led the studio through the launch of <em>Destiny 2</em> in 2017, along with the release of its major expansion pack, <em>The Final Shape</em>.</p><div><p>In 2022, Sony Interactive Entertainment <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/15/23220335/bungie-sony-acquisition-complete-official-done">purchased Bungie for $3.6 billion</a>. The studio has since contended with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/30/23938990/bungie-sony-layoffs-delays-destiny-final-shape-marathon">the layoffs</a> of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/31/24210476/bungie-to-layoff-220-employees-new-project">hundreds of workers</a> and delayed its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688479/bungie-marathon-delay-sony">extraction shooter <em>Marathon</em></a> following lackluster alpha test feedback. In May, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/668449/bungie-marathon-art-plagiarism-ps5">an artist accused Bungie</a> of using their work in <em>Marathon</em> without permission.</p></div><p>“We’ve been through so much together: we launched a bold new chapter for Destiny, built an enviable, independent live ops organization capable of creating and publishing its own games, and joined the incredible family at Sony Interactive Entertainment,” Parsons writes.</p><p>Truman joined Bungie in 2010 and became chief development officer in 2022. He says the team is “currently heads down” on both <em>Marathon </em>and <em>Destiny</em>, adding that “we’ll have more to show you in both of these worlds later this year.”</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/763895/bungie-ceo-pete-parsons-steps-down-destiny#comments">2<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/763895/bungie-ceo-pete-parsons-steps-down-destiny]]></content:encoded>
