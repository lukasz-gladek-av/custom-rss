            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/653115/nvidia-gpu-drivers-black-screen-crashes-issues<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia’s GPU drivers have been a disaster over the past four months. It all started when Nvidia released its drivers for the RTX 50-series cards in January, and introduced black screen issues, game crashes, and general stability problems for new and existing graphics cards. Now, yet another new hotfix has emerged to fix even more issues introduced by Nvidia’s buggy drivers.</p><p>Nvidia GPU owners have been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXoUsdSAnA">struggling for months</a> with a variety of issues reported on Reddit and in Nvidia’s own support forums, with most people fixing their issues by rolling back to the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fdrivers%2Fdetails%2F237719%2F" rel="sponsored">December 566.36 driver</a> before the RTX 50-series. Those fortunate enough to secure one of Nvidia’s latest GPUs aren’t able to roll back to the old drivers as they simply don’t support the new RTX 50-series, so Nvidia has been issuing a series of updates to try and address the problems.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/649599/nvidia-driver-576-02-bug-fixes-crashes-download-game-ready">The 576.02 driver release last week</a>, which included lots of bug and crash fixes, seemed like it would finally solve the issues that have plagued Nvidia’s driver releases over the past few months, but it has made things worse for some. Posters in the Nvidia forums have been reporting issues with GPU monitoring utilities not reporting the correct GPU temperatures since installing 576.02, so Nvidia was forced to release a hotfix driver yesterday to address this issue.</p><p>The latest <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5650/~/geforce-hotfix-display-driver-version-576.15">576.15 hotfix</a> also includes fixes for lower idle GPU clock speeds for RTX 50-series owners, and some fixes for certain games flickering after updating to last week’s 576.02 driver. I would highly recommend installing this hotfix driver if you’re on an RTX 50-series GPU or you regularly set your PC to sleep mode and use GPU monitoring utilities like Afterburner to control a custom fan curve based on GPU temperatures.</p><p>While this latest hotfix driver addresses some important issues, Nvidia forum posters are <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fforums%2Fgame-ready-drivers%2F13%2F563719%2Fannouncing-geforce-hotfix-driver-57615-released-42%2F" rel="sponsored">still reporting</a> lots of game crashes, performance issues, and stuttering when using G-Sync in certain games. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fforums%2Fgame-ready-drivers%2F13%2F563010%2Fgeforce-grd-57602-feedback-thread-released-41625%2F" rel="sponsored">Nvidia is currently tracking</a> at least 15 open issues with its 576.02 driver that will hopefully be addressed with the next official driver release.</p><p>Nvidia has released four hotfix drivers over the past two months, which is a surprising amount of hotfixes between the main Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) releases. It’s also surprising because, for the most part, Nvidia’s GPU drivers have always been stable and better than the AMD and Intel competition at game compatibility, performance, and crash-free gaming.</p><p>Nvidia’s driver issues come after a turbulent launch of the RTX 50-series cards. Some RTX 5090 power cables <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/609207/nvidia-rtx-5090-power-connector-melting-burning-issues">have been melting</a>, Nvidia had to admit that some of its new GPUs had a “rare” manufacturing issue that meant they were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618748/nvidia-admits-the-rtx-5080-is-affecte">missing render units</a>, and some of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/623441/nvidia-rtx-5070-review-test-benchmark">Nvidia’s marketing claims have been questionable</a>. The RTX 50-series cards have also been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/603863/nvidia-rtx-5090-out-of-stock-paper-launch">difficult to find in stock</a> at retail prices, leaving many PC gamers frustrated by Nvidia’s latest GPU launch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/649319/duolingo-chess-course-ios-test<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Duolingo will soon be able to help you learn another new skill: chess.</p><p>The platform’s new chess course will use short puzzles, such as moving a knight to the correct spot to practice its L-shaped movement or checkmating a king that’s stuck in a corner, to help teach you the game. You’ll also be able to play “mini-matches” or full games against Duolingo’s Oscar character, who serves as your coach through the lessons.</p><p>Duolingo gave me a brief demo of the chess course on a recent video call, and it looks like it could be a lot of fun. The team’s approach was to “make chess as accessible as possible,” Duolingo group product manager Edwin Bodge tells <em>The Verge</em>, and the course will offer lessons for a wide range of skill levels so that people can jump in at whatever level of familiarity they already have for chess.</p><p>Chess joins topics like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24253932/duolingo-loog-portable-green-piano-music-lessons">music</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/26/23319398/duolingo-math-app-beta-launch-duocon-2022">math</a> that aren’t language-based but can still be practiced via Duolingo. I asked if the company plans to build courses around other games, and staff software engineer Sammi Siegel says that “while we don’t have any plans to share right now, I think we’re just seeing how this launch goes and then we’ll go from there.”</p><p>The chess course is launching in beta testing on iOS in English, according to Monica Earle, Duolingo’s PR director. Earle estimates that in four to six weeks, more people on iOS will be able to try it, and then it will head to Android and be available in other languages down the line.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
