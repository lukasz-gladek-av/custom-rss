The news was <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1881728578712474019">shared on X</a> and featured a shout out to The Game Awards. </p><p>“To everyone who picked up Balatro after seeing it at <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards">@thegameawards</a>, we hope you’re having an amazing time with it!” the post read. <em>Balatro</em> was featured prominently during The Game Awards, nominated for a number of awards including Game of the Year and winning the best indie, best debut indie, and best mobile categories. </p><p>On X, Wout van Halderen, PR manager for <em>Balatro</em> publisher Playstack, added that the game had sold 3.5 million copies <a href="https://x.com/TheHashtag0nist/status/1881729707521257851">by the first week of December</a>. With The Game Awards taking place the second week in December, the implication is that <em>Balatro</em> received a significant 1.5 million unit bump in sales after being featured during Keighley’s Christmas Commercial telethon. Even more impressive, the 5 million figure is total units sold and doesn’t count the number of downloads the game got for being on the Apple Arcade subscription.</p><p>Since its launch in February, <em>Balatro</em> has quickly become one of the biggest indie hits of 2024. <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/balatro-localthunk-interview">Developed by a single person</a> over the course of two years, the poker roguelike has garnered a reputation for being a well-crafted “number-go-up” game with its developer leaning in on the joke that <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1839702508454687062">it devours players’ free and not-so-free time</a>.</p><div><p>In the 11 months since the game’s release, it’s only gotten small, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278578/balatro-is-getting-more-cards-featuring-other-games">cosmetic</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319769/dont-watch-this-balatro-video">updates</a> but developer LocalThunk has hinted <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215342/balatro-free-major-gameplay-update-2025">a major gameplay-focused update</a> is forthcoming this year.</p></div><p>Jimbo help us all. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
