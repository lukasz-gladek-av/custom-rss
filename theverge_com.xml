            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/626530/retroid-pocket-mini-screen-issue-returns-limited-200<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/wes-davis">Wes Davis</a> <span>is a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <a href="https://www.goretroid.com/products/retroid-pocket-mini-handheld?srsltid=AfmBOop71MwibM_OiOPn7LF7riEUPhx10NjhJUautgtvPXtEXcXW1p56">Retroid Pocket Mini</a> has an unfixable issue that’s causing certain graphical effects for emulated games not to work properly. Retroid, the China-based company that makes the Pocket Mini, announced on Discord that it will accept returns of the device but only during a limited March 8th to March 14th window — and capped at just 200 returns from owners who live outside of China, as <a href="https://retrohandhelds.gg/its-official-retroid-pocket-mini-shader-issue-cannot-be-fixed/"><em>RetroHandhelds</em> reports</a>.</p><p>Earlier in the week, the outlet says Retroid acknowledged it couldn’t fix the issue, which affects how the screen shows scanline and pixel grid shaders used to give classic emulated games the appearance of being played on the CRT displays they were designed for. The effects can show up as “misplaced scanlines, uneven pixels, or a slightly distorted image,” <em>RetroHandhelds</em> writes.</p><p>In this morning’s message, Retroid says carrying out this return campaign is a “large and costly endeavor,” and that it expects “a lot of return requests outside of screen-related issues.” Retroid also mentions it is asking customers to pay to ship their returns, which it promises to reimburse. Finally, the company added that it will offer all Pocket Mini owners “a $10 stackable coupon” for two of its future handhelds.</p><p>As Russ from the Retro Game Corps YouTube channel notes in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SBCGaming/comments/1j6ohs3/how_would_you_address_the_rp_mini_screen_issue/">post on Reddit</a> asking for recommendations to pass along to the company for dealing with the situation, Retroid is in a hard situation as a small company that now faces having to pay for very expensive shipping on returns. But that doesn’t change the fact that many gamers who bought the $199 handheld specifically to play retro games are left with a device whose otherwise impressive display does a bad job with some of the oldest tricks in the emulation book.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/625881/suikoden-remasters-classic-rpgs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Suikoden</em> is a game that I’ve been meaning to play for years. A highly regarded roleplaying game from the original PlayStation era, it’s renowned for its sprawling storyline and huge cast of playable characters. That also makes it pretty intimidating, and I’ve had a copy sitting on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24121232/sony-playstation-vita-steam-deck-switch">my PS Vita</a> just waiting for when I might have the free time to finally dig in. After all that waiting, I’m now playing a new remastered collection that includes the first two games in the series instead. And it made me realize that, for the past several months, my personal gaming time has been dominated by classic, turn-based RPGs — an experience that has really made clear the genre’s realm of possibilities.</p><p>It started with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24297436/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">excellent new version of <em>Dragon Quest 3</em></a>, which launched last November. That game was the equivalent of video game comfort food: an exceedingly straightforward fantasy adventure that has been spruced up with gorgeous visuals, a lush orchestral soundtrack, and some very welcome quality of life tweaks. Soon after that, Mistwalker released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24312363/fantasian-xbox-ps5-switch-pc-launch-hironobu-sakaguchi">an updated version of <em>Fantasian</em></a>. It’s technically not an old game — it originally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad">debuted on Apple Arcade</a> in 2021 — but it has the soul of one, with <em>Final Fantasy</em> creator Hironobu Sakaguchi using it as a way to explore new ideas in presentation and combat. Then, to top it all off, the “pixel remaster” version of the very first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295537/final-fantasy-4-apple-arcade"><em>Final Fantasy</em> hit Apple Arcade</a> in January.</p><p>These were all games I had played before, but digging through them again in quick succession made me appreciate their strengths. <em>DQ3</em> and <em>FF</em> embody a true sense of adventure. Both have straightforward stories that are easy to follow (or ignore, if you don’t care about that sort of thing) but locations and systems that make venturing into towns, dungeons, and the wider world exciting. <em>DQ3</em> made that type of experience incredibly approachable, with its beautiful new presentation and streamlined gameplay, while I’ve discovered that <em>FF</em> is quite possibly the ideal mobile game: something deep enough to keep me engaged but also an experience where it still feels like you’re making progress when you only have a short window to play.</p><p><em>Fantasian</em>, meanwhile, is like a modern reinterpretation of what a classic turn-based RPG could be. In a lot of ways, it’s classic <em>FF</em>, from the amnesiac protagonist to the the world that’s a mix between fantasy and sci-fi. But it also has some clever twists on the formula, like battles that let you aim attacks and a tool for delaying random battles for when you just want to explore. This is all on top of the headline-grabbing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi">visuals made of real-world dioramas</a>. And while I’m only a few hours into playing <em>Suikoden</em> for the first time, I’ve already been struck by the ambition of its storytelling, which manages to cram a lot of political intrigue into the confines of a traditional RPG structure.</p><p>That’s all to say that even at a time when there’s plenty of impressive, big, and modern RPGs like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/611255/avowed-review-xbox-pc"><em>Avowed</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24307786/dragon-age-the-veilguard-full-review"><em>Dragon Age</em></a>, there’s still something distinct and interesting about the classic turn-based formula, and it’s exciting to see all the ways that various studios have utilized it over the years. That’s true whether you’re replaying a new version of something old or, like me, trying out <em>Suikoden</em> for the very first time. Even better: there’s still more to come. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24350575/hironobu-sakaguchi-interview-fantasian-neo-dimension">Sakaguchi told me</a> earlier this year, when it comes to his studio’s next game, their “goal is to create something old but new at the same time.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
