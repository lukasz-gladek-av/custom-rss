            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/642025/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-zelda-wind-waker-f-zero-gx<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Before this morning, I knew I was going to buy the Nintendo Switch 2 but I didn’t know when. After watching <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream">Nintendo’s Switch 2 Direct today</a>, in which a purple block traced the GameCube’s stylized “G” logo, followed by high-res footage from <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker </em>and <em>F-Zero GX </em>and an announcement that they’ll be playable at launch, I realized I’ll be doing my damndest to get it on day one. It was the cherry on top of a stellar presentation that made the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">console’s $449.99 price tag</a> way easier to swallow.</p><p>GameCube games are coming to the Nintendo Switch Online (NSO) subscription’s Classic Game Library feature, which the company is now shortening to “Nintendo Classics.” It lets you play games from the NES, SNES, and Sega Genesis. Like the Game Boy and Nintendo 64 game collections, you’ll need the NSO Expansion Pack for GameCube games. The existing catalog of playable Classic Game Library games is far from complete, but together (and combined with DLC for contemporary Switch games), they make the Expansion Pack well worth it.</p><p>The subscription gets even more enticing on the Switch 2, starting before the console even comes out — Nintendo is prioritizing long-time subscribers (with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641559/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gameplay-requirements">certain caveats</a>) when it sends out Switch 2 preorder invites. The Expansion Pack will also let you play the Switch 2 editions of <em>Zelda </em>games <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and<em> Tears of the Kingdom </em>(provided you own their respective Switch 1 versions). </p><p>But the GameCube games are what I’m most excited about. I’d love for the Wii U’s <em>Wind Waker HD</em> to get a Switch re-release, but the GameCube version is still one of the most beautiful games I’ve ever played and looks great in Nintendo’s trailer for it. So does <em>F-Zero GX</em>, a game with such well-executed style and tight control that I would pit it against any futuristic racer today. The Switch 2 is also launching with <em>Soul Calibur II</em>, a game that featured adult Link as a playable character in his <a href="https://youtu.be/Q-25c8Rsobw?t=508">post-<em>Ocarina of Time</em> fighting-people-for-sport era</a>.</p><p>The company flashed a few other re-releases coming down the line, like <em>Super Mario Strikers </em>and <em>Chibi-Robo!, </em>in the latter of which you play a tiny, toothbrush-armed robot tasked with cleaning up a very messy house. It’s way more fun than it sounds, and gives me hope for what Nintendo <em>could</em> announce. There are some excellent, but more obscure gems that never really leapt beyond the GameCube, like the creepy, Lovecraft-inspired <em>Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem </em>and <em>Cubivore, </em>in which you play a small, wild cube trying to bring color back to the world by eating other boxy creatures, winning the chance to mate, die, and be reborn over and over again until you’ve become the fittest survivor of them all. </p><p>And all of these will be playable with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641482/nintendo-is-releasing-a-gamecube-controller">forthcoming wireless recreation of the GameCube controller</a>, as they should be. The GameCube wasn’t an abject failure, but it sold nowhere near as well as the Wii or the Switch. There’s no guarantee that the Switch 2 will keep up the sales pace set by its predecessor, but even if it manages half that console’s sales, it could give some games a well-deserved second look. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/641149/nintendo-switch-2-vs-oled-lite-specs-comparison-price<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Switch 2 is here — well, almost. Nintendo took the wraps off its new console during its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream">latest Direct event</a>, providing us with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/630264/nintendo-switch-2-specs-details-performance">a closer look</a> at the $449.99 console ahead of its release on June 5th.</p><p>In many ways, the sequel is a generational leap from<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild"> the original console / handheld hybrid</a> that rocked the gaming world over eight years ago. Nintendo is building upon the successful foundation it laid with the original Switch by offering a larger screen, more internal storage, and magnetic Joy-Con controllers that can operate like mice. It’s also introducing some new features, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">GameChat</a>, which lets players make voice calls, screen share, and video chat.</p><p>Below, we’re taking a closer look at the on-paper differences between the Switch 2 and its various predecessors — specifically, the original <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Nintendo Switch</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review">Nintendo Switch OLED</a>. We’ve even thrown in the handheld-only <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date">Nintendo Switch Lite</a>, just for good measure.</p><div><nav><h2>In this article</h2><ul><li><a href="#pricing-and-availability">Pricing and availability</a></li><li><a href="#display-technology">Display technology</a></li><li><a href="#performance-and-battery-life">Performance and battery life</a></li><li><a href="#joy-cons-and-other-controllers">Joy-Cons and other controllers</a></li><li><a href="#storage-dock-and-more">Storage, dock, and more</a></li><li><a href="#games-and-software">Games and software</a></li><li><a href="#by-the-numbers">By the numbers</a></li></ul></nav></div><div><p id="pricing-and-availability"><h2>Pricing and availability</h2></p></div><p>The Switch 2 will retail for $449.99 at launch, or you can buy it bundled with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> — a Switch 2 exclusive — for $499.99 through the fall 2025 or while supplies last. The standard Switch, meanwhile, still retails for $299.99 while the newer OLED edition costs $349.99. Both models can often be found on sale, as can the cheaper Nintendo Switch Lite, but the OLED variant rarely dips below $299.99.</p><p>Fortunately, like the Switch 2, Nintendo also continues to occasionally sell discounted bundles containing the Switch OLED, a three-month subscription to Nintendo Switch Online, and select games. The latest, which launched less than a month ago for MAR10 Day, contains a digital copy of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/623966/nintendo-switch-oled-mario-wonder-mar10-day-bundle"><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em></a> for $349.99.</p><div><p id="display-technology"><h2>Display technology</h2></p></div><p>With a 7.9-inch 1080p LCD screen, the Switch 2’s display is noticeably larger than that of prior Switch models. The original Switch panel comes in at 6.2 inches while the display on the Switch OLED stretches the screen to a respectable seven inches (both support 1,280 x 720 resolution in handheld mode or 1080p when docked). The Switch Lite is the smallest of the bunch with a 5.5-inch 720p display and no docking option.</p><div><p id="performance-and-battery-life"><h2>Performance and battery life</h2></p></div><p>The Switch 2’s predecessors use a custom version of Nvidia’s Tegra X1 chipset, which uses an octacore Arm CPU and a Maxwell-based Nvidia GPU that’s in league with the 900-series graphics cards that ruled the era. The power handily eclipsed smartphones of the time, but lagged well behind the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One that launched years prior. Still, that hasn’t stopped developers from producing critically acclaimed games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/17/23403042/persona-5-royal-nier-automata-nintendo-switch-review">excellent ports of several popular titles</a> within the last several years.</p><p>Nintendo has yet to divulge many technical details about the Switch 2’s new Nvidia chipset, only stating that it offers “significantly improved CPU and GPU performance” compared to the original Switch. We also know that the processor will allow for 4K gameplay at up to 60 frames per second in docked mode or 1080p at up to 120fps (with a variable refresh rate) in handheld mode. </p><p>As for battery life, you can eke out between 4.5 and nine hours on the Switch and Switch OLED. Nintendo says the Switch 2 can last between 2.5 and 6.5 hours, depending on usage, and takes approximately three hours to charge, just like previous models. </p><div><p id="joy-cons-and-other-controllers"><h2>Joy-Cons and other controllers</h2></p></div><p>The Switch 2 will feature longer, magnetic Joy-Con slots for a more secure connection. Instead of sliding the controllers into a side-mounted rail, you instead push them into a recessed slot. In addition, each Joy-Con 2 will feature “more durable” analog sticks and function like a mouse in certain scenarios, allowing you to control functionality in select games by simply sliding them across a flat surface.</p><p>The Joy-Cons that came with the original Switch were available in multiple colors. The Switch 2 controllers, meanwhile, come in a black colorway with red and blue accents surrounding the analog sticks. Matching colors drape the entirety of the attachment point where the shoulder buttons are located, which is visible when using a Joy-Con as a single controller. The inside of the attachment area also matches the Joy-Cons’ respective colors, and the right Joy-Con now features a “C” button for accessing various GameChat features.</p><p>If you find Joy-Cons too cramped, rest assured that Nintendo also introduced a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637833/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-details">new Pro Controller</a> during its recent Direct event. Along with customizable rear buttons and a 3.5mm audio jack, it sports the aforementioned “C” button found on the Joy-Con 2, which launches a chat menu when pressed. Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/24/14699044/nintendo-switch-pro-controller-hands-on-preview">Nintendo’s original pro-grade model</a>, it also features bigger buttons and triggers than the Joy-Cons, but will cost $79.99 (up from $69.99).</p><div><p id="storage-dock-and-more"><h2>Storage, dock, and more</h2></p></div><p>In terms of storage, the Switch 2 offers 256GB of internal space, which is eight times the storage capacity of the original Switch and four times that of the Switch OLED. You can add up to 2TB of additional storage using microSD Express cards, too, which offer faster read and write speeds than your standard microSD card.</p><p>Other notable hardware tweaks include an additional USB-C port on the top of the console and a built-in microphone with noise filtering, so you can chat with friends using Nintendo’s new Discord-like GameChat feature. GameChat also lets you screen share and make video calls via the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641352/nintendo-switch-2-camera-launch">new Nintendo Switch 2 Camera</a>. Nintendo has added a redesigned, U-shaped adjustable kickstand to the Switch 2 as well, which spans the width of the display.</p><p>As for the Nintendo Switch 2 dock, it comes with a built-in ethernet port just like the Switch OLED dock, whereas the original dock requires an optional adapter. The new dock also features a pair of USB-C ports, as opposed to just one, while retaining an HDMI port. </p><div><p id="games-and-software"><h2>Games and software</h2></p></div><div><p>The<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/1/13/14241960/nintendo-switch-launch-titles-prices-release-dates"> original Switch had about a dozen titles</a> available at launch, with dozens more released by the end of 2017. As of writing, Nintendo has announced a number of Switch 2 launch titles, including first-party games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> and third-party titles such as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/623660/split-fiction-review-hazelight-studios-it-takes-two"><em>Split Fiction</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23881536/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-2-0"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>. Nintendo also announced that select <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24339906/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-nso">GameCube games are coming to Nintendo Switch Online</a> and that several enhanced “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641365/nintendo-zelda-botw-totk-switch-2-edition-announced">Switch 2 Edition” games</a> will be available at launch, most notably <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p></div><p>You will have plenty more to play on the Switch 2, however, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641578/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatibility-games-faq">as it’s backward compatible</a> with most Switch 1 games. That said, Nintendo says some older titles may have some in-game compatibility issues, including <em>Doom: Eternal, Rocket League, NBA 2K25,</em> and <em>Warframe.</em> You also won’t be able to make use of Nintendo’s creative VR kit (sorry, <em>Labo</em> fans).</p><div><p id="by-the-numbers"><h2>By the numbers</h2></p></div><p>The standard Switch and Switch OLED are nearly identical on paper, but the Switch 2 has many notable upgrades.
