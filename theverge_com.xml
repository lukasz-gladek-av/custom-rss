However, <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1920181314092765494">developer Rockstar Games says </a>that isn’t actually the case, and that the trailer was “comprised of equal parts gameplay and cutscenes.” The fact that it’s hard to discern between the two in the trailer is an impressive achievement for the game, though obviously we’ll have to reserve judgement until we are able to actually play it.</p><p>Here, you can judge for yourself:</p><p>The studio also confirmed that the trailer was “captured entirely in-game from a PlayStation 5,” something that was noted in the trailer’s fine print. The game will be launching on both the PS5 and the Xbox Series X / S.</p><div><p>The trailer — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23988446/gta-vi-trailer-leaked-vice-city">which came more than a year after the first</a> — was released soon after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660057/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026">news came that <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> was being delayed</a>. Originally slated to launch this fall, the game is now due to release on May 26th, 2026. In a statement, Rockstar said that “we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.”</p></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
