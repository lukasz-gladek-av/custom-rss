In it, instead of a bald Agent 47, you play a youthful and immaculately coiffed James Bond — and that’s pretty much the biggest distinction between the two games. Watch the thirty minute stream<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/pwRpK8eoLLE?si=_fw8taB-FIX3ynmR"> here</a>.</p><p>As in <em>Hitman</em>, <em>First Light</em>’s gameplay demo featured a fancy party at a luxurious estate, lots of slow walking to blend in with the crowd, listening to ambient conversation for clues, and, of course, lots of fancy cars to drive and inevitably wreck. Basically, what IO showed of <em>First Light</em> makes the game look like <em>Hitman </em>with a fancy 007 skin. Which, honestly, probably suits a lot of players just fine.</p><p>With the success of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/18/23172898/tmnt-shredders-revenge-classic-arcade-game-interview">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredders Revenge</a> </em>and<em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610817/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a></em>, licensed games are making a big comeback. And while IO continues to update <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252511/hitman-3-review-io-interactive-accessible-storytelling-end-series">Hitman: World of Assassination</a></em> with new missions and fancy new targets, it’s been four years since the last full <em>Hitman</em> release. <em>007 First Light </em>seems like it’ll be a new way to scratch that spy thriller assassination itch and you won’t have to wait too long for it either. <em>007 First Light </em>launches on March 27th on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch 2, and PC.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770509/007-first-light-state-of-play-september-2025#comments">0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/770509/007-first-light-state-of-play-september-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you ever doubted the “console wars” were over, here’s a new piece of data to consider: <em>Helldivers 2</em>, formerly console exclusive to Sony’s PS5, is currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-ps5-console-exclusive-helldivers-2-now-tops-xbox-sales-chart-as-sony-continues-to-dabble-with-its-multi-platform-strategy">the best-selling title on Xbox</a>. In fact, it’s the <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/helldivers-2-first-third-xbox-best-selling-games-chart/">first <em>and third</em> best-selling game</a>, if you count its more premium edition, and it’s currently the ninth-most played game on the platform — mostly beaten by free-to-play games like <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Roblox </em>but also <em>Minecraft </em>and <em>GTA V</em>.</p><div><p>It doesn’t surprise me that <em>Helldivers 2</em> is popular on Xbox, because it was a huge hit on PS5 and PC. Last May, Sony revealed that <em>Helldivers 2</em> had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time-with-over-12-million-sold-in-12-weeks">become PlayStation’s fastest-selling game of all time</a> with 12 million copies sold in 12 weeks, and it <a href="https://x.com/alineaanalytics/status/1961422671381504312">may have now crossed 18 million</a> after reportedly racking up <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/augusts-most-downloaded-games-across">nearly a million on Xbox</a> in its first week on sale.</p></div><p>No, what’s surprising is that we now live in an era where companies like Sony and Microsoft no longer entirely see their hit games as a way to get players to buy their own consoles, and instead just want to sell as many copies of these games as they can. Back in May, we wrote about how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661814/xbox-best-selling-games-ps5-oblivion-minecraft">the top three games on PlayStation came from Microsoft</a>, and now it’s reciprocal!</p><div><p>Sony has come around to this position slowly, but by 2022, it planned for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/26/23142569/sony-playstation-pc-mobile-game-releases-first-party-portfolio">roughly half of its games to come out on PC or mobile</a> instead of just console, and though PlayStation game boss Hermen Hulst suggested in 2024 that some of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167560/sony-thinks-its-pc-games-will-tempt-you-to-buy-a-playstation-really">Sony’s big single-player games might be held in reserve</a>, the company revealed this August that it’s gradually <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1953483758667170146">“moving away from a hardware centric business model</a>.” It’s about selling games, not consoles.</p></div><p>Here’s where some of you will no doubt point out: is <em>Helldivers 2</em> actually a PlayStation game? Since PlayStation is merely the publisher and doesn’t own its developer Arrowhead Game Studios, is it really such a big deal?</p><p>I would say yes, because Sony has been the one in control, the one making the strategic decisions over when and where and how much PlayStation goodness to share. When players balked at how <em>Helldivers 2</em> originally required you to log in with a PlayStation account on PC, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24150327/sony-helldivers-2-review-bombing-psn-login">it was out of Arrowhead’s hands</a>. When players wanted an Xbox version, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/getting-helldivers-2-on-xbox-would-need-sony-and-phil-spencer-to-duke-it-out-arrowhead-community-lead-says">Arrowhead said it was entirely up to Sony</a>.</p><p>Microsoft doesn’t have to cut such publishing deals to bring Xbox’s biggest games to PlayStation, though. When it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224284/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date">chose to bring <em>Indiana Jones</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610793/hellblade-2-ps5-release-date-xbox-ninja-theory"><em>Hellblade 2</em> to PS5</a>, it could do so because it owns both giant publisher / developer Bethesda and developer Ninja Theory itself.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/693576/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-steam-notepad">What is an Xbox</a>, and what is a PlayStation, if not <em>the</em> place to play specific games? Is it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/763357/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-hands-on-notepad">a launcher and a set of familiar controls</a>? Is it a feeling? That’s the challenge facing Microsoft and Sony if they continue down this road.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770311/playstation-game-helldivers-2-best-selling-game-on-xbox#comments">1<!-- --> <!-- -->Comment</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/770311/playstation-game-helldivers-2-best-selling-game-on-xbox]]></content:encoded>
