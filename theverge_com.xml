            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/643616/nintendo-switch-2-us-preorders-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo has announced a new date for when Switch 2 preorders will kick off in the US; <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fnintendo-maintains-nintendo-switch-2-pricing-retail-pre-orders-to-begin-april-24-in-u-s%2F" rel="sponsored">April 24th</a>.</p><p>As a part of the announcement, Nintendo said that the price of the Switch 2 will remain at $449.99 despite fears that the Trump administration’s new tariff policy would lead to increased pricing for the console. However, Nintendo also said that the Switch 2 accessories would be more expensive. The Switch 2 Joy-Con, Pro Controller, and Switch 2 camera have all gone up in price. Originally the Joy-Con was priced at $89.99 and is now $94.99. The Pro controller has also gone up $5 from $79.99 to $84.99. Finally, the Switch 2 camera has gone from $49.99 to $54.99.</p><p>Preorders were originally set to begin on April 9th, but Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">delayed that</a> following the Trump administration’s announcement <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642240/trump-tariffs-imports-apple-manufacturing">of new tariffs</a>.</p><p>Specifically, Nintendo delayed preorders “in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.” At the time, the company said that the Switch 2’s planned June 5th launch date would be “unchanged.”</p><p>On April 8th, Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645240/nintendo-switch-2-canada-preorders-delayed-trump-tariffs">also announced</a> that it would be delaying Switch 2 preorders in Canada “in order to align with the timing of preorders to be determined in the US.” With this news, Canada will be able to preorder the Switch 2 on April 24th as well.</p><p>Nintendo’s new preorder date follows President Trump announcing on April 9th that he had authorized a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646029/trump-announces-a-90-day-pause-on-tariffs-outside-of-china">90-day pause</a> on tariffs outside of China.</p><p>The original preorder date was announced as part of Nintendo’s big reveal event for the Switch 2. At that event, Nintendo also said that the system <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">would cost $449.99</a> with a $499.99 version available that includes <em>Mario Kart World</em>. In the announcement, Nintendo reaffirmed that the price of the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle would remain the same along with the prices for both <em>Mario Kart World</em> ($79.99) and <em>Donkey Kong Bananaza</em> ($69.99).</p><p>The Switch 2 looks to be <a href="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=643616&amp;action=edit">a substantial upgrade</a> from the original Switch, with a larger 7.9-inch LCD screen, bigger Joy-Con controllers, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/630264/nintendo-switch-2-specs-details-performance">and more</a>. In addition to <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em>, Nintendo also showed off <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642699/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-preview-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></em>, a new 3D <em>Donkey Kong</em> game that’s set to launch on July 17th.</p><p>The new preorder date also follows Sony raising the price <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/647869/sony-ps5-price-rise-uk-europe-australia-new-zealand">of PS5 models</a> in the EU, UK, Australia, and New Zealand due to “a backdrop of a challenging economic environment.”</p><p>Nintendo closed its annoucement with an apology stating, “We apologize for the retail pre-order delay, and hope this reduces some of the uncertainty our customers may be experiencing.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
