He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>EA is asking employees to return to the office for three days per week under a hybrid model – and it sounds like the company will be significantly reducing remote hiring. CEO Andrew Wilson and president of EA Entertainment and technology Laura Miele sent emails to staff about the change, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring"><em>IGN</em> reports</a>. <em>Kotaku’s</em> Ethan Gach <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/667401/eas-ceo-is-asking-staff-to-return-to-the-office">also reported</a> on Wilson’s email.</p><p>Corporate communications VP Justin Higgs confirmed the new hybrid model to <em>The Verge</em>. “We’ve adopted a globally consistent hybrid work model to bring teams together with greater clarity and intent – enabling faster decisions, sharper execution, and stronger connection to one another,” Higgs says. Hybrid roles will spend “at least three days a week in the office,” though there will be “flexibility” on other roles.</p><p>Miele’s email details how EA locations will have a 30-mile radius around them to help determine if an employee falls under the on site, hybrid, or remote model for work, IGN reports. Here’s what Miele says, per <em>IGN</em>:</p><div><ul><li><span>Employees who live within 30-miles/48-km of an EA location will transition to a Hybrid work model.</span></li><li><span>Employees who live outside the 30-mile/48-km radius will be considered remote unless their role is designated as On Site or Hybrid.</span></li></ul></div><p>The “offsite local” work model is going to be sunset within 3 to 24 months. In addition, “any work model exception and future Remote hires will require a CEO Direct’s /my approval,” Miele’s email says, according to IGN.</p><p><em><strong>Update, May 14th</strong>: Noted that Ethan Gach also reported on Wilson’s email.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A leak of old text messages sent to Steam customers with one-time codes for logins was “not a breach of Steam systems,” Valve says in <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F593110%2Fview%2F533224478739530145%3Fl%3Denglish" rel="sponsored">a post published Wednesday</a>.</p><p>Valve’s response follows news that a hacker is allegedly in possession of 89 million user records and put them up for sale for $5,000, as <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/twilio-denies-breach-following-leak-of-alleged-steam-2fa-codes/"><em>BleepingComputer</em> reports</a>. <em>BleepingComputer</em> looked at 3,000 leaked files and found “historic SMS text messages with one-time passcodes for Steam, including the recipient’s phone number.”</p><p>While one X user <a href="https://x.com/MellowOnline1/status/1921682082025115818">claimed that there is</a> evidence tying the breach to Twilio, a Twilio spokesperson told <em>BleepingComputer</em> that “there is no evidence to suggest that Twilio was breached” and that “we have reviewed a sampling of the data found online, and see no indication that this data was obtained from Twilio.” Valve also told the X user that <a href="https://x.com/MellowOnline1/status/1922458687316074640">it does not use Twilio</a>.</p><p>“The leak consisted of older text messages that included one-time codes that were only valid for 15-minute time frames and the phone numbers they were sent to,” Valve says in its post. “The leaked data did not associate the phone numbers with a Steam account, password information, payment information or other personal data. Old text messages cannot be used to breach the security of your Steam account, and whenever a code is used to change your Steam email or password using SMS, you will receive a confirmation via email and/or Steam secure messages.”</p><p>Valve adds that you don’t need to change your password or phone number following this leak, though it does recommend setting up the Steam Mobile Authenticator.</p><p>The company says it’s “still digging into the source of the leak.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/667061/ubisoft-prince-of-persia-remake-release-date-by-april-2026<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister">Sean Hollister</a> <span>is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p><em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21429389/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-xbox-one-ps4-announcement-ubisoft">was originally supposed to arrive</a> on January 21st, 2021. Since then, it’s been delayed three times, got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/3/23055673/ubisoft-prince-persia-remastered-pune-mumbai-montreal">shipped to a different studio</a>, reportedly started over from scratch, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/10/24126462/prince-of-persia-sands-remake-yuri-lowenthal">may have lost the original writer and amazing performances of its English voice actor</a>. But Ubisoft has revealed the game is finally on the way — and will go on sale before April 2026, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-will-release-by-april-2026/">as spotted by <em>Insider Gaming</em></a>.</p></div><p>In <a href="http://irtable.com/appJQntCmOa2q2a5C/tblpr7UqfWXvDuH8G/viwviiWY2XXTIhLm8?blocks=hide">Ubisoft’s latest earnings release</a>, the company reveals that it expects the <em>Prince of Persia</em> remake to be one of the games that will help its bottom line during the next fiscal year, FY2025-2026. Since Ubisoft’s FY2024-2025 ended on March 31st, 2025, that means the new game will have to go on sale before March 31st, 2026.</p><p>But that also means it could arrive any time now. We’re already two months into FY2025-2026. I’d be surprised if we didn’t get an announcement <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/603313/summer-game-fest-returns-on-june-6th">at the Summer Game Fest next month</a>.</p><p>Ubisoft suggests that its top games in FY2025-2026 will be <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/637717/assassins-creed-shadows-stealth-assassinations">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a></em> and <em>Siege X, </em>but names <em>Prince of Persia</em> as one of the games that’ll contribute alongside <em>Anno 117: Pax Romana, Rainbow Six Mobile</em> and <em>The Division Resurgence</em>.</p><p>I’m eagerly awaiting the chance to try it, as the original is one of my top five favorite games of all time. I loved its storytelling, voice acting, incredible music, and its then-groundbreaking ability to rewind time. But I won’t deny I’m a bit worried.</p><p>Both Yuri Lowenthal — the Prince’s iconic English-language voice actor — and <em>Prince of Persia</em> creator Jordan Mechner were attached to the remake when it was announced in 2020. (Lowenthal once suggested the remake was going to “keep all of Jordan Mechner’s brilliant writing” and thanked Ubisoft for not picking a “younger, hotter actor” instead of him.) But after development moved to Ubisoft Montréal in 2022, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/10/24126462/prince-of-persia-sands-remake-yuri-lowenthal">it’s not clear whether either is still involved</a>. Here’s hoping there was good reason to overhaul the game, unlike <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495611/spider-man-remastered-peter-parker-tom-holland-ps5-playstation-5">that other time a game company replaced Yuri Lowenthal’s face</a>!</p><p>The remake is far from the most-delayed game at Ubisoft, of course: I believe <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24181213/i-got-excited-for-beyond-good-and-evil-2-there-for-a-sec-but-i-guess-the-remastered-original-will-do">Beyond Good and Evil 2</a></em> currently holds the all-time record at over 15 years since it was first announced. Incidentally, the first BG&amp;E game shipped just a month after <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</em>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ftech-specs%2F" rel="sponsored">Switch 2 specs page</a> is light on details. However, <em>Digital Foundry </em>has shared what it says are “rock solid” specifications for the upcoming console in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-final-tech-specs-and-system-reservations-confirmed">an article</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huxDoYXS8Ng">a video</a>, offering new information about its processor and a testing tool for developers for GameChat.</p><p>On its specs page, Nintendo only describes the Switch 2’s chip as a “custom processor made by Nvidia.” Nvidia shared <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642793/nintendo-switch-2-dlss-support-nvidia-ray-tracing">a bit more last month</a>, including that its chip enables DLSS and real-time ray tracing on the Switch 2. <em>Digital Foundry </em>gets more specific: it says the Switch 2’s custom Nvidia T239 system-on-a-chip uses an ARM Cortex A78C CPU with eight cores. Six cores will be available to developers, while two will be used for the system.</p><p>The GPU uses Nvidia’s Ampere architecture. The console also has 12GB of LPDDR5X memory, though the system will hold 3GB in reserve.</p><p>As for the Switch 2’s display capabilities, while VRR is supported on the console’s screen, the device doesn’t support VRR while in docked mode and connected to HDMI, <em>Digital Foundry </em>reports. Nintendo originally advertised that VRR would be available while docked as well, but it’s since <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-scrubs-mentions-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-supporting-vrr-on-a-tv-while-docked.1166361/">scrubbed mentions of that</a> on its website. </p><p><em>Digital Foundry</em> also notes an interesting tidbit about GameChat, the new Discord-like chat system for the Switch 2. Nintendo is offering developers a GameChat testing tool that “simulates API latency and L3 cache misses that the real world GameChat system incurs on the system, meaning developers can test this without needing active GameChat sessions running,” <em>Digital Foundry</em> says. Hopefully, this testing tool will help developers make sure that GameChat doesn’t bog down their games.</p><p><em>Digital Foundry</em> has a lot more detail than I covered here, so check out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-final-tech-specs-and-system-reservations-confirmed">its</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huxDoYXS8Ng">coverage</a> of the specs to learn more. The Switch 2 is scheduled to launch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">on June 5th</a>, and if you missed getting a preorder, you might want to consider <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/665958/nintendo-switch-2-best-buy-stock-launch-day">lining up at Best Buy</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
