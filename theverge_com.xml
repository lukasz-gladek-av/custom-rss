He previously wrote for <em>Business Insider, Rolling Stone, </em><em>Futurism, </em>and <em>Popular Science.</em></span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Remedy Entertainment is one of the few game studios that’s seemingly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/691964/remedy-entertainment-profile-alan-wake-control-fbc-firebreak">been doing well</a> in an industry where its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762933/bioshock-cloud-chamber-take-two-2k-layoffs">competition is downsizing</a> and console makers are continually raising <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">hardware prices</a>. The studio turned 30 on August 18th, and Humble is celebrating with <a href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/482924/2091208/25796?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fremedy-games-30th-anniversary-bundle" rel="sponsored">a 10-item bundle</a> for $27 ($211 off the full MSRP). To put the price into perspective, <em>Alan Wake 2 Deluxe Edition</em>, one of the included games, currently retails for $69.99 in the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/alan-wake-2--deluxe-edition">Epic Games Store</a>. You can also choose a bundle that costs $5 or $12 but includes fewer games, and each is available until October 10th.</p><p>While <em>Alan Wake 2 Deluxe Edition</em> is the standout game in the bunch — and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Verge</em> favorite</a> from 2023 — you’ll also get a mix of classics, including 2002’s <em>Max Payne</em> and a 2012 remake of 1996’s <em>Death Rally</em>, which was initially released for MS-DOS. You’ll also get a 25 percent off coupon for <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, Remedy’s latest title. If you don’t want to jump into <em>Alan Wake 2, </em>a remastered version of the original game and the standalone side story <em>Alan Wake’s American Nightmare </em>are also included. Playing the games in order will allow you to witness how the studio has progressed, including popularizing the bullet time game mechanic with <em>Max Payne </em>and the psychological horror genre with the <em>Alan Wake </em>series.</p><p>If you pick up the bundle, you’ll receive a mix of Steam keys and Epic Games Store keys, which can be redeemed on their respective platforms. All of the games run on Windows, and some titles are playable on the Steam Deck, which is currently 20 percent off <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamdeck" rel="sponsored">from Steam</a> in its entry-level LCD configuration. Part of the proceeds from your purchase even support <a href="https://www.savethechildren.org/">Save the Children</a> — <strong>an organization that provides health, education, and protection programs for children across 113 countries</strong> — in addition to the publishers and Humble. You can also adjust the amount that goes to each entity using the “adjust donation” slider on the landing page.</p><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/783776/remedy-30th-anniversary-humble-bundle-alan-wake-2-control-deal-sale#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandt Ranj</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/783776/remedy-30th-anniversary-humble-bundle-alan-wake-2-control-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
