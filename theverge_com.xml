            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/28/24308248/8bitdo-keyboard-retro-87-mechanical-xbox-edition-rgb-lighting-r8-mouse<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>8BitDo has announced a new version of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/31/23813761/8bitdo-retro-mechanical-keyboard-nintendo-famicom">mechanical keyboard</a> with a design inspired by the&nbsp;transparent green edition of Microsoft’s original Xbox console. The <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-87-mechanical-keyboard-xbox/">8BitDo Retro 87 Mechanical Keyboard - Xbox Edition</a> features a transparent green shell and matching keycaps similar to the console. But unlike previous iterations of the keyboard, this is the first from 8BitDo to incorporate RGB backlighting.</p><p>The Xbox Edition mechanical keyboard is now <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMTLLSBN?tag=theverge02-20">available for preorder through Amazon</a> for $119.99 with shipping expected to start on January 16th, 2025. 8BitDo also announced the matching 8BitDo Retro R8 Mouse alongside the keyboard, which is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMVLD2HC?tag=theverge02-20">also listed on Amazon</a>, but not available for preorder yet.</p><div><figcaption><em>The keyboard includes 8BitDo’s programmable Dual Super Buttons.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: 8BitDo</cite></p></div><p>The keyboard features a tenkeyless layout with 87 keys that include a full function row, a Windows key, and the addition of an Xbox logo button in the upper right corner that serves as a shortcut to the Windows Game Bar. It pairs double-layered ABS keycaps featuring a matte UV coating for durability with Kailh Jellyfish X switches, and the keyboard is compatible with 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software V2 allowing its mapping to be customized and macros to be created.</p><p>As with its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/28/24113566/8bitdo-commodore-64-retro-mechanical-keyboard-specs-release-date-price-features">other mechanical keyboards</a>, 8BitDo includes a pair of large Super Buttons that can be programmed to trigger macros or other functions.</p><p>The RGB backlighting offers eight different modes including animated waves of rainbow colors or individual keys illuminating. 8BitDo says the keyboard’s built-in 2,000mAh battery can keep it running for up to 200 hours, but doesn’t specify if that’s with the backlighting turned on, or if that’s while connecting to a device over Bluetooth or using its included 2.4GHz dongle. With a dead battery, the keyboard can still connect to devices with a USB-C cable.</p><div><figcaption><em>8BitDo’s Retro R8 Mouse - Xbox Edition matches the keyboard and features four customizable buttons, two on each side.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: 8BitDo</cite></p></div><p>The <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-r8-mouse-xbox/">8BitDo Retro R8 Mouse - Xbox Edition</a> has a similar transparent green shell as the keyboard, along with four programmable side buttons (two on each side) matching the colors of the action buttons on the original Xbox controllers. It uses a PAW 3395 optical sensor with six selectable sensitivity levels ranging from 50 DPI to 26,000 DPI. The Retro R8 Mouse’s polling rate can also be adjusted using 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software from 125Hz to 8,000Hz. The mouse’s primary buttons use Kailh Sword GM X Micro Switches which 8BitDo says have been “engineered for up to 100 million clicks.”</p><p>The mouse’s 450mAh rechargeable battery can power the mouse for up to 100 hours when using a Bluetooth connection but with a low-latency 2.4GHz connection battery life ranges between 26 to 105 hours depending on the polling rate. To streamline charging the Retro R8 Mouse includes a matching charging dock that also includes a “signal-extending feature” that 8BitDo says “ensures robust and uninterrupted connectivity.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
