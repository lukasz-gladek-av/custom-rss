Previously, he was a freelance writer for Popular Mechanics, Men’s Health, and Esquire.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo rarely offers big discounts on its own games and gear throughout the year, but opportunities to save are coming soon. The company <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fnintendo-announces-holiday-offers-for-black-friday-and-cyber-monday-2025%2F" rel="sponsored">announced</a> that multiple retailers will offer discounts of up to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2F" rel="sponsored">$30 off of beloved Switch games</a>, as well as temporary price cuts on its amiibo figures, and a $20 off discount on microSD Express cards that are only compatible with the Switch 2.</p><p>These discounts begin at slightly different times. If you’re shopping for games digitally through your Switch or Switch 2, you can get the jump on deals in Nintendo’s Cyber Deals sale starting November 20th and lasting through December 3rd at 11:59 PM PT.</p><div><p>Then, Nintendo and select retailers will offer deals on physical versions of first-gen Switch games beginning November 23rd. First-party titles like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24112407/princess-peach-showtime-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Princess Peach: Showtime!</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a>, and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20942003/luigis-mansion-3-review-nintendo-switch-gooigi-comedy">Luigi’s Mansion 3</a></em> will be available for $39.99 each ($20 off). You can also save on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23339801/splatoon-3-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Splatoon 3</em></a>, and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fpaper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-switch%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em></a>, each of which will be available for $29.99 ($30 off).</p></div><p>Notably, there are no deals on Nintendo Switch 2-exclusive titles; however, <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, and <em>Splatoon 3</em> all offer a downloadable Switch 2 update for free with purchase. Those updates generally provide smoother gameplay at higher resolutions on the newer handheld.</p><p>If you’re into collecting amiibo, Nintendo will also offer discounts on select models, including Tulin, Yunobo, and Ruji from <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> series, along with <em>Street Fighter 6</em> figures of Jamie, Kimberly, and Luke. Finally, starting November 30th, Nintendo stores in New York and San Francisco, along with select retail stores, will offer $20 off Samsung microSD Express cards, so presumably, you’ll be able to get the $59.99 256GB for $39.99.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzE5"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandon Russell</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/817944/nintendo-switch-2-black-friday-games-amiibo-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
