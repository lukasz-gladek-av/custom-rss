            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/30/24305460/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-concert-eminem-snoop-juice-wrld-ice-spice<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fortnite</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/30/24308372/fortnite-remix-finale-concert-juice-wrld-chapter-6-how-to-watch">most recent virtual concert</a> was supersized in multiple ways. Unlike previous events, which focused on specific artists like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling">Ariana Grande</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/29/24187226/fortnite-metallica-concert-interview">Metallica</a>, this one featured a cast of four different artists: Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Ice Spice, and the late Juice WRLD. And it turned each one of the large lineup into a kaiju-sized performer, while also integrating deep cuts of <em>Fortnite</em> lore and providing a tease of what’s next for the game.</p><p>Things started out at Snoop Dogg’s compound, which has been at the center of the battle royale map since the beginning of November. From there, a gigantic version of the rapper performed, before whisking players away into space for another song. In fact, the event constantly moved around: up next was Eminem who fought against a giant robot following a dramatic storm, followed by Ice Spice towering over a cityscape like Godzilla. It ended back on the battle royale island with a pair of Juice WRLD songs.</p><p>The humongous versions of the stars were reminiscent of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report">the Travis Scott show from 2020</a>, and — much like the Grande concert — the event also weaved in bits of <em>Fortnite</em>’s strange history. Eminem’s sequence was similar to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20701930/fortnite-epic-games-live-event-mecha-monster-battle-showdown-giant-robot">the game’s mecha-monster battle from back in 2019</a>, while during Juice WRLD’s songs players were turned into the glowing butterflies that first appeared in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913541/fortnite-game-shutdown-black-hole-event-storytelling"><em>Fortnite</em>’s ambitious black hole event from the same year</a>. At the end players were given a glimpse of what appears to be the new version of the battle royale island that will be playable when the game’s next chapter kicks off on December 1st.</p><p>After things wrapped up, the game was used to premiere Juice WRLD’s new animated music video for “Empty Out Your Pockets,” which takes place inside of <em>Fortnite</em>:</p><div><p>This all comes after an interesting, music-filled month for the battle royale game. At the beginning of November Epic kicked off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24283508/fortnite-remix-chapter-2-concert-snoop-dogg-ice-spice">a remixed version of <em>Fortnite</em>: Chapter 2</a>, which was a month-long and focused on a different musical artist each week. It was preceded by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24288014/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-snoop-dogg-times-square-music">a real life concert in Times Square from Snoop Dogg and Ice Spice</a>. The mini season also introduced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301624/can-i-kick-it-yes-i-can-on-thursday">a new cosmetic item in the form of kicks</a>, and saw <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301710/fortnites-subscription-is-about-to-become-a-better-deal">Epic revamp its battle pass structure</a>.</p></div><p>The concert not only closed out Chapter 2: Remix, it also set up the game’s next mainline season. It’s called “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306403/fortnite-minus-one">Hunters</a>,” and it kicks off on December 1st with new additions like Godzilla and Baymax, along with a completely new battle royale island. Here’s the first trailer:</p><div><p>While the Chapter 2 event is over, <em>Fortnite</em> isn’t done with the nostalgia. Epic is bringing back <em>Fortnite </em>OG — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23948555/fortnite-og-new-season">a throwback to the game’s original map</a> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294616/fortnite-og-permanent-december-release-date">as a permanent fixture on December 6th.</a></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some other paired attacks show up, like Squirrel Girl catching a Spider-Man web ball and apparently turning it into an exploding slingshot projectile, or Black Window and Hawkeye firing side-by-side. </p><p>Marvel also took the wraps off a new map called Kyntar: Symbiotic Surface in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-CFFxqFNRo">separate video</a> published on Thursday. Here’s the synopsis from Marvel’s announcement: </p><div><blockquote><p>The awakening Knull has cast a shadow over the Panther God Bast. In response, Shuri sends the Guardians of the Galaxy to Klyntar to seek out a solution to this looming threat. After the Milano crashes on Klyntar, the Guardians bump into Venom. The two sides have different opinions on how to defeat Knull: Venom, having extracted the Knull Essence from a controlled symbiote, argues for caution due to its volatile nature and the risk of harming the planet’s symbiotes. With Knull still dormant, Venom prefers to wait until they can harness this power safely. On the other hand, the Guardians, tasked by Shuri, are eager to immediately neutralize Knull’s influence over the gods including Bast. At an impasse, they decide to go their separate ways.</p></blockquote></div><p><em>Marvel Rivals </em>is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X / S, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) on December 6th. Ahead of that, the Marvel Games team is holding an AMA on December 4th at 10PM ET on the game’s <a href="https://www.discord.gg/marvelrivals">official Discord</a>.</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24307545/black-friday-2024-best-deals-tech-gadgets-cyber-monday-gift-ideas"><h2>The best Black Friday tech&nbsp;deals&nbsp;we’ve found</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/30/24308372/fortnite-remix-finale-concert-juice-wrld-chapter-6-how-to-watch"><h2>How to watch Fortnite’s big Juice WRLD, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, and Ice Spice concert</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24303161/amazon-influencers-lawsuit-copyright-clean-aesthetic-girl-sydney-nicole-gifford-alyssa-sheil"><h2>Bad influence</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24309106/best-black-friday-deals-2024-tech-gadgets-cyber-monday"><h2>The best Black Friday deals you can still get today</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24306534/black-friday-2024-streaming-best-deals-max-hulu-peacock-paramount-plus-cyber-monday"><h2>Max, Hulu, and Paramount Plus are all heavily discounted for Black Friday</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
