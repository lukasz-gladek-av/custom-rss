            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/628698/spectre-divide-mountaintop-studios-shutting-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Spectre Divide</em>, a <em>Valorant</em>-like free-to-play shooter <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24211078/spectre-divide-preview-mountaintop-fps-game">where you control two bodies</a>, is shutting down just months after its September launch.</p><p>“We were optimistic about the first week,” developer Mountaintop Studios <a href="https://x.com/SpectreDivide/status/1899943286158336111">says in a post</a>. “We’ve had ~400,000 players play, with a peak concurrent player count of ~10,000 across all platforms. But as time has gone on, we haven’t seen enough active players and incoming revenue to cover the day-to-day costs of Spectre and the studio.”</p><p>The studio expects to take <em>Spectre Divide</em> offline “within the next 30 days,” and it will refund all money since the game’s first season, which kicked off on February 25th. Mountaintop Studios will also be “closing its doors” at the end of the week, according to the post.</p><p>“We pursued every avenue to keep going, including finding a publisher, additional investment, and/or an acquisition,” Mountaintop says. “In the end, we weren’t able to make it work. The industry is in a tough spot right now.”</p><p>In December, Mountaintop CEO Nate Mitchell and <em>Spectre Divide</em> game director Lee Horn told <em>The Verge</em> that things were already dire, and that the game’s console launch and new season <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24325918/can-spectre-divide-escape-concords-failed-shooter-fate-heres-the-hail-mary">would be its hail mary play</a>. Horn said that the marketing was working going into launch, but that server issues beginning on launch day axed its momentum. “Unfortunately, the game fell over on day one,” he admitted. </p><p>Mitchell told us the game needed thousands of concurrent players if it was going to survive, or else the company would run out of money this year. Unfortunately, the game’s new season peaked <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/2641470#3m">at just over 1,000 concurrents on Steam</a>, and has been downhill ever since; presumably, Mountaintop saw its multiplatform peak of around 10,000 players drop similarly.</p><p>“If the players are enjoying the game... if they aren’t into season one, they way we hope they are, we’ll have to take a hard look at if we should keep going on as we are, or if players are telling us this isn’t what we want,” Mitchell told us in December. Apparently, Mountaintop did have to take that hard look, and this is its decision.</p><div><p>The <em>Spectre Divide</em> shutdown follows the disastrous launch of Sony’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">forgettable <em>Concord</em> hero shooter</a>. Sony has since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">closed down <em>Concord’s</em> development studio</a> and permanently shut down the game.</p></div><p><em>Additional reporting by Sean Hollister</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/628332/amd-9070-xt-gpu-retailer-partner-scalping<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sure enough, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/624423/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review-benchmarks-price">AMD’s exciting Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT graphic card prices, quoted at $550/$600</a>, are looking too good to be true. Newegg, Overclockers UK, and even Micro Center are among the outlets that have now quietly raised the prices on the <em>supposedly</em> entry-level MSRP models of these graphics cards by $50-$130. Last Thursday, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/625502/amd-rx-9070-xt-launch-pricing-msrp-possible-bait-switch">AMD wouldn’t deny reports</a> that its partners are explicitly allowed to rapidly increase those prices beyond MSRP, and a week later, that’s already coming to pass.</p><p>While it’s true that board partners like ASRock, Gigabyte, PowerColor, Sapphire, and XFX generally charge more for cards with fancier cooling solutions, those aren’t the cards we’re talking about today. We’ve been tracking prices on ten specific models of the AMD 9070 and AMD 9070 XT that were originally introduced at their $550 and $600 MSRPs.</p><p>None of those cards are currently in stock at any retailer we’ve checked — but some retailers have already modified their pricetags ahead of new shipments. Here are the changes we’ve seen:</p><div><p id="amd-radeon-9070-xt"><h2>AMD Radeon 9070 XT</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Newegg now lists PowerColor’s 9070 XT Reaper at $700, a $100 jump</span></li><li><span>Newegg now lists XFX’s 9070 XT Swift at at $730, a $130 jump</span></li><li><span>Newegg now lists ASRock’s 9070 XT Steel Legend at $670, a $70 jump</span></li><li><span>OCUK now lists PowerColor’s 9070 XT Reaper and Sapphire Pulse 9070 XT at £650, an £80 jump</span></li><li><span>OCUK now lists ASRock’s 9070 XT Steel Legend at £669, a £99 jump</span></li></ul></div><div><p id="amd-radeon-9070"><h2><strong>AMD Radeon 9070</strong></h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Micro Center now lists XFX’s 9070 Swift OC at $630, an $80 jump</span></li><li><span>Micro Center now lists Gigabyte’s 9070 Gaming OC at $670, a $130 jump</span></li><li><span>OCUK now lists PowerColor’s 9070 Reaper at £570, a £40 jump</span></li><li><span>OCUK now lists Sapphire’s Pulse 9070 at £570, a £40 jump</span></li></ul></div><p>Not every retailer has changed out the pricetags on every card. Best Buy, which only listed a single model of the 9070 and 9070 XT at MSRP to begin with, hasn’t changed those prices yet — though they’re admittedly still out of stock. (It also now lists a pair of out-of-stock Gigabyte cards at MSRP.) Micro Center also still lists three models of 9070 and four models of 9070 XT at MSRP, though all are out of stock.</p><p>On the Nvidia front, there doesn’t seem to be much retailer/board partner scalping going on yet, at least at major US retailers. We’re tracking six different models of $550 RTX 5070, three different models of $750 RTX 5070 Ti, and three different models of $1,000 RTX 5080 which were originally listed at MSRP prices. Best Buy, Newegg, and Micro Center are still listing the ones they stock at MSRP today.</p><p>Last week, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/625502/amd-rx-9070-xt-launch-pricing-msrp-possible-bait-switch#:~:text=It%20did%20address%20the%20larger%20question">AMD told us</a> that “we expect cards to be available from multiple vendors at $549 / $599,” and that more cards are coming. AMD did not say which board partners or retailers would agree to offer cards at those prices, or how few those partners would have to sell at those prices before charging more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
