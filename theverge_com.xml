Both <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> have been plagued by players using devices like XIM, Cronus Zen, and ReaSnow S1 to enable unfair advantages that exploit aim assist, and now Activision is introducing new detections to ban the devices.</p><p>“These devices are not permitted in <em>Call of Duty</em>,” <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2026/02/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-02">says Activision’s Richochet team</a>. “They are cheating tools, even if they masquerade as accessibility devices.” Activision <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/4/23669939/call-of-duty-warzone-xim-ban-suspension-warning">originally cracked down</a> on these devices in <em>Call of Duty: Warzone </em>and <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</em> nearly three years ago, with mixed results.</p><p>“Stopping these devices takes more than looking for a specific piece of hardware because they are designed to hide, adapt, and change configurations to avoid simple detection,” says Activision. It’s a constant game of cat and mouse for anti-cheat developers, especially when these devices are regularly updated by the manufacturers and sold at big retailers.</p><p>Activision is now updating its detection software to focus on player inputs, rather than attempting to detect the actual devices. “We analyze input timing, consistency, and response patterns to distinguish natural human play from machine-modified input,” says Activision. “This allows us to identify recoil control, aim behavior, and input precision that exceed what is physically possible through a standard controller or mouse.”</p><p>These new third-party device detections will be introduced alongside season 2 of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </em>later this week. Microsoft-owned Activision is also introducing stronger cloud-based anti-cheat technology, which verifies a PC using Microsoft Azure Attestation to prevent attempts to bypass system-level security protections. This stronger detection is coming first to Ranked Play matches, and builds on top of the existing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/720007/call-of-duty-pc-anti-cheat-secure-boot-windows-black-ops-7">TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot requirements</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/872976/call-of-duty-xim-cronus-reasnow-s1-ban-detections]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite is about to get a lot more gaming crossovers]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/872769/epic-games-store-fortnite-year-in-review-2025</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Fortnite</em> is going to be getting <em>a lot</em> more crossovers featuring characters from video games. As part of the Epic Games Store’s <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/news/epic-games-store-2025-year-in-review">year in review for 2025</a>, Epic shared details about its official program for developers that will give people who purchase their game on the Epic Games Store a related cosmetic they can use within <em>Fortnite</em>.</p><p>Eventually, the goal is to scale the program to “over 100 partnerships per year,” Epic Games Store GM Steve Allison said on X <a href="https://x.com/halfbakedSteve/status/2014813374362878317">last month</a>. In an interview with <em>The Verge</em>, Allison says that there will be “about 40” this year and “60-plus” so far set for 2027. The program starts with Capcom’s <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, which launches <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/681325/resident-evil-requiem-trailer-date">on February 27th</a>, and other publishers with crossovers in the works include miHoYo, Pearl Abyss, S-Game, MintRocket, and Kakao Games.</p><p>“It’ll help a bunch of our partners, and it’ll be cool for our players,” Allison says about the program. But it benefits Epic, too; players might be more willing to buy a game on the Epic Games Store instead of Steam because of a <em>Fortnite</em> tie-in, and more people making more purchases on the Epic Games Store might make the platform more appealing for developers and publishers in general.</p><p>In its year in review, Epic also highlighted how player spending in third-party PC games grew 57 percent year over year to an “all-time record” of $400 million. The platform saw an all-time record of 78 million monthly active users on PC, too. And users claimed 662 million titles through Epic’s free games program, which Allison says will continue through 2026. “It’s basically our marketing budget,” he says.</p><p>This year, Epic is planning to make some updates to the Epic Games Store launcher on PC, including rebuilding the underlying architecture as part of a string of improvements it plans to ship this summer. The launcher has been criticized for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/p57148/epic_games_launcher_is_terrible/">being slow</a>, and the improvements should lead to faster load times and better stability, according to Epic. “We know the criticism,” Allison says. “We don’t disagree with it.” He says that Epic wants the app to feel “instant” and “snappy.”</p><p>Epic is also still invested in its efforts with its mobile stores. The mobile Epic Games Store has seen more than 50 million installs, Allison says, which is a far cry from the 100 million it was targeting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store">by the end of 2024</a>. “We expected more,” according to Allison, but the friction from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789421/epic-games-store-ios-android-installations">scare screens</a> is the “real deal.” (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259634/we-lose-half-of-people-that-intend-to-install-the-store">He’s said as much before</a>.) Still, Epic is planning to launch the store in Japan in March and Brazil in June because of regulatory changes in those countries.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/872769/epic-games-store-fortnite-year-in-review-2025]]></content:encoded>
