It also comes with an exclusive white carrying case and white microfiber cleaning cloth.</p></blockquote></div><p>Since the 1TB OLED normally costs $649, you’re effectively paying $30 for the color. Valve says it’s allocated stock proportionally across each region, but once it’s sold out, it won’t be making any more. </p><p>Below, find a few more images of it direct from Valve.</p><p>I still highly recommend <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">the Steam Deck OLED</a>, though I could see some buyers picking <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">an Asus ROG Ally X instead</a> for its notable performance and decent battery life advantages, particularly if they decide to dual-boot the Bazzite operating system (which makes it feel a lot like a Steam Deck) alongside Windows. </p><p>(Yes, the ROG Ally X is a black variant of an originally white handheld, and this Steam Deck is the opposite.)</p><p>Here’s what the old Valve prototype looked like, straight out of <em>Portal</em> with an Aperture Science logo on the back:</p><div><figcaption><em>It’s not for sale.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>GIF by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Here’s hoping someone will print up some high quality<em> Portal</em> stickers, and perhaps we can add our own orange and blue <em>Portal</em> thumbstick covers or something.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
