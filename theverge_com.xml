The new Ryzen 7 9850X3D will debut on January 29th, priced at $499.</p><p>That’s $20 more than the initial retail pricing of the 9800X3D, and this faster 9850X3D will feature the same 8-core / 16-thread CPU running at faster boost clocks. The boost clock on the 9850X3D is 400MHz higher than the standard 9800X3D, and it maintains the same 120-watt TDP. It’s essentially a better-binned version of the 9800X3D.</p><p>It’s still not clear exactly how much these higher boost clocks will help with PC games, and AMD has admitted that most of the benefits will be found in frequency-sensitive titles like esports games. Still, at least you won’t have to pay much more for a faster chip — that’s if you can find the 9850X3D at its retail price later this month.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/865648/amd-ryzen-7-9850x3d-price-release-date-announcement]]></content:encoded>

It shares some functionality with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">Nintendo’s Alarmo alarm clock</a>, but the Talking Flower seems more like a talkative companion for fans of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>First and foremost, as the name implies, the Talking Flower will just randomly speak a couple of times every hour when left alone with phrases like “sometimes it’s nice to space out,” and “is it weird for flowers to talk?” A single button on the toy can be pressed to trigger random thoughts on demand, or you can press and hold the button to silence the Talking Flower for a while. There’s music, too, and at launch it will support 11 different languages including English, Italian, and Japanese.</p><p>You can also set the Talking Flower to speak at specific times of day, such as greeting you in the morning or saying good night as you head to bed, and some of its random phrases are only triggered at specific times of the day. It’s got a built-in sensor so it can comment on the temperature in the room, and instead of using LEDs or a screen, the Talking Flower will just tell you when its batteries are running low. The toy will be <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260122688129/en/Discover-More-of-Whats-New-in-Super-Mario-Bros.-Wonder-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Meetup-in-Bellabel-Park">available for preorder today</a> through the My Nintendo Store and other retailers, and is expected to release on March 12th, 2026.</p><p>Surprisingly, this wasn’t the only flower-related news from Nintendo today. The company also released an overview trailer for the upcoming Switch 2 update for <em>Mario Wonder</em>, and it includes a new power-up called the “bellabel flower.” That update is out on March 26th.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/865618/nintendo-talking-flower-preorder-super-mario-wonder]]></content:encoded>
