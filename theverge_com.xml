            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349938/royal-shakespeare-company-macbeth-game-lili<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Macbeth</em>, William Shakespeare’s iconic play, is being reimagined as an interactive video game with a neo-noir vibe — and it’s being developed in part by the Royal Shakespeare Company. The game, titled <em>Lili</em>, is a “screen life thriller video game” where you’ll have access to a modern-day Lady Macbeth’s personal devices, according to a press release.</p><p>“Players will be immersed in a stylized, neo-noir vision of modern Iran, where surveillance and authoritarianism are part of daily life,” the release says. “The gameplay will feature a blend of live-action cinema within an interactive game format, giving players the chance to immerse themselves in the world of Lady Macbeth and make choices that influence her destiny.” It sounds kind of like a version of <em>Macbeth</em> inspired by Sam Barlow’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/23/20828666/telling-lies-review-steam-iphone-sam-barlow-interactive-thriller-her-story">interactive</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031558/immortality-is-coming-to-ps5">thrillers</a>.</p><p>The Royal Shakespeare Company is making the game in collaboration with iNK Stories, a New York-based indie studio and publisher that also made <em>1979 Revolution: Black Friday</em>. It stars Zar Amir as “Lady Macbeth (Lili),” per the press release.</p><p><em>Lili</em> is set to release “later in 2025.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349916/celeste-developers-cancel-earthblade-extremely-ok-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Earthblade, the next game from the developers of <em>Celeste</em>, has been canceled. The fantasy-inspired game got its first trailer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/8/23500114/earthblade-trailer-extremely-ok-games-the-game-awards-2022">in late 2022</a>, and the game would have let you explore a “free-roaming, dynamically-loading map,” Extremely OK Games’ Maddy Thorson said at the time. But the team decided to cancel the game in December after a team conflict and because of the pressure of trying to follow up on <em>Celeste</em>, Thorson says <a href="https://exok.com/posts/2025-01-22-earthblade-final-update/">in a post detailing what happened</a>.</p><p>The “disagreement” was between Thorson and Noel Berry (Thorson refers to the two of them as “us”) and Pedro Medeiros over “the IP rights of <em>Celeste</em>,” Thorson says. “We eventually reached a resolution, but both parties also agreed in the end that we should go our separate ways,” and Medeiros is currently working on <a href="https://saint11.art/games/neverway/">a game called <em>Neverway</em></a>. “Losing Pedro wasn’t the only factor in cancelling the game, but it did prompt us to take a serious look at whether fighting through to finish <em>Earthblade</em> was the right path forward,” Thorson says.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20857240/celeste-farewell-dlc-expansion-masterpiece-platformer-game-release-date">huge success of <em>Celeste</em></a> also “applied pressure on us to deliver something bigger and better with <em>Earthblade</em>, and that pressure is a large part of why working on it has become so exhausting,” Thorson says. “Pedro isn’t to blame for this — in fact the split with him has given us the clarity to see that we have lost our way, and the opportunity to admit defeat.”</p><p>Thorson and Berry want to refocus on “smaller-scale projects” and are “prototyping again” to try and “rediscover game development in a manner closer to how we approached it at <em>Celeste’s</em> or <em>TowerFall’s</em> inception.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
