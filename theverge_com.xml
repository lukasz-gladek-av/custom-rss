The team revealed seven years ago that it kept the <em>Hollow Knight</em> pricing low to ensure as many people played it as possible. “$15 US is actually quite a bit of money for many people, especially in other countries than the US,” explained Team Cherry cofounder Ari Gibson in a 2018 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/8swt8n/comment/e12wtcy/">Reddit post</a>. “Ultimately, our main interest is that as many people as possible play our games, and we want to price them such that players can do so.”</p><p>The considerate choice on the pricing of <em>Hollow Knight</em> allowed millions of people to play the game, with the original selling more than 15 million copies. That’s made <em>Hollow Knight</em> one of the most successful indie video games ever, so a $19.99 price tag for <em>Silksong</em> could produce similar sales results — especially as it’s currently the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Ffilter%3Dpopularwishlist" rel="sponsored">most wishlisted game on Steam</a>.</p><p><em>Silksong </em>is releasing at 7AM PT / 10AM ET / 3PM UK on September 4th. It will be available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, and Team Cherry has also struck a deal to include <em>Silksong </em>on Xbox Game Pass on day one.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/768524/hollow-knight-silksong-pricing-release-timing#comments">3<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/768524/hollow-knight-silksong-pricing-release-timing]]></content:encoded>
