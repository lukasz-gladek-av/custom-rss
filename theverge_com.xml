            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24316882/itch-io-offline-domain-registration-funko-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Indie game storefront&nbsp;<a href="http://itch.io/">Itch.io</a> is currently offline because of what it describes as a bogus phishing report. While the game store’s servers are still online, the domain for the website is currently pointing towards IP addresses that itch.io doesn’t own — making it inaccessible for most people.</p><p>Itch.io blames pop culture collectibles company Funko for the issues in a <a href="https://x.com/itchio/status/1866017758040993829">post on X</a>, “because they use some trash ‘AI-powered’ Brand Protection Software called Brand Shield that created some bogus Phishing report to our registrar.”</p><p>While the disputed page has been taken down, itch.io’s domain registrar, <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/">iwantmyname</a>, still disabled the domain likely due to automated systems. According to a <a href="https://x.com/itchio/status/1866022784222245305">post on X</a>, the indie game marketplace is now waiting on the domain registrar to respond and re-enable its domain.</p><p>If you know how to tweak your hosts file that maps hostnames to IP addresses then you can use the 45.33.107.166 IP address in the meantime, but you’ll need to remove the entry once the domain is restored. <a href="https://x.com/itchio/status/1866049795724648524">Itch.io is hoping</a> the problems will be resolved in a matter of hours so it doesn’t have to deploy a new domain name instead.</p><p>The domain issues come just days after itch.io <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295998/you-can-now-use-your-itch-io-url-as-your-username-on-bluesky">started allowing its users</a> to use its domain name for Bluesky accounts. If you have spent $10 on the platform then you have the option to use your itch.io profile URL on Bluesky, but the current domain issues mean anyone who switched to the custom itch.io URLs has an “invalid handle” error on Bluesky until the main itch.io domain is back online.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
