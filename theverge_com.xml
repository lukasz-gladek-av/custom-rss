That’s because now until 1PM ET on March 20th, PC gamers can save on a smorgasbord of great titles as part of the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2F" rel="sponsored"><strong>Steam Spring Sale</strong></a>, which encapsulates everything from classic Japanese RPGs and newer deckbuilding titles to one truly hellish shooter.</p><p>The bulk of the deals are not necessarily “new,” though they are a great way to catch up on newer games you may have missed and revisit landmark titles from gaming’s past. For instance, if you’ve been itching to revisit <em><strong><strong><em>Chrono Trigger</em></strong></strong></em> in honor of <a href="https://x.com/SquareEnix/status/1899460368344252493">the game’s 30th anniversary</a> this week, you can now <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F613830%2FCHRONO_TRIGGER%2F" rel="sponsored">snag Square Enix’s fabled SNES RPG for $3.74</a> (about $11 off). Want something modern? <strong><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></strong> is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1091500%2FCyberpunk_2077%2F" rel="sponsored">down to $42.76</a> (about $40 off) with its excellent <em>Phantom Liberty</em> expansion, while the <strong>2016 <em><em>Doom reboot</em></em></strong> is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F379720%2FDOOM%2F" rel="sponsored">going for a mere $1.99</a> ($18 off).</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->43</span></p><div><p><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</em> includes the base game as well as CDPR’s excellent <em>Phantom Liberty</em> expansion, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23881536/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-2-0">improves the game significantly</a>. The spy thriller DLC introduces players to a new area of Night City, along with a host of new quests and items.</p></div></div><p>It’s not all about studios with a AAA budget, either. Collectible card games like <strong><em>Inscryption</em></strong> (<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1092790%2FInscryption%2F" rel="sponsored">now $7.99</a>) and <strong><em>Slay the Spire</em> </strong>(<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F646570%2FSlay_the_Spire%2F" rel="sponsored">now $6.24</a>) — both of which offer deep mechanics and various roguelike elements — are steeply discounted this weekend, while the bullet hell survival game that is <em><strong>Vampire Survivors</strong></em> is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1794680%2FVampire_Survivors%2F" rel="sponsored">going for $3.74</a> (about $1 off). And if you know nothing about the latter, well, rest assured <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/629790/vampire-survivors-has-an-official-wiki">there is now an official wiki</a> that outlines any question you might ever think to ask.</p><div><p id="more-ways-to-save-right-now"><h2>More ways to save right now</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>There’s been a spate of terrific Sonos deals over the last couple of weeks; however, if you’re looking for something <em>somewhat</em> budget-friendly, you can still grab <strong>Sonos Ray</strong> at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Essential-Soundbar-Music-Video/dp/B0B2KQFTG9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSonos-Ray-Compact-Sound-Bar-for-TV-Gaming-and-Music-Black%2F1181374313%2F" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/297ucif8ryve0">Best Buy</a> for $179 ($100 off). The 22-inch stereo soundbar makes some concessions to keep the cost down (RIP, HDMI), but it still manages to deliver excellent dialogue clarity and crisp, balanced sound that one-ups most other soundbars in its price range. It also taps into the rest of the Sonos ecosystem, naturally, and supports AirPlay 2 for streaming from various Apple devices. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23149484/sonos-ray-soundbar-review">Read our review</a>.</span></li><li><span><a href="https://www.thensf.org/sleep-awareness-week/">Sleep Awareness Week</a> is a thing, apparently, and the reason why <strong>Headspace</strong> has <a href="https://checkout.headspace.com/checkout?voucherCode=40SLEEP2025A">dropped the price of its annual subscription</a> to $41.99 ($28 off) through March 18th. A subscription grants you access to a robust catalog of well-curated sleepcasts, not to mention guided meditation sessions, focus music, and daily inspirational videos. The app’s searchability and the gradual progression of the courses remain the best parts of Headpace, though, especially if you’re a relative newcomer to mindfulness exercises.</span></li><li><span>If PC games aren’t your thing, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/626792/finall">Sony’s new <em>Astro Bot</em> PlayStation 5 bundle</a>, which pairs a 1TB PS5 “slim” with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/12/12/24320203/astro-bot-is-the-2024-game-of-the-year">last year’s Game of the Year</a>, is now available for $449 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-Digital-ASTRO-Bundle-PlayStation-5/dp/B0DWGLDS2V/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/auha8bm69jl94">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPS5-Standard-Bundle-Astrobot%2F15239011502" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>. It doesn’t come with Team Asobi’s adorable <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/29/24208726/astro-bot-limited-edition-ps5-dual-sense-controller"><em>Astro Bot </em>Dualsense controller</a> or any sort of limited edition styling, sadly, but it is $50 cheaper than picking up a standalone PS5 console.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/627954/star-of-providence-review-nintendo-switch-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Star of Providence</em> is like a retro game I would have loved as a kid. But the roguelike bullet hell shooter is also a modern twin-stick shooter, and the melding of the two eras results in a fun, fast, and challenging experience.</p><p>In <em>Star</em>, you control a ship and explore randomly generated dungeons. As you navigate room by room — similar to an old-school <em>Legend of Zelda</em> game — you’ll pick up powerful weapons to fight the many enemies you’ll stumble across in your dungeon crawling.</p><p>The weapons are a delight, filling your screen with bullets and lasers. Sometimes, you’ll get cool effects like the ability for your bullets to phase through one side of the screen and appear on the other. But enemies can also spew out huge amounts of bullets, and that means many rooms turn into chaos as you weave through attack patterns to line up a perfect shot. The game’s narrow aspect ratio makes rooms feel pretty small, too (though I appreciate how it adds to the retro vibe).</p><p><em>Star’s</em> controls are tight, so it always feels like you can thread the needle to escape danger. A useful dash can get you out of rough spots. And you can deploy bombs to clear bullets from a room, but they can take a while to recharge.</p><p>As you explore dungeons, you’ll have to make a lot of typical roguelike-y choices, like what to buy at a shop or what upgrades to pick. Arguably the most important choice is what weapons you’ll pick up along the way: they’re much more powerful than your basic gun, but they also have a limited amount of ammo. But I found that made for some fun strategy. Do I buy a weapon right when I come upon a store but risk running out of ammo before I really need it? Or should I try to survive a floor without it and instead buy the weapon when I’m about to take on the floor’s boss?</p><p>Speaking of bosses: they’re awesome. They’re typically giant, taking up a good portion of the square screen, and they spew bullets in all sorts of unpredictable and nail-biting patterns. I’m a particularly big fan of the <a href="https://starofprovidence.wiki.gg/wiki/Daemon">huge green skeleton with horns</a>.</p><p>Perhaps my favorite thing about <em>Star</em> is that everything is <em>fast</em>. Rooms typically take just seconds to clear, meaning you can zip through a whole dungeon floor in a few minutes. The game’s map lets you instantly teleport to rooms you’ve previously been to as you’re exploring a floor. Even boss fights usually only take a minute or two. And when you want to start a new run, all you need to do is go through a door at your home base.</p><p>There’s a constant sense of forward momentum that I think more games should emulate. That actually might be where <em>Star</em> is most like the old-school games it’s inspired by: jumping into the action is almost as easy as adding another quarter to an arcade machine.</p><p><sub>Star of Providence<em> is available now on Nintendo Switch and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
