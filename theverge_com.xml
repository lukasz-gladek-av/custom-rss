            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294720/sony-playstation-5-ps5-price-cut-holidays<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony is cutting the price of the “slim” PS5 digital edition by $70, making it more affordable for the holiday season. Typically, that PS5 model costs $449.99, but it will start at $379.99 through December 24th, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J40QG4CVaww">according to a new ad</a>. </p><p>This holiday deal brings the slim PS5 digital edition just under the original $399.99 price of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21436287/sony-ps5-digital-edition-price-release-date">launch version of the PS5 digital console</a>. The footnote at the end of the ad specifies that this price is only for the disc-free console, so it seems like the model with a disc drive already attached will still start at $499.99. But the holiday pricing also means that by buying a digital PS5 slim and one of Sony’s separate $79.99 PS5 disc drives, you can make your own PS5 with a disc drive and save about $40.</p><p>Another way to save money would be to opt for one of Sony’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/11/24241914/sony-refurbished-playstation-5-ps5-dualsense">refurbished PS5s</a>: a digital refurb costs $349.99 while a model with a disc drive costs $399.99. But those refurbished consoles also come in the original design for the PS5 that’s larger (and arguably) uglier than the slimmer model.</p><p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, Sony offers the $699.99 PS5 Pro. But that doesn’t come with a disc drive, and whether it’s worth the higher cost might depend on how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">far away you sit from the screen</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
