The new trailer is — like the first — pretty heavily focused on setting up the characters and world, without much in the way of gameplay (though the developer does call it “the biggest, most immersive evolution of the series yet”).</p><p>But we do have a few more details about the story. Here’s the description from Rockstar:</p><div><blockquote><p>Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive.</p></blockquote></div><p>And here are some closer looks at the setting (you can see more images and videos <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI/downloads">right here</a>):</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->12</strong><span><cite>Image: Rockstar Games</cite></span></p></section><div><p>The sixth <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> game was previously slated <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158510/gta-6-release-date-fall-2025">to launch in fall 2025</a> on the PS5 and Xbox Series S / X (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/607885/gta-vi-is-still-coming-this-fall">publisher Take-Two was pretty confident about hitting that window</a>), but was later <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660057/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026">pushed to May 2026</a>. It tells a Bonnie and Clyde–style story set in a fictionalized version of Florida called Leonida, which is home to the iconic Vice City. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/614743/gta-vi-user-generated-content-roblox-fortnite">Reports have also suggested</a> that user-generated content could play a major role in the release.</p></div><div><p>Of course, <em>GTA</em> fans are used to waiting around. It’s been over a decade since <em>GTA V</em> first launched and was then subsequently ported <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/16/22980756/grand-theft-auto-5-gta-next-gen-ps5-xbox-hands-on">to multiple generations of consoles</a>, selling more than 200 million copies over that span. In the meantime, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22978906/gta-online-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-version-next-gen-career-missions-graphics">the game’s online mode became a juggernaut</a>, and Rockstar also released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18021082/red-dead-redemption-2-review-xbox-one-ps4">a little game called <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em></a>.</p></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
