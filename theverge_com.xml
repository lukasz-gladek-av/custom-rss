            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/674523/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-live-service<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Tiger Borgia, a content creator focused on cozy games, has been pulling weeds in <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> for over five years. </p><p>Given the current landscape in which game developers constantly release new updates to vie for the attention of audiences, Borgia’s dedication to <em>New Horizons</em> can come across as admirable. Nintendo has not released a major update to <em>New Horizons </em>since the <em>Happy Home Paradise</em> DLC in 2021. (Just this week <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/49112/~/how-to-update-animal-crossing%3A-new-horizons">the game was patched</a> in advance of the Switch 2.) The version of <em>New Horizons</em> Borgia plays today — the one where she pulls weeds and fishes each day — is more or less the same game that the company released in the spring of 2020. </p><p>At a time when seemingly every publisher is trying to capture a piece of the lucrative live-service boom, <em>New Horizons</em> showed Nintendo slowly inching its way into the space with more than a year’s worth of regular updates after launch. And that expansion into live service is something that could become an even larger part of Nintendo’s future with the Switch 2.</p><p>Speaking to <em>The Verge</em>, Borgia explains that two years ago she would have said yes to having more content in <em>New Horizons</em>, but her opinion has since changed. “Now I feel like the game should be left as is,” Borgia says via email. “<em>New Horizons</em> already had its moment. I would be open to the next Animal Crossing title being a live-service game, but I would be skeptical about paywalls and subscription fees.”</p><p>Since the release of <em>Fortnite </em>and<em> PUBG: Battlegrounds </em>in 2017, live-service games have become a core pillar of modern gaming. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-09-29/why-playstation-fans-are-cheering-ceo-jim-ryan-s-departure">Live-service games</a> — or what some call “games as a service” — don’t have a clear start and end. Instead, developers release a base game and continue to put out updates that add new characters, game modes, and other content to try and get people to play as much as possible.</p><p>The model has become a massively popular way to monetize games. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lj27nkyes22r">Industry analyst Mat Piscatella</a> published data saying more than 40 percent of all time spent playing on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles in the US in the month of January was spent playing the top 10 live-service games. And the trend has hit the developer side too: a <a href="https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-2025-state-game-industry-devs-weigh-layoffs-ai-and-more">2025 survey from the Game Developers Conference</a> found that roughly 30 percent of all “AAA” developers are working on a live-service game. </p><p>Despite all the big numbers, Nintendo has been selective with the live-service games it develops. Creating a live-service game isn’t as easy as flipping a switch, and even major companies like Sony have struggled to enter the space; it <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects">recently shut down development on two such projects</a>. However, some fans are wondering if that could change with the Switch 2. </p><p>Previous titles like <em>Splatoon 3 </em>have already gotten live-esque service with regular <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23683377/splatoon-3-splatfest-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-kingdom">updates and events</a> — even if the earlier entries in the series were ultimately shut down. And <em>New Horizons</em> received a steady stream of updates initially. New features, like the Switch 2’s Discord-like social tool GameChat, could benefit live-service games that rely on online communication and logging in with friends regularly to play. Additionally, leaks from an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275596/nintendo-switch-online-beta-playtest-program-leak-mmo">October playtest</a> suggested that Nintendo could be working on some sort of MMO for the Switch 2, which could also fall under the umbrella of a live-service game. </p><p>But here is the most compelling argument that a shift could be on the horizon: Nintendo has already been investing in live-service games for years. If you look at Nintendo’s mobile games, entries like <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em> already used a free-to-play model with in-game transactions at launch.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Some Animal Crossing fans welcome the possibility of adapting the mainline games to a live-service model. <em>New Horizons</em> is really good for people who like to get creative and design an island, but the game can run out of new content after players complete certain tasks and storylines.</p><p>Tom, an artist who played the game for more than two years, tells <em>The Verge</em> a live-service version of the game could have kept him playing even longer. “More updates would have made it <em>way</em> more likely that I’d have kept going, especially because it would keep friends coming back too,” he says<em>.</em></p><p>Additionally, the gameplay and structure of <em>New Horizons </em>could be the perfect fit for a live-service game, since it has seasonal events depending on the time of year and the region you play in. However, some of the fans I spoke to expressed skepticism. </p><p>“I was never expecting to get infinite content from Animal Crossing honestly,” Christi Kerr, a player who spent more than 700 hours playing <em>New Horizons</em>, tells <em>The Verge</em>. “I was used to old AC games where all the content came out at once, and you play it until you feel like you’ve done all you want. I thought the updates to <em>New Horizons</em> were fun, but also kind of frustrating as a <em>New Leaf</em> player.”</p><p>That’s not to say that players <em>The Verge</em> spoke to are completely closed off to the live-service model with the next mainline Animal Crossing game; it just needs to be done in a way that feels respectful to players’ time, money, and attention. Today, even beloved live-service games are regularly criticized by fans for requiring too much time to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteXPMaps/comments/1h45vb0/leveling_up_this_season_so_far_doesnt_seem_so_easy/">level up a battle pass</a> or for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/wa1348/patch_28_has_the_worst_puzzle_designs_in_genshin/">poorly designed events</a>. </p><p>“If Animal Crossing were to consider a live-service approach, I really hope that they would focus on seasonal events and quality-of-life updates,” Borgia says. “I would be nervous to say I hope for continuous new content like furniture and clothing, because that can easily turn into a microtransaction nightmare. I’d love to have more seasonal celebrations, challenges, and temporary NPC visitors.”</p><p>So far, Nintendo has shown a measured approach to live-service games. In the case of <em>Pocket Camp</em>, Nintendo ended up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312047/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-complete-review-microtransactions">rereleasing it as a standalone game</a> free of microtransactions. Now, people who missed the boat on playing <em>Pocket Camp</em> initially and don’t like in-app purchases can still play the same game. </p><p>For the fans we spoke to, this is good enough. Animal Crossing doesn’t need to be some sort of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23583539/back-4-blood-content-updates-expansion-packs-good">never-ending forever game</a> that trudges on like a zombie throughout the years. As Kerr put it, it’s totally fine to have a game start and end, and then get a new one down the line. </p><p>“I would’ve been delighted to see updates like a live service game. [...] But like I said, I’m not bothered if the next Animal Crossing game sustains my interest for a while and then I’m done.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
