It came in third for home console sales during Black Friday week, according to sales data shared on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m7du6uaaec2p">Bluesky</a> from Mat Piscatella of Circana, falling behind only Nintendo’s Switch 2 and Sony’s PlayStation 5. That’s an impressive feat for Nex, and not a great look for Microsoft’s Xbox consoles, which saw two price hikes this year.</p><p>If you missed your chance to pick one up at its 20 percent off sale price, you can do so now through December 14th. <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fplayground-the-active-play-system-for-kids-families-indoor-physical-play-meets-interactive-family-fun%2FJ3Q5RY2VVT" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNex-Playground-Game-System%2F9402952208" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a> are selling it for $199.99.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6NzAwNjA1"><p><span>$<!-- -->199</span></p><div><p>What if the dream of Microsoft’s Kinect lived on? It does in the Nex Playground, an all-in-one, motion-controlled console filled with kid-friendly games. Exhaust and entertain your little ones. You’re welcome.</p></div></div><p>The Nex Playground includes the console itself, a remote for navigating its menus, a power supply and HDMI cable, as well as a magnetic privacy cover that snaps onto the Playground’s camera lens. There are a ton of games that you can download to the Playground — all of which are controlled by moving your body — although the console comes with just five to get you started (Fruit Ninja, Starri, Party Fowl, Go Keeper, and Whack-a-Mole Deluxe are all pretty fun).</p><p>If you want more, including a bunch of licensed games involving Elmo, Bluey, Care Bears, How to Train Your Dragon, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Peppa Pig, you’ll need a Play Pass to access them. New games are added to the catalog every season, and are automatically downloaded to your Playground.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/841831/nex-playground-console-deal-holiday-sale]]></content:encoded>
