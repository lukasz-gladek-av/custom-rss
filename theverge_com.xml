            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/658511/nintendo-switch-20-0-0-update-virtual-game-card-gameshare-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>With just over a month to go before the Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">Switch 2 release date on June 5t</a>h, Nintendo has released a Switch 1 update that will help prepare things for the new console’s arrival. The <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/p/989/c/188#current">V20.0.0 update for the original Switch</a> adds a bunch of new features that go along with the Switch 2, like Home menu buttons for the<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637307/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-card-lending-system"> Virtual Game Card</a> and GameShare features that were announced earlier this month, and a new system transfer feature that can store your data in the cloud until you’re ready to put it on a Switch 2 — just make sure you read the instructions closely before trying it.</p><p>You won’t be able to use the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641334/nintendo">GameShare feature</a> yet, as sharing can only start from a Switch 2 system over local wireless connections — trying to do it between two Switch 1 systems won’t work.</p><p>You can check out the new Virtual Game Cards that collect digital software and DLC for you to “load” and “eject” between two different systems, and lend games to others in your Nintendo Account family group. If you lend a game to someone else, then you can pull it back while they’re online even if they’re currently playing, but if they go offline without returning it or coming back online, you’ll need to wait until the end of the two-week lending period for it to be returned to your library automatically.</p><p>Nintendo’s <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/67891">Virtual Game Card Guide</a> explains all of the ins and outs of the new lending system, like how each Switch can only be connected to one other Switch at a time, how to manage your game cards from the web, and how to hide (or unhide) certain cards.</p><p>To use digital games across more than just two systems or without those restrictions, Nintendo is now relying on the Online License Settings, which are also being added to your Switch 1 in this update. If it’s turned on, it will allow the user to play any of their digitally purchased games and DLC as long as they’re connected to the internet, without relying on virtual game cards.</p><p>But if you’ve already decided to upgrade, then your first stop might be the new option for “System Transfer to Nintendo Switch 2” under the System menu in System Settings. While it can be used for a local system-to-system transfer once your new console arrives, there’s also an option to upload system transfer data to the cloud now, where it will be ready to download to a Switch 2 without requiring access to your old system.</p><p>While that might be good for someone passing their Switch 1 off to someone else, the downside is that it will factory reset your Switch 1, so it’s better to wait if possible, and it will only be stored for a year if not downloaded. Another wrinkle is that it’s possible to set up a Switch 2 cloud transfer, then cancel it and bring your data back to a Switch 1. However, <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68432">as Nintendo’s system transfer FAQ explains</a>, while it doesn’t have to be the same Switch 1 you started with, if it started on a Switch OLED, you will only be able to cancel and reload your data on another Switch OLED.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
