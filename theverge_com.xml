In addition to new features like tools that let developers to target mobile web, the game engine maker is also promising that it will dedicate “long-term” resources to “to enhance feature sets and deliver new functionality while maintaining ease of upgrade and continued stability,” <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241017906915/en/Unity-6-Launches-Globally-Next-Gen-Game-Development-Platform-Delivers-Enhanced-Performance-and-Stability/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-RqSGyeNvWF-qZ8hKEMz48Z5g0wAIXjK73252wRUvTxLWJT50v2g3Ei-19qH0fyPszGrim8IhAkVNXbaI1AGppOzkqEXpa07kut2m9xviGvGKzEpgVj8oZTJfPwAW_-x3g==">according to a press release</a>.</p><p>Unity is a widely-used game development engine powering games like <em>Among Us,</em> <em>Hollow Knight</em>, and many more, but the release of Unity 6 follows a turbulent period in the company’s history. Unity charges developers on a per-user basis, but in September 2023, the company announced a new pricing scheme that charged developers per install of their games after a certain threshold. The change could have potentially added significant costs for developers, and many expressed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/14/23872330/unity-developers-react-new-pricing-model">significant frustrations</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/17/24272699/unity-6-game-engine-release">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTYyMjI=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242937/unity-runtime-fee-cancelled-subscription-pricing">Unity has eliminated its controversial runtime fee</a></h2><div><p><cite>Illustration by Cath Virginia / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p>One year to the day since Unity announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870547/unit-price-change-game-development">its runtime fee pricing model</a>, the software developer <a href="https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee">is canceling that program effective immediately</a>. “After extensive consultation with our games community and customers, we’ve decided to cancel the Runtime Fee,” said Unity CEO Matt Bromberg in the blog post announcing the news. Instead of the runtime fee, Unity will return to a per-seat subscription model.</p><p>Last year, Unity caused a stir within the game development community with a controversial update to its pricing model. Instead of charging developers a set monthly rate based on the number of users utilizing the software, it would implement a pay-per-download scheme that charged developers every time their game was downloaded. That meant instead of paying a flat, predictable rate to Unity, payouts could fluctuate, resulting in potentially higher fees.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242937/unity-runtime-fee-cancelled-subscription-pricing">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MjQ1OTQ=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/17/24180241/major-nelson-larry-hryb-unity-community-xbox">Major Nelson is joining Unity</a></h2><div><p><cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p>Larry Hryb, aka “Major Nelson,” has his next job.
