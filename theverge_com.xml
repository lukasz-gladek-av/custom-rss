A new console means a new generation of games like <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>and the franchise’s next mainline title. But there should also be some major updates for more casual games like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/601656/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-functionality-issues">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23893260/pokemon-sleep-insomnia-app-nintendo-aid">Pokémon Sleep</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615045/niantic-rumored-to-be-discussing-3-5-billion-sale-of-pok">Pokémon Go</a></em>. We’ve already gotten a little (animated) taste of what Nintendo has been cooking up, but there are even more reveals in store, which you can follow along with right here.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article"><div><p>I don’t play Pokémon Café but...</p><p>I kind of want to after seeing this new apple pie drink that puts Starbucks to shame.

During today’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/618678/pokemon-presents-2025-all-the-biggest-news-and-trailers">Pokémon Presents,</a> The Pokémon Company announced that the second season of the stop motion show about a lady and her Psyduck running a more wholesome, pokémon-ified version of The White Lotus Hotel is coming later this year on Netflix. Also, if you haven’t seen the first season, you can catch the first four episodes for free on YouTube right now.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Honda is building the Koraidon motorcycle of your dreams.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>It’s almost pokémon time.</p><p>The annual Pokémon Presents showcase is happening at 9AM ET this morning, and with games like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date">Legends: Z-A</a></em> in the works, not to mention <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">a brand-new Switch on the way</a>, we’re expecting a good showing.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjE4ODg3" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618887/dragonite-and-the-special-delivery-pokemon-day-2025">Kick off Pokémon Day 2025 with this gorgeous short film</a></h2><div><p>It’s technically already Pokémon Day in Japan, and while we’re still a few hours away from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/616289/pokemon-presents">this year’s big Pokémon Presents showcase</a>, there’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pokemon/617216/oh-yes-wait-a-minute-mr-postmon">a new animated short film</a> out that right now feels like the perfect way to get pumped up for whatever surprises Nintendo has in store.</p><p>Many of the Pokémon Company’s animated projects outside of the mainline anime have been fun explorations of what people and their pokémon get up to besides battling. But director Maho Aoki’s <em>Dragonite and the Special Delivery</em> also feels like a reminder to thank your mail carriers for all the hard work they do. Produced by CoMix Wave Films — the studio behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/15/23678724/makoto-shinkai-suzume-interview"><em>Suzume</em></a>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113522/weathering-with-you-review-climate-change-makoto-shinkai">Weathering With You</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/7/15209584/your-name-love">Your Name</a></em> — <em>Dragonite and the Special Delivery </em>tells the story of Hana (Riko Fukumoto), a young Paldean postal worker who dreams of becoming an expert deliveryperson.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618887/dragonite-and-the-special-delivery-pokemon-day-2025">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Oh yes, wait a minute, Mr. Postmon.</p><p>A new trailer for the short — out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFctpiB_Hnlk3ejWfHqSm6Q">on YouTube</a> February 27th 12 AM JST — makes it look like it’s going to be a gorgeous reminder that there’s more to the Pokémon world than battling.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>A pikat the new Pokémon game?</p><p>February 27th is Pokémon Day, which means it’s time to tease us with upcoming pocket monster updates.
