            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>8BitDo has created its first wireless Xbox controller in partnership with Rare, a game studio acquired by Microsoft. The officially licensed controller features a gold and blue design, with plenty of Easter eggs to celebrate Rare’s 40th anniversary.</p><p>The $89.99 8BitDo Ultimate 3-mode Controller for Xbox — Rare 40th Anniversary Edition (yes, that’s the product name!) can connect to an Xbox console via a 2.4GHz wireless connection or a USB-C cable. The wireless connection works through a small USB dongle and not Microsoft’s native Xbox Wireless protocol. You can also use Bluetooth to connect the controller to mobile devices.</p><p>This Rare special edition controller is essentially a wireless version of 8BitDo’s existing Ultimate three-mode controller. 8BitDo is using the same hall effect joysticks and Xbox-style impulse triggers, but there are also two swappable silicone joystick caps included. One is a skull from <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, and the other is a jigsaw puzzle piece that Rare fans will immediately recognize from <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>. The tactile D-pad is made from zinc alloy and matches the controller’s gold aesthetic.</p><p>You’ll also be able to program three profiles on this controller, which includes configuring the two back buttons at the rear. All of the customization can be done using 8BitDo’s Ultimate software that lets you remap buttons, adjust the ranges and motor tensity of triggers, set vibration levels, and customize each stick for more precise control.</p><p>As this controller is wireless, it has a 1,000mAh battery inside, which 8BitDo suggests will deliver 20 hours of playtime. The rechargeable battery takes around 4 hours to fully charge, and there’s even an integrated charging dock included in the box that automatically reconnects the controller once you remove it from the dock.</p><p>It’s surprising to see Rare, an Xbox game studio, turn to 8BitDo to create a 40th anniversary controller instead of Microsoft just creating its own. The collaboration comes as Microsoft’s own custom Xbox Design Lab controller has been on hold for months now. You can still design custom controllers, but Microsoft hasn’t been accepting purchases since last December — with no sign of when Xbox Design Lab will return.</p><p>8BitDo’s Rare 40th anniversary Xbox controller goes on sale today, priced at $89.99.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/717994/8bitdo-wireless-xbox-controller-rare-40th-anniversary-edition]]></content:encoded>
