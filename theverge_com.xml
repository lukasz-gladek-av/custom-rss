Nintendo doesn’t give a specific release date for the console besides “2025.”</p><p>The console looks a lot like the original, but it’s bigger. In the video, the Joy-Con controllers are black with colored accents, and they attach to the side of the console instead of sliding on and off. The Joy-Cons appear to snap on quite easily — leaks have suggested they could be attached via magnets.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Nintendo’s Osborne effect.</p><p>Earnings are out and sales of the Switch console have plummeted after the Switch 2 rumors and announcement, exactly as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect#:~:text=The%20Osborne%20effect%20is%20a,announcing%20a%20future%20product%20prematurely">you’d expect</a>. Switch sales are now projected to hit 11.0 million for the year ending March, down from 12.5 million units forecasted. Nintendo has sold 150.86 million Switch consoles since launch, behind only the Nintendo DS which sold 154.02 million units over its lifetime.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NTc5" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348868/nintendo-switch-2-new-trigger-disconnecting-joy-con-controllers">The Switch 2 has a new trigger for disconnecting Joy-Con controllers</a></h2><div><p>A video on <a rel="sponsored" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fsuccessor%2Fen-us%2Findex.html">Nintendo’s Switch 2 website</a> shows how the trigger (or is it a button?) on the back of the Joy-Con controllers disconnects them from the console, as spotted <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/511597/switch-2-nintendo-joy-con-remove-detach">by <em>Polygon</em></a>.</p><p>In the video, the trigger is pressed down a tad before a final push releases it from the console. As the Joy-Con moves away, you can also see a small cylinder receding back into the top part of the inside of the controller; to me, that indicates that when you push the trigger, you’re actually pushing out that cylinder to help bump the Joy-Con out.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348868/nintendo-switch-2-new-trigger-disconnecting-joy-con-controllers">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MzQ1" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24344718/nintendo-switch-2-specs-date-price-launch-games-mario-kart">All our unanswered questions about the Nintendo Switch 2</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NTkx" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339466/nintendo-switch-2-pc-gaming-handhelds-steamos">The Switch 2 is almost here — but PC handhelds are giving it big competition</a></h2><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p>The first Nintendo Switch basically had the road to itself, and Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">instantly proved</a> just how awesome a hybrid console and handheld could be, leading to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150926/nintendo-expects-switch-to-become-its-best-selling-console-ever-this-year">massive success</a>. We now know that the Switch 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">is set to launch in 2025</a>, but it will be released into a world that’s packed with very capable handheld gaming PCs that could present an interesting challenge to Nintendo, especially following news from CES 2025.</p><p>Valve’s Steam Deck kicked off the handheld gaming PC push in large part because its Linux-based SteamOS makes playing your games just about as easy as it is on consoles. That’s why one of the biggest CES announcements is that Valve is going to let people install SteamOS on other handhelds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck">as soon as April</a>, potentially making the entire handheld PC gaming market a lot more appealing.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339466/nintendo-switch-2-pc-gaming-handhelds-steamos">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NTQ5" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345191/nintendo-switch-2-bigger-screen">The Switch 2’s bigger screen is just what I wanted</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div><div><p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">finally revealed the Switch 2</a> — but it didn’t reveal everything. Even still, the new console looks pretty much like a bigger, more refined Switch. Sure, that’s the straightforward and expected move from Nintendo. But it’s also exactly what I’ve been waiting for.</p><p>The first Switch was a revelation. When it launched, I marveled over being able to play <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> on my TV and then take the console out of the dock and play in handheld mode curled up on the couch. Nintendo absolutely nailed the execution of combining its console and portable expertise into one great device, and ever since, the Switch has been a constant companion at home and while traveling.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345191/nintendo-switch-2-bigger-screen">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjU2" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24344511/nintendo-switch-2-features-specs-handheld-dock-upgrade-comparison">The Switch 2 is boring — and that’s exactly what Nintendo needs</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div><div><p>You can always count on Nintendo for a surprise. This is the company that followed the Game Boy with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24242128/nintendo-ds-touchscreen-games-2004-launch">a strange dual-screened handheld</a> and broke out of its GameCube slump with a console focused on motion controls. It’s the company that lost its lead with the Wii U and then gambled on another innovation — the portable hybrid known as the Switch — to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718273/nintendo-2023-big-moment-mario-zelda">ultimately get back on top</a>. All of those were big, risky swings that seemingly exemplified the company’s playful, experimental ethos.</p><p>The Switch 2, on the other hand, is… <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">a bigger, better Switch</a>. It’s kind of boring. But it’s also exactly the right move from Nintendo. At a time when people expect their games and experiences to carry over between devices, the old console paradigm of starting over with a new generation doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. And since Nintendo hit a home run with the original Switch, it has the runway to be a little bit boring this time.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24344511/nintendo-switch-2-features-specs-handheld-dock-upgrade-comparison">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Whenever the Switch 2 comes out, it’ll have competition from handheld PCs.</p><p>As I wrote <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339466/nintendo-switch-2-pc-gaming-handhelds-steamos">earlier this month</a>, “it will launch into a world that’s packed with very capable handheld gaming PCs that could present an interesting challenge to Nintendo.”</p><p>Yes, the Switch 2 will probably outsell most handheld gaming PCs by a wide margin. But nowadays, Nintendo isn’t the only one offering great handhelds that can also connect to bigger screens.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>The Switch 2’s snap sound is *chef’s kiss*.</p><p>Just listen, starting at <a href="https://youtu.be/itpcsQQvgAQ?feature=shared&amp;t=80">about 1:20 in Nintendo’s video</a>. I am guessing this is amped up for impact, but the sound might be the best part of the whole video.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Here’s our video about the Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>I <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DE44_b_xIY0/">recorded this</a> with a sleeping baby in the next room, so I apologize if my voice sounds a bit quiet. It’s only just past 6AM here on the West Coast — why did Nintendo announce its n<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">ew console</a> so early?</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NzAy" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo">Everything we know about the Switch 2’s Joy-Con controllers</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div><div><p>The arrival of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">the Nintendo Switch 2</a> heralds some much-needed improvements over its predecessor, especially its Joy-Con controllers. Here’s a quick breakdown of what the announcement trailer showed us about the Switch 2’s Joy-Cons.</p><p>Before the official reveal of the console, there were rumors alluding to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld">how the new Joy-Cons would work and their internal mechanisms</a>. The most significant rumor was that they were held to the console via magnets, and in the reveal video, that appears to be the case. The video features the Joy-Con seemingly snapping to a cover as though attracted by a magnetic force.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NzUx" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345091/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-event-schedule">You’ll be able to try out the Switch 2 starting in April</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6Nzcw" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24337198/switch-2-mario-kart-nintendo">Nintendo teases a new Mario Kart for the Switch 2</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MzM4" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24236766/nintendo-switch-2-games-direct-date-time">Nintendo announces Switch 2 Direct for April</a></h2><div><p>Now that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">Nintendo’s reveal of the Switch 2</a> has put to rest years of anticipation and rumormongering, it’s time to hear more information about the console and, importantly, all the games. The company has announced it will hold a Switch 2 Direct scheduled for April 2nd.</p><p>The Switch 2 reveal trailer showed footage that looks to be a new <em>Mario Kart </em>game, which is a good indication it’ll be a launch title. There’s speculation that the forthcoming <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/26/24052049/i-love-this-theory-that-metroid-prime-4-could-be-a-cross-gen-switch-2-launch-title">might straddle both consoles</a> the way <em>Breath of the Wild</em> launched on both the Wii U and the Switch back in 2017. The Switch 2 Direct might also reveal the follow-up to <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276650/nintendo-switch-2-predictions-playtest-alarmo">Who knows</a>?</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24236766/nintendo-switch-2-games-direct-date-time">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6Nzk1" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343666/nintendo-switch-2-cartridge-backwards-compatibility">The Nintendo Switch 2 supports original Switch cartridges</a></h2><div><p><cite>Photo by James Bareham / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p>Nintendo has a new console on the way, but you can still hang onto those old games. The company has confirmed that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">the just-announced Switch 2 device</a> will support cartridges from the original Switch.</p><p>The news shouldn’t be too surprising. Late last year, Nintendo confirmed that the then-unnamed console <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation">would be backward-compatible with the Switch</a>. However, that original statement — “Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch” — wasn’t clear on whether that included physical games as well as digital. Now we know for sure. Additionally, Nintendo Switch Online, which includes a growing library of retro games and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284073/nintendo-music-streaming-app-switch-online-subscribers">other features like a music app</a>, will also carry over between the two devices for subscribers.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343666/nintendo-switch-2-cartridge-backwards-compatibility">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Get ready for the Switch 2 announcement this week.</p><p><em>VGC</em> reports that Nintendo will reveal its new console on Thursday, January 16th. This is according to claims from reliable video game podcaster <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWifbMkXe_4">Nate the Hate</a> and supported by <em>The Verge</em>’s own insider sources.</p><p>We believe the likely sequence of events will be an announcement on January 15th, with the actual reveal taking place the following day, so you better clear up your schedules.</p></div></li></ul></section></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs">sign up for the program now</a>, and EA says that the “first phase” of testing will go live in “the coming weeks” for invited players in Europe and North America.</p><p>As I write this, there’s a long queue to attempt to sign up for Battlefield Labs; there are just under 200,000 people ahead of me and my estimated wait time is “more than an hour.” EA <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1886450457800810928">says that</a> “your position in the registration queue does not affect your chances of being invited,” so if you don’t want to deal with the queue, you might want to wait a bit to try to register.</p><div><p>Battlefield Labs follows other early testing initiatives from EA like its work with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/14/23207209/skate-free-to-play-developers-interview-ea">new <em>Skate</em> game</a> and with the <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/project-rene-playtesting-the-next-generation-of-the-sims">Project Rene game in <em>The Sims</em> franchise</a>.
