Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Fortnite</em> continues to be extremely weird in its new season. The battle royale game is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/25/23844876/fortnite-chapter-4-season-4-last-resort-island-map-battle-pass">returning to a heist theme</a> for Chapter 6: Season 2, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/run-amok-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-6-season-2-lawless">which has been dubbed “Lawless.”</a> Players will be able to break into bank vaults, rob armored cars, and even perform robberies on the train that services the island. Also, there’s a giant pickle that raps.</p><p>After <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/30/24309607/new-chapter-new-island">a Japanese-inspired season</a>, Lawless looks like it’s taking cues from games like <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>. In addition to all of the robbery, there are also a handful of new locations, including an urban locale simply called Crime City. Other new features include: gold water that gives you powers when you swim in it; a fictional crypto currency that you can buy gear with but resets after each match; black markets for buying high-end weapons; a scanner for detecting where enemies are; and a mob boss who apparently likes to show up in the middle of a heist. Also new is the ability to have a specific song playing when you drop onto the map and win a match, as if you were a professional wrestler.</p><p>Here’s how the new season’s map plays out:</p><p>For those who pick up this season’s battle pass, there’s a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite/613378/auto-draft">crew of thematically appropriate criminals</a>, as well as the aforementioned pickle — known as Big Dill — and, for some reason, Sub-Zero from <em>Mortal Kombat</em>. A series of <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> quests will also appear in-game starting March 1st, while outfits of the characters Spike Spiegel and Faye Valentine will appear in the item shop on February 28th.</p><div><p>Lawless runs from today until May 2nd. And while the battle royale updates are always Fortnite’s biggest draw, the game has also been expanding quite a bit in other ways over the last few months. That includes adding <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24340770/fortnite-festival-local-multiplayer">local multiplayer to its music mode</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24315134/fortnite-ballistic-counter-strike-first-person-shooter-fps">a new <em>Counter-Strike</em>-style shooter mode</a>, and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319151/lego-fortnite-epic-games-future-battle-royale-interview">Lego social game inspired by <em>GTA</em> roleplaying</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
