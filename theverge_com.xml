            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282741/xenoblade-chronicles-x-nintendo-switch-release-date-march-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Though we’re mere months away from the reveal of the Switch’s successor, Nintendo still has some unfinished business with its current hardware. Nintendo has announced that <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9862024/xenoblade-chronicles-x">a remaster of Monolith Soft’s 2015 action RPG</a>, will launch on the Switch on March 20, 2025. According to the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241029757838/en/">press release</a>, the remaster features enhanced visuals and added story elements.</p><p>Nintendo released a new trailer to mark the occasion and its opening seconds feel hilariously on the nose. There’s something deeply ironic about the trailer for a Switch port of a ten-year old Wii U game starting with the dialogue, “Well, here we are. Not too shabby, huh?” It’s like a tongue-in-cheek joke acknowledging there’s a wealth of Wii U games in desperate need of salvation (<strong>coughs</strong> <em>Wind Waker</em> <strong>coughs</strong>) and <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> was one of the lucky ones to get a lifeboat off the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/21/22988902/nintendo-wiiu-3ds-eshop-closure-dmca-section-1201">sunken, inaccessible ship that is the Nintendo back catalogue</a>. </p><p>In addition to porting old Wii U games, Nintendo’s still releasing new titles in the twilight days of the Switch. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180608/mario-and-luigi-brothership-release-date-nintendo-direct"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em></a> is due out next week. Nintendo’s also confirmed that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a> will get a Switch release too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24279789/fortnite-espn-football-island-disney<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Disney is releasing an experience tied to <em>Fortnite — </em>but it’s not the big “persistent universe” featuring all things Disney that was teased earlier this year. This new experience launching today is instead all about ESPN, and it’s called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15KQwebh_lw">ESPN Football Island</a>.</p><p>In the experience, you’ll be able to participate in activities, challenges, mini-games, and a big <a href="https://overwatch-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Payload">Payload-style game</a> called “Touchdown Rush” where you guard a football from your opponents as it moves toward an end zone. ESPN Football Island will also have persistent progression and its own unlockable cosmetics that will be exclusive to the experience.</p><p>ESPN Football Island was built using the Unreal Editor for <em>Fortnite </em>(UEFN), a powerful set of development tools Epic launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/22/23645671/fortnite-unreal-editor-epic-games-state-of-gdc-2023-creative">last year</a> to let people make <em>Fortnite</em> experiences. While this ESPN island is a branded Disney experience that’s separate from <em>Fortnite’s</em> main battle royale modes, Disney properties have been a frequent presence within battle royale, including with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/15/24221374/fortnite-marvel-absolute-doctor-doom">latest season’s Marvel theme</a>.</p><p>If you want to try ESPN Football Island yourself, you can access it by entering the code 4481-0077-4190 from the <em>Fortnite</em> menu.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
