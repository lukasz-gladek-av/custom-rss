For the retailer’s midnight openings for the Switch 2 launch, “most stores will have limited inventory of systems, games, and accessories for in-store purchase,” <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo%2Fpcmcat1742407305710.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1742407305710" rel="sponsored">according to its website</a>. </p><p>Most Best Buy stores across the country will be opening up at 12:01AM ET on June 5th for the launch, per the website. (If you’re on the West Coast like me, that means your store will open at 9:01PM PT on June 4th.) People who snagged preorders for in-store pickup can also get their consoles when the stores open. As part of the midnight launch, Best Buy also says that customers will “have the chance to receive a Nintendo collectible.”</p><p>Online preorders last month <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/654571/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-issues-problems">were a total mess to start</a>, but many people had success the old-fashioned way: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/655949/switch-2-in-person-preorder-gamestop">lining up at GameStop</a>. With Best Buy offering its limited in-store stock, lining up ahead of June 5th might be the way to go if you don’t have a preorder in and want to play <em>Mario Kart World</em> on day one.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/665860/valve-steamos-compatibility-system-rating<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Ahead of the release of the Lenovo Legion Go S running SteamOS later this month, Valve has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/532097310616717411">announced a new compatibility rating system</a> for SteamOS devices. As the name implies, the new SteamOS Compatibility system will rate how compatible games are with third-party devices, similar to how Valve already rates the compatibility of games for its own Steam Deck.</p><p>The new rating will only show up on devices running SteamOS that aren’t a Steam Deck and are designed to quickly indicate to users if all of a game’s features and functionality, including any anti-cheat tools it may be using, are fully supported by the OS. Games will be marked as either “SteamOS Compatible” or “SteamOS Unsupported” in the Steam Store and Steam Client.</p><p>The rating “does not include testing results for performance and input, since we will not know (and have not tested) how all titles will run on all potential hardware,” as Valve points out in an announcement shared to its community pages yesterday. But the company expects “over 18,000 titles on Steam to be marked SteamOS compatible out of the gate.”</p><p>Because the new ratings are “automatically generated from Steam Deck verification results without additional testing,” Valve says that developers don’t need to take any additional steps to ensure their games are compatible with third-party SteamOS devices. “If your title already has a Steam Deck Compatibility rating, an automated process will use that data to give it a SteamOS Compatibility rating.”</p><div><p>The Legion Go S will be the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">first handheld gaming PC to trade Windows for SteamOS</a>, the gaming-focused operating system that powers Valve’s Steam Deck.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
