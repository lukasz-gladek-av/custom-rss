He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>On Friday, the YouTube channel Balatro University posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnhNLWKEbSE">a video</a> highlighting how some of their videos had recently been age-restricted after the company tightened its policies <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/623985/youtube-online-gambling-rules-restrictions">about gambling content</a>. But in a post Monday night, YouTube said the restrictions shouldn’t have been applied.</p><p>“Videos featuring <em>Balatro</em> gameplay should not be age-restricted,” YouTube <a href="https://x.com/TeamYouTube/status/1909446185598996790">says in a post on X</a>. We’re reviewing the age-restrictions on these videos and conducting a platform-wide review. Thanks for your patience as we fix!”</p><p>YouTube’s post is a reply to <em>Balatro’s</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/634123/balatro-localthunk-developer-anonymous-update">anonymous developer</a>, LocalThunk, who shared the Balatro University video <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1908620740435280288">Monday afternoon</a>. “Good thing we are protecting children from knowing what a 4 of a kind is and letting them watch [<em>Counter-Strike</em>] case opening videos instead,” <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1908620319381717301">LocalThunk said</a>.</p><p><em>Balatro</em>, a roguelike that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">borrows ideas from poker</a>, doesn’t actually involve gambling. But the game received a PEGI 18 rating in Europe after it launched because it “contains prominent gambling imagery and material that instructs about gambling,” as quoted by publisher Playstack <a href="https://x.com/PlaystackGames/status/1763614758043795909">at the time</a>. LocalThunk also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324626/balatro-localthunk-18-plus-rating-europe-pegi">expressed his displeasure</a> with that rating.</p><p>However, in February, PEGI revised <em>Balatro’s</em> rating <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618342/balatro-pegi-rating-appeal">to PEGI 12</a> following an appeal and said it would “develop a more granular set of classification criteria to handle gambling themes and the simulation, teaching and glamorisation of gambling in different age categories.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Last week, the company delayed preorders <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">in the US</a> because of the potential impact of the Trump administration’s new tariffs.</p><p>“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in Canada will not start on April 9, 2025 in order to align with the timing of preorders to be determined in the US,” Nintendo of Canada said to <em>MobileSyrup</em>. “Nintendo will provide updated information at a later date.
