            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/627006/infinity-nikki-interactive-map-update-infold-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The developers of <em>Infinity Nikki</em> have finally solved one of the game’s biggest problems: where the hell is everything? Piggybacking off similar efforts in other gacha games like <em>Genshin Impact</em>, the developers at Infold Games have created an interactive map that’ll guide you to all the bits and bobs littered throughout the game’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/14/24320757/infinity-nikki-review-gacha-dress-up-game">impressively expansive world</a>.</p><p>Because <em>Infinity Nikki</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/605811/infinity-nikki-gacha-mechanics">is a gacha game</a>, there are fifty ‘leven different kinds of <em>things</em> to collect and trade for resources, currencies, and clothes. You can map some of the collectibles in <em>Infinity Nikki </em>to the ones in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and it works out pretty well. Some of them are easier to find than others. The whimstars are like spirit orbs you earn from shrines and they’re pretty easy to find as the game has a built-in system to help you locate them. The dews of inspiration are like korok seeds; there’s ten and a half million of them and your best chance of finding them is through sheer luck and determination – i.e. impossible. </p><p>It kinda sucks that they’re so hard to find because dews can be exchanged for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619372/infinity-nikki-eerie-season-event-march-2025">really cool outfits</a> that can help out if you’re stuck in one of the styling boss battles. The <em>Infinity Nikki</em> community has clamored for the developers to put a tracking system for them in the game similar to the way your bi-pedal cat companion Momo can guide you to nearby whimstars. The developers have fulfilled other community wishes like expanding the number of outfit slots from four to seven (thanks!) and now they’ve answered this ask in a big way.</p><p>Visiting <a href="https://pearpal.infoldgames.com/en/home">this site</a> will grant access to an interactive map whereby you can finally locate all those damnable dews of inspiration. If you use your <em>Infinity Nikki</em> log in information, the map will be personalized to show what items you’ve picked up and what you’re still missing. Best yet, this map can be used for literally everything – missing treasure chests, secret clothing vendors, hidden caves, and more. It’s not as convenient as an in-game map would be but it updates in real time to make checking things off your list a little easier.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/626952/sony-fsr-4-upscaler-coming-to-ps5-pro-reimplementation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Today, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">the $700 PlayStation 5 Pro</a> can already produce crisper, sharper, smoother, and more stable graphics than a PS5, if you sit close enough to appreciate them. But starting in 2026, the company hopes to imbue games with a new AI upscaling formula that’ll make them even crisper, based on the AMD FSR 4 technique that’s now shipping with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/624423/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review-benchmarks-price">AMD’s new RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards</a> and appears to be competitive against Nvidia’s latest DLSS as well.</p><p>“Our target is to have something very similar to FSR 4’s upscaler available on PS5 Pro for 2026 titles as the next evolution of PSSR,” PlayStation lead architect Mark Cerny <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-mark-cerny-fsr-4-to-play-a-key-part-in-the-next-evolution-of-pssr-upscaling">tells <em>Digital Foundry</em></a>.</p><p>Many new PS5 Pro games already use an AI upscaler called “PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution” (PSSR) on their AMD-based chips. PSSR can turn 720p images into 4K ones on the fly while adding extra particle effects, and we’ve been relatively impressed by its quality compared to, say, FSR 3.</p><p>But Sony and AMD’s relationship didn’t stop there — it turns out that the neural network that underpins AMD’s new FSR 4 upscaler was part of a collaboration with Sony, too, and Sony now plans to backport some of that work to its flagship PlayStation.</p><p>In December, Sony and AMD announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324317/amd-playstation-ai-work-better-graphics-project-amethyst">a multiyear collaboration called Project Amethyst</a>, one that we’re now learning actually began back in 2023, and Cerny tells <em>Digital Foundry</em> that FSR 4 was the first fruit of those labors. “The neural network (and training recipe) in FSR 4’s upscaler are the first results of the Amethyst collaboration,” he says, calling it “a more advanced approach that can exceed the crispness of PSSR.”</p><p>For now, though, Cerny says it’s still encouraging developers to use PSSR, as it will take time to “reimplement” FSR 4’s upscaling network into the PS5 Pro and its games.</p><p>Cerny suggests that Sony will have “its own implementations” of each algorithm it develops with AMD from here on out. He also hints Project Amethyst may be about more than home consoles, though: “Now to be clear, this technology has uses beyond PlayStation, and it’s about supporting broad work in machine learning across a variety of devices – the biggest win is when developers can freely move their code from device to device,” he tells <em>Digital Foundry.</em></p><p>You can watch <em>Digital Foundry</em>’s comparison of FSR 4, and its deep dive on PSSR, below.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
