He joined in 2018, and after a stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Corsair wasn’t joking around when it named the new $99.99 Sabre V2 Pro Ultralight Wireless gaming mouse. At 36 grams, it weighs just a bit more than seven US nickels. Is that <em>too </em>light? Maybe. Most of Corsair’s competitors haven’t shipped a mouse much below 50 grams (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/757680/sony-inzone-pc-gaming-headset-keyboard-mouse-hands-on">Sony’s new Inzone mouse</a> is 48 grams). I could flick it across my desk with relative ease, and that’s the point of lightweight mice. The Sabre V2 Pro is made to be easy to move so players can more quickly react in fast-paced games.</p><p>Even so, it doesn’t seem like Corsair cut too many corners to reduce the weight. The company claims its tiny 210mAh battery can last up to 70 hours per charge over a 2.4GHz wireless connection with its default 1,000Hz polling rate. The Sabre V2 Pro also supports 8,000Hz polling, letting your PC register a movement or input at 0.125ms, but battery life will dive to just 16 hours per charge in that mode. Peripheral makers love to brag about 8,000Hz polling, but most people’s reaction speeds aren’t anywhere close to sub-millisecond sensitivity, so you can probably save your battery.</p><p>The Sabre V2 Pro has a symmetrical shape, but is built for right-handed for PC gamers, with two thumb buttons on its left side. Corsair includes grip tape that can be applied to the main buttons and to the sides to customize how it feels to hold.</p><p>Tweaking this mouse’s DPI, macros, and other settings won’t require a software installation. Corsair is launching a browser-based configurator for the Sabre V2 Pro. This is slowly becoming the norm with PC gaming accessories geared toward pros. Allowing access to settings via a browser makes it easy to quickly make adjustments from any internet-connected PC, which makes them more useful during tournament play.</p><p>The Sabre V2 Pro is available now in black or white.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/776782/corsair-sabre-v2-pro-ultralight-gaming-mouse-weight-specs-price#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/776782/corsair-sabre-v2-pro-ultralight-gaming-mouse-weight-specs-price]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Epic is continuing its attempts to turn <em>Fortnite</em> into a platform that’s bigger than just battle royale — this time by giving creators the ability to make and sell in-game items. <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-developers-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items?lang=en-US">Starting in December</a>, <em>Fortnite</em> creators will be able to sell items directly from the islands they’ve built, using new tools that will be launching later on.</p><p>The benefit, of course, is that creators on the platform will have a new revenue stream (currently, they earn revenue primarily based on engagement numbers). And Epic says that they’ll normally earn “50 percent of the V-Bucks value from sales in their islands,” though through 2026 that number will temporarily be at 100 percent presumably to encourage developers to take part. As for what “V-Bucks value” entails, well, it’s a complicated calculation.</p><p>Here’s Epic’s explanation:</p><div><blockquote><p>To determine the V-Bucks value in US dollars in a given month, we take all customer real-money spending to purchase V-Bucks (converted to US Dollars), subtract platform and store fees (ranging from 12 percent on Epic Games Store to 30 percent on current consoles), and divide it by the total V-Bucks spent by players. Fortnite’s average platform and store fees are currently 26 percent (with specific fees ranging from 12 percent on the Epic Games Store to 30 percent on console platforms). So, 50 percent of V-Bucks value translates to ~37 percent of retail spending, and 100 percent of V-Bucks value translates to ~74 percent.</p></blockquote></div><p>In terms of actually creating these items, Epic says that creators will be able to utilize “a Verse-based API and new UEFN tools to create and offer purchasable durable items and consumable items in their games,” and that details are coming “soon.”</p><p>Meanwhile, in November Epic will be adding a “sponsored” row to <em>Fortnite</em>’s discover feed, which will let creators spend money for increased visibility for their islands. Also coming is a community tool that will let creators speak more directly to players for sharing updates and soliciting feedback.</p><p>Notably, Epic says that it will be taking a cut of both the sponsored row and user-created item sales because it has been “operating the business at a loss.” The developer explains that “This model will enable Epic to cover the costs of servicing the <em>Fortnite</em> ecosystem. The funds that don’t go back to creators contribute to server hosting costs, safety and moderation costs, R&amp;D and other operating expenses.”</p><div><p>Today’s announcement is just the latest in a string of updates meant to expand <em>Fortnite</em> from a single, massively popular shooter to a platform for games, much like Roblox. Things really kicked off at the end of 2023 with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic">the launch of Epic-made games like <em>Lego Fortnite</em> and <em>Fortnite Festival</em></a>, and since then the developer has added new creators tools like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24258447/fortnite-creators-first-person-shooters-fps-unreal-editor">the ability to make first-person shooters</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite/679077/epic-games-fortnite-creators-ai-npcs-darth-vader">the introduction of AI characters</a>.</p></div><p>At the beginning of the year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349588/epic-paid-fortnite-creators-a-total-of-352m-in-2024">Epic said that it had paid out $352 million to creators in 2024</a>, with user-made games accounting for more than 36 percent of time spent in <em>Fortnite</em>. Today the company said that it had paid out a total of $722 million to date.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/780819/fortnite-creators-sell-items#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/780819/fortnite-creators-sell-items]]></content:encoded>

Valve will continue to support 64-bit versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11 with Steam, but <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/49A1-B944-48B8-FF00">on January 1st 2026</a> it’s game over for 32-bit versions of Windows.</p><p>Windows 10 is the only 32-bit version of Windows that’s still currently supported by Steam. Microsoft is about to end of support for Windows 10 next month, but Valve will continue to support 64-bit versions of the OS. You’ll also still be able to play 32-bit games through Steam, just not install the Steam app on a 32-bit version of Windows.</p><p>The irony here is that the current version of Steam is a 32-bit app on all versions of Windows right now, but that appears to be changing soon. “Future versions of Steam will run on 64-bit versions of Windows only,” warns Valve in a support note. “This change is required as core features in Steam rely on system drivers and other libraries that are not supported on 32-bit versions of Windows.”</p><p>The move away from 32-bit versions of Windows won’t affect too many Steam users, though. Valve says the 32-bit version of Windows 10 is only used by 0.01 percent of all systems reported through its Steam Hardware Survey.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/780806/valve-steam-32-bit-windows-support-end#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/780806/valve-steam-32-bit-windows-support-end]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Seven indie games that will upgrade your downtime this fall]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/774447/upgrade-downtime-indie-games-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seven-indie-games-that-will-upgrade-your-downtime-this-fall.1301289/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>We all know there’s a lot of tech to potentially upgrade in your life, but for those who want to upgrade their downtime with inexpensive, relatively short video games, I have good news. 2025 has already featured a wealth of excellent titles to spend your time with, including ones from smaller and independent developers that you can complete in a few sessions. If you’re looking for a good new game to play (and aren’t already deep into <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/769489/hollow-knight-silksong-news-updates">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a></em>), here are some great options from this year.</p><p>This new take on the classic side-scrolling versions of <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> from Dotemu and The Game Kitchen has gorgeous pixel art, tight platforming, thrilling combat, and a soundtrack that feels ripped straight from a cheesy action movie. The game can be pretty tough, which is fitting given its lineage, but there are Assist Mode features for those who want to make things a bit easier. It hits all the right notes for a great retro action game, yet it still feels very modern.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Poti Poti Studio / Wholesome Games Presents</cite></p></div><p>If a chill puzzle game is more of what you’re hankering for, <em>Is This Seat Taken?</em> should fit the bill. In the game, you’re tasked with finding the right seats for adorable little shape people while taking into account their various needs. Some may request to sit near a window, or to be far away from a stinky person. It’s all very relaxing and charming, and there’s no time limit or major penalty for not seating everyone exactly as they want. When you do find the right seats for everyone, it’s extremely satisfying.</p><p><em>The Drifter</em> has all the hallmarks of an old-school point-and-click adventure game, like beautiful pixel art, many interesting people to talk to, and lots of items to experiment with. But unlike goofier stalwarts, such as the <em>Monkey Island</em> series, <em>The Drifter</em> uses the genre to tell a gripping thriller story. It’s a refreshing take on a classic genre, and like a great novel, I couldn’t put it down.</p><p><em>Rift of the NecroDancer</em> is a <em>Guitar Hero</em>-like music game that’s <em>packed</em> with excellent original music, including some catchy remixes of tunes from the hit roguelike <em>Crypt of the NecroDancer</em>. I was a huge fan of <em>Rift</em>’s story mode, which uses a lightweight narrative to introduce you to the more than 30 songs in the game. There are also silly rhythm-based minigames and epic bosses. It’s foot-tapping fun, and if you’re like me, you’ll be humming the songs long after you put the game down.</p><p>Toby Fox’s parallel story to the indie classic <em>Undertale</em> has been in development for years and still isn’t finished. But even with four of seven planned chapters available to play right now, it feels like a complete experience. <em>Deltarune</em> is packed with just as much humor and oddities as <em>Undertale</em>, and the battles that blend RPG and bullet hell mechanics are just as entertaining to figure out in the in-development game. <em>Deltarune</em> is the longest game on this list — it took me about 15 hours to get through all four chapters that are out now — but every minute is worth your time.</p><p><em>Despelote</em>, set in Ecuador in 2001, puts you in the shoes of a soccer-obsessed kid who’s swept up in the excitement of Ecuador competing to qualify for the World Cup. It features a stunning art style that puts black-and-white characters in an oversaturated world, and according to my colleague Andrew Webster, you can finish the game in about two hours. He called it a “picture-perfect portrait of childhood obsession,” so if you’re looking for a game that might make you feel a bit nostalgic — even if you didn’t grow up being into soccer — this might be one to check out.</p><p>Sometimes, you just want a game that encourages you to turn off part of your brain, and <em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em> can do just that. The game gives you basic tools that you can level up to dig, dig, dig your way down. There isn’t some late-game twist that breaks the fourth wall. You dig a hole, monitor your remaining health and power levels, mine valuable treasures, and reemerge to upgrade your gear so you can go even deeper. It’s mesmerizingly simple, and a good game to check out if you’re exhausted by games with upgrade trees and endless quests.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/774447/upgrade-downtime-indie-games-2025#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/774447/upgrade-downtime-indie-games-2025]]></content:encoded>
