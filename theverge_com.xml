Bloober Team announced that it will <a href="https://blooberteam.prowly.com/383560-bloober-team-and-konami-continue-their-collaboration">continue its partnership</a> with the Japanese publisher on a new project.</p><p>“The trust built upon the success of <em>Silent Hill 2</em> laid the foundation for signing another agreement for a new project,” the announcement read. And while the new project will be based on Konami’s IP, the two companies did not share if the next game will be another <em>Silent Hill</em> or something else from Konami’s back catalog. (Hey, just thinkin’ out loud here, but when was the last <em>Castlevania</em> game released? <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/2/25/5444178/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-2-review-bad-blood">2014</a>? Oh, okay.)</p><p>Konami and Bloober Team <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/19/23412671/silent-hill-2-remake-f-townfall-konami-bloober-team">paired up in 2022</a> when the companies announced they would be collaborating on a remake of<em> Silent Hill 2</em>. Due to lukewarm reviews of Bloober’s original horror game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251159/the-medium-game-review-xbox-series-x-pc"><em>The Medium</em></a>, there was skepticism that the studio would be able to pull off a remake of one of the most celebrated survival horror games of its time. But <em>Silent Hill 2</em> launched to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/26/24279276/survival-horror-silent-hill-2-fear-the-spotlight">rave</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/460647/silent-hill-2-sh2-remake-review-ps5-pc">reviews</a> and sales, making it the fastest-selling entry in the <em>Silent Hill</em> series. </p><p>Beyond Bloober Team, Konami is also working on a new, non-remake <em>Silent Hill</em> game called <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23413471/silent-hill-f-announcement-trailer-konami">Silent Hill F</a> </em>that it debuted in 2022 but has provided scant updates about since then. There’s also a movie adaptation of <em>Silent Hill 2</em> in the works, with Christophe Gans, the director of the first (not great!) <em>Silent Hill </em>movie, tapped to direct.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
