            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350382/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-doom-ninja-gaiden-trailers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Though Nintendo can technically claim it had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">the first big gaming news event of the year</a>, at least <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24338314/microsoft-xbox-event-developer-direct-date-2025">Xbox’s Developer Direct</a> actually showed off some games <em>and</em> let us know when we can play them. The showcase was anchored by deep dives into the biggest games coming down the green pipe like <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> and Compulsion Games’ <em>South of Midnight</em>, with a couple of surprises to fill out the nearly one-hour-long runtime. Here are the highlights from the show.</p><p><h3><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></h3></p><p>Xbox kicked off the Direct with the surprise reveal of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350352/ninja-gaiden-4-xbox"><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></a>. The game is being codeveloped by Koei Tecmo’s Team Ninja and <em>Bayonetta </em>studio PlatinumGames. <em>Ninja Gaiden 4 </em>revives the series’ bloody, fast-paced combat and high-stakes (but often frustrating) platforming with a new face, the ninja Yakumo. Yakumo will use his unique fighting styles to defeat the Divine Dragon Order that’s turned Tokyo into a dystopian, crumbling mess. <em>Gaiden</em>’s former protagonist, Ryu Hayabusa, will also make an appearance as a playable character and Yakumo’s rival.</p><p><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> will launch in the fall of this year, but if you don’t want to wait for your bloody ninja action, you don’t have to. Xbox stealth dropped <a href="https://youtu.be/MFjWCZIVZDw?si=Dw16HKjd1MRHKDhp"><em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</em></a>, a remake of <em>Ninja Gaiden II</em>, and it’s available right now on Xbox and Game Pass.</p><p><h3><em>South of Midnight</em></h3></p><p>The developers at Compulsion Games went into detail about <em>South of Midnight</em>’s gameplay and story. You play as Hazel who must use her powers as a Weaver, fighting monsters and traversing the haunted landscape, to rescue her mother who gets swept away in a hurricane. With this, everything I’ve seen about <em>South of Midnight</em> makes it seem like it’ll be one of my games of the year. It’s got a Black protagonist, features characters and tropes that harken to Southern gothic folklore, and its stop-motion art style makes it immediately stand out. I cannot wait to get my hands on this game when it releases on April 8th.</p><p><h3><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></h3></p><p>Sandfall Interactive was founded in Montpellier, France, in 2020 with a team led by former Ubisoft developers. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is the studio’s first game — a turn-based RPG with a compelling narrative hook. The world has been ravaged by a being known as the Paintress. Every year, she writes down a number, and everyone older than that number disappears. Expeditions are sent out to stop the Paintress, and the game will follow Expedition 33 in their attempt to save humanity. In addition to an interesting <em>Persona 5</em>-style take on turn-based combat, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271773/dream-rpg-voice-cast-rotation"><em>Expedition 33</em> features some serious voice acting talent</a>, starring Charlie Cox, Jennifer English, Ben Starr, and Andy Serkis. Can’t wait to hear them perform when <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> launches on April 24th.</p><p><h3><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></h3></p><p>To close out the Direct, Xbox gave us another look at <em>Doom: The Dark Ages,</em> the prequel to id Software’s 2016 <em>Doom</em> reboot and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186572/doom-eternal-review-xbox-ps4-pc-stadia-date-battlegrounds"><em>Doom Eternal</em></a>. It will, of course, feature all the ripping and tearing a <em>Doom </em>enjoyer could want, along with an interesting focus on narrative — something the series isn’t really known for. But I suspect folks are far more interested in piloting a 30-story Doomguy-shaped mech suit <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349379/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-xbox-pc-ps5">when the game releases on May 15th</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
