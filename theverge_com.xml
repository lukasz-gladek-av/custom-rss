The streaming platform has shared some of its viewership stats from last year with <em>GTA V</em> capturing over 1 billion hours watched.</p><p>Here’s an infographic breaking some of the stats down:</p><p>Twitch also revealed insights into viewer habits and tastes including who people like to watch in addition to what. In 2024, the most watched streamer list was dominated by the usual suspects: xQc, Kai Cenat, Pokimane, and HasanAbi to name a few. But V-Tubers, streamers who use an animated persona as their avatar instead of their real face, saw a 10 percent increase in viewership over last year with viewers watching over a billion hours of V-Tuber streams. </p><p>Rockstar’s foundational action game wasn’t last year’s only big winner as <em>League of Legends</em> also racked up over 1 billion hours watched. Competitive shooters rounded out the top of the most popular games watched list. The top three games in that category were <em>Call of Duty</em> with 451 million hours watched, <em>Fortnite</em> with over 500 million hours watched, and <em>Valorant</em> topping the competition with 804 million hours watched.</p><p>But those numbers, while impressive, fall short of <em>GTA V</em>’s staggering 1.4 billion hours watched — a solid indication that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23987993/gta-6-news-trailers-rockstar-games">the inevitable launch of <em>GTA VI</em> later this year</a> will be, simply put, friggin’ huge.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
