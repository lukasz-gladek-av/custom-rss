            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24325371/2024s-best-games-classic-genres-astro-bot-balatro-metaphor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>In 2024, we gamed like it was 1997. Games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2023/12/7/23992947/metaphor-refantazio-looks-sick"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24237166/astro-bots-roll-out"><em>Astro Bot</em></a>, and the solo-developed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame"><em>Balatro</em></a> remixed genres of console generations past (or, in <em>Balatro</em>’s case, remixed the very old game of poker itself) to critical and commercial success, while Capcom was one of the most successful companies of the year supported by a healthy mix of titles across different genres. With the industry’s biggest publishers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172733/summer-game-fest-video-game-announcements-layoffs-labor-live-service-fortnite">increasingly chasing massive, broadly appealing games meant to be played forever</a>, it was heartening to see old formats come back with some new tricks. And these successes could provide the blueprint needed to pull the video game industry out of its current tailspin.</p><p><em>Persona</em> developer Atlus has once again innovated on the turn-based RPG with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a>. What makes <em>Metaphor</em>’s combat interesting in a way that’s hard to replicate with traditional turn-based RPGs is that Atlus has built a unique ability system powered by anticipation and anxiety. Characters have access to powerful summons, each with their own abilities, along with strengths and weaknesses that enemies also share. Hitting an enemy’s weakness or having your own exploited results in monumental shifts in the momentum of battle. Every attack becomes consequential, as you don’t know what will work against your foes or what they have to work against you.</p><div><p>Atlus has built a unique ability system powered by anticipation and anxiety.</p></div><p>Despite dominating with games like <em>Final Fantasy</em> in the late ’80s and through the ’90s, turn-based RPGs have largely been left behind. (With <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24297436/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">the notable exception of the <em>Dragon Quest </em>series</a>, which consistently sells beaucoup copies in Japan.) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/23/23180709/final-fantasy-16-eikons-naoki-yoshida-interview">Modern tastes</a> have evolved to prefer the active, frenetic, and combo-dependent combat of the action RPG over the passive, implied action of turn-based games. But through the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23553499/persona-p3-p4-review-switch-ps4-xbox"><em>Persona</em> series</a>, and now with <em>Metaphor</em>, Atlus has proven it is uniquely equipped to make turn-based RPGs feel just as kinetic and engaging as their action-based cousins.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24256010/how-to-play-balatro-mobile-localthunk-playstack">The poker roguelike <em>Balatro</em></a> is perhaps the game that best represents the success that can be had by melding old genres with new features. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc">Roguelikes can be a difficult sell</a>, especially to players unfamiliar with the genre. To get them to stick, players not only have to be okay with the idea of failure as progression but also have to be invested enough in the game’s wider world to want to keep playing through it multiple times. For every <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159911/hades-best-game-2020-nintendo-switch-supergiant-pc"><em>Hades</em></a>, there are hundreds of games on digital storefronts that blur together into smears of generic fantasy dungeon crawlers.&nbsp;</p><div><p>[Balatro is] catnip for the players who can’t resist “number go up.” </p></div><p>One of the reasons<em> Balatro</em> became an instant success was because it didn’t have that hurdle. Poker is known all over the world and hasn’t really changed much in the centuries since its invention.<em> Balatro</em> took advantage of that familiarity and combined it with great humor and an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24085031/balatro-jokers-break-the-game">ingenious progression system</a> that made it catnip for the players who can’t resist “number go up.” More than that, <em>Balatro</em> feels more permissive than its roguelike cousins. The best runs in <em>Hades</em> are typically the result of lucking into specific boons or items, whereas <em>Balatro</em> is lousy with jokers, card modifiers, perks, and more that make scores get stupid fast. <em>Balatro</em> took home a slew of Game Awards, and it probably would have won Game of the Year if not for that one meddling robot.</p><p>Speaking of… perhaps the biggest example of 2024’s Return trend is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year"><em>Astro Bot</em></a>. Developed by Team Asobi, <em>Astro Bot</em> is a full-sized, standalone expansion of the PS5 pack-in game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549072/astros-playroom-ps5-review-dualsense-controller"><em>Astro’s Playroom</em></a> that takes the little robot’s adventures beyond the confines of the PS5 console and into the wider universe. At its core, though, <em>Astro Bot is </em>a mascot platformer reminiscent of the games from PlayStation’s earliest days like <em>Crash Bandicoot </em>and <em>Spyro the Dragon</em>. Indeed, <em>Astro Bot</em> pays homage to those very characters, featuring them as robots to rescue along with other characters from PlayStation’s 30-year history.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Astro Bot </em>is stuffed with so many items and secrets to collect. That kind of mechanic can get tedious in games suited to “modern” tastes like <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, as finding things feels no better than ticking off a box in the slow march to 100 percent completion. But each of Astro’s powers — like the dog jetpack or the shrinking mouse — inject whimsy into the act of collecting.&nbsp;And when I do find a secret, I’m rewarded with a little celebration of cheering bots that somehow never gets old.</p><p>Mascot platformers fell out of favor, especially with PlayStation studios, despite initial success. Naughty Dog and Sucker Punch have transitioned away from the lightheartedness of Crash Bandicoot and Sly Cooper to make “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035730/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-review-ps5">serious</a>” games for “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/21323144/ghost-of-tsushima-review-ps4-game-developer-samurai">mature</a>” audiences, and PlayStation’s recent catalog reflects that overall trend. <em>Astro Bot</em> is an outlier in form and tone and parlayed that uniqueness into a shower of accolades. It would be such a missed opportunity if Sony didn’t respond to that success with similar projects.</p><div><p>When I do find a secret, I’m rewarded with a little celebration of cheering bots that somehow never gets old.</p></div><p>Over the last two years, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163110/embracer-laid-off-more-employees-than-riot-games-entire-workforce">prolific layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">studio closures</a> have left tens of thousands of developers unemployed, in large part because companies <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/18/23311082/embracer-group-acquisition-lord-of-the-rings-hobbit-limited-run-games-tripwire">spent too much money</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized">on getting bigger</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">developing huge</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/02/10/skull-and-bones-is-a-70-game-because-its-quadruple-a-says-ubisoft/">expensive games</a> that may have made sense years ago but no longer do. Companies dumped hundreds of millions of dollars and considerable development resources into the next live-service shooter in hopes of replicating <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Call of Duty</em>’s runaway success and profits. But as those games continue to top the monthly video game spending charts, refreshed by a steady cadence of new content, the idea that a newcomer like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312584/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-refunds"><em>XDefiant</em> could compete at that same level</a> becomes increasingly remote. This leaves studios with an expensive product nobody wants to play, along with a pipeline of upcoming games too sparse to make up the difference.</p><p>But the way out of this precipitous (and avoidable) decline doesn’t necessarily mean giving up on the big multiplayer or open-world projects. Capcom, for example, has proven that “por qué no los dos” can be a winning strategy. The company has boasted record profits <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/capcom-hits-new-record-for-sales-and-profits-in-2023-2024-financials"><em>the last seven years</em></a> with a diverse catalog composed of heavy hitters like <em>Monster Hunter</em>, <em>Resident Evil</em> remakes, and <em>Street Fighter, </em>along with smaller, weirder games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23979909/dragons-dogma-2-release-date-trailer-capcom"><em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24202033/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-review-capcom"><em>Kunitsu-gami: Path of The Goddess</em></a>. Contrast that with Square Enix <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/square-enix-president-bemoans-weak-final-fantasy-sales-and-says-his-restructure-is-existential-our-winning-formula-is-no-longer-effective/">reporting less-than-expected profits</a> after it <a href="https://kotaku.com/foamstars-servers-ending-free-ps5-square-enix-concord-1851714395">failed</a><em> </em>to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/16/24040124/square-enix-foamstars-ai-art-midjourney">make<em> Foamstars</em> happen</a> on top of releasing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23767669/final-fantasy-xvi-review-ps5">three</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24079544/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5">different</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24030282/final-fantasy-14-new-class-pictomancer-ffxiv-fan-fest-tokyo">AAA <em>Final Fantasy </em>titles</a> in a 12-month period. Capcom has the right idea <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e241213.html">and is doubling down on it</a>, stating that it plans on “re-activating dormant IPs that haven’t had a new title launch recently” after revealing new entries in its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320133/okami-2-announce-game-awards"><em>Okami</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320142/onimusha-is-back-and-very-bloody"><em>Onimusha</em></a> series.</p><p>But more than just appealing to gamer nostalgia, these success stories — which also extend to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24153478/crow-country-review-steam-ps5-xbox">survival horror</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035933/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-ubisoft">Metroidvanias</a> — offer a healthier alternative to the trends the big publishers and studios are pursuing. (Nintendo, of course, is always exempt from these generalizations.) While there will always be an appetite for big online shooters or bespoke open-world games with hours of Hollywood-acted voice and motion performance, these breakout releases of 2024 prove (or should at least remind decision-makers) that there is so much worth to also be found in smaller, quirkier, and most importantly, cheaper projects. If the big publishers want to staunch the bleeding of the last two miserable years, they could take the lessons Capcom, <em>Balatro</em>, <em>Metaphor,</em> and <em>Astro Bot </em>provide.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/27/24326278/nintendo-fake-takedowns-youtube-domtendo-dmca<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In late September, Dominik “Domtendo” Neumayer received a troubling email. He had just featured <em>The</em> <em>Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> in a series of videos on his YouTube channel. Now, those videos were gone.&nbsp;</p><p>“Some of your videos have been removed,” YouTube explained matter-of-factly. The email said that Domtendo had now received a pair of copyright strikes. He was now just one copyright strike away from losing his 17-year-old channel and the over 1.5 million subscribers he’d built up.&nbsp;</p><p>At least, he would have been, if Domtendo hadn’t spotted something fishy about the takedown notice —&nbsp;something YouTube had missed.&nbsp;</p><p>Domtendo had been a little bit confused right from the start;<strong> </strong>the strikes didn’t make sense. Like countless other creators, Domtendo specializes in “Let’s Play” videos, a well-established genre where streamers play through the entirety of a game on camera.</p><div><p>“The next copyright strike will close your channel”</p></div><p>Nintendo has a complicated relationship with the fans who use its copyrighted works, infamously shutting down all sorts of unauthorized projects by sending cease-and-desists. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">It has gone after YouTubers</a>, too. But both the Japanese gaming giant and the broader gaming industry typically leave Let’s Plays alone, because they serve as free marketing for their games.</p><p>And yet, YouTube had received a legit-looking request apparently justifying these takedowns under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), signed “Tatsumi Masaaki, Nintendo Legal Department, Nintendo of America.”</p><p>It was in a second email from YouTube that Domtendo spotted something off. The takedown requests came from a <em>personal</em> account at an encrypted email service: “tatsumi-masaaki@protonmail.com”.</p><div><figcaption><em>YouTube took action on Domtendo’s videos, even though the requests cited a personal email address.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Domtendo</cite></p></div><p>Fake takedowns are real. <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/youtube-copyright/summary?hl=en">YouTube says</a> over six percent of takedown requests through its public webform are likely fake, and the company accepts requests via plain email too, meaning anyone can file them. Fighting fake takedowns can cost creators time, money, and stress. But creators can’t easily be sure that a takedown is fake — and they can lose their entire channel if they get it wrong and clash with a company that has a legitimate copyright claim.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">When the well-respected Retro Game Corps</a> received his second Nintendo copyright strike, he publicly declared he would self-censor all his future work to hopefully escape the company’s wrath. But first, he checked that Nintendo’s threat was real. He checked to see who YouTube listed as the complaining party, and that it came from a Nintendo email address. Then he checked with his YouTube Partner Manager to be extra safe.</p><div><p>Rumors of fake Nintendo takedowns have swirled in the past. Earlier this year, <em>Garry’s Mod </em>developer Garry Newman removed<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/25/24140246/garrys-mod-nintendo-copyright-takedowns-dmca"> 20 years’ worth of Nintendo-related fan content from his sandbox video game</a> over takedown threats. Fans speculated that it may actually have been someone posing as a Nintendo lawyer. But Newman eventually revealed <a href="https://garry.net/posts/aaron-peters">Nintendo was legitimately behind those takedowns</a> despite using seemingly suspicious names and emails.</p></div><p>Domtendo thought he might have an actual case of a Nintendo faker. So he decided to push back. At first, it seemed to work. He emailed YouTube, and it soon reinstated his videos. But Tatsumi was back the next day —&nbsp;this time, emailing Domtendo directly.&nbsp;</p><p>“Dear Domtendo, I represent Nintendo of America Inc. (“Nintendo”) in intellectual property matters,” the first email began. After a bunch of legalese, Tatsumi eventually explains why he’s reaching out: “I submitted a notice through YouTube’s legal copyright system, but the infringing content still appears.”</p><p>He wouldn’t let it go.&nbsp;</p><p>Domtendo wasn’t about to risk his livelihood just in case Tatsumi was real. He got spooked, and began voluntarily pulling his videos off YouTube. But his new pen pal just kept asking for more removals. Tatsumi reached out day after day, sometimes multiple times a day, according to emails shared with <em>The Verge</em>. The threats got weirder, too:</p><p><strong>October 3rd:</strong></p><div><blockquote><p>I ask for your expeditious removal of all infringing material that use Nintendo Switch game emulators by 6th October 2024. Please note that the amount of videos infringing Nintendo’s copyrights is too high to be able to list them all in this e-mail and we hope that you will conscientiously remove all infringing videos before the next week.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>October 8th:&nbsp;</strong></p><div><blockquote><p>Nintendo hereby prohibits you from any future use of its intellectual and copyrighted property. Existing content may remain as long as there is no request to remove it. Nintendo of America Inc. would like to avoid further legal action and therefore hopes that their intellectual property will no longer be used by you. This cease-and-desist declaration is valid immediately and has been approved by President of Nintendo of America Doug Spencer Bowser.</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>October 12th:</strong>&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote><p>Nintendo of America Inc. (“Nintendo”) will no longer tolerate this behavior and is now on the verge of filing a lawsuit. Note that we work closely with our subsidiary Nintendo of Europe, located in Germany and therefore already have your address from the time you have been Nintendo Partner and/or will receive your new address from the residents’ registration office.”</p></blockquote></div><p>Domtendo began reaching out to friends and fellow content creators, and discovered he wasn’t alone. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Waikuteru">Waikuteru</a>, a streamer who develops Zelda mods, had been targeted by Tatsumi as well. Only that time, the takedown notices were filed in Japanese, and YouTube claimed they’d come from a seemingly real email address: <a href="mailto:anti-piracy3@nintendo.co.jp">anti-piracy3@nintendo.co.jp</a>. Whoever submitted those notices claimed to be a “Group Sub-Manager” in Nintendo’s “Intellectual Property Department.”&nbsp;</p><p>Could Tatsumi be legit? Was Domtendo staring down a real threat?&nbsp;</p><p><em>The Verge</em> could find no public record of a Tatsumi Masaaki working for Nintendo of America or Nintendo’s legal team, period. Nintendo did not respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s repeated requests to fact-check whether such a lawyer even exists.&nbsp;</p><p>But there <em>was </em>a person by a similar name <a href="https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Masaaki+Tatsumi);&amp;assignee=Nintendo&amp;oq=inventor:(Masaaki+Tatsumi);+assignee:(Nintendo)">working on Nintendo technology patents</a> in its home country of Japan, public records show, and Domtendo was dismayed to find a Nintendo email address for that person on the public web.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>This is the name of a real person (</em>真章 辰己) <em>who worked for Nintendo out of Kyoto, Japan</em>, <em>but the company wouldn’t tell The Verge one word about it.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: USPTO</cite></p></div><p>To a trained eye, there were signs that Domtendo’s “Tatsumi” was probably a fake. What business would a Japanese game technology inventor have individually chasing down a German YouTuber and threatening them with the laws of the United States? If they were a real lawyer, wouldn’t they know that threatening Domtendo with DMCA 512 is laughable, because that’s the portion of the law that protects platforms like YouTube rather than individual creators?&nbsp;</p><p>But Domtendo didn’t want to take the risk, not without proof. His livelihood was at stake. So as Tatsumi’s email threats rolled in, he reached out to Nintendo himself.&nbsp;</p><p>To his great surprise, Nintendo replied.&nbsp;</p><p>“Please note that <a href="mailto:tatsumi-masaaki@protonmail.com">tatsumi-masaaki@protonmail.com</a> is not a legitimate Nintendo email address and the details contained within the communication do not align with Nintendo of America Inc.’s enforcement practices. We are investigating further,” the company’s legal department wrote on October 10th, according to a screenshot shared with <em>The Verge</em>.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Here’s how Nintendo replied to Domtendo.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Even then, Domtendo didn’t feel safe. He’d seen how Waikuteru had received a legal threat that seemingly came from a legitimate Nintendo email. Perhaps Tatsumi just wasn’t using his proper email account? Domtendo tried emailing “tasumi_masaaki@nintendo.co.jp” to find out.&nbsp;</p><p>His anxiety ratcheted even higher when Tatsumi’s next email arrived, asking him not to send email to that address. “Please understand that matters are not currently handled from there,” he wrote. Even though it seemed impossible that Tatsumi could be real, he somehow knew things that he shouldn’t.</p><p>Then, on October 18th, Tatsumi suddenly changed his tune: “Dear Domtendo, I hereby retract all of my preceding claims.”</p><p>Tatsumi wasn’t done with Domtendo quite yet. Two more emails arrived the same day, explaining that while Nintendo had “suspended” him from filing copyright infringement claims, his Nintendo colleagues would now file them on his behalf. Hours later, Domtendo received what was in some ways the most legit-looking email yet, seemingly sent from anti-piracy3@nintendo.co.jp rather than a personal email address.&nbsp;</p><p>But that email turned out to be Tatsumi’s undoing, when Domtendo checked the headers and discovered they’d spoofed Nintendo’s email address using a publicly available tool on the web. I took the tool for a spin, and sure enough — <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/29436?hl=en">unless you check</a>, anyone can make an email look like it was sent from Nintendo that way.&nbsp;</p><p>Domtendo still doesn’t understand how “Tatsumi” knew he’d emailed the real Tatsumi at Nintendo. He changed his passwords and reformatted his computer, just to be safe. Today, his best guess is that the troll was lurking in his personal Discord channel.&nbsp;</p><p>He’s angry at YouTube for letting this happen. “It’s their fault,” he tells me. “Every idiot can strike every YouTuber and there is nearly no problem to do so. It’s insane,” he writes. “It has to change NOW.”</p><div><p>“Every idiot can strike every YouTuber”</p></div><p>It’s true there isn’t a terribly high bar to submit a YouTube copyright claim, something that YouTube itself admits. Currently, bad actors just need to fill in a form on a website, a place where YouTube sees a “10 times higher attempted abuse rate” than tools with more limited access. Or they can just email YouTube’s copyright department directly. And while <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512#:~:text=Elements%20of%20notification">the law</a> technically requires a copyright holder to provide their name and address and state “under penalty of perjury” that they’re authorized to complain on Nintendo’s behalf, there’s nothing compelling YouTube to check they aren’t lying before slapping creators with penalties.&nbsp;</p><div><p><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">Why is Nintendo targeting this YouTuber?</a></h2></p><p>Russ Crandall, aka Retro Game Corps, was actually targeted by Nintendo. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">Here’s the story</a> of  how the Japanese game company (and YouTube) are threatening his livelihood.</p><p>If you have first-hand information about Nintendo, you can reach me securely on Signal at <strong>seanhollister.01</strong>. </p></div><p>The thing to remember is the DMCA’s “Safe Harbor” isn’t here to protect creators, EFF legal director Corynne McSherry explained to me in 2022. When rightsholders realized they wouldn’t be able to sue every uploader, and internet platforms realized they wouldn’t be able to survive under an onslaught of uploader lawsuits, the law became a compromise to protect platforms from liability as long as they remove infringing content fast. </p><p>“It creates a situation where service providers have very strong incentives to respond,” said McSherry. “They don’t want to mess around and try to figure out if they might be liable or not.”</p><p>Waikuteru and Rimea, a pair of other creators harassed by Tatsumi, agree that the YouTube system is unfair. Neither know for sure whether trolls were responsible for all the takedown notices they’re received, and that’s part of the problem. “The idea that months of worries were caused by a single troll as opposed to a big untouchable company is a hard pill to swallow either way,” says Rimea.&nbsp;</p><p>But they also claim YouTube doesn’t allow smaller channels to challenge copyright strikes in the first place, arguing that it automatically and arbitrarily rejects the legal notices that would let them reinstate their videos. “YouTube decides whether someone loses his channel based on channel size,” says Waikuteru.&nbsp;</p><p>YouTube isn’t particularly interested in talking about any of this, though.&nbsp;</p><p>While YouTube spokesperson Jack Malon did confirm that “Tatsumi” made false claims, the company wouldn’t explain why the company even briefly accepted false claims from a protonmail.com email address as legitimate, and repeatedly dodged questions about whether Tatsumi made false claims on other creators’ videos, too. </p><p>YouTube wouldn’t even tell me whether Domtendo was still in danger of false copyright claims from this specific individual, or offer assurances that it would take any new action to prevent this sort of behavior in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Malon does claim that YouTube has “dedicated teams working to detect and prevent abuse,” however, and “work to ensure that any associated strikes are reversed” when bad actors make false claims.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the troll, Tatsumi declined <em>The Verge</em>’s interview request. “Dear Sean, I am an authorized agent for Nintendo of America Inc,” they replied, staying in character to the very end.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
