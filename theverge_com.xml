            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/655626/nintendo-switch-2-gamestop-preorder<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>GameStop’s online Nintendo Switch 2 preorders went live at 11AM ET, and like the preorders from other retailers overnight, things immediately got off to a rocky start. However, shortly after 11:30AM ET, it appears some people started to be able to complete orders, including one <em>Verge</em> staffer.</p><p>Right as the clock rolled over to 11AM, many of us at <em>The Verge</em> experienced issues with the website. At first, GameStop’s website showed me a mostly-blank page – the only text on it was “Oops…Something went wrong” [sic] and a refresh button. Soon after, myself and other <em>Verge</em> staffers often saw Cloudflare notices on GameStop’s website instead, including error notices that said the “web server is down” or that the site is experiencing a “bad gateway.”</p><p>Occasionally, the online listing for the Switch 2 and <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle has loaded for me, but the preorder button will be grayed out. One colleague also got the console-only option listing to load, but with a “not available” button in place of a preorder one.</p><p>GameStop’s mobile app has also been showing error messages for me, including one that vaguely says “activity paused,” when I try to open it.</p><p>At 11:34AM ET, deals-hunter Wario64 posted that GameStop’s Switch 2 preorders <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1915429174073774270">were actually live</a>. A few <em>Verge</em> staffers were then able to get a console in their cart, and one was actually able to make a purchase, but they didn’t get a confirmation email from GameStop until shortly after 1PM ET.</p><p>Another staffer thought they had the console in their cart, but when their cart actually loaded, GameStop said it was out of stock.</p><p>“We’re seeing overwhelming demand for Switch 2, which is causing some site issues. In-store preorders are open and running smoothly,” GameStop said on its support account on X <a href="https://x.com/GameStopHelp/status/1915429914641350721">at 11:37AM ET</a>. “Our team is actively working to fix it. Hang in there — we’ll keep you posted.”</p><p>In a post at 1:15PM ET, <a href="https://x.com/GameStopHelp/status/1915454612716621849">the account said</a>, “we expect Switch 2 online pre-orders to be caught up within the hour. If you didn’t get a confirmation email, it should be arriving shortly. Thanks for hanging in there — we’re almost back on track.”</p><p>We’ve contacted GameStop for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/655492/razer-pro-click-v2-vertical-edition-gaming-mouse-announcement-price<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/antonio-g-di-benedetto">Antonio G. Di Benedetto</a> <span>is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget. He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Razer is announcing two new mice, the Pro Click V2 and Pro Click V2 Vertical Edition — the latter being Razer’s first vertical mouse design. Both mice are more ergonomic and productivity-focused than the usual gaming-first designs Razer is known for, but the $99.99 Pro Click V2 and $119.99 Vertical Edition feature the brand’s typical all-black designs and bright RGB illumination.</p><p>Both Pro Click V2 mice feature programmable buttons, Razer Chroma compatibility, and Razer’s “AI Prompt Master” for quick access to prompting ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot. The standard model has a 30 degree tiled angle with contoured design for a natural resting position, rubberized side grips, an extended thumb rest, and a free-spinning tiltable scroll wheel for horizontal scrolling. The Vertical Edition goes for a more handshake-like grip with a 71.7 degree angle, big cutout to grip with your thumb, and an extended base that slightly elevates the wrist to reduce strain.</p><p>The new V2 versions replace the original <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fmena-en%2Fproductivity%2Frazer-pro-click" rel="sponsored">Pro Click</a> that Razer designed with ergonomic office furniture company Humanscale. That model definitely looked the part of an office productivity tool with its white and gray design. The V2s go harder on the typical Razer gamer aesthetic while still trying to compete with popular ergonomic mice like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23142689/logitech-mx-master-3s-mouse-review">Logitech MX Master</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/favorites/623848/my-favorite-things-logitechs-mx-vertical-wireless-mouse">MX Vertical</a>.</p><p>Razer begins selling both the <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Frazer-pro-click-v2%2FRZ01-03900100-R3U1" rel="sponsored">Pro Click V2</a> and the <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Frazer-pro-click-v2-vertical-edition%2FRZ01-05250100-R3U1" rel="sponsored">Pro Click V2 Vertical Edition</a> directly from its online and brick-and-mortar stores today, and the Vertical Edition will also be carried by authorized resellers.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
