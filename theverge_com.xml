            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/18/24298330/roblox-child-safety-chat-parent-accounts<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Roblox is starting to roll out some recently-announced child safety features, and the updates include some new limitations for how users under 13 can communicate on the platform. Beginning Monday, users younger than 13 won’t be able to DM players outside of games or experiences on Roblox. And they’ll need parental permission to be able to send in-game DMs — though this change won’t be fully implemented across the platform until the first quarter of 2025.</p><p>The changes follow recent reports highlighting instances of Roblox failing to protect children. A big article <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/?srnd=undefined">from <em>Bloomberg</em></a> described how predators on the platform use chat to communicate with kids. And a report from Hindenburg Research described Roblox as “an X-rated pedophile hellscape.” These new restrictions on chat will build on Roblox’s <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313120-Safety-Features-Chat-Privacy-Filtering">automatic chat filters</a> intended to block users from sharing personal information.</p><p>In addition to the changes to chat, Roblox is rolling out its previously-announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277992/roblox-pre-teen-children-parent-accounts-default-settings">accounts for parents and caregivers</a> that will let them remotely manage things like a child’s screen time limits. Previously, parents had to have physical access to their child’s account to set parental controls.</p><p>Roblox is also starting to use content labels to describe experiences instead of rating experiences for specific age groups. That means, for example, a “moderate” experience may contain things like moderate fear or crude humor. Users under the age of 9 will only be able to access experiences with “minimal” or “mild” content labels unless a parent gives permission. And Roblox will stop users under 13 from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289837/roblox-banning-preteens-social-hangout-spaces">accessing social hangout experiences</a> and experiences with free-form writing or drawing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/18/24299376/lg-ultragear-gx7-480hz-oled-gaming-monitor-price-availability<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>LG’s 27-inch OLED gaming monitor is one of the fastest models we’ve seen to date and it’s finally ready for preorder. The <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2024/11/lg-unveils-new-ultragear-oled-gaming-monitor-with-480hz-refresh-rate/">UltraGear 27GX790A</a> (or GX7 for short) is priced at $999.99 and is built around a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/3/24024042/lg-display-oled-480hz-oled-gaming-monitor">480Hz panel from LG Display</a> announced in early January with a 2560 x 1440 resolution and 0.03ms response time.</p><p>The base specs of the GX7 are on par with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24253167/sony-inzone-gaming-monitor-m10s-480hz-oled">$1,100 InZone M10S that Sony released</a> in September. That makes the UltraGear GX7 a smidge cheaper, but it lacks some of the performance modes and variable refresh rate features available on Sony’s offering.</p><p>The UltraGear GX7 is listed as <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-27gx790a-b-gaming-monitor">available for preorder on LG’s US website</a>, but there’s no mention of a delivery date and it can’t yet be added to the basket for checkout. We’ve reached out to LG for more information and will update here if we hear back.</p><div><figcaption><em>Here’s a shot of the UltraGear GX7 from the rear, showing the port locations behind the adjustable stand.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: LG</cite></p></div><p>The UltraGear GX7 is compatible with both Nvidia’s G-Sync and AMD’s FreeSync technology to help eliminate flickering and screen tearing issues. The display carries a DisplayHDR True Black 400 certification that supports a wide color gamut and impressive black levels, and an “Anti-Glare and Low Reflection” coating to improve the viewing experience in brightly lit environments.</p><p>The monitor features ports for HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 2.1, USB 3.0, and a headphone jack. It also comes with a slim, height-adjustable stand that can tilt up to 15 degrees, and swivel up to 30 degrees.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
