Previously, he was a freelance writer for Popular Mechanics, Men’s Health, and Esquire.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you missed the chance to pick up <strong>Nintendo’s new GameCube Controller</strong> for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Switch 2</a>, your time has come. It’s back in stock for $64.99 at the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-2-nintendo-gamecube-controller-120833%2F" rel="sponsored">My Nintendo Store</a>. To add one to your collection, you’ll need to have a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fonline%2F" rel="sponsored">Nintendo Switch Online subscription</a>, which starts at $19.99 a year for individuals. Once signed up, you can place an order by signing into your Nintendo Account and adding the gamepad to your cart, though you’re still limited to one controller per account.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->65</span></p><div><p>Nintendo’s new Switch 2 gamepad updates the classic GameCube Controller with a wireless design, a GameChat button, and USB-C. However, it only works with GameCube titles available through the Switch Online Expansion Pack.</p></div></div><p>As fun as it’s been playing <em>Mario Kart World</em> and the updated versions of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/681361/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-edition"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></a> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> on the Switch 2, I’ve been enjoying catching up on GameCube titles available through the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack. The controller provides a genuine experience when playing classic titles like <em>Wind Waker</em> and <em>Soulcalibur II</em>, with some notable upgrades. </p><p>The biggest change is the addition of wireless connectivity, so you’re not tethered by a short cable. It also has Nintendo’s “C” button for opening up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/video/685229/nintendo-switch-2-gamechat-c-button-mario-kart">GameChat</a>, a new Discord-like voice chat feature that’s free until March 31st, 2026. And if you like taking screenshots, the controller has a dedicated capture button, allowing you to document your first-place finishes in <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p><p>Although it works best with GameCube titles, you can also use the controller to play Switch 2 games, complete with gyro controls. However, Nintendo warns that the GameCube Controller “doesn’t have all the buttons and features found in other controllers that can be used with the Nintendo Switch 2 system,” which means you may run into some issues when playing games on the new system.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/691562/nintendo-wireless-gamecube-controller-switch-2-restock]]></content:encoded>

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you’ve been itching to get a handheld, but the Switch 2 isn’t quite up your alley, now you can get your hands on a Steam Deck OLED. As spotted <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lscg5aodzt2a">by @Wario64</a>, Valve has started selling the device <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamdeck%2F" rel="sponsored">on its online store</a> again after it was out of stock in the US and Canada for over a week.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/steam-deck-oled-out-of-stock">Valve cited</a> “recent supply chain constraints” for the Steam Deck OLED’s unavailability, adding that it expects the device to come back in stock by the end of the summer. It looks like Valve may have resolved its supply chain issues — at least for now — as the 512GB Steam Deck OLED is currently on sale for $549, while the 1TB version is available for $649.</p><p>Both devices come with a 7.4-inch HDR OLED display, up to a 90Hz refresh rate, a carrying case, and battery life ranging from three to 12 hours, depending on content. The 1TB version adds a “premium anti-glare etched glass” display, a removable liner with the carrying case, and an exclusive startup screen and virtual keyboard theme. However, neither model includes the Steam Deck Docking Station, which is available separately for $79 (there <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23776368/jsaux-rgb-dock-steam-deck-rog-ally-aya-neo">are plenty</a> of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23843324/gulikit-steam-deck-rog-ally-dock-super-nintendo-snes-xbox-elite-gamepad">third-party</a> options out there, too.)</p><p>But if you’re still holding out for a Switch 2, the $450 console has been popping up intermittently at retailers like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/691604/steam-deck-oled-valve-in-stock]]></content:encoded>
