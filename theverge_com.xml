            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/618705/pokemon-legends-z-a-chikorita-tepig-totodile-battles<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/charles-pulliam-moore">Charles Pulliam-Moore</a> <span>is a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Like its predecessor, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> </em>is bringing back three classic starter pokémon to get you started on your next adventure.</p><p>Though <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>will likely introduce a number of new creatures, Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile will be the first three partner pokémon you can choose between as you journey into the depths of Lumiose City. The starters were the stars of the <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>teaser The Pokémon Company debuted during this year’s Pokémon Presents. Details about the game are still sparse, but we now know a little bit more about how its battles will work.</p><p>Like other <em>Pokémon </em>games, you will be able to fight wild pokémon found throughout certain areas, but rather than just launching attacks turn by turn, <em>Legends: Z-A </em>will require players to think strategically about the range moves have and where their monsters are on the battlefield. The video — which focuses on how moves can have different effects and levels of damage depending on a pokémon’s position on the field — makes <em>Legends: Z-A</em>’s battles look a bit like fighting in <em>Diablo</em>. </p><p>The video also emphasizes how, because the game is set entirely in Lumiose, many of the areas where wild pokémon can be found are special locations like alleys and rooftops, where the creatures are learning to cohabitate with humans. Like in <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a></em>, players will be able to catch monsters <em>without </em>battling in some cases by simply throwing pokéballs at them from a distance.</p><p>That mechanic, in particular, should make the game feel much more fluid than <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet, </em>but we won’t know for sure until <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>debuts for the Switch family of systems sometime later this year.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
