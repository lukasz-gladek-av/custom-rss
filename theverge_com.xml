Now through February 19th, PlayStation Plus members can buy two PlayStation 5 accessories and get 20 percent off purchases over $100. If you aren’t a PS Plus member, you can still save <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/">if you sign up for a subscription</a>, which starts at $9.99 a month.</p><div><p>The ongoing promo applies to any accessory listed <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Faccessories%2Fps5" rel="sponsored">on this landing page</a> marked with Sony’s “Deal” badge, which includes the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-accessories%2Fplaystation-portal-remote-player" rel="sponsored"><strong>PlayStation Portal</strong></a> ($199.99), the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-accessories%2Fdualsense-edge-wireless-controller" rel="sponsored"><strong>Sony DualSense Edge</strong></a> ($199.99), and a handful of items that rarely receive discounts. The sale also includes a handful of cheaper accessories you can add to bring the cost down on the pricey gadgets, such as the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-accessories%2Fdualsense-charging-station" rel="sponsored">DualSense Charging Station</a> ($29.99), <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-accessories%2Fplaystation-link-usb-adapter" rel="sponsored">Link USB adapters</a> ($24.99), a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-accessories%2Fmedia-remote%3Fclickref%3D1100lA6Bt5GE%26emcid%3Dot-ps-456950" rel="sponsored">Media Remote</a> ($29.99), and various <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-accessories%2Fps5-console-covers-midnight-black" rel="sponsored">console covers</a> ($54.99).</p></div><p>In case you need a refresher, the PlayStation Portal is a handheld device with a crisp, eight-inch 1080p LCD display you can use to stream games from your PS5 over Wi-Fi or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300991/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming-update-beta-ps5-games">the cloud</a>. It’s a nice, all-in-one device that supports DualSense haptics, so you can take advantage of adaptive triggers and tilt controls. That said, while it’s great for playing PS5 games around the house, we wouldn’t recommend it for titles with a lot of latency, including online shooters and fighting games. Sony’s remote player also doesn’t work with any old pair of Bluetooth headphones either, so you’ll need to either dig up your wired headphones or pick up Sony’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-accessories%2Fpulse-explore-wireless-earbuds-ps5" rel="sponsored">Pulse Explore earbuds</a> or <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-accessories%2Fpulse-elite-wireless-headset-ps5" rel="sponsored">Pulse Elite headset</a> (which are also included in the sale).</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->200</span></p><div><p>The PlayStation Portal is a handheld device that allows you to play PS5 games over Wi-Fi.
