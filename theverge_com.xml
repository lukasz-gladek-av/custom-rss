Created by Australian developer Orbx that’s <a href="https://orbxdirect.com/">known for its flight sim add-ons</a>, the expansion lets you visit many locations from the films while the islands will be teeming with more than 10 different species of dinosaurs.</p><p>According to an <a href="https://orbxstudios.com/jwarchipelago/faqs/">FAQ on Orbx Studios’ website</a>, the <em>Jurassic World: Archipelago</em> expansion is an official collaboration with Universal Products &amp; Experiences and will be available sometime in late August or early September, 2025. It will initially launch for all versions of <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> on Xbox and PC, but is compatible with the entry-level Standard Edition which is also available through Xbox Game Pass. The studio says it’s also “working towards making compatible products for <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020</em> and <em>X-Plane 12</em>.”</p><p>The expansion lets you visit the five new islands — including Isla Nublar, Sorna, Matanceros, Peña, and Tacaño — as they were before the events of 2015’s <em>Jurassic World</em> “when the park is operational but not everything is under control.” You’ll be able to fly over Isla Nublar and see the park alive with activity, while the breeding facilities on Isla Sorna, as seen in <em>The Lost World: Jurassic Park,</em> remain abandoned and overgrown.</p><p><em>Jurassic World: Archipelago</em> includes new flying challenges like transporting VIPs between the islands and nearby Costa Rica and conducting guided tours. You can visit the facilities and theme park structures seen in the various films and land at recognizable airfields and helipads, all while dodging the local wildlife that includes brachiosaurus, stegosaurus, velociraptor, t.rex, and flying pteranodons.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/720070/orbx-universal-jurassic-world-park-dinosaurs-microsoft-flight-simulator-2-024]]></content:encoded>
