            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Switch 2</a> can be enjoyed right out of the box, but it’s even better with the right accessories. Some of these add-ons are more crucial than others, especially if you’re deciding what to buy early on. For example, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Carrying-Nintendo-Odorless-Protective-Portable-Protection/dp/B0DT48LYLP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">case</a> and a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Auto-Alignment-Protector-Accessories-Installation-Anti-Scratch-Ultra-Clear/dp/B0DRCKDWD1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">screen protector</a> can keep your console safe from scuffs, scratches, and drops, so both are what I’d consider to be essential.</p><p>On the other hand, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DFQKQ9CB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">microSD Express card</a> lets you add even more digital games to your library, although the console’s somewhat generous 256GB of internal storage means you may not need one right away. Some others don’t add enough to the gaming experience to be worth it. Those Joy-Con 2 steering wheel accessories? You can pass on those.</p><p>The Switch 2 and its games are expensive enough, so we’ve assembled this guide with picks that are a great value. You don’t need to spend hundreds on accessories — many of us at <em>The Verge</em> certainly aren’t. No matter your budget, we’ve included numerous categories, beginning with a starter kit of recommendations we think everyone should consider.</p><div><p id="our-seven-must-have-switch-2-accessories"><h2>Our seven must-have Switch 2 accessories</h2></p></div><div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->9</span></p><div><p>This two-pack of glossy screen protectors is a great value.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->33</span></p><div><p>A slim, durable case that comes in multiple color schemes.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->89</span></p><div><p>The Switch 2 wireless controller with the most features, but it’s not cheap.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->19</span></p><div><p>Grab this to be able to use your Xbox or PS5 controller on your Switch 2.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->54</span></p><div><p>Once you’ve filled up the Switch 2’s built-in 256GB SSD, add some extra storage.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->13</span></p><div><p>Switch 2 Wi-Fi download speeds are painfully slow. This can help speed things up in handheld mode.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->20</span></p><div><p>A great accessory for households with original Switch Joy-Con laying around.</p></div></div></div><div><p id="best-switch-2-controllers"><h2>Best Switch 2 controllers</h2></p></div><div><p id="nintendo-switch-2-pro"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro</h3></p></div><p>The Switch 2 Pro is Nintendo’s latest flagship wireless controller. It’s similar in several ways to the excellent Pro controller that debuted alongside the Switch, especially in design, with its analog stick layout, and because it’s the most replete with features you won’t find on other Switch 2 gamepads.</p><p>Its motion control support isn’t a novel feature (many third-party controllers offer that), but its Amiibo NFC support is still something that almost no alternatives offer. Another feature that makes this one worth considering despite its high price is its 3.5mm headphone jack, in case you want to plug in a set of wired headphones for private listening. Additionally, it can wake the Switch 2 from standby via Bluetooth (only a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/716763/gulikit-elves-2-controller-wake-switch-2">select few wireless models</a> possess this ability), so you don’t have to get off your couch to hit the console’s power button. Lastly, this model has two additional buttons that can be mapped to mimic almost any other button. (some cheaper alternatives, including the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 and Pro 3, feature four extra buttons).</p><p>The Switch 2 Pro is very comfortable, and it’s the controller that I always want to use when given the choice between the options below. But it’s not perfect. For one, it’s pricey at $89.99, and you’d think for that price Nintendo might have opted for drift-resistant sticks. Alas, you owe $5 to your buddy who bet that Nintendo would doggedly opt again for potentiometer sticks that are proven to tear down over time. Its sticks haven’t caused issues so far, but it’s possible that they might not fare as well — and as long — as models below that feature more durable Hall effect or TMR joysticks.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->89</span></p><div><p>The Switch 2 Pro Controller features new remappable “GL” and “GR” rear buttons, the “C” button to access in-game chat features, and a headphone jack.</p></div></div><div><p id="8bitdo-pro-3"><h3>8BitDo Pro 3</h3></p></div><p>8BitDo’s Pro 3 is a good alternative to the Switch 2 Pro controller: it’s slightly cheaper, yet better in some ways (and a bit worse in others) that might matter to you.</p><p>Starting with the good, the company upgraded its joysticks to the even more durable <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">TMR</a> sensors. The two back paddles are carried over from the first iteration, though there’s a new pair of buttons (L4 and R4) near the triggers that can be customized. Also of note are new toggle switches around its backside (similar to what we saw on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23564531/sony-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-ps5-features-review">DualSense Edge</a>) that let you alter the travel distance of its two triggers. Toggling a switch makes the corresponding trigger feel more like a mouse click.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that this controller is significantly more customizable than the Switch 2 Pro, as well as most other controllers out there. Its face buttons are magnetically attached, and can be removed to let the Pro 3 flip between the Switch layout and the Xbox layout.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>While the Pro 3’s TMR sticks might make it last longer, there are some trade-offs compared to the pricier Nintendo alternative — none of which are deal-breakers if saving money is a top priority. For example, its attempts to replicate the subtle blips and buzzing of Nintendo’s impressive HD haptics in the Switch 2 Pro controller are just not good. Its attempts at replicating the smallest, nuanced vibrations of Donkey Kong walking in <em>Bananza</em> makes it go full boar. I’d sooner turn off the vibration entirely than deal with how jarringly intense it feels, and thankfully you can in the app.</p><p>Other downsides are more minor, but are still worth knowing about. It lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack, and it doesn’t have the C button to launch GameChat. However, you can easily assign the feature to one of the Pro 3’s buttons via the Switch 2’s OS — but not to its additional buttons (the two R buttons near the triggers, and the two rear paddles). If you’d prefer to use the controller’s built-in button combo to reassign in-game commands to any of its buttons, that’s easy to do, per the instructions in its <a href="https://download.8bitdo.com/Manual/Controller/Pro3/8BItDo-Pro-3-Bluetooth-Gamepad-for-EN.pdf">PDF manual</a>.</p><div><p id="8bitdo-usb-adapter-2"><h2>8Bitdo USB Adapter 2</h2></p></div><p>It’s technically not a controller, but I’m a broken record when it comes to recommending 8BitDo’s USB Adapter 2 for households already with more than one console. In the case that you have an Xbox or a PS5 and would rather not buy a bespoke Switch 2 controller, just buy this $20 adapter instead, and use it to connect a wireless controller you already own.</p><p>This adapter goes into the Switch 2’s dock (or directly into the console, if you have a <a href="http://amazon.com/UGREEN-Adapter-MacBook-Thunderbolt-Samsung/dp/B0DSK82JK8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">USB-A to C adapter</a>). Connecting your controller is as easy as putting it into pairing mode, then ensuring that the “Pro Controller Wired Communication” option is turned on <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fen-gb%2FSupport%2FNintendo-Switch%2FHow-to-Enable-Disable-Pro-Controller-Wired-Communication-1516284.html%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOooQDh9bo5-2gBbiTFt9tjp2FhOWMvMjDCetyx00DLITBir2u2Z4" rel="sponsored">within the console’s settings</a>. Click and hold the adapter’s coin-shaped button to initiate pairing, then you should be good to go. The DualSense’s rumble and motion controls work seamlessly, and you can remap buttons as you please within the console’s OS, just like you would an official Switch controller.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->19</span></p><div><p>The 8BitDo’s latest adapter resembles a flash drive, but once connected to your Switch’s dock, it allows you to wirelessly pair it with a variety of PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo controllers.</p></div></div><div><p id="best-switch-2-cases"><h2>Best Switch 2 cases</h2></p></div><div><p id="dbrand-killswitch"><h3>Dbrand Killswitch</h3></p></div><p>The Killswitch is a great Switch 2 companion, whether you’re someone who primarily uses the console in handheld mode or while it’s docked. It’s a case that wraps around the Switch 2’s back, with detachable components that snugly grip onto each Joy-Con 2, adding some extra bulk that makes them more comfortable to hold. Above all else, it’s a great way to protect your console from scratches and slightly more significant damage. What’s also great is that it doesn’t limit its flexibility as a hybrid console.</p><p>Each Killswitch ships with a USB-C dock adapter that is inserted into the Switch 2 dock. Since the case-equipped console can no longer fit in Nintendo’s dock, this adapter lets you connect it to your TV without taking off the case. It’s tougher to correctly align the Switch 2’s USB-C jack with this adapter than it is to put it in the dock, but it gets easier with practice.</p><div><p id="tomtoc-fancycase-slim-zip-up-case"><h3>Tomtoc FancyCase Slim zip-up case</h3></p></div><p>The best, slimmest zip-up case you should buy is made by Tomtoc. Compared to the Belkin hard zip-up case that I got my hands on before the Switch 2’s launch, the Tomtoc FancyCase slim case feels more durable; anecdotally, it holds up much better to being squeezed by hand. It even has more vertical clearance above the Joy-Con 2 sticks, so it’ll never press them in on accident. Like most zip-up cases, it features a screen cover that doubles as cartridge storage. This one can hold 12 cartridges.</p><p>I’m confident that it’ll absorb more potential damage over time than other cases I’ve tried. Plus, it just looks cooler, with low-profile designs for gamers who don’t want to draw attention to their console. That said, its “Froz Edition” has ice cream-inspired looks that are a lot more expressive.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->33</span></p><div><p>This hard case has a soft touch and a slim fit, and includes a flap that can hold up to 12 cartridges as it protects the console’s screen.</p></div></div><div><p id="belkin-fabric-zip-up-case"><h3>Belkin fabric zip-up case</h3></p></div><p>Belkin’s $29.99 zip-up case is another competent, good-looking option that’s slim and lightweight. It’s worth considering over the Tomtoc for one reason only: its built-in pocket, which is great if you need to stow a charging cable or any other small doo-dads. Not to mention, this pocket contains another pocket for an AirTag or similar Bluetooth tracker, so you can track this case’s location should you lose track of it.</p><p>Belkin makes a thicker, pricier version of this case that has a 20,000mAh 20W battery inside. It’s nearly identical until you open it. A cutout fits this (and only this) Belkin battery perfectly, and it lets you charge your Switch 2 at top speeds while it’s protected.</p><div><p id="best-switch-2-cameras"><h2>Best Switch 2 cameras</h2></p></div><p>The best webcam that you can get for your Switch 2 should be the cheapest one you can find that’s guaranteed to work with it. So far, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/694565/logitech-webcams-work-with-nintendo-switch-2">Logitech has confirmed</a> that almost all of its webcams support the Switch 2, and <a href="https://help.elgato.com/hc/en-us/articles/25019224596877-Elgato-Facecam-MK-2-Firmware-Update#:~:text=As%20of%20July%2029%2C%202025%2C%20the%20firmware%20for%20the%20Facecam%20MK.2%20updated%20to%20version%202.00.%20This%20update%20can%20be%20used%20to%20make%20Facecam%20MK.2%20work%20with%20the%20Nintendo%20Switch%202.">Elgato has updated its Facecam MK.2</a> to support it, as well. Elgato’s model is pricier than we recommend most people spend, but it’s a solid option if you also have a PC to use it with. It’s worth knowing that the Switch 2 displays low-fidelity video feeds during gameplay, so unless you plan to use the webcam with your PC as well, it’s not worth spending a lot for a model that promises great video quality.</p><div><p id="best-switch-2-portable-batteries"><h2>Best Switch 2 portable batteries</h2></p></div><p>The Switch 2 is more powerful than the original Switch. However, it doesn’t require all that much more power to charge, even while you’re playing games. While new phones and tablets are breaking new ground with fast charging speeds, getting a power bank that can deliver at least 20W is totally sufficient to get the fastest-possible charging speeds with the Switch 2 in handheld mode.</p><p>By using a display-equipped USB-C cable with a wattage reading, I was able to see that the Switch 2 usually pulls a maximum of about 15-17W of power (sometimes less) from a USB-C battery during gameplay. When the system was asleep, the rate went down to between 8-13W, fluctuating at different points during the charging process. From a totally dead state, the console took almost 90 minutes to reach 69 percent with a 20W battery plugged into it. You’ll likely drain your USB-C battery more quickly if you’re playing as you charge.</p><p>Thankfully, your options for compatible batteries are plentiful. You’ll likely be paying for more power than you’ll need with the Switch 2, but more power (and especially more ports) are never a bad thing to have too much of.</p><div><p id="best-microsd-express-cards-for-switch-2"><h2>Best microSD Express cards for Switch 2</h2></p></div><p>The Switch 2 supports microSD Express cards of up to 2TB, even though models with that amount of storage aren’t yet available for purchase. Most brands make cards in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB configurations, and some offer 1TB cards as well. I’d suggest grabbing the cheapest microSD Express card you can find, as so far they all offer similarly fast read/write speeds.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/buying-guides/720160/best-switch-2-accessories]]></content:encoded>
