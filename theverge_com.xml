            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft and Asus have been working together over the past year to create not one, but two new ROG Xbox Ally handhelds. Both of these Xbox Ally devices, part of the Project Kennan effort I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/628073/microsoft-xbox-handheld-project-kennan-notepad">reported on earlier this year</a>, include a new full-screen Xbox experience on Windows that’s designed to be more handheld-friendly and hide away the complexity of Windows to focus on gaming instead.</p><p>The white ROG Xbox Ally is designed for 720p gaming, and the more powerful black ROG Xbox Ally X targets 900p to 1080p gaming on the go. Like the existing ROG Ally and Ally X, the new Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X share the same 7-inch 1080p screen, complete with a 120Hz refresh rate and VRR support.</p><p>The Xbox Ally uses a previously unannounced AMD Ryzen Z2 A chip, combined with 16GB of LPDDR5X-6400 RAM and 512GB of M.2 2280 SSD storage. The Xbox Ally X upgrades the chip to AMD’s Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor, 24GB of LPDDR5X-8000 memory, and a 1TB M.2 2280 SSD.</p><p>All of these specs make them very similar to Asus’ existing Windows-powered handheld gaming PCs at heart, but there are some much-needed changes to the software side that could make the Windows handheld experience a lot better.</p><p>“We know that to take this handheld experience to the next level, we cannot do this alone,” says Shawn Yen, vice president of consumer at Asus, in a briefing with <em>The Verge</em><strong>,</strong> admitting that some gamers have found it “frustrating and confusing” to navigate Windows with joysticks and button until now.</p><p>Microsoft and Asus have been collaborating closely on these two new Xbox Ally devices over the past year, and Yen says Microsoft and Asus “share a joint obsession” on these new handhelds.</p><p>That joint obsession includes Microsoft making good on its promise to combine “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming">the best of Xbox and Windows together</a>,” thanks to a new Xbox full-screen experience on Windows that’s designed specifically for handhelds. Not only can the Xbox Ally devices boot directly to this interface, but the companies claim you can easily get back to it using a new dedicated Xbox button on these handhelds, much like an Xbox console.</p><p>Microsoft doesn’t load the full Windows desktop or a bunch of background processes in this full-screen Xbox experience, putting Windows firmly in the background and freeing up more memory for games. Instead, you launch straight into the Xbox PC app, which includes all of your PC games from the Microsoft Store, Battle.net, and what Microsoft calls “other leading storefronts.”</p><p>This aggregated gaming library means you’ll see games from Xbox, Game Pass, and all your PC games installed from Steam, Epic Games Store, and elsewhere in a single interface, much like what the GOG launcher offers. Earlier this week, we started seeing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682235/xbox-pc-games-console-library-xbox-360">parts of this unified library appear</a> in the Xbox PC app, and Microsoft says you’ll be able to access your full Xbox console library through Xbox Cloud Gaming or Remote Play to an Xbox console.</p><p>The idea is that you should be able to seamlessly launch any game you own, whether it’s actually installed on your handheld, streaming from your Xbox Series X over home Wi-Fi, or streaming from the cloud, though we have yet to try that ourselves.</p><p>Microsoft has also made some additional tweaks to the Xbox PC app and Game Bar to make this all more handheld-friendly, including the ability to log in via the Windows lockscreen with your controller<strong>,</strong> no touchscreen taps required. You’ll also be able to use this handheld-friendly Game Bar interface to easily launch apps like Discord, or alt-tab between apps and games, or adjust settings without having to fiddle with the touchscreen. <a href="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=vm_preview_make&amp;post_id=682011">You can read all about all the Windows changes in my deep dive look at this new Xbox PC experience right here</a>.</p><p>These two Xbox Ally devices also have Xbox-like contoured grips. It’s as if Microsoft and Asus have taken an Xbox controller and squeezed a screen between the grips, similar to what Sony did with its PlayStation Portal. The grips have been designed like this to make it easier to wrap your hands around the entire controls, so you access all the buttons and triggers.</p><p>The Xbox Ally X even has impulse triggers like all modern Xbox controllers, so you’ll feel things like terrain of roads during racing games or the impact of bullets in a shooter, all thanks to the haptics on the triggers. Asus is also using a USB-C 4 connector that supports Thunderbolt 4 on the more powerful Xbox Ally X<strong>, </strong>offering the possibility of connecting a powerful external GPU to it, alongside a single USB-C 3.2 port and a UHS-II microSD card reader. The Xbox Ally uses two USB-C 3.2 ports instead.</p><p>Microsoft and Asus aren’t providing any benchmarks or a real sense of performance for these handhelds yet, and both use chips we haven’t tested. But interestingly, they appear to be focusing on battery life this time around.</p><p>“For this generation the most important thing to us is efficiency. Efficiency is our new superpower,” says Yen. “The games will be able to play cooler and quieter, and at the same time offer you a longer battery life for gameplay.” AMD told us in January that the Z2 Extreme would be both its most powerful and most efficient handheld chip yet, while <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-z2-a-said-to-be-based-on-steam-decks-van-gogh-apu">the Z2 A is rumored</a> to be based on the Steam Deck’s less powerful but battery-sipping Van Gogh-based chip.</p><p>Importantly, the Xbox Ally is using a 60Wh battery, 50 percent larger than the pack that shipped in the original ROG Ally, while the more powerful Xbox Ally X uses an 80Wh battery, tied with the Ally X and the largest you can find in a handheld today. The Windows tweaks may also improve battery, with Microsoft claiming it’s already seeing one-third of the drain when these Xbox Full Screen Experience systems are idle and asleep.</p><p>If you want extra performance, you’ll also be able to dock these Xbox Ally devices <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24336135/asus-thunderbolt-5-external-gpu-graphics-xg-mobile-ces-2025">to Asus’ XG mobile device</a> that offers up an RTX 5090 laptop GPU to overhaul how games play on these handheld devices.</p><p>These new Xbox Ally handhelds will launch during the holiday season later this year, and Microsoft and Asus are planning to share pricing and preorder information in the coming months.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft and Asus have just announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">two ROG Xbox Ally devices</a> that include a new full-screen Xbox experience for handhelds. After promising to combine “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming">the best of Xbox and Windows together</a>” for handhelds earlier this year, Microsoft is now revealing exactly how it is overhauling the Xbox app, Game Bar, and Windows itself to better compete with SteamOS.</p><p>Microsoft has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/676258/microsoft-xbox-handheld-windows-steamos-notepad">needed to respond to SteamOS</a> ever since the Steam Deck launched three years ago, and it has steadily been tweaking its Xbox app and the Xbox Game Bar on Windows to make both more handheld-friendly. But there was always a bigger overhaul of Windows required, and we’re starting to see parts of that today.</p><p>“The reality is that we’ve made tremendous progress on this over the last couple of years, and this is really the device that galvanized those teams and got everybody marching and working towards a moment that we’re just really excited to put into the hands of players,” says Roanne Sones, corporate vice president of gaming Devices and ecosystem at Xbox, in a briefing with <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Microsoft demonstrated this handheld-friendly combination of Windows and Xbox to The Verge in a briefing earlier this week, but it was a virtual demo so we haven’t been able to try it fully yet. It all starts by booting directly into a new Xbox full-screen experience on these ROG Xbox Ally devices that focuses on the Xbox app and Game Bar, alongside being a launcher for all your PC games — yes even Steam ones.</p><p>“We were able to take people who have been working on the Xbox OS for 20 years or more and have them work directly on the Windows codebase and start reimagining what that operating system looks like for this form factor,” explains Jason Beaumont, vice president of experiences at Xbox. “These two things combined led us to build a bunch of features.”</p><p>The Xbox full-screen experience is very much the compact mode of the Xbox app taking full control of the ROG Xbox Ally devices, instead of the familiar Windows desktop and taskbar. “When the player boots into the full-screen experience there is a whole bunch of Windows stuff that doesn’t get loaded,” says Beaumont. “We’re not loading the desktop wallpaper, the taskbar, or a bunch of processes that are really designed around productivity scenarios for Windows.”</p><p>You can still exit this full-screen mode and launch the full version of the Windows desktop, but by default it will by hidden away. “We’ve reduced many notifications and pop-ups, and we will continue to listen to feedback from players to make continued improvements,” says Sones.</p><p>The Xbox app itself in full-screen mode looks very similar to what exists on Windows right now, except the library is now full of all of your PC games from Steam and other stores, alongside ones from Xbox Play Anywhere and Game Pass. Where it really gets interesting is the Game Bar.</p><p>“We’ve made a lot of improvements to Game Bar over the last year, and really it was driving towards this device,” says Brianna Potvin, principal software engineering lead at Xbox. A short press on the Xbox button on the Xbox Ally devices brings up the Game Bar interface, and you can use this to access device settings like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, Asus’ Command Center interface, and even Microsoft’s new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628666/microsoft-xbox-copilot-for-gaming">Gaming Copilot</a>. If you long press on the Xbox button then you’ll even get a more handheld-friendly task switcher, which lets you alt+tab between apps and games using the controller.</p><p>I’ll need to try this new interface fully to really get a feel for the Windows changes here, but Microsoft is promising that this isn’t just lipstick on top of Windows. “This isn’t surface-level changes, we’ve made significant improvements,” says Potvin. “Some of our early testing with the components we’ve turned off in Windows, we get about 2GB of memory going back to the games while running in the full-screen experience.”</p><p>That’s a good step to improve the performance of Windows on handhelds, but one of the big pieces of feedback around the handheld experience is the sleep situation where Windows-powered devices often draw far too much battery life when they’re idle.</p><p>“If you’re booting your device into the full-screen experience and you’re putting it down and it’s going to sleep, it draws one third of the idle power draw than if it was booting the same device into the [Windows] desktop experience,” claims Potvin. Microsoft is still focused on battery life and power efficiency for this full-screen mode, so we might even see further improvements before devices ship later this year. Microsoft has also made improvements to the Windows lockscreen, so you can now use a controller to log in using a PIN code, or navigate around in this part of Windows.</p><p>This updated Xbox app will now work as a launcher for all your PC games, but you’ll still be able to interact with Windows apps and those other launchers freely in this full-screen handheld experience. Sones says Microsoft is “working closely with leading storefronts to have them optimize their full screen experience,” to make it easy for everyone to play a full library of PC games from Steam, Epic Games Store, and elsewhere.</p><p>“The aggregated gaming library within Xbox on PC will be available for all Windows 11 devices,” says Sones, so you’ll soon be able to see all of your Steam games within the Xbox app on any PC.</p><p>Microsoft is also creating its own version of Valve’s Steam Deck verified program, allowing you to see what games are optimized for handhelds like the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X. You’ll also be able to access your full Xbox console library on handhelds thanks to either Xbox Cloud Gaming or Remote Play from an Xbox console, but most console games won’t play natively unless there’s a PC version or they’re part of Xbox Play Anywhere.</p><p>The best part of all these Windows changes is that you won’t necessarily need a new device to benefit from them. “The Xbox full-screen experience will first come to the ROG Xbox Ally and the ROG Xbox Ally X, and our next focus will be updating the in-market ROG Ally and the ROG Ally X,” says Sones. “Similar full-screen Xbox experiences will be rolling out to other Windows handhelds, starting next year.”</p><p>Valve is also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">supporting SteamOS on the ROG Ally</a>, so we should be able to compare Valve and Microsoft’s handheld operating systems on the same hardware soon. We don’t yet know if Microsoft has done enough to stop other PC makers from being tempted over to SteamOS <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">like Lenovo has</a>, but Microsoft’s efforts are really setting up a battle between Windows and Linux for the future of handheld gaming PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
