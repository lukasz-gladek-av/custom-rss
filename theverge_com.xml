Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The squid kids are coming to the Switch 2. In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637319/nintendo-today-news-app">its mobile news app today</a>, Nintendo made some surprise announcements about its ink-shooting franchise.</p><p>First up, a spinoff game called <em>Splatoon Raiders</em> is in the works for the Switch 2, though there aren’t a lot of details. The new game will take players to an area known as the Spirhalite Islands, investigating some kind of mystery alongside the fictional pop group Deep Cut. It appears the game may be a single-player offshoot of the franchise, though there is currently no word on when it will launch.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23339801/splatoon-3-review-nintendo-switch">the online shooter <em>Splatoon 3</em></a> is getting a big update on June 12th, which will bring it up to version 10.0. It will introduce 30 remixed weapons and the classic Urchin Underpass map from the first <em>Splatoon</em> on the Wii U. The game will also be getting enhanced for the Switch 2, with what Nintendo calls “more detailed visuals” and a “smoother appearance” in certain locations. Players will be able to play against each other on both platforms. The update will be available for free.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/682063/the-new-york-times-nyt-games-crossplay-scrabble-pips<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>The New York Times</em>’ games team is trying something new: it’s about to start testing a <em>Scrabble</em>-like game it calls <em>Crossplay</em>, but instead of folding the game into the main NYT Games app, <em>Crossplay</em> will be a standalone app. The game is soft launching in New Zealand on iOS on June 10th.</p><p>I was recently shown a demo of the game by Jonathan Knight, head of games at <em>NYT</em>, and I think it will look familiar to any fans of <em>Scrabble</em> or <em>Words with Friends</em>. The game takes place between two players. Each turn, your goal is to build a word out of the up to seven letter tiles on your tray and the letters already on the board. Every letter has a different point value, and you can boost your score by taking advantage of bonus tiles on the board that multiply your letter or word scores.</p><p>(The <em><em>NYT</em></em> did not provide screenshots I could publish; Knight says that a screenshot of the game right now doesn’t represent where it will be when it launches more widely.)</p><div><p>“We’re really presenting a very pure, classic, elevated version of the game”</p></div><p>The <em>NYT</em> has a few of its own tweaks to differentiate <em>Crossplay</em> from similar games, including different positions for bonus tiles and a different letter distribution, Knight says. The end of the game has a clever twist, too: after all of the letter tiles have been drawn from the virtual bag, each player gets just one additional turn instead of having to clear their tray of tiles to end the game.</p><p>Knight argues that <em>Crossplay</em> is its own app because it’s an experience that would be hard to fit in another app. “We’re very specifically wanting to reach all new audiences with this game,” particularly people that love to compete and love word games, he says.</p><p><em>Crossplay</em> requires a free <em>NYT</em> account to play, and your friends from the main <em>NYT</em> Games app will carry over, Knight says. “Certain aspects” of the game will be exclusive to paid subscribers, such as a feature that will help you review your matches. But he says <em>Crossplay</em> won’t have many of the things that can make other free mobile games frustrating.</p><p>“In a world where mobile games have become little mini casinos, and it’s often hard to find the game itself behind all of the treasure chests and friction and aggressive monetization tactics and coins and all of that, we’re really presenting a very pure, classic, elevated version of the game that you can just get in and enjoy without all that business,” Knight says.</p><p>The <em>NYT’s</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/31/22911274/wordle-new-york-times-free-word-game-acquisition">acquisition of <em>Wordle</em></a> arguably kicked off the race for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279439/news-games-crossword-wordle">daily puzzle games</a>, with places like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23984103/puzzmo-acquired-hearst-zach-gage">Hearst</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152045/linkedin-games-crossclimb-queens-pinpoint">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276945/netflix-is-getting-a-daily-word-game-from-ted">Netflix</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24295846/words-with-friends-single-player-daily-puzzles-wordle">Zynga</a> putting their own stamps on the genre. Overall, the <em>NYT’s</em> games business is growing, according to Knight, including “tremendous downloads,” growing app use, and subscriptions.</p><p><em>NYT</em> puzzles were played 11.1 billion times in 2024, according to statistics shared with <em>The Verge</em> by <em>NYT</em> spokesperson Jordan Cohen. <em>Wordle</em> was played 5.3 billion times, “3.3 billion successful <em>Connections</em> were made,” and <em>Strands</em>, the <em>NYT’s</em> word search game, was played 1.3 billion times.</p><p>The <em>NYT</em> games team is still developing new puzzles for the main games app, such as <em>Pips</em>, a logic game, that it started beta testing in Canada in April.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682075/verge-staffers-react-nintendo-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is finally, officially out, and <em>Verge</em> staffers have spent a bunch of time playing with it. The new console has a lot of improvements, like a bigger screen and an extra USB-C port. There’s a bunch of games to play, too, including a new <em>Mario Kart</em> and nice updates to older games.</p><p>Here’s our impressions of our first few days with the Switch 2. Our full review is coming soon.</p><div><p id="bigger-screen"><h3>Bigger screen</h3></p></div><p>I wish the Switch 2 had an OLED screen, particularly considering the price, but this 7.9-inch, 1080p 120Hz panel absolutely makes my original 6.2-inch Switch seem like a bargain basement tablet by comparison. It’s <em>so</em> much more real estate, it’s crisper and clearer, navigating the UI feels smoother thanks to the high refresh rate, and I no longer feel like my field of vision is getting squeezed by loads of ugly bezel.</p><p>But the Switch OLED already solved a few of those issues. And while reasonably bright, the Switch 2’s screen can’t compare to the Steam Deck OLED’s amazingly bright and colorful HDR panel. —<em>Sean Hollister, senior editor</em></p><div><p id="old-games-on-new-console"><h3>Old games on new console</h3></p></div><div><p>The Switch 2’s slim launch lineup is supplemented by updates to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/681361/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-edition">some of the original Switch’s most popular games</a> — some free, some paid. In a lot of cases, the vision and ambition of these games stretched or even exceeded the capabilities of the original Switch hardware, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/679031/pokemon-violet-scarlet-switch-2-update-hands-on">their performance on the Switch 2 is a <em>drastic</em> improvement</a>.</p></div><p>I’m glad some great games are finally able to escape the shackles of the original Switch and really shine, but it also highlights just how overdue the Switch 2’s improvements really are. —<em>Kallie Plagge, senior copy editor</em></p><div><p id="only-one-color-option"><h3>Only one color option?</h3></p></div><p>Speaking as a man with a bona fide Joy-Con collecting problem — I racked up six pairs for the Switch because I like all the colors and am bad at managing my money — it was bittersweet news that the Switch 2 only comes in black with tiny red and blue accents. It saved me from spending even more at launch, but that’s only delaying the inevitable.</p><p>Does it mean future Joy-Con designs will be similarly understated, with pops of color below the control sticks? Will we have to live with the knowledge that future colored controllers won’t match the hidden accents on the console itself? Most importantly, will I be able to curb my collection compulsion this time around? —<em>Dominic Preston, news editor</em></p><div><p id="its-so-much-faster"><h2>It’s so much faster</h2></p></div><p>I would like to apologize to a bunch of game developers, because I’ve spent the last several years cursing them for interminable loading times, unnecessarily complicated menus that take a second to register every button press, and a lot of overall slowness. All of which turned out to be the Switch’s fault</p><p>I have been shocked at how much zippier the Switch 2 feels in almost every way. Games load faster, menus render more quickly, old games play like new again. The overall speed of the device is, in my time with it so far, a bigger upgrade than just about anything else about the Switch 2. <em>—David Pierce, editor at large</em></p><div><p id="the-extra-usb-c-port"><h3>The extra USB-C port</h3></p></div><p>To my surprise, my favorite change for the Switch 2 so far is the extra USB-C port on the top of the console. Maybe that’s just because of the way I work: my desk is usually an overflowing pile of various gadgets and cables, so I like having the extra port on top for charging or plugging in a webcam for some <em>Mario Kart</em> (which I’m definitely only testing for work, pinky promise). <em>—Jay Peters, news editor</em></p><div><p><cite>Photo: Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="ergonomics"><h3>Ergonomics</h3></p></div><p>The original Switch wasn’t comfortable to hold for an extended time, and I thought the Switch 2’s larger size could remedy that. But to me, the Switch 2 might actually be worse.</p><p>The slightly bigger Joy-Con 2 controllers give you a little more to wrap your fingers around in handheld mode, but they’re not contoured like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871866/hori-split-pad-pro-controller-nintendo-switch-daemon-x-machina-review">larger third-party gamepads</a> or chunkier PC handhelds. The hard edge along the bottom of the Joy-Con 2 controllers digs into my palms when I’m leaning back on the couch. I felt noticeable discomfort after playing <em>Mario Kart World</em> in this position for less than an hour. By the end of my two-hour session, it was unbearable.</p><p>Maybe my soft hands just aren’t burly enough. (After all, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23527936/sony-alpha-a7rv-mirrorless-fullframe-camera-hands-on-ergonomics-pain">I’m on the record</a> complaining about uncomfortable cameras.) But I think the move from the original Switch Joy-Cons’ rounded borders to the Switch 2’s hard edge is a small downgrade I’ll have to work around. <em>—Antonio G. Di Benedetto, reviewer</em></p><div><p id="the-mystique-is-gone"><h3><strong>The mystique is gone</strong></h3></p></div><p>There was so much hype ahead of the Switch 2’s launch (even before its announcement) that it’s impossible for a device to live up to it all. And yet, after a weekend with the Switch 2, it’s great, though I’m surprised that all of my personal feelings of mystique surrounding it are gone. What it can or can’t do is no longer a mystery, even if figuring out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682008/which-webcams-work-with-nintendo-switch-2">which webcams will work</a> remains one. </p><p>I agree with my colleague Andrew Webster who said in his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682661/nintendo-switch-2-early-hands-on-mario-kart-world">in-progress testing</a> that it’s “a pleasant upgrade, as opposed to a next-gen shift.” However, I’m disappointed that the mystique didn’t stick around a little longer, like it did with the Steam Deck. Turns out, when a handheld doubles as a Linux PC, the possibilities feel limitless.</p><p>The same can’t be said for the Switch 2. It’s a better Switch, but conceptually, it’s the same formula. I’m still getting used to that. —<em>Cameron Faulkner, commerce editor</em></p><p><em><strong>Update, June 10th</strong>: Added David’s entry.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
