            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/641537/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo is releasing a new 3D <em>Donkey Kong</em> game that will be an exclusive for the Nintendo Switch 2. The game, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, will release on July 17th, which is a little more than a month after the June 5th launch of the Switch 2.</p><p><em>Bananza</em> is a 3D platformer that gives DK a new look that’s seemingly inspired by his appearance in <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>. “Explore a vast underground world—by smashing your way through it!” according to the description of Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIddsPkdX9U">YouTube trailer for the game</a>. “Bash, throw, and climb through just about anything in DK’s brand-new 3D platforming action-adventure game!”</p><p>In the trailer, you can see DK scaling walls like a super-powered Link from <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, picking up and tossing rocks to smash through enemies and walls, and digging into the ground with his fists. There also looks to be old-school 2D sections and mine cart rides.</p><p>The game looks full of energy — DK and various characters in the trailer are really expressive and fun. It’s a shame it won’t launch at the same time as the Switch 2, but at least we won’t have to wait too much longer after the system releases to play the game.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It wouldn’t be a new Nintendo console without a big <em>Zelda</em> release, and the franchise’s next entry is sending the princess to war.</p><p>During <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream">today’s Switch 2 Direct,</a> Nintendo announced the forthcoming arrival of <em>Age of Imprison</em>ment, a new installment of Koei Tecmo’s <em>Zelda-</em>inspired <em>Hyrule Warriors </em>series. Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572264/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review-nintendo-switch-zelda-botw-prequel"><em>Hyrule Warrior</em>s: <em>Age of Calamity</em></a>, <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> is another prequel whose story connects directly with the larger tale unfolding in <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">Breath of the Wild</a> </em>and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch">Tears of the Kingdom</a></em>. But this time around, the game looks even farther back into the past to focus on the battle Princess Zelda fought alongside King Rauru against Ganondorf.</p><p>A brief trailer for the game highlighted how <em>Age of Imprisonment </em>will allow you to play as Zelda and Rauru as you fight against hordes of Hylian monsters. Nintendo didn’t reveal much about the new game’s plot, but announced that it’s set for release this winter.</p><p>The <em>Zelda </em>franchise played a key role in the original Switch’s success. <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, which was also one of the last Wii U titles, quickly became one of the handheld console’s bestselling games and a critical darling that kicked off a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">new era of open-world gaming</a>. The Switch gave Nintendo a chance to double down on <em>Zelda</em> spinoffs like the <em>Hyrule Warriors </em>series and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/13/18677194/cadence-of-hyrule-crypt-of-the-necrodancer-zelda-nintendo-hands-on-release-date-e3-2019">Cadence of Hyrule</a></em>.</p><div><p>The company kept its <em>Zelda </em>momentum going with updated versions of classics like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20871958/legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review-nintendo-switch-updates-graphics">Link’s Awakening</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22576029/legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-review-nintendo-switch">Skyward Sword</a></em>. And even though the first Switch was nearing the end of its life cycle, Nintendo pushed the series even further into the future with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch">Tears of the Kingdom</a> </em>and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch">Echoes of Wisdom</a></em>. The way <em>Zelda </em>flourished on the Switch is undoubtedly part of why the franchise is being <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/638133/legend-of-zelda-movie-premiere-date-2027">adapted into a live-action movie</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-of-legend-of-zelda-producer-eiji-aonuma-at-universal-studios-pulled-offline">seemingly getting the theme park treatment</a>. And now we know a bit more about how the princess’s legend will continue with the Switch 2.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was originally intended to be DLC for <em>Hollow Knight</em>, but <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/hollow-knight-silksong-revealed">according to developers Team Cherry</a>, “it quickly became too large and too unique to stay a DLC, as initially planned.” The game will take place in a new kingdom, with new moves and new weapons at your disposal as well as new enemies to take on.</p><p>Nintendo featured gameplay of <em>Silksong</em> during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8lvHT_IQbM">a broadcast at E3 2019</a>. But since then, there have only been a few substantial updates about the game. Xbox showed a new trailer for it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/12/22175400/hollow-knight-silksong-sequel-xbox-game-pass-trailer">in June 2022</a> and said it would be available within 12 months. The game was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/9/23717855/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed">delayed shortly before that deadline</a>. The game was announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/16/23356667/hollow-knight-silksong-playstation-ps5-ps4-still-no-release-date">for PlayStation, too</a>. And in January, Matthew Griffin, who works on marketing and publishing for <em>Silksong</em>, <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1880523110816051696">stated that</a> “the game is real, progressing and will release.”</p><div><p>Now that the game has a release window, it might almost be time to <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hollow-knight-silksong-fans-in-clown-makeup">take off our clown makeup</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo says they will have “clearer image quality” and higher resolution than the original releases.</p><p>Nintendo also promised that games like <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>, <em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</em>, <em>Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</em>, <em>Super Mario Strikers</em>, <em>Chibi-Robo! Plug Into Adventure</em>, <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em>, and <em>Pokémon Colosseum</em> will be available on the service.</p><p>The GameCube game library will launch on the same day as the Switch 2, June 5th, and will be available as part of the Nintendo Switch Online: Expansion Pack.</p><p>Since its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17874798/nintendo-switch-online-launch-subscription">launch in 2018</a>, Nintendo’s slowly built up its online subscription service by offering games from console generations past, alongside other neat features. In addition to enabling cloud saves and online play, the base service offers players access to games from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/17/18185533/nintendo-switch-online-classic-nes-games-blaster-master-zelda-2">the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries</a>, along with the recently added <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284073/nintendo-music-streaming-app-switch-online-subscribers">Nintendo Music app</a>.

Nintendo has remastered or ported a handful of games to the system over the years, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/9/23592822/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-best-way-classic"><em>Metroid Prime </em>and<em> Metroid Prime 2</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/14/23873435/nintendo-switch-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-trailer"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438499/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Sunshine</em></a> (before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307522/mario-limited-time-nintendo-switch-disney-vault">yanking the collection that contained <em>Sunshine</em> from stores</a>).</p></div><p>Last year, Nintendo conducted a secretive online playtest that was initially thought to be for GameCube games with online multiplayer features. That test <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275596/nintendo-switch-online-beta-playtest-program-leak-mmo">was actually for an MMO</a>, but at least Nintendo was a little late in adding GameCube games, rather than never doing it at all.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo didn’t go into specifics on those upgrades, but the titles were running at a perfectly smooth 60fps during the stream.</p><p>Both titles pushed the original Switch hardware to its limits with occasional frame rate drops, so if Nintendo is able to deliver buttery-smooth gameplay on the new console, many early buyers will be happy to replay these classics.</p><p>The company also demonstrated a new second-screen experience in its Nintendo Switch app for Android and iOS. A “Zelda’s Notes” feature will be able to show your location on a map in the massive world of either game, and it can help guide you to shrines and koroks that you haven’t yet discovered. “It’s a game-specific service that’s exclusive to the Switch 2 Editions of these titles,” the company said.</p><p>If you already own the original games, the upgrades will be available as separate purchases or at no additional cost if you have a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch Online app will be renamed to a simpler “Nintendo Switch” at the end of May, Nintendo confirmed during the stream.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Now that Nintendo has finally given us the rundown on the Switch 2, we can finally answer one of the biggest questions we had about the new console: “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637523/nintendo-today-switch-2-c-button-leak">what’s the deal with that ‘C’ button?</a>”</p><p>The button, present on the right Joy-Con directly below the home button, is square and marked with a “C.” The mysterious new button was shown briefly in the video debuting the Switch back in February and was present in every mock-up and leak of the console. In the Switch 2 Direct, Nintendo finally revealed the purpose of the button, a new feature called GameChat.</p><p>As its name implies, GameChat enables Switch 2 players to communicate using the console’s built-in microphone. Nintendo noted how the Switch 2’s microphone will feature background noise filtering to ensure that GameChat calls come through clearly. In addition to giving people a way to talk directly to one another, GameChat also features screen sharing functionality that will allow you to broadcast your gaming to friends on group calls. Notably, you will <em>not</em> have to be playing the same game while using GameChat, meaning that people within a call will be able to play and screen-share different titles simultaneously. And for gamers looking to see one another’s faces, GameChat will support video calls by connecting to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641352/nintendo-switch-2-camera-launch">the new Nintendo Switch 2 camera peripheral</a>.</p><p>In a press release, Nintendo said parents looking to monitor their children’s use of GameChat will be able to enable or disable the feature through the Nintendo Switch Parental Control smartphone app.</p><p>The GameChat feature represents a major step forward in Nintendo’s social gaming offerings. Of the three major manufacturers, Nintendo was the only one that did not have a way for players to communicate with their friends via the console. Shortly after the launch of the original Switch, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/18/15995098/nintendo-switch-online-app-out-now-ios-android">Nintendo released a mobile app</a> that let users participate in voice chat for select games, but it’s awkward to use an app for a feature that comes standard in other consoles.</p><p>Nintendo <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fwhats-new-with-nintendo-switch-online-on-nintendo-switch-2%2F" rel="sponsored">also announced today</a> that it plans to rename the Switch’s smartphone app — it’s just called “the Nintendo Switch app” now — which will continue to offer voice chat functionality for certain games OG Switch like <em>Splatoon 3 </em>and <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>. The Nintendo Switch app will also debut a new service called Zelda Notes, that “supports players on their adventures in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition.”</p><p>As a whole, all of GameChat’s features make it feel like Nintendo set out to bake some of Discord’s core features directly into its newest console. It’s a bold move for the company given its history of making this kind of communication more cumbersome than you would expect, but these are exactly the kind of moves that are (almost assuredly) going to make the Switch 2 sell like hotcakes.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
