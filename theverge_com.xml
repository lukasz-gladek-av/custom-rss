            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336355/intel-core-ultra-200-series-hx-h-u-processors-laptops-ces-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Intel is announcing the rest of the Arrow Lake family of CPUs at CES today, with options for thin-and-light laptops all the way up to gaming notebooks. These mobile processors will appear in many of the computers being announced at CES this week, with the 200HX series being paired with next-gen GPUs we’re expecting Nvidia to announce later today and the 200H and 200U series of chips destined for thin-and-light and premium laptops.</p><p>While Intel will continue to supply Lunar Lake CPUs for its range of Copilot Plus laptops, the Arrow Lake mobile family <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285513/intel-ceo-lunar-lake-one-off-memory-package-discrete-gpu">won’t be ditching memory sticks</a> after Intel confirmed in October that the Lunar Lake chips were a one-off experiment.</p><div><figcaption><em>Intel’s Core Ultra 200HX series of processors.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Intel</cite></p></div><p>The new Core Ultra 200HX series will be targeted at gaming laptops and should deliver around 5 percent better single-thread performance and 20 percent multithread performance improvements over previous Raptor Lake-H Refresh processors. </p><p>Intel says new gaming laptops with the “latest discrete GPUs” (read that as Nvidia’s RTX 50-series) will be coming in late Q1. The flagship Intel Core Ultra 9 285HX has 24 cores (8 performance and 16 efficiency cores), can boost up to 5.5GHz, has 4 GPU cores, and a 13 TOPS NPU. That’s enough to meet Intel’s definition of “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/26/24112500/microsoft-ai-pc-intel-windows-copilot-key-requirements">AI PC</a>” but not enough for Microsoft’s Copilot Plus features.</p><p>Consumer laptops that aren’t gaming-focused will come with Intel’s 200H or 200U series of processors. The H variants have a base power of 28 watts, apart from the flagship Core Ultra 9 285H that pushes the power requirements up to 45 watts. These H-series CPUs have a new Intel Arc GPU inside that delivers around 15 percent better graphics performance over previous Meteor Lake chips. </p><div><figcaption><em>The Core Ultra 200HX series lineup.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Intel</cite></p></div><p>CPU performance on these H chips should be around 15 percent better, too, for single-thread tasks. There are five chips available for laptop makers here, including the flagship Intel Core Ultra 9 285H with 16 cores (6 performance, 8 efficiency, and 2 low-power efficiency cores), a boost clock of 5.4GHz, and 8 GPU cores.&nbsp;</p><p>Intel will also release the U series of its Core Ultra 200 processors for laptops that are much more focused on battery life and thin-and-light designs. These chips have a base power of just 15 watts and only turbo up to 57 watts. The top Intel Core Ultra 7 265U processor includes 12 cores (2 performance, 8 efficiency, and 2 low-power efficiency cores) and can boost up to 5.3GHz.</p><p>While the 200HX series of chips won’t appear until late Q1 in gaming laptops, the 200H and 200U chips should start shipping in thin-and-light laptops in the coming weeks.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
