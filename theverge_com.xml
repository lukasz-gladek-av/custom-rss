            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Roblox and <em>Fortnite</em> are two of the biggest games around, and a huge part of why is because they aren’t just one game: instead, they’re vast platforms where you can party up with your friends, dress up in ridiculous digital outfits, and quickly jump from one experience to another. Back in the day, <em>Fortnite</em> copied <em>PUBG</em> by making a battle royale, and now, <em>PUBG</em> is mimicking <em>Fortnite</em> by trying to become more of a platform than a game.</p><p>As part of a roadmap released earlier <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/8308">this year</a>, <em>PUBG</em> developer Krafton said that it would let players create their own modes as part of an alpha, and it revealed more details about the alpha <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/8865">this month</a>. This week, Krafton CFO Dongkeun Bae also discussed the company’s vision for “<em>PUBG</em> 2.0” in <a href="https://youtu.be/lghT4WUpgZQ?feature=shared">an earnings call</a>. “It will not just simply be a battle royale game per se,” he said through a translator.</p><p>The game will also be “a gameplay platform” and Krafton is developing “wide-ranging modes under that objective.” It seems like this approach will be a lot like <em>Fortnite</em>’s, which offers a mix of Epic Games-made modes and user-created experiences. Krafton also isn’t just doing user-generated content (UGC) because it’s “currently the mainstream,” Bae said. With UGC, if it’s opened up to the broader player base, players will be able to “create many different things” with <em>PUBG</em>.</p><p>The shift makes sense. By opening <em>PUBG</em> — which is still one of the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fcharts%2Fmostplayed" rel="sponsored">most-played titles on Steam</a> — to different kinds of experiences, it could grow beyond just hardcore shooter fans. <em>Fortnite</em>’s battle royale modes are still quite popular, but you can also play lower-stakes modes themed around <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24316954/lego-fortnite-brick-life-social-roleplay-game">Lego</a><em>,</em> navigating obstacle courses, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/8/23993494/catch-some-air">racing</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24340770/fortnite-festival-local-multiplayer">playing music together</a>. Epic has put a lot of effort behind expanding from just being a battle royale experience, even if some of them, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241414/fortnite-party-royale-ltm-mode">a combat-free party island</a>, haven’t been big hits. And Roblox’s user-made <em>Grow a Garden</em>, which is a farming simulator, has been <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/robloxs-grow-a-garden-hits-industry-record-213m-concurrent-users-surpassing-pubg-fortnite-and-more/">breaking concurrent player records</a>.</p><p>In some ways, adding user-generated content is a continuation of <em>PUBG</em> and <em>Fortnite</em> following similar tracks. Like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>PUBG</em> has <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/7408">big crossover events</a>, for example<em>. </em>But <em>PUBG</em>’s creator tools have a long way to go to catch up with what’s possible with <em>Fortnite</em> and Roblox, though. Roblox was first released <em>in 2006</em>, and the company offers the <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313860-Roblox-Studio">Roblox Studio</a> for making games and <a href="https://create.roblox.com/">extensive resources for Roblox developers</a>. And Epic is investing heavily in its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/22/23645671/fortnite-unreal-editor-epic-games-state-of-gdc-2023-creative">Unreal Engine-level tools for making <em>Fortnite</em> experiences</a>. But like with Roblox and <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>PUBG</em> players may have already invested time and money that makes switching over to a new game that much more difficult. By letting players make their own experiences, Krafton can keep those players interested in the <em>PUBG</em> universe and potentially pull in new ones.</p><p>One thing Krafton may also learn from <em>Fortnite</em>: this kind of player-driven expansion can take a long time. Epic has been working and iterating for years to build up <em>Fortnite</em>’s ecosystem of user-made experiences, and even then, Epic’s own modes are usually the ones with the most players. It will probably take a while to know if Krafton’s <em>PUBG</em> 2.0 plan is a winner winner chicken dinner.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/716209/pubg-2-0-fortnite-roblox-platform-krafton-earnings]]></content:encoded>
