And now Panic has confirmed that a second season is coming at some point in 2025.</p><p>As for what will be included, we don’t have a lot to go on right now. Panic says that “details on price, the exact number of games, and the developers behind the games of season 2 will come in 2025.” But during a livestream today, the company said it would probably feature “about a dozen games” and will also include a “really cool surprise.”</p><p>Last year Panic launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/7/23627413/playdate-catalog-store-launch-date-best-games">a Playdate store called Catalog</a> where developers could release games outside of the season structure, and during today’s presentation the company said that the shop had surpassed 200 available games. We also got a glimpse at some titles in development, including the adorable word game <em>Bwirds</em> (launching November 26th), a grappling hook-powered platformer called <em>Owlet’s Embrace </em>(later 2025), the cozy puzzle adventure <em>Comet </em>(listed as coming soon), and the self-explanatory <em>Office Chair Curling</em> (also coming soon).</p><p>You can check out the full presentation for more on these games:</p><p>There’s also some good news on the hardware front: Panic said that the hard-to-find handheld is available to order now with an expected shipping date of December.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284644/apex-legends-loses-linux-steam-deck-support-anti-cheat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Apex Legends</em> is one of the only battle royale games that lets you play on a Steam Deck gaming handheld — <em>Fortnite, Valorant, PUBG</em> and more never supported it in the first place, citing concerns about anti-cheat. But today, Electronic Arts and Respawn are taking the game away for that very same reason. </p><p>“In our efforts to combat cheating in Apex, we’ve identified Linux OS as being a path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats. As a result, we’ve decided to block Linux OS access to the game,” writes EA, <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/News-Game-Updates/Dev-Team-Update-Linux-amp-Anti-Cheat/td-p/14217740">in a blog post explaining the decision</a>.</p><p><em>Apex Legends did</em> have anti-cheat software that <em>did</em> run on the Steam Deck — specifically, the game uses Epic Games’ Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC), which has been compatible with the Linux gaming handheld <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690670/epic-eac-anti-cheat-linux-valve-steam-deck-support-games">for over three years now</a>. But that wasn’t good enough for Epic Games’ own <em>Fortnite — </em>Tim Sweeney explained that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/8/22923163/fortnite-steam-deck-update-epic-tim-sweeney">the “threat model” was too large in 2022</a> — and it’s apparently no longer good enough for EA now.</p><p>“Linux cheats are indeed harder to detect and the data shows that they are growing at a rate that requires an outsized level of focus and attention from the team for a relatively small platform. There are also cases in which cheats for the Windows OS get emulated as if it’s on Linux in order to increase the difficulty of detection and prevention,” EA writes today.</p><p>Riot Games has similar concerns. Like many competitive multiplayer game developers, it also doesn’t support <em>Valorant </em>and <em>League of Legends</em> on Linux due to the increased possibility of cheating. In a recent interview with <em>The Verge</em>, Phillip Koskinas, director of anti-cheat on <em>Valorant</em>, discussed why game developers are shying away from Linux support. </p><p>“You can freely manipulate the kernel, and there’s no user mode calls to attest that it’s even genuine,” says Koskinas. “You could make a Linux distribution that’s purpose-built for cheating and we’d be smoked.”</p><p>Linux is so open that you can run an emulated version of <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> right now on a Steam Deck and still have a cheat on the device. “Imagine if Steam Deck just has the security handled so we know it’s a genuine device, it’s fully attested, all these features are enabled, we’d be like cool, go game, no problem” says Koskinas.</p><p>As usual, it’s not clear if this is mostly a Linux problem, or mostly a problem of needing to spend more money on creative solutions than the small number of players might be worth. Last December, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney told us he <em>could</em> possibly justify putting <em>Fortnite</em> on the Steam Deck <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23999300/fortnite-on-steam-deck-sweeney-says-valve-needs-tens-of-millions-of-users-to-justify-it">if it had “tens of millions of users” there</a>, and EA writes today that it weighed its <em>Apex </em>decision based on the “small” population of Linux players versus how “their impact infected a fair amount of players’ games.”</p><p>EA says you’ll still be able to play <em>Apex Legends</em> on a Steam Deck if you install Windows. Valve still hasn’t released its own dual-boot installer to make putting Windows on a Steam Deck easier — the feature has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23954455/the-ability-to-dual-boot-windows-is-still-high-on-the-list-of-steam-deck-priorities">“high on the list” for some time</a> — but it has recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot#:~:text=Yang%20on%20that%3A-,As%20for%20Windows,-%2C%20we%E2%80%99re%20preparing%20to">plugged some of the big holes</a> in its Windows drivers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
