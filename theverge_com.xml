He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony is shutting down the “current version” of the PlayStation Stars loyalty and rewards program that it launched in 2022, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/21/playstation-stars-coming-to-a-close-as-sie-evaluates-new-ways-to-evolve-future-loyalty-program-efforts/">according to a blog post</a>. </p><p>The program let users obtain “digital collectibles,” which Sony described <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/14/23215753/sony-playstation-stars-digital-collectibles-loyalty-points">at the time</a> as “digital representations of things that PlayStation fans enjoy, including figurines of beloved and iconic characters from games and other forms of entertainment, as well as cherished devices that tap into Sony’s history of innovation.”</p><p>While that might make them sound like they could have been NFTs, they weren’t; PlayStation’s Grace Chen, VP of network advertising, loyalty, and licensed merchandise, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/07/14/sony-playstation-stars-announcement/">told <em>The Washington Post</em></a> that the program was “not leveraging any blockchain technologies and definitely not NFTs.”</p><p>In Wednesday’s blog post about the shutdown, Chen says that “since launching the program, we’ve learned a lot from evaluating the types of activities our players respond best to, and as a company, we are always evolving with player and industry trends. Through this evaluation, we have decided to refocus our efforts and will be winding down the current version of PlayStation Stars.”</p><p>As of today, “PlayStation Stars will no longer accept new members for this version of the program,” according to Chen. If you’re in the program now, users can “still earn Digital Collectibles, Points and level up their status” until July 23rd at 10:59AM ET, and after that date, there will be no new PlayStation Stars campaigns.</p><p>“This version” of PlayStation Stars will fully end on November 2nd, 2026.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-18-mario-kart-world-part-3%2F" rel="sponsored">latest entry</a> in its “ask the developer” interview series has some fun new details about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2">the Switch 2 launch title <em>Mario Kart World</em></a>. Among the many things discussed is an explanation for why the game isn’t called <em>Mario Kart 9</em>, despite being a sequel to the best-selling <em>Mario Kart 8</em> — and it has to do with the game’s approach to open-world design.</p><p>“If the idea had just been to add more courses, then I think we would’ve called it <em>Mario Kart 9</em>,“ explained producer Kosuke Yabuki. “But, that wasn’t our approach this time. We wanted to take the series to the next level. So, we decided to drop the numbering this time and go with a completely new title, <em>Mario Kart World</em>. So, we’d already added “<em>MARIO KART WORLD</em>” to the concept art from the early stages of development.“</p><p>The development team also discussed the game’s origins on the original Switch. Many of the key aspects of <em>World</em> — including its interconnected map and increasing the number of players per race from 12 to 24 — were in place early on, but they apparently proved to be a challenge on the previous hardware.</p><p>“When we were developing for the Nintendo Switch system, it was difficult for us to incorporate everything we wanted, so we were always conscious of what we were giving up in return,” programming director Kenta Sato said. “We discussed things like toning down the visuals, lowering the resolution, and we even considered dropping the frame rate to 30 fps in some cases. It was a tough situation.” Yabuki added that when the idea of moving the game to the Switch 2 came up, “It was truly a ray of hope.”</p><p>There’s a lot more to dig into in the four-part Q&amp;A, including the fact that there will be 200 tracks to listen to and how important food is to the game from a worldbuilding perspective. So you should definitely check out <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-18-mario-kart-world-part-1%2F" rel="sponsored">the full thing</a>. My favorite detail, though, is how a character named Cow made it onto the roster of racers. As art director Masaaki Ishikawa explains it “Cow is actually a pivotal character in the <em>Mario Kart</em> series.“</p><p>After looking at this concept art, I can’t help but agree:</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
