He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Some people reported an unwelcome surprise after picking up their Nintendo Switch 2 preorders at GameStop: staples used to attach receipts to Switch 2 boxes ended up damaging the screens on the console, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-screen-punctures-ruin-launch-day-for-fans-due-to-store-receipts-stapled-into-consoles-box">as reported by <em>IGN</em></a>. However, GameStop says this was an issue that was “isolated” to a single store and that it has already offered replacements.</p><p>When you open the box for the Switch 2, the tablet / screen part of the device is just under the top flap of the packaging. The tablet’s proximity to the top of the box possibly explains how staples could get through and poke holes in the screen — especially if the person using the stapler gave it a solid push.</p><p>Reports started trickling in overnight as people got their preorders. In <a href="https://x.com/Oadhan/status/1930496875532018128">this post on X</a>, for example, you can see photos of two dots on the box, a bag, and the screen.</p><p>To <em>IGN</em>, a GameStop spokesperson said that it was “investigating the matter” and promised to “make customers whole.” And on Thursday, one Reddit user affected by the problem <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1l43c3z/update_on_the_staple_issue/?share_id=Pqlu60ioQUZJOFKDEvyfD">said that</a> they spoke with a GameStop manager who said they would be able to exchange their damaged unit.</p><p>“We’ve addressed a unique case of staples damaging Switch 2 screens – isolated to one store,” GameStop says <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1930688438342176780">in a post on X</a>. “Replacements have been offered. Staplers have been confiscated.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
