The company also revealed some new features for the games, including the option to change the color of Virtual Boy titles which were notoriously limited to only bright red on the original hardware.</p><p>Both the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fvirtual-boy-for-nintendo-switch-2-120829%2F" rel="sponsored">$99.99 Virtual Boy headset accessory</a> and the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fvirtual-boy-cardboard-model-for-nintendo-switch-2-120828%2F" rel="sponsored">$24.99 cardboard version</a> require a Switch or Switch 2 console to be inserted in order to play Virtual Boy games. The lineup of games launching alongside the accessories on February 17th include <em>Teleroboxer</em>, <em>Galactic Pinball</em>, <em>Red Alarm</em>, <em>Golf</em>, <em>Virtual Boy Wario Land</em>, <em>3-D Tetris</em>, and <em>The Mansion of Innsmouth</em>.</p><p>Virtual Boy titles coming later in 2026 include <em>Mario Clash</em>, <em>Mario’s Tennis</em>, <em>Jack Bros.</em>, <em>Space Invaders Virtual Collection</em>, <em>Virtual Bowling</em>, <em>Vertical Force</em>, and <em>V-Tetris</em>. Nintendo Switch Online will also feature two previously unreleased Virtual Boy games “coming later this year.” <em>Zero Racers</em>, and <em>D-Hopper</em>.</p><p>Players will be able to rewind and replay Virtual Boy games through the Switch Online service and remap controls. That’s especially useful as neither headset accessory includes the original Virtual Boy’s unique controller which featured a pair of D-pads. However, as welcome as the color changing feature will be when it also launches later this year, it will only be available for the more expensive Virtual Boy headset accessory and will require you to remove its lens cover first.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/868569/nintendo-switch-online-virtual-boy-3d-lineup-launch]]></content:encoded>
