            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/629162/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>There are a lot of “simulator” games out there that gamify everything from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/31/23148156/euro-truck-simulator-heart-of-russia-dlc-cancelled-ukraine-invasion">driving your own big rig</a> to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mitchwallace/2024/12/21/nostalgia-sim-inkonbini-looks-like-retail-shenmue/">running your own Japanese convenience store</a>. Some of them hit, like the one about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/1/5569950/goat-simulator-review">being a goat</a> which is on its third iteration. And some of them <em>hit</em> like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21254550/powerwash-simulator-game-pc-demo-clean-house">PowerWash Simulator</a> </em>which is getting a sequel slated for release later this year.</p></div><p><em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> will feature a new campaign with new locations and jobs to expand your power washing empire. To further drive home the fact this game is wish fulfillment for aspiring home owners, <em>PWS2</em> will also add a home base you can customize with furniture and other cosmetics. But more than anything, I’m excited by the prospect of the new split-screen co-op mode.</p><p>I played <em>PowerWash Simulator</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/powerwash-simulator-is-why-i-shouldnt-be-a-homeowner-1846801530">waaay back in 2021</a> when there was just the demo. I found myself utterly delighted by how the simplistic idea of methodically cleaning grime off a surface with a destructive power tool lit up my brain. Since its release in 2022, the game has exploded in complexity and content with crossover content packs that approach <em>Fortnite</em> levels of wacky metaverse shenanigans. There’s a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/06/29/powerwash-simulator-dives-into-bikini-bottom/"><em>SpongeBob</em> pack</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/18/23561389/why-is-lara-crofts-mansion-so-damn-dirty-i-must-know">a <em>Tomb Raider</em> pack</a>, and even a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/23601203/final-fantasy-7-powerwash-simulator-dlc-corporate-environmental-disasters"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em> pack</a> that lets you valiantly attempt to clean up the perpetually dirty streets of Midgar.</p><p>The developers at FuturLab tapped into something unique, and made <em>PowerWash Simulator </em>standout amidst a veritable ocean of simulator games and it seems like <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> is primed to do the same. It launches this year on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Epic Games announced today that it’s teaming up with Qualcomm to add Windows on Snapdragon support for Easy Anti-Cheat, which will let the game be compatible with those devices.</p><p>“Over the last year, the introduction of Windows 11 Arm-based laptops has transformed the PC landscape, and laptops with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Series processors represent a rapidly growing segment of the PC gaming market,” <a href="https://onlineservices.epicgames.com/en-US/news/windows-on-snapdragon-support-is-coming-to-epic-online-services-anti-cheat-and-fortnite">Epic says in a blog post</a>. “However, the majority of PC games today are compiled for x64, which doesn’t translate directly to the Windows on Snapdragon architecture. Due to the way anti-cheat software works with x64 features, additional tooling is required for compatibility with these devices.”</p><p>Epic says that “hundreds” of multiplayer games rely on Easy Anti-Cheat, including <em>Fortnite</em>, and that “battle-testing Windows on Snapdragon anti-cheat support with <em>Fortnite</em> will help ensure smooth implementations in other games.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/628323/google-play-games-android-mobile<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Ahead of the Game Developers Conference next week, Google is announcing that all mobile Android games will be available by default on Google Play Games on PC unless a developer opts out. The change could significantly boost the number of games on the platform, as previously, developers had to opt in.</p><p>Google Play Games on PC was originally launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891046/google-play-games-android-games-windows-pc-beta-launch">in beta</a> in 2022 as a way for people to play Android games on their PC, and Google has been slowly expanding its availability and building on the program since then.</p><p>As part of its announcements on Thursday, Google is also introducing a new “playability badge” for mobile games that are available on PC to highlight how well they run. An “optimized” badge means a game “meets all of our quality standards for a great gaming experience” and a “playable” badge means a game “meets the minimum requirements to play well on a PC,” writes Aurash Mahbod, VP and GM of Games on Google Play. (The system sounds a bit like Steam’s badges for Steam Deck compatibility.)</p><p>However, if a game has an “untested” badge, that means a user will only see it if they specifically search for it, Google’s Nia Carter tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Google is investing more in bringing PC games to Google Play Games on PC as well. There are already more than 50 native PC titles on the platform, Carter says, and later this year, Google plans to open up its native PC program to all native PC developers so they can bring over their games, according to Mahbod.</p><p>Google is making Google Play Games on PC more widely available, too; the company has offered a limited catalog of games on AMD laptops and desktops, but Google will now offer the full catalog on AMD laptops and desktops. In addition, Google is “partnering with PC OEMs to make Google Play Games accessible right from the start menu on new devices starting this year,” Mahbod says. Google is also rolling out multi-account and multi-instance support for Google Play Games on PC this month.</p><p>Google will make Google Play Games on PC generally available this year, according to Mahbod.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
