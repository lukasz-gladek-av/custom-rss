Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo has won its legal battle against Dstorage, the French company it accused of hosting pirated games on its file-sharing site 1fichier.com. In a press release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-latest-legal-win-against-piracy-significant-for-the-entire-games-industry">sent to outlets like <em>Eurogamer</em></a> and <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/french-supreme-court-rules-in-favour-of-nintendo-in-lawsuit-against-1fichier-for-hosting-pirated-content.667952/"><em>GBATemp</em></a>, Nintendo says a French Court agreed that 1fichier.com is “liable for failing to remove or block access to unauthorised copies of Nintendo games stored on this platform.”</p><p>In 2021, a Paris court ordered Dstorage to <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-awarded-1-13m-after-file-hosting-site-failed-to-remove-pirated-games-210608/">pay Nintendo $1.13 million</a> for failing to remove pirated games despite warnings from Nintendo. Though Dstorage appealed this decision, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-wins-case-against-french-filesharing-service-hosting-pirated-games">the court ultimately sided with Nintendo</a>. The company later brought the case before the highest French judiciary court, which has now ruled against Dstorage as well.</p><p>“Nintendo is pleased with the Court’s finding of liability against DSTORAGE and believes that it is significant not only for Nintendo, but for the entire games industry,” Nintendo said in its press release. It adds that the decision “will prevent sharehosters like 1fichier.com” from claiming they need a court order to follow through on requests to remove copyrighted content.</p><p>Nintendo has only stepped up its legal fights over the past year. In 2024, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">company sued Yuzu</a>, the developers behind a Nintendo Switch emulator, resulting in it shutting down completely, and also went after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259791/nintendo-ryujinx-switch-emulator-gdkchan-removed-downloads-github">the Switch emulator Ryujinx</a>. It also sued the developers of <em>Palworld</em> for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/8/24291232/nintendo-pocketpair-palworld-lawsuit-patents">allegedly infringing on its patents</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
