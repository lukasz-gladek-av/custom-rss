            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339206/agdq-2025-batman-forever-the-arcade-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick">Awesome Games Done Quick</a>, the annual charity speedrunning marathon <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24334425/how-to-watch-awesome-games-done-quick-agdq-2025">is in full swing</a>, already amassing over $500,000 for the Prevent Cancer Foundation. With three more days to go, there’s a great many runs of popular games coming up. But relying on the schedule or your own preferences to determine when to tune in is a surefire way to miss the best AGDQ has to offer.</p><p>Take today, for example. I’ve never played <em>Batman Forever: The Arcade Game</em>, but after watching the speedrun, I might have to. It’s a Batman-flavored beat-’em-up that bears precious little resemblance to the movie it’s based on. The runner, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lrock617">LRock617</a>, chose to play as Robin and within moments of starting the game, I was hooked. The graphics were reminiscent of the early <em>Mortal Kombat</em> games, appropriate since it was published by Acclaim Entertainment. But there was a surreality to them that — when combined with Robin’s overpowered abilities (like one that has him essentially go Super Saiyan), the runner’s charisma in explaining what’s happening, and the audience getting in on the fun with funny donation messages — gave the run an absurd goofiness that was a sorely needed shot in the arm at 9AM on a Wednesday morning. And if I hadn’t had the marathon on in the background, I would have missed it.</p><p>Games Done Quick’s schedule is set up to have the most popular games or gimmicky runs take place during the early evenings and weekends — the time when folks are most likely to tune in. But I’ve found some of my favorite runs are of games I’ve never heard of played well outside those primetime hours. I’ve developed a deep an abiding love of <em>Mr. Bones</em>, a Sega Saturn game I have never played, because I found it during <a href="https://kotaku.com/after-a-very-shitty-day-the-mr-bones-speedrun-helped-1846020990">a bout of January 6th-induced insomnia</a>. The <a href="https://youtu.be/NgQ6AKLsOwY?si=3QgLKu_rA81EL4l9"><em>Ratatouille</em> run from Summer Games Done Quick 2023</a>, one of that year’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/summer-games-done-quick-2023-is-over-so-come-watch-ratatouille-cosplay">stand</a>-<a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/lists/best-speedruns-sgdq-2023">out</a> runs, happened on a Tuesday at 11AM. </p><p>More than simply being entertained, keeping GDQ on all the time is a good way to find your next indie game. I didn’t know what<em> </em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fpizza-possum-switch%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOorvTrs9fk-4p2sjbGWy50hNKRxjjWIIs2vgyJgyxUJLJLNp-6oE"><em>Pizza Possum</em></a> was, but after <a href="https://youtu.be/HPjJbwzn9k8?si=OooLH-EdTHGfzuG0">watching the speedrun</a>, it’s on my list of co-op games to try at home. There’s still plenty of AGDQ left to enjoy. There’s a <em>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</em> run that’ll be played while the runner plays the piano and I cannot wait for the <em>Crazy Taxi</em> run that’ll be accompanied by a live band playing covers of the songs in the game. But I’m even more excited to find the next hidden gem of the marathon purely by chance.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo isn’t officially at CES, but it might have stolen the show anyway: accessories-maker Genki brought a 3D-printed mockup of what it says is Nintendo’s Switch successor, and we got to hold it and take some high-resolution pictures. </p><p>Based on the mockup of what we’ll call the Switch 2, Nintendo’s next console appears to be wider than the original, with slightly larger Joy-Con controllers that seem like they’ll be more comfortable to hold. Compared to a Steam Deck OLED, the Switch 2 mockup still feels noticeably smaller, in part because the Joy-Cons are not as pronounced and ergonomic as the Deck’s grips. But the mockup still feels closer in size to Valve’s handheld than the original Switch.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</p><p><figcaption><em>A rough size comparison with a Steam Deck OLED.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>As previous rumors have indicated, the Switch 2’s Joy-Cons will attach to the console via magnets instead of a sliding rail, Genki cofounder and CEO Eddie Tsai tells <em>The Verge</em>. To detach a Joy-Con from the Switch 2, you press a big button at the top of the backside of each controller, Tsai says, and that button apparently pushes out a pin that nudges against the chassis of the console, disconnecting the magnets.</p><p>You can remove the Joy-Cons with brute force if you really wanted to, according to Tsai, but he says, overall, they feel secure for regular use and that the big release button detaches the Joy-Cons with ease. Tsai declined to share where he’d learned details of the new console.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->8</p><p><figcaption><em>The left JoyCon without pressing the detachment button.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Tsai also tells <em>The Verge</em> that housed within the mounting channel of the Joy-Cons is an optical sensor, and by using another attachment the new Joy-Cons may offer mouse-like functionality. It sounds a bit like what Lenovo does <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">with its Legion Go handheld</a>.</p><p>Nintendo has promised that it will announce the Switch’s successor <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">before April 2025</a>, and as that deadline creeps closer, there have been waves of leaks and rumors about the new hardware. In December, YouTube channel SwitchUp posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nacn4yqUY1s">a video</a> showing a 3D-printed, non-functional Switch 2 mockup provided by a Chinese case manufacturer. That mockup basically looked like the current Switch but bigger, and it revealed a few other potential changes like a new USB-C port on the top of the device and a mysterious new square button under the Home button on the right Joy-Con.</p><p>Days later, accessories-maker Dbrand announced its “Killswitch 2” case, and CEO Adam Ijaz <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">told <em>The Verge</em></a> that it was designed based on “actual dimensions”&nbsp;based on a “3D scan of the real hardware.” Ijaz also said that it was his “understanding” that the console’s Joy-Cons are magnetically attached. And Dbrand’s imagery showed that the new square button had a “C” printed on it, though Ijaz didn’t know what it was. Days after that, our colleague Sean Hollister spoke with a Redditor who shared apparent photos <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld">of the Switch 2’s dock</a> and the&nbsp;inside&nbsp;of what appears to be a Switch 2 Joy-Con.</p><p>With that April 2025 deadline inching closer every day, it seems like it won’t be long until Nintendo officially, finally reveals the Switch 2. But until that happens, at least we have these pictures to look at.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
