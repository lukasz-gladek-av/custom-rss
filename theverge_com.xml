Qualcomm is hinting about potential Windows gaming handhelds showing up at the Game Developers Conference <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855222/qualcomm-hints-we-might-see-windows-gaming-handhelds-at-gdc-in-march">in March</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855463/amd-strix-halo-ai-max-plus-388-392-handheld-gaming">AMD’s new Strix Halo chips</a> could lead to more powerful handhelds.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-intel-is-making-its-own-handheld-gaming-pc-chips-at-ces-2026">According to <em>IGN</em></a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/intel-is-building-a-handheld-gaming-platform-including-a-dedicated-chip/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>, sources say Intel is going to compete by developing a custom Intel Core G3 “variant or variants” just for handhelds that could outperform the Arc B390 GPU on the chips it just announced. <em>IGN </em>reports that by using the new 18A process, Intel can cut different die slices, and “spec the chips to offer better performance on the GPU where you want it.”</p><p>As for concrete details about the gaming platform, we’re going to have to wait. According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGLg9AghJao">Intel’s Dan Rogers yesterday</a>, the company will have “more news to share on that from our hardware and software partners later this year.” The Intel-based MSI Claw saw a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/769609/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-intel-review">marked improvement</a> when it jumped to Lunar Lake, and hopefully the new platform keeps up that positive trend.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/857252/intel-handheld-gaming-pc-panther-lake-custom-cpu]]></content:encoded>
