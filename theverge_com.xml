They can all run <em>Doom, </em>and naturally, so can Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">adorable Alarmo alarm clock</a>. It was only a matter of time before someone pulled that off, but what I didn’t expect was that when it happened, it would be playable.</p></div><p>That’s exactly what hacker GaryOberNicht, who recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283916/sound-the-alarmo">figured out how</a> to run custom firmware on the Alarmo, did in a video <a href="https://social.treehouse.systems/@garyodernichts/113414373708017840">posted to Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://x.com/GaryOderNichts/status/1852753537001718021">their X account</a> yesterday. In it, they play by turning or pressing the mushroom-shaped blob on top of the Alarmo to move and pressing the other buttons to shoot or open doors. Here, have a look:</p><p>Gary <a href="https://social.treehouse.systems/@garyodernichts/113414374157540351">said</a> it’s “possible to load the shareware version of Doom entirely from USB, without modifying the Alarmo.” And they’ve put the software and instructions for running it <a href="https://github.com/GaryOderNichts/alarmo_doom">on Github</a>, so almost any sufficiently knowledgeable and determined Alarmo owner can do it, too. Best of all, it can be done without opening the clock up at all.</p><p>How did they pull this off? Gary explains in a <a href="https://garyodernichts.blogspot.com/2024/10/looking-into-nintendo-alarmo.html">blog post</a> that after another person called Spinda <a href="https://x.com/_spinda/status/1845279277304119318">hacked the Alarmo</a> (with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23433594/flipper-zero-hacking-gadget-wireless-pentesting-open-source-antenna">Flipper Zero</a>) and dumped the firmware from memory, Gary worked out a method that uses a USB mode and the USB-C port to point the Alarmo to custom external firmware, instead. </p><p>Given how easy it appears to be reproduce what Gary has done, Alarmo software modding almost certainly won’t just stop at <em>Doom</em>. Of course, how far any online community efforts to turn the Alarmo into a bizarro game console will get probably depends on how Nintendo, which has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">particularly active</a> with its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">copyright</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259791/nintendo-ryujinx-switch-emulator-gdkchan-removed-downloads-github">disputes</a> lately, feels about it. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
