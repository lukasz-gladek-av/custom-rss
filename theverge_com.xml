If a DLC drop gets delayed, Steam will let developers reschedule it up to 3 months later. And if developers have to cancel a DLC, buyers must get a refund for the item value.</p><p>Steam is also redefining what a season pass is:</p><div><blockquote><p>Because a Season Pass is effectively a DLC pre-purchase, creating a Season Pass on Steam has many of the considerations and restrictions as outlined in the documentation on&nbsp;<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/prepurchase">pre-purchases</a>. For these reasons, we will not offer a Season Pass except in a few rare cases with partners with which we have a well-established relationship and that have a proven track record on Steam.</p></blockquote></div><p>Steam also provided a strong disclaimer for developers:</p><div><blockquote><p>If you aren’t ready to clearly communicate about the content included in each DLC AND when each DLC will be ready for launch, you shouldn’t offer a Season Pass on Steam.</p></blockquote></div><p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/pc-gaming/steam-is-forcing-games-to-be-more-clear-about-whats-in-their-season-passes-and-only-allowing-devs-with-a-proven-track-record-to-sell-them/">As noted by <em>Games Radar</em></a>, the new rules might be more challenging for indie developers who don’t have a lot of games under their belts to pass Steam’s requirements. They also may not have enough resources to build up a guaranteed DLC list — but in that case perhaps they aren’t big enough to offer a season pass anyway.</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301975/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-doge-plan"><h2>Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have spelled out their plans for DOGE</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300569/jaguar-rebrand-new-logo-ev"><h2>Jaguar is now JaGUar</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301740/hyundai-ioniq-9-three-row-electric-suv-laas"><h2>The Hyundai Ioniq 9 is a three-row electric SUV with room to grow</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301489/amazon-echo-show-21-smart-display-price-specs-release-date"><h2>Amazon’s new&nbsp;Echo&nbsp;Show 21 has a huge screen and built-in&nbsp;smart home&nbsp;hub</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24300617/doj-google-search-antitrust-chrome-breakup"><h2>DOJ says Google must sell Chrome to crack open its search monopoly</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

First up is the game’s <a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fen-ca%2Fgame%2Fstar-wars%2Foutlaws%2Fnews-updates%2F1Q4y5lMJwdUUt6qXzbWKPI%2Fstar-wars-outlaws-game-update-showcase-wrapup">first batch of downloadable content</a>, which adds a new storyline involving Lando Calrissian and what appears to be a very dangerous game of Sabacc. The new expansion is called <em>Wild Card </em>and will be followed by a second DLC update next spring called <em>A Pirate’s Fortune</em>.</p><p>Perhaps more significant, today, <em>Outlaws</em> is also getting a major update to address some of the game’s technical and design issues. Ubisoft describes it as the game’s “biggest patch yet.” Most notable, it seems, is that the stealth sections — a major point of frustration for many players — have been toned down.</p><p>Ubisoft says that the update includes “updates to stealth and combat that allow players greater choice, including using stealth or reaching for their blaster, even in syndicate territories in cities.” Similarly, there are “enemy AI and detection improvements, with players being notified when they’re being detected and can choose to escalate or change tactics to remain in stealth.”</p><div><p>Here’s how creative director Drew Rechner <a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgame%2Fstar-wars%2Foutlaws%2Fnews-updates%2F4U9vshW5I0KpPRJFhQspn2%2Fstar-wars-outlaws-dev-update-3-the-scoundrels-journey">explains the changes</a>:</p></div><div><blockquote><p>Our first step in expanding player choice is removing forced stealth from almost all quest objectives. This doesn’t mean that sneaking is no longer a viable or even preferable option in some cases. Rather, if you’re caught while sneaking, the objective won’t fail and reset you to the last checkpoint. Instead, you’ll seamlessly transition into combat.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></div><p>You can check out the full patch notes <a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fen-ca%2Fgame%2Fstar-wars%2Foutlaws%2Fnews-updates%2F1sXCR6GmB3Kn7OrKiy8DPO%2Fstar-wars-outlaws-title-update-140">right here</a>, and get an overview in the video below.</p><p>Also notable: while <em>Outlaws</em> has been on PC since launch, it was only available through the Epic Games Store and Ubisoft Connect.
