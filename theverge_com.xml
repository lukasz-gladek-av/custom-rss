            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Roblox is introducing two new systems that are designed to further encourage creators to bring players onto the social games platform on a regular basis. The systems, part of what Roblox is calling Creator Rewards, will roll out beginning July 24th.</p><p>One is the Daily Engagement Reward program, which gives Roblox creators 5 Robux for an “active spender” on the platform who spends at least 10 minutes in their experience in one day. 5 Robux isn’t a lot on its own — depending on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/2/24311337/roblox-robux-app-store-fees-worth-more-party">where you buy Robux</a>, that can translate to <a href="https://www.roblox.com/upgrades/robux">about five cents</a> — but if an experience brings back thousands <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/grow-a-garden-roblox-interview">or millions</a> of people every day, that could add up quickly. Roblox may also change the payout in the future, it says <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/introducing-creator-rewards-earn-more-by-growing-the-community/3777628">in a blog post</a>.</p><p>To be eligible for the reward, a creator’s experience must also be one of the first three experiences an active spender (which the platform defines as a user who has spent at least $9.99 in the last 60 days) launches each day.</p><p>The choice to offer these payouts after the first three experiences isn’t an exact science, Roblox CPO Manuel Bronstein tells <em>The Verge</em>. It’s more that those first three experiences are why you may come to the platform in a given day, he says, while you might visit experiences after those first three because you found something new through recommendations or because of a friend’s suggestion.</p><p>Bronstein doesn’t think creators will change their experiences to optimize just for that 10-minute threshold. “Continue to build a great product, continue to build a great game, continue to build a great experience, and you will benefit from this reward,” he says.</p><p>He also points out that these engagement-based rewards aren’t the sole mechanism for Roblox creators to make money. The “vast” majority of transactions for Roblox developers come from transactions that they generate on the platform, according to Bronstein, and creators can also monetize with things like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/9/23343459/roblox-age-guidelines-metaverse-ads-developer-conference-announcements">ads</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/15/23962567/you-can-now-buy-subscriptions-in-roblox-experiences-that-offer-them">subscriptions</a>, and even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/667470/roblox-creators-physical-merch-in-game-shopify-amp">selling physical goods</a>.</p><p>This new reward system will replace the current <a href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/production/monetization/engagement-based-payouts">engagement-based payouts program</a>, which pays out Robux based on playtime from people who are subscribers to <a href="https://www.roblox.com/premium/membership">Roblox Premium</a>. Bronstein says that program didn’t reward user acquisition or user reactivation, and wasn’t as transparent as Roblox wanted it to be. (He also says this new program isn’t a response to Epic Games’ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/28/23659492/fortnite-creator-economy-2-0-epic-games-catch">engagement-based payouts system for <em>Fortnite</em></a>.)</p><p>The second program Roblox is adding is the Audience Expansion Reward, which pays creators a revenue share of purchases from Roblox users who join or return to the platform because of them. Roblox will apply the credit if a player joins the platform through a creator’s link or if a player searches for a creator’s experience on Roblox by name and plays for at least 10 minutes. This new system will eventually take over for Roblox’s <a href="https://create.roblox.com/affiliate">current Creator Affiliate program</a>. This program will offer a 35 percent revenue share to creators on up to the first $100 those new or returning users spend in their first two months on Roblox.</p><p>Roblox says it’s on track to pay out $1 billion to creators this year. Last year, it paid out more than $922 million, which far exceeds the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349588/epic-paid-fortnite-creators-a-total-of-352m-in-2024">$352 million Epic paid to <em>Fortnite</em> creators</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/691308/roblox-daily-engagement-audience-expansion-reward-program-payouts-creator-rewards]]></content:encoded>

Di Benedetto</a> <span>is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget.

The cards will be made by third-party partners like Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, Zotac, and others, with expected shipments in the second half of July. Nvidia’s Game Ready Drivers are expected to receive an update for compatibility with the new cards in early July. </p><p>The <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Flaptops%2Fcompare%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DGeForce%2520RTX%25205050%2520Laptop%2520GPU" rel="sponsored">RTX 5050 laptop GPU</a> will draw 35W to 100W of power and use 8GB of GDDR7 VRAM and 2,560 Blackwell CUDA cores. Laptops running a 5050 GPU are expected to start at $999, with <a href="https://marketplace.nvidia.com/en-us/consumer/gaming-laptops/?locale=en-us&amp;page=1&amp;limit=12&amp;gpu=RTX%205050&amp;gpu_filter=RTX%205090~8,RTX%205080~16,RTX%205070%20Ti~9,RTX%205070~7,RTX%205060~3,RTX%205050~1,RTX%204080~1,RTX%204070~8,RTX%204060~7,RTX%204050~8,RTX%203050~1,RTX%202050~3">availability of some models beginning today</a>. Early models launching before Nvidia’s Game Ready Drivers are released will have drivers for the 5050 GPU pre-installed. GDDR7 VRAM is more power efficient than GDDR6, allowing the laptop version of the 5050 to fit into slimmer notebooks without getting quite as hot.</p><p>The choice to go with GDDR6 on the desktop cards feels like an odd one, even though it should outperform the laptop version with GDDR7. The desktop RTX 5050 matches the RTX 5060 with 8GB of VRAM, but being GDDR6 and having 1,280 fewer CUDA cores ensures it should have a noticeable gap in performance with the card directly above it.</p><p>Nvidia is claiming the 5050 will be able to deliver “an immersive ray-traced experience with high settings in single-player games such as <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Avowed</em>, thanks to DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation.” Its chart shows the 5050 achieving over 150 fps in that scenario with 4x MFG turned on. However, keep in mind that the fine print indicates that’s all while the GPU was paired with a $479 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24288948/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-review-cpu-processor-benchmark-test">AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a> CPU running at 1080p resolution. In full raster, Nvidia claims the RTX 5050 is about 60 percent faster than the two-generations-old RTX 3050.</p><p>The RTX 5050 is the direct replacement of that RTX 3050, which remains one of the most popular GPUs <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fhwsurvey%2Fvideocard%2F" rel="sponsored">in use on Steam</a>. Nvidia never announced a desktop <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-4050.c3892">RTX 4050</a>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/692045/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5050-desktop-laptop-gpu-gddr6-gddr7]]></content:encoded>
