But it has survived the test of time, outlived Google’s Stadia, and has attracted companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/6/23906915/amazon-luna-buy-ubisoft-games-cloud-gaming-service">Ubisoft</a>, and now, EA.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/637258/samsung-990-pro-ssd-4tb-pc-laptop-ps5<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Samsung launched its new, very fast <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619414/samsung-9100-pro-gen-5-pcie-ssd-specs-price-release-date">9100 Pro PCIe Gen 5 SSD</a> last week, and the prices are pretty high, starting at $199.99 for the 1TB model without a heatsink pre-installed. This had me looking at prices for its predecessor, the still-very-fast 990 Pro, and I was happy to see that its 4TB model is currently selling for $279.99 at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-990-PRO-M-2-2280-4TB-PCI-Express-Gen-4-0-x4-NVMe-2-0-V7-V-NAND-3bit-MLC-Internal-Solid-State-Drive-SSD-MZ-V9P4T0B-AM-Non-Heatsink%2F5075942372" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a> and at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CHGT1KFJ/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> as part of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/634880/amazon-big-spring-sale-march-2025-prime-day-deals-shop">Big Spring Sale</a> — more or less half off the price of the 9100 Pro’s 4 TB version (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Computing-Workstations-VAP1T0B-AM/dp/B0DX2GJ1YR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$549.99</a>).</p><p>Why buy the 990 Pro over the 9100 Pro? Well, the 9100 Pro requires PCIe Gen 5-ready hardware to take advantage of its speeds, and that tech is far from being affordable or mainstream at the moment.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/24/23319258/samsung-990-pro-ssd-speeds-heatsink-ps5">we wrote</a> when the 990 Pro launched in 2022, that SSD came close to PCIe Gen 4’s theoretical speed limit, making it among the quicker options out there for PC (its faster speed is wasted on the PS5, though it’ll work fine in one). It’s still a great value today, especially as prices for all storage configurations have dropped considerably. Considering that a 2TB version of the 990 Pro is $170 and doubling the storage costs just about $100 more, we think that the 4TB is the one to get right now. As game install sizes continue to increase, it’ll be a great addition to any PS5, or in any desktop or laptop that supports PCIe Gen 4 speeds.</p><p>Given that the 990 Pro we’re recommending doesn’t have a heatsink (one’s suggested for use in the PS5, and it’s never a bad idea on PC), it’s <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=m2+ssd+heatsink&amp;i=electronics&amp;crid=2C532BVY97UYG&amp;sprefix=m2+ssd+heatsink%2Celectronics%2C107&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2&amp;tag=theverge02-20">cheaper to buy and install your own instead</a> of paying Samsung a $20 premium for the heatsink edition of the 990 Pro.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/637307/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-card-lending-system<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In addition to showing off a bunch of new games including a brief glimpse at <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/630255/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-trailer">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a></em>, Nintendo also shared some new features coming to the Switch. Coming in an April system update, Nintendo is introducing a new game management system called “virtual game cards.” Virtual game cards are meant to function similarly to physical ones. When the feature goes live, purchases of digital games on the Nintendo eShop will automatically create a virtual game card that you’ll be able to manage from a dedicated screen.</p><p>Virtual game cards also make sharing games between consoles simpler. Using a local wi-fi connection, you can use virtual game cards to transfer digital games between Switch 1 and Switch 2 consoles. But perhaps the most interesting aspect of this feature is that now, you’ll be able to lend games to members of your Nintendo Switch Family account. You can only lend out one game per person and only for two weeks, but its still very neat that Nintendo has replicated the spirit of renting video games from Blockbuster.</p><p>Since Nintendo already told us the Switch 2 is backwards compatible, it seems like this new virtual game card system was created to ease the transition for players upgrading their consoles. We’ll learn more about the Swtich 2 and all its new features during the Switch 2 direct on April 2nd.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
