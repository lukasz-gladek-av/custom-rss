            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">One year ago</a>, Lenovo became the first company besides Valve to announce a handheld with SteamOS instead of Windows. The result was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/704903/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-os-review-z2-go-z1-extreme">the Legion Go S with SteamOS</a>; no Steam Deck killer due to price and battery life, but a big step forward in performance and pick-up-and-play portability.</p><p>Now, Lenovo’s doing it again — it’s bringing SteamOS to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/769776/legion-go-2-official-lenovo-new-flagship-handheld-cost">Legion Go 2</a>, its flagship handheld with detachable Nintendo Switch-like controllers and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/lenovo/769314/lenovo-legion-go-2-oled-vrr-nits-leak-evleaks">the most advanced screen in a handheld yet</a>. Lenovo plans to begin selling a SteamOS version in June starting at $1,199, the company just announced at CES 2026 in Las Vegas. Specs are otherwise the same.</p><p>Yes, that is <em>quite</em> the price tag and quite the wait before it arrives! Lenovo already launched the Windows version of this handheld at the end of October, so it’ll already be seven-to-eight months old by the time SteamOS debuts. (With the Legion Go S, the Windows version only had a three-month head start.)</p><p>By then, it’s possible we’ll have handhelds with more powerful <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/797146/intel-panther-lake-core-series-3-architecture-platform-feature-reveal">Intel Panther Lake chips</a> — we’ve already seen Intel’s existing Lunar Lake offering <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/799698/xbox-ally-x-review-asus-microsoft-full-screen-experience#:~:text=in%20my%20tests.-,720p%20benchmarks,-Game%20and%20power">better performance in some games</a> than the Legion Go 2’s AMD Z2 Extreme can offer.</p><p>But simply switching from Windows to SteamOS can offer a notable performance boost, too, and the Legion Go 2 isn’t just premium because of an AMD chip. As of this writing, it’s the only handheld on the market with a variable-refresh-rate OLED screen to make games look amazing and one of the few that doubles as a tablet, with an excellent integrated kickstand and comfortable sculpted detachable wireless controllers for tray table play. There’s even an FPS mouse built into one of those controllers, with a snap-on puck to let it glide smoothly across a table.</p><p>I called the original Legion Go <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">“the Swiss Army knife of handhelds</a>,” and my time with the Legion Go 2 is much the same. I still find the newer Legion Go 2 a bit heavy and awkward with all the extra mouse buttons beneath my fingers as I grip, but there’s no denying its versatility. Speaking of which: you can already load Bazzite onto a Legion Go 2 if you want a preview of SteamOS there. Everything seems to work, including the detachable controllers and RGB lighting.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/853587/lenovo-legion-go-2-steam-os-annoucement-price-release-date]]></content:encoded>
