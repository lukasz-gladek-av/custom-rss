The company is teasing a collaboration with Lego that will see the original grey brick known as a Game Boy rendered in Lego blocks. There are no details yet, aside from the fact that it’ll be out in October, but it’s likely an official reveal is coming soon.</p><div><p>This isn’t the first collab between the two companies, as there have been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24205955/lego-nintendo-super-mario-yoshi-snes-gaming-sdcc">a handful of Lego sets based on Nintendo properties</a>, along with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21322481/lego-nintendo-nes-super-mario-interactive-set-replica">a blocky rendition of the NES</a>.</p></div><div><p>If you’re keeping track, this is part of a lengthy string of non-Switch 2 announcements and launches that Nintendo has made over the last few months. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256070/nintendo-museum-kyoto-tour-shigeru-miyamoto">A Nintendo museum opened in Kyoto in October</a>, and after that the company released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">an alarm clock called Alarmo</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284073/nintendo-music-streaming-app-switch-online-subscribers">started a music streaming service full of classic gaming tunes</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275596/nintendo-switch-online-beta-playtest-program-leak-mmo">kicked off a test for a mysterious MMO</a>. At this rate, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276650/nintendo-switch-2-predictions-playtest-alarmo">it’s almost pointless to guess what Nintendo will do next</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24334903/my-arcade-super-retrochamp-handheld-gaming-retro-sega-nintendo-cartridges<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>First announced at CES four years ago, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21051902/my-arcade-super-retro-champ-snes-sega-genesis-games-ces-2020">My Arcade’s Super Retro Champ was a chunky handheld</a> that could play classic 16-bit titles using original Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo cartridges. The console didn’t end up launching, but at CES 2025, My Arcade is reviving it with an expected release later this year.</p><p>The design and functionality of the Super Retro Champ appears nearly identical to what My Arcade revealed in 2020, but as with many things now, it’s expected to be slightly more expensive. Instead of $110, the handheld is now priced at $149.99.</p><div><figcaption><em>Super Nintendo cartridges end up slightly sticking out of the top of the handheld, while Sega Genesis carts sit flush in its bottom slot.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: My Arcade</cite></p></div><p>Unlike the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24236829/analogue-pocket-handheld-gaming-game-boy-color">Analogue Pocket</a>, which can play retro titles using cartridges or ROM files, the Super Retro Champ is similar to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24303052/modretro-chromatic-review-game-boy-color-handheld-palmer-luckey">ModRetro Chromatic</a> and sticks to carts. It’s got a slot on the top for SNES games (that end up slightly sticking out) and a second on the bottom for Genesis carts. It’s also compatible with cartridges released for the international versions of those classic consoles, including Super Famicom and Mega Drive games.</p><div><figcaption><em>It’s unlikely you’re ever going to find a pocket large enough to carry the Super Retro Champ.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: My Arcade</cite></p></div><p>With a six-inch screen surrounded by generous bezels plus a directional pad and action buttons on either side, the Super Retro Champ doesn’t prioritize portability. You can use it as a handheld with “hours of uninterrupted gameplay” from its rechargeable battery, My Arcade says, but it’s better suited for playing while propped up on a table using its folding stand, a pair of connected controllers, and a power adapter.</p><p>If six inches feels too cramped for you and another player, there’s also an HDMI port on the back of the Super Retro Champ for connecting it to a TV. Just don’t expect to enjoy your favorite 16-bit titles in HD or expect them to look as good as they did on the old CRT TV you grew up with.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
