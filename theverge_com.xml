            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Recently, I dug out my old Nintendo 3DS because I was craving simpler times. Really, I just wanted to play some games; to chip away at the mystery of <em>Majora’s Mask</em>, or solve a few puzzles in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/2/8325077/boxboy-nintendo-3ds-review"><em>BoxBoy</em></a>, without the headaches of system updates or subscriptions or any of that stuff. It’s been refreshing. And my choice has felt especially prescient of late, given just how much more complicated and expensive modern game consoles have become. It’s not a new problem, but it keeps getting worse.</p><div><p>The most recent example comes from Microsoft. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">Today, the company announced changes to its Game Pass subscription service, which, yes, also include a price hike</a>. Game Pass Ultimate is now $29.99 per month, a hefty $10 jump, and more games and features are being added to justify the higher price. There have also been some name changes. What used to be known as the “core” tier is now called “essential,” while “standard” is now “premium.” There are a bunch of charts to help you understand the differences between the tiers. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOtXisIDRi9/?hl=en">Trying to figure out what to choose is like living in a <em>Portlandia</em> sketch</a>.</p></div><div><p>Of course, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23901586/streaming-service-prices-netflix-disney-hulu-peacock-max">subscription prices rise all the time</a>, but the timing of this latest hike from Microsoft feels particularly egregious. It comes just a few weeks removed from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">Xbox hardware also getting more expensive</a>, to the point that an Xbox Series X now costs $150 more than it did at launch five years ago. We’re living in a tariff-influenced bizarro world, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/782532/game-console-price-hikes-xbox-ps5-switch">where game consoles actually get more expensive over time, rather than cheaper the older they get</a>. And it’s not just Microsoft. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762410/sony-ps5-price-hike-raise-digital-pro">Sony has been bumping up prices, as well</a>, and just released a new version of its digital-only PS5 in Europe — but instead of adding features or capabilities, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789686/sony-digital-ps5-slim-less-storage-europe">it has less storage for the same price</a>.</p></div><div><p><cite>Photo: Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p>Even Nintendo is not immune. While, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717610/nintendo-switch-original-price-increase">unlike its predecessor</a>, the Switch 2 hasn’t seen a price hike (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/717611/nintendo-switch-price-increase-risk-safety">yet</a>), its launch was filled with confusion around <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/656049/nintendo-switch-2-edition-upgrade-pack-price">the upgrade costs</a> of “Switch 2 editions,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgoogle.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dsite%253Atheverge.com%2Bswitch%2Bvirtual%2Bgame%2Bcards%26oq%3Dsite%253Atheverge.com%2Bswitch%2Bvirtual%2Bgame%2Bcards%26gs_lcrp%3DEgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg60gEIOTEzOWowajeoAgCwAgA%26sourceid%3Dchrome%26ie%3DUTF-8" rel="sponsored">how virtual game cards work</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/643635/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-explained">those weird “game-key” cartridges that don’t actually have games on them</a>. And I still don’t understand why <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642436/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-f-zero-hands-on">games from the GameCube</a>, a console that launched in 2001, are only playable for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers with a Switch 2. I’m pretty sure my OLED Switch can handle <em>F-Zero GX</em>.</p></div><p>When you add all of these elements together, it can feel like chaos. Just choosing a console is hard enough, and now you have to factor in the timing of it. When is the safest, cheapest time to buy an Xbox or PlayStation? There’s no longer a clear answer, but it’s probably right now before the hikes get worse. Once you have the box, then you have to figure out which versions of games to play and decide if you want to invest in a subscription to get the most out of your hardware. That, of course, means picking the tier that suits you best. Most of these issues have been brewing for some time, but it feels like we’re now at an inflection point where everything seems particularly frustrating.</p><p>There are some good things about this generation, of course, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/column/781303/microsoft-sony-playstation-xbox-future-of-gaming-console">the slow erosion of console exclusives</a>. But I mostly just find myself annoyed, pining for the days when buying a console and playing a game didn’t require so much forethought. Do I want to go back to the days of the Nintendo 64? Not especially (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762883/analogue-3d-delay-q4-2025">well, maybe a little</a>). But it is nice to know that when I want to go back, that old hardware will still do exactly what it was designed for.</p><p>And, really, that is what used to be the main sales pitch for a game console: it just works. You buy a device, you don’t have to fuss with it, and it’s clear what games work on it. That’s no longer the case. As technology has improved to the point of giving us wonderful experiences like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/784888/ghost-of-yotei-review-ps5"><em>Ghost of Yōtei</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>, it’s also been a monkey paw situation. Rising prices, confusing upgrades, constant subscription pushes — together, these form the headache that’s at the center of modern gaming. It’s enough that playing a 15-year-old handheld feels like an escape.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/789734/game-consoles-too-expensive]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft is raising the price of its Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription again and rebranding some of its Xbox Game Pass plans. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans">Starting today</a>, Game Pass Ultimate will be priced at $29.99 per month instead of $19.99 — a 50 percent increase. Microsoft is attempting to justify the price hike with a variety of upgrades across all of its Xbox Game Pass tiers.</p><p>Xbox Game Pass Core is being rebranded to Xbox Game Pass Essential, and the Standard plan is now Xbox Game Pass Premium.</p><p>“What’s new for everyone across all three Xbox Game Pass plans is bigger game libraries, including PC games across each of the plans,” explains Dustin Blackwell, director of gaming and platform communications at Microsoft, in a briefing with <em>The Verge</em>. “There is also unlimited cloud gaming, which is new to Essential and Premium subscribers.”</p><div><p id="xbox-game-pass-ultimate"><h2>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</h2></p></div><p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is moving from $19.99 a month to $29.99 a month, which is a surprising $10 increase. While Microsoft increased the price of Game Pass Ultimate last year without improving the subscription, it’s adding a bunch of improvements this time around. “[Game Pass Ultimate] will now include access to more than 400 titles globally, this includes the majority of our partners who want to continue to bring their future games to Xbox Game Pass,” Blackwell explains.</p><p>Microsoft is adding 45 games to Game Pass Ultimate today alone, including <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, a variety of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> titles, and many more Ubisoft games. “We’re also now giving access to more than 75 day one releases each year,” Blackwell says. “That’s a 50 percent increase over the day one titles we provided last year.”</p><p>Ubisoft Plus Classics is also now part of Game Pass Ultimate, a perk that provides access to a selection of Ubisoft games across console, PC, and cloud. On November 18th, Fortnite Crew will also be part of Ultimate, which gives subscribers the Fortnite Battle Pass, 1,000 V-bucks each month, and more. “With Fortnite Crew and Ubisoft Plus Classics, those combined add about $28 a month in value to Ultimate subscribers,” Blackwell says.</p><p>Xbox Cloud Gaming is also coming out of beta and getting 1440p resolution support and bitrate improvements for certain games on select devices. These cloud improvements are exclusive to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.</p><p>Finally, Microsoft is also reworking its rewards program. Ultimate subscribers can now earn up to $100 per year (100,000 points) in the store just by playing games.</p><div><p id="xbox-game-pass-premium"><h2>Xbox Game Pass Premium</h2></p></div><p>Game Pass Premium will be priced at the same $14.99 monthly price of the existing Standard subscription, but it will now have a bigger library of games to choose from. More than 200 games will be available on both Xbox and PC, giving Game Pass Premium subscribers access to PC games for the first time — including <em>Diablo IV</em> and <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> today.</p><p>Game Pass Premium is also getting unlimited cloud access for the first time, meaning you no longer need a Game Pass Ultimate subscription to get access to Xbox Cloud Gaming. Premium subscribers will be able to stream titles from the Game Pass library, as well as select titles they own.</p><p>While Game Pass Premium won’t get access to day one launch titles like Game Pass Ultimate does, Microsoft is now making a clear commitment to bring new Xbox-published games to this subscription tier “within a year of their launch.” This excludes <em>Call of Duty </em>titles, but every other Microsoft-owned Xbox game will be available.</p><p>Microsoft is also expanding its in-game Game Pass perks down to the Premium subscription, instead of being locked to Ultimate. Subscribers will get in-game benefits in games like <em>League of Legends</em>, <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>, and <em>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege X</em>. Premium subscribers will also be able to earn up to $50 a year by playing games through Microsoft’s rewards program.</p><div><p id="xbox-game-pass-essential"><h2>Xbox Game Pass Essential</h2></p></div><p>Game Pass Essential will be priced at the same $9.99 monthly price of the existing Core subscription, but it will now include more than 50 titles in the library instead of the more than 25 games that were available in Core. You’ll also be able to play all of these titles on PC or console, and there’s even unlimited cloud access, which was previously only available through the Game Pass Ultimate tier.</p><p>Essential subscribers will also be able to stream select games they own, as well as access in-game benefits from Riot Games and earn up to $25 a year in the store through Microsoft’s revamped rewards program.</p><div><p id="pc-game-pass-price-changes-and-more"><h2>PC Game Pass price changes and more</h2></p></div><p>Microsoft is also increasing the price of its PC Game Pass subscription today, moving from $11.99 a month to $16.49 monthly — a nearly 40 percent increase. Microsoft isn’t trying to justify this increase with any added extras for PC players, though.</p><p>“The only change happening for PC Game Pass subscribers is that they won’t be getting Ubisoft Plus Classics, but they’ll be getting about 50 additional Ubisoft titles across PC Game Pass,” Blackwell says. “It will continue to get day one titles.”</p><p>With PC games also being added to both Xbox Game Pass Essential and Premium today, I get the feeling that Microsoft may eventually rethink its dedicated subscription for PC gamers and try and tempt subscribers over to its Essential, Premium, or Ultimate tiers instead.</p><p>While the Xbox Game Pass Essential and Premium tiers aren’t seeing price increases in the US today, pricing will be adjusted for these plans in some markets. All existing Game Pass Core and Standard subscribers will be automatically upgraded to the Essential and Premium plans. Any price changes begin today for new subscribers, or at the next billing cycle for existing Game Pass subscribers.</p><p>The price increases come after Microsoft has been increasingly investing in Game Pass deals over the past year. “This last year alone we’ve made our largest investment in Game Pass so far, signing deals with more than 150 partners to expand the catalog over time,” Blackwell says.</p><p>Microsoft is also set to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">increase the price of its Xbox consoles</a> in the US again later this week, with the Xbox Series X now $150 more than it was just six months ago. Microsoft and Asus also just announced that the upcoming Xbox Ally X handheld will be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/784286/xbox-handheld-ally-x-price-preorder">priced at $999.99</a> in the US.</p><p>“We understand price increases are never fun for anybody, but we’re trying to reinforce by adding more value to these plans as well,” Blackwell says. “It’s something we don’t take lightly, and we’re listening to the feedback of players and the community to try to provide them with more of what they’re asking for.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Xbox Cloud Gaming is finally coming out of its preview state, more than five years after the streaming service first launched in 2020. “We’re officially removing the beta tag from Xbox Cloud Gaming,” says Dustin Blackwell, director of gaming and platform communications at Microsoft, in a briefing with <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>The beta tag removal coincides with some key changes to Xbox Cloud Gaming today, and a big <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">price increase to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>. Microsoft is also expanding Xbox Cloud Gaming to more Game Pass tiers, and it’s improving the streaming quality and resolution exclusively for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.</p><p>“We’ll have our highest streaming quality yet for Ultimate subscribers,” Blackwell says. “It’ll go up to 1440p for select games and select devices, and still deliver the shortest wait times for players.”</p><p>Some Xbox Cloud Gaming users <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/776320/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-limitations-strategy-notepad">already spotted</a> the 1440p support in games like <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em> last month, with bitrates that can peak at 27Mbps. Most Xbox Cloud Gaming streams average at around 10Mbps right now, with some devices able to access a better 17Mbps stream. An upgrade to 27Mbps should greatly reduce artifacts and improve the visual quality of game streams.</p><p>It’s the first major visual quality improvement to Xbox Cloud Gaming since Microsoft upgraded the hardware in the service to Xbox Series X-like blades. The previous <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527432/microsoft-xcloud-server-xbox-series-x-hardware-upgrade-game-streaming">Xbox Cloud Gaming upgrade in 2021</a> allowed games to load faster and have improved frame rates, all because the hardware enabled support for Xbox Series S / X-optimized titles.</p><p>It’s not immediately clear whether Microsoft is doing any hardware upgrades to enable 1440p support and higher bitrates this time around. I asked the company to comment on whether PC-like hardware is being used in its Xbox Cloud Gaming configurations to enable these upgrades, but the company didn’t respond in time for publication.</p><p>The expansion of Xbox Cloud Gaming to Microsoft’s new Xbox Game Pass Essential and Premium tiers will allow many more Xbox fans to access cloud games they own or titles from the Game Pass library. It’s the first time, beyond the free-to-play <em>Fortnite </em>streaming, that Microsoft has enabled cloud access beyond its top Ultimate plan.</p><p>The 1440p upgrade is still limited to select games and select devices, and Microsoft needs to go further to match the impressive quality from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/775222/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-5080-hands-on">Nvidia’s GeForce Now service</a>. I suspect we’ll have to wait until Microsoft is ready with its next-gen console launch to see a bigger upgrade to 4K resolution, higher frame rates, and even better bitrates.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/789461/xbox-cloud-gaming-launch-1440p-resolution-bitrate-changes]]></content:encoded>
