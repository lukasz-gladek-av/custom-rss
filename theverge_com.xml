            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>You might find it kind of sad to put a hard-earned gadget into a protective case. To me, it’s freeing. Using a case relieves me of the worry that it will accumulate tons of little scratches. So, I wasted no time testing cases on the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and it didn’t take long for me to find one that I think is the best.</p><p>I tried several types of cases on the Switch 2. I tested flimsy shells that snap or slide onto the Switch 2 to provide a simple, aesthetically pleasing barrier from scratches to the console and its Joy-Cons. I also tried slim cases that have one job: to protect the console when it isn’t in use.</p><div><h2>What I look for in a Switch 2 case</h2><section><p>We use each Switch 2 case as it was designed to be used. We follow the instructions included to get the best fit and protection, noting along the way when a feature works better than expected, or worse. We don’t perform drop tests (I’m using my personal, and thus treasured, Switch 2 unit), but we try our best to find weak points in each case.</p></section><section><p>Installing a case should be easy, not cumbersome. Given the Switch 2’s hybrid design, a multi-step process for attaching a case is expected, but it should be easy to achieve a successful installation every time with little effort.</p></section><section><p>Since a lot of tech cases are made before said technology is even publicly available, I’m watching like a hawk to make sure the cases that I try actually fit the Switch 2. Even a millimeter’s difference isn’t good enough for me or you.</p></section><section><p>Some cases come with compromises, such as not allowing the Switch 2’s Joy-Con 2 controllers to be detached. Others block the kickstand, and/or prevent the console from fitting into its original dock for playing on a TV. Compromises are fine as long as you know what they are beforehand. I think most people want to access the Switch 2’s unique features, so I’ve focused mostly on picks that retain them, although I may include some picks that limit them.</p></section></div><p>I just listed my high standards for form-fitting cases made to fit the Switch 2 while it’s in use. However, the bar for slim zip-up/clasp cases is lower. They just need to protect the console and, ideally, provide some extra value, like a pocket for cables or cartridge storage.</p><div><nav><h2>In this article</h2><ul><li><a href="#the-best-switch-2-case-for-both-handheld-and-docked-play">The best Switch 2 case for both handheld and docked play</a></li><li><a href="#the-best-slim-protective-switch-2-cases">The best slim, protective Switch 2 cases</a></li><li><a href="#the-best-form-fitting-shells-for-the-switch-2-in-handheld-mode">The best form-fitting shells for the Switch 2 in handheld mode</a></li><li><a href="#what-s-coming-next">What’s coming next?</a></li></ul></nav></div><p>As for my favorite case, I didn’t want to make any major compromises; I wanted one that’s just as good for handheld mode as when docked, which is why I think the <strong>Dbrand Killswitch</strong> is the best model overall. I published a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/686719/dbrand-killswitch-switch-2-case-review">full review of the Killswitch</a>, but the skinny is that while it’s perhaps more expensive than some may hope to pay, the level of protection and versatility it offers is worth the cost.</p><div><p id="the-best-switch-2-case-for-both-handheld-and-docked-play"><h2>The best Switch 2 case for both handheld and docked play</h2></p></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->60</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Very secure fit</li><li>Makes the Switch 2 feel more like a Steam Deck (in the best ways)</li><li>Clever dock adapter</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Chunky dock adapter</li><li>Not the most affordable case</li><li>Front protection only comes in the $80 tier</li></ul></div></div></div><p>The least expensive Killswitch tier <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fkillswitch%2Fnintendo-switch-2-cases" rel="sponsored">costs $59.95</a> and includes a rear cover for the console and a small piece to adhere to its kickstand for a matching style, plus Joy-Con 2 grips, all of which securely latch onto each component. It also includes a skin for your hardware. There’s no piece of the Killswitch that feels like it’ll incidentally wiggle off. </p><p>Unfortunately, the Switch 2 console case makes it impossible to fit into the dock. However, Dbrand includes its workaround adapter that fits into it, essentially acting as a USB-C extender. It’s a fairly elegant solution that works as intended. The only downside is that it leaves your Switch 2’s screen exposed instead of concealed by the dock’s plastic wall. It’s a little clunky, but I’m willing to forgive it because it allows the Switch 2 to retain its docking functionality.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->5</strong><span><cite>Photo: Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The tier I recommend for most Switch 2 players (especially those who will often throw their console into a bag) is the $79.85 “Travel” tier, which includes a semi-transparent travel cover that protects the front of your console during transit, or just for safekeeping when you aren’t using it. The cover fits around the front of your Killswitch-equipped console, securing around the back with a tough bungee cord latch. This tier also includes a pair of analog stick grips and a tray that holds 10 Switch cartridges and fits neatly within the travel cover.</p><p>I couldn’t post this without addressing the controversy surrounding the Killswitch’s design, specifically that it allows the Joy-Con 2s’ magnets to break away without pressing their release buttons. If you hold your Killswitch-equipped Switch 2 parallel to the ground solely by either of the Joy-Con 2 controllers and give it a shake, the entire console portion is likely to detach. This could obviously cause serious damage to the console. Dbrand insisted in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/">lengthy Reddit post</a> that most players don’t (and shouldn’t) hold their consoles this way. I <em>can</em> easily replicate the issue, though I didn’t notice it during my testing, mainly because I’m a worrywart who’s perhaps unnecessarily gentle with tech. However, I could see this being a more pressing issue if you have, say, a younger kid who roughhouses with technology. Either way, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1ljlhwy/joycon_detachment_update_part_2_were_fixing_it/">Dbrand later confirmed on Reddit</a> that all buyers are getting improved Joy-Con 2 covers that should fix the issue.</p><div><p id="runner-up"><h3>Runner-up</h3></p></div><p><strong>Genki’s Attack Vector</strong> case is similar in some ways to the Killswitch, as it consists of three pieces: one that goes around the console, and two pieces that wrap around each of the Joy-Con 2 controllers. The <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/attack-vector">$49.99 kit</a> improves on the Killswitch with swappable modular grips that come in three sizes to let you customize how the Joy-Con 2 fits in your hand. It follows a small, medium, and large model, with the smallest adding some minor ergonomic benefits, and the largest being what large-handed folks will likely gravitate toward to make the Switch 2 comfier to hold. Its large, palm-filling grip feels as good to use as the Killswitch, but it’s a very close race and I’d be smitten to use either.</p><p>However, one notable downside with the Attack Vector is that the Joy-Con 2 sleeves can be pulled off with relative ease, unlike Dbrand’s. Their fit is accurate, technically, and they won’t fall off during normal use. But they’re not as secure as I want them to be.</p><p>Also, Genki advertises that you can keep the Attack Vector on when you insert your console into the Switch 2 dock, but its launch unit doesn’t work as intended. Genki addressed complaints on forums that the case doesn’t fit the console perfectly, and is working on a fix that it expects to finish in July. It will ship a replacement middle piece to all who have already purchased the case, and those who buy the case going forward will receive the fixed product.</p><div><p id="the-best-slim-protective-switch-2-cases"><h2>The best slim, protective Switch 2 cases</h2></p></div><p><strong>Power A’s slim zip-up case </strong>for the Switch 2 is a simple and inexpensive way to keep your console safe when you aren’t using it. It’s not a hard case, so it won’t survive catastrophic damage, but it’s a fine choice if you don’t want to add a bunch of heft. To that end, it’s one of the slimmest cases that I have tried. </p><p>At just <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F69R7LLR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$19.99</a> (half the cost of <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fnintendo-switch-2-carrying-case-screen-protector-multi%2F6625926.p%3FskuId%3D6625926" rel="sponsored">Nintendo’s official carrying case</a>), protection alone would be sufficient, but it offers safe storage for up to 10 Switch cartridges, too. The cartridge holder has a soft bottom that protects the screen, and it can also fold into a tent, allowing the Switch 2 to rest against it (the Switch 2 already has a kickstand for this).</p><p>This case doesn’t suffer from a negative trait that’s common among other slim cases (some of which are pricier than PowerA’s): being able to press on the Joy-Con 2 joysticks from the outside. Other cases might allow your Switch 2 to suffer some joystick damage unbeknownst to you, but not this one, as well as the ones listed below.</p><p>For $10 more ($29.99), <strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/680463/belkin-nintendo-switch-2-charging-case-battery">Belkin’s slim case</a></strong> is better-looking than PowerA’s and is made with better materials. It has a carrying strap, a large mesh pocket, and a secret compartment for an Apple AirTag or similar Bluetooth tracker, all of which the PowerA case lacks. Belkin’s case can carry 12 cartridges, and it’s only slightly thicker than the PowerA case, likely to compensate for whatever cables or small gizmos you might stuff into its pocket. It features deep grooves to fit the Joy-Con 2’s triggers, and its outer shell prevents accidental presses on the joysticks. It comes in dark gray, cream, and a fun green shade.</p><p>Belkin sells a $69.99 version of its slim case that features everything above and includes a 10,000mAh 20W battery for keeping the Switch 2 charged while it’s inside the case. The company says the battery can fully charge the console 1.5 times. The battery results in a thicker case, and its bespoke compartment only holds the specific Belkin model that’s included, so you won’t be able to swap in a different, faster-charging battery. Neither of those may be deal-breakers for you, but are worth keeping in mind.</p><div><p id="runners-up"><h3>Runners-up</h3></p></div><p>JSAUX makes a relatively slim zip-up Switch 2 case that absolutely pops with color. Expressiveness is its main appeal, as this <strong><a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Carrying-Compatible-Nintendo-Switch-Protective-2/dp/B0F2F38LZK?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">$25.99 case</a></strong> slouches on other features you might want. Once it’s opened, all there is to see is a velcro strap that secures your Switch 2. Underneath it is a fabric tray stitched into the case that can hold 12 game cartridges. Like the Belkin and PowerA cases, this one prevents accidental pressing on the Joy-Con 2 sticks through its shell. It’s a little too light on features to recommend broadly, and it’s thicker than the other models.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/sleeper-case">Genki’s $42.99 Sleeper Case</a></strong> is a <em>very </em>tough soft case. Its wool-wrapped shell doesn’t have nearly as much give as other slim cases. Plus, its screen guard can carry up to 18 cartridges. However, I dislike how much the Switch 2 moves around when you shake the case (the fit is snug if you have the company’s Attack Vector case equipped). Notably, Genki’s Neil Trachy, who handles marketing and media relations, shared with <em>The Verge</em> that a production error may impact how well its zipper works in the long run, and that a free fix is coming in July for all who’ve already purchased one. The fix will be implemented for all future purchasers of the case. </p><p>“Our Sleeper Case was upgraded to a waterproof zipper last minute and unbeknownst to our production team, the adhesives used were not binding well to the zipper. [...] While the case is still rock solid, the weak point will be the glue that holds it all in place.”</p><div><p id="the-best-form-fitting-shells-for-the-switch-2-in-handheld-mode"><h2>The best form-fitting shells for the Switch 2 in handheld mode</h2></p></div><p>The <strong>Killswitch</strong> is the best case for handheld mode because it allows you to remove the Joy-Con 2 controllers and includes an adapter to easily connect to the dock. Plus, it offers kickstand access.</p><p>If you don’t <em>ever </em>plan to connect your Switch 2 to its dock or detach its Joy-Cons, or it’ll be a rare occurrence, you might pick an all-in-one shell that fits completely around the console. It will protect every angle of your Switch 2 from dings and scratches, and may even keep it safe in the event of a drop.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Designed-Protective-Ergonomic-Compatible/dp/B0DMV31N3F?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored"><strong>$29.99 Spigen Rugged Armor</strong></a> is a suitable option. It fits around every nook and port of the Switch 2, with openings for its speakers and air intake. It gets bonus points for fitting around the edges of the Joy-Con 2 while providing more pronounced grips, which may be a boon for those who experience hand or wrist pain while holding the console in handheld mode. However, as noted, you’ll need to remove the case in order to install the Switch 2 into its original dock.</p><div><p id="what-s-coming-next"><h2>What’s coming next?</h2></p></div><p>This case features many of the qualities that I like about the Dbrand Killswitch for a lot less ($29.99 versus $59.99), even one-upping it by being able to fit into the Switch 2’s original dock without the need for an adapter. I look forward to testing it when it launches.</p><p>I intend to keep this post updated as frequently as I’m able to test new cases.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/reviews/691319/best-switch-2-cases]]></content:encoded>
