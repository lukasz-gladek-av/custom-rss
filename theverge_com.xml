            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/640147/palworld-pubg-dating-sims<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The developers of <em>Palworld</em> and <em>PUBG</em>: <em>Battlegrounds</em> have announced details of dating simulators set in the universes of their respective games.</p><p>The <em>Palworld</em> dating sim, technically called <em>Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~</em>, was actually announced ahead of April Fools’ Day <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/1/24118022/doki-doki-palworld-club">last year</a>. But yesterday, developer Pocketpair released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUpilXM6638">second trailer for the game</a> and published <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3620480%2FPalworld_More_Than_Just_Pals%2F" rel="sponsored">an official Steam listing</a>, so it seems like it’s a bit closer to actually releasing.</p><p>According to the Steam page, “You, the protagonist, enroll as a transfer student in the prestigious Palpagos Private Academy. You will meet unique friends (pals) and enjoy school life through friendship and romance. It’s up to you whether you stay friends with the pals, develop romantic relationships with them, or even dismember and eat them.”</p><p><em>Pal♡world</em>’s initial trailer stated the game would release on an April 1st, 2025, but the newly launched Steam page says its release date is “to be announced.”</p><p><em>PUBG’s</em> dating sim, called “Winner Winner Romantic Dinner,” is an April Fools’ Day promotion that will let you get to know the game’s weapons as characters that have been personified.</p><p>“‘Winner Winner Romantic Dinner’ is set in a high school within the <em>PUBG</em> universe, where players take on the role of a student preparing for a school festival,” according to a press release. ”The game features characters inspired by PUBG’s iconic firearms, with branching storylines that lead to multiple unique endings.”</p><p>The <em>PUBG</em> dating sim will be available from April 1st to April 29th.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
