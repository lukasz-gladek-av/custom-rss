            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/623978/monster-hunter-wilds-salesrecordcapcom<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Though only out for a grand total of four days, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/617587/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-xbox-steam"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a> has sold an astonishing 8 million copies. That’s according to Capcom, reporting that the monster hunting action RPG has become the company’s <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250304.html">fastest selling title ever</a>.</p><p>The <em>Monster Hunter </em>franchise has racked up a number of superlatives for its publisher with 2018’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/25/16931366/monster-hunter-world-review-ps4-xbox-one-release-date"><em>Monster Hunter World</em></a> selling <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html">21 million copies to date</a> to become the company’s best selling game. With these statistics, combined with the success of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23642938/resident-evil-4-remake-review-xbox-ps5-steam"><em>Resident Evil</em> remakes</a>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23741204/street-fighter-6-review-ps5-xbox-pc">Street Fighter VI</a></em>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24111687/dragons-dogma-2-review-xbox-ps5-pc"><em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em></a> (not to mention <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22352085/monster-hunter-rise-review-nintendo-switch">MonHun Rise</a></em>), Capcom is one of the few publishers not currently on fire amidst the industry’s larger financial and labor crisis. Even better, it’s parlaying that success into developing new creative endeavors like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24202033/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-review-capcom"><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em></a> or reviving much beloved but dormant franchises like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320133/okami-2-announce-game-awards"><em>Okami</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320142/onimusha-is-back-and-very-bloody"><em>Onimusha</em></a>.</p><p>For now, players seem to be enjoying the hell outta <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> so much that it’s causing commotion in the real world. According to a report in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-is-so-popular-it-caused-a-run-on-an-unexpected-dish-in-japan/1100-6529845/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f"><em>Gamespot</em></a>, <em>MonHun </em>fans are finding the cheese naan that players can make in the game so appealing that it’s selling out in restaurants that specialize in the dish.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The new bundle includes the Nintendo Switch OLED system with a digital copy of <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> and a 3-month Nintendo Switch Online individual membership for $349.99 — a $67.98 savings if bought separately at regular prices.</p><p>Nintendo is releasing the new bundle on March 10th to celebrate “MAR10 Day.” On March 9th, the company will also offer a bunch of its <em>Mario</em> titles on discount at retail stores including Best Buy, GameStop, Target, and Walmart.

Nintendo says it’s “taking risks” with the Switch’s successor as it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606817/nintendo-switch-2-production-demand-q-a">proceeds with production</a>. The company is planning a Switch 2-focused Nintendo Direct <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606504/nintendo-switch-2-direct-new-time">on April 2nd</a> to share more details about the console.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/617038/see-you-at-the-warehouse">a whole lot of teasing</a>, it’s now official: remakes of <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3</em> and <em>4</em> are on the way. Activision officially announced the new release — called <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</em> — which will include remakes of both seminal skateboarding games and is launching on Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and the Switch on July 11th. It’ll also be available for subscribers of Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC.</p><p>Just like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21419054/tony-hawk-pro-skater-1-2-review-xbox-pc-ps4">the previous remakes</a>, the new collection will include all of the content from the original games, alongside some modern additions, including brand-new parks and a handful of current skaters like Olympic stars Rayssa Leal and Yuto Horigome. They’ll join the original cast, including the likes of Bucky Lasek, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Elissa Steamer, Chad Muska, Rodney Mullen, and, obviously, Tony Hawk.</p><p>The new game is being developed by Iron Galaxy Studios, which worked with Vicarious Visions — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244924/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-remake-studio-vicarious-visions-blizzard-entertainment-merger">now a part of Blizzard</a> — on the previous remake. Here’s a little before-and-after image comparing the original games to the updated version:</p><p>Activision says that the soundtrack — always an important part of a <em>Tony Hawk</em> game — will include classic songs from Motörhead, Gang Starr, KRS-One, and others, “alongside new tracks that capture the spirit of modern skate culture.” The game will also support cross-platform online multiplayer for up to eight skaters.</p><p>The original remakes were well-received updates of some true classics, and the new game will be launching at a very interesting time for skateboarding games. In addition to clever indie releases like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24339211/skate-city-new-york-review-apple-arcade">Skate City</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22915054/olliolli-world-review-switch-ps5-xbox-pc">OlliOlli World</a></em>, and the upcoming <em><a href="https://www.devolverdigital.com/games/skate-story">Skate Story</a></em>, EA is also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/30/23189958/ea-skate-trailer-progress-update-playtest-sign-up">bringing back its long-dormant <em>Skate</em> series</a>.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
