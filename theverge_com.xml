Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s called <em>Arkheron</em>, and looks a bit like a multiplayer take on <em>Diablo</em>. In each match, 15 teams made up of three players compete to ascend a tower, and they can collect and loot items that give them special powers. It seems the idea is to build your load-out and strategy on the fly in each match.</p><div><p>There’s no word yet on when the game will launch, but an open alpha playtest is happening this weekend, from September 19th through the 21st. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3333850%2FArkheron%2F" rel="sponsored">You can sign up to check it out on Steam right now</a>.</p></div><p>As for why the game took so long following the formation of the studio, Pardo wrote a lengthy blog post explaining the multiple rounds of iteration and revision the game has gone through. The combat, for instance, was redesigned four different times before they got things right. It sounds a lot like the way Blizzard used to work. As Pardo writes:</p><div><blockquote><p>As we playtested Arkheron internally, something rare happened. The team fell in love with the game. That might sound obvious, but for experienced developers it isn’t. Many of us have been through projects where the work is meaningful, but the daily playtests feel like a chore. With Arkheron it was different. People didn’t want to miss a session. They got frustrated if servers went down on a holiday. They grumbled when a playtest was canceled.</p></blockquote></div><p>He notes that the alpha will be a little rough arounds the edges, but that that’s all part of the process. “Playtesting is how we make <em>Arkheron</em> better,” Pardo wrote. “It’s how we’ll continue to play the game to make the game, listen to our community and let the fun guide us toward launch.”</p><p>Whenever it does launch, the game will be coming to PC, Xbox, and PS5.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/779968/bonfire-studios-arkheron-trailer-alpha-date#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/779968/bonfire-studios-arkheron-trailer-alpha-date]]></content:encoded>

He joined in 2018, and after a stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Look, delays happen. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762883/analogue-3d-delay-q4-2025">Analogue 3D</a>, a console made to display N64 games in 4K, has had its release window pushed multiple times. That frustrated me for a while because I wanted to get my hands on <strong>8BitDo’s slick 64 Bluetooth controller</strong> that was made to go along with the console. Its release was likely planned to coincide with the console, but the controller finally launched just a couple months ago. The white version is down to $27.69 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK6VCGBC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, which is a hefty 31 percent off its original $39.99 price.</p><p>The 8BitDo 64 can also be wirelessly connected to a Switch or Switch 2, coming in handy for Nintendo 64 games that you can play if you have a Nintendo Switch Online plus Expansion Pack subscription. It’s one of a few controllers out there that gives you the same set of buttons as the original N64 controller (A, B, and directional C buttons on the right-hand side), but with some modern tweaks to the layout and feature set. The sole analog stick has a Hall effect sensor and is located on the left-hand side, with a D-pad beneath it. Also, the Z button is on both sides of the trigger grips. The controller supports rumble and a turbo function.</p><p>The 8BitDo 64 is also compatible with Windows and Android via Bluetooth or via a USB-C wired connection. If you wind up eventually buying an Analogue 3D whenever it releases, you’ll need a controller like this one because the console doesn’t include one.</p><div><p id="other-verge-approved-deals"><h2>Other Verge-approved deals</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>I’ve been seeing emails in my inbox every week about how RTX 50-series GPUs are in stock at many retailers, but the bigger news is that stock is apparently <em>so </em>plentiful that we’re seeing deals worth sharing. Whether you have a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349976/nvidia-rtx-5090-fe-small-form-factor-sff-hands-on">small form factor desktop</a> build or not, the <strong>Asus Prime RTX 5070 Ti graphics card</strong> with a triple-fan setup takes up just 2.5 slots in your case, making it a compact option if you’re trying to keep your components neatly tucked. This model debuted at $829.99, but for the past couple of weeks it has been available for $749.99 at <a href="http://amazon.com/ASUS-SFF-Ready-Graphics-2-5-Slot-Axial-tech/dp/B0DS6WFRBP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=http%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fasus-prime-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-16gb-gddr7-pci-express-5-0-graphics-card-black%2FJJGGLHJX5W" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>. I put this model to the test during my days at <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/533860/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-review-3070-upgrade-worth-it/">Polygon</a></em> (RIP), and it was a huge upgrade for me, as someone who previously used an RTX 3070 Ti that was held back by other outdated components.</span></li><li><span>Phone and tablet accessories company <strong>Lisen makes an iPad stand </strong>that can let your screen rotate 360 degrees, making it a handy addition in the kitchen, the tool bench, or anywhere you need to do some work. It’s $15.19 for Prime members right now — a small discount from its original $15.99 price — but the code <strong>MFY2E8L7</strong> will knock the cost down to $8.96 before tax (a tip of the hat to <em><a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/18609412-prime-members-lisen-adjustable-360-degree-rotation-tablet-stand-holder-up-to-12-9-8-96-free-shipping?src=SDSearchv3&amp;attrsrc=Thread%3AExpired%3AFalse%7CSearch%3AType%3Anormal%7CSearch%3ASort%3Arelevance%7CSearch%3AHideExpired%3Afalse">Slickdeals</a> </em>for surfacing this deal). Beyond rotating 360 degrees, the stand portion can adjust to multiple angles as needed, going as low at 15 degrees that makes the tablet close to parallel with a flat surface, or up to 75 degrees, which seems good for entertainment purposes.</span></li><li><span>Those of us who have been patiently waiting for <em><strong>Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning</strong></em> to be available to rent can now pay just $6.99 to watch the film on services like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mission-Impossible-Reckoning-Christopher-McQuarrie/dp/B0DLTM683D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon Prime Video</a>, <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/mission-impossible---the-final-reckoning/umc.cmc.492oh9izvznxkfxk934zdz941">Apple TV</a>, and <a href="https://athome.fandango.com/content/browse/details/Mission-Impossible-The-Final-Reckoning/4224756">Fandango</a>. I missed it in the theater, and after recently paying $20 to buy the Jeff Buckley documentary, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/interview/718962/jeff-buckley-documentary-amy-berg-interview">It’s Never Over</a></em>, I figured I’d wait until <em>The Final Reckoning</em> got cheaper to view. It took longer than expected to be rentable, but now I know what I’m doing this weekend. If you’d rather buy it, the film got a $7 discount on platforms, dropping to $12.99.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/779829/8bitdo-n64-wireless-controller-mission-impossible-rent-deal-sale#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/779829/8bitdo-n64-wireless-controller-mission-impossible-rent-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
