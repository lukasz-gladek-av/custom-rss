Nintendo announced <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fnintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5-bringing-new-forms-of-game-communication-to-life%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOor48gIQRe3AJfpPKWtNEnIbCV0UefifG398la8AdB4asWFv2Mni" rel="sponsored">last week</a> that the game was coming to the Switch and Switch 2, and today, the company released a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G3wbCIUVqs">Creator’s Voice video</a> highlighting more about the game.</p><p>In the video, Supergiant employees don’t get very specific about the Switch 2 version of the game, but do say 60 fps gameplay is important to them and that they’ll be able to “push some of the graphical features with the extra power” of the system. Otherwise, the video is a good place to start if you haven’t been keeping up with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152085/hades-2-steam-deck-performance"><em>Hades</em> sequel</a>, which is in early access on PC, and want to know what it’s all about. </p><p>Despite a screen in the video that says <em>Hades II</em> will launch “first for consoles on Nintendo Switch 2,” developer Supergiant Games <a href="https://x.com/SupergiantGames/status/1909615715642196067">clarified on X</a> that the game is also launching on the original Switch when it reaches v1.0. Supergiant is promising to share more information about <em>Hades II</em>, which doesn’t have a set release date, “later this year.”</p><p>My colleague Jay Peters has already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/617730/hades-2-getting-better-early-access">written about how much fun he’s having</a> with <em>Hades II</em>. Maybe it’s time I finally try again to beat the final boss in the first <em>Hades</em>. I made it there once, lost in the second phase of the battle, and just haven’t been back since.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
