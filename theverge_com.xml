            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/610599/overwatch-2-season-15-16-update-stadium-new-character-freja-loot-boxes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Overwatch 2</em> is getting quite the shakeup in 2025 as it faces growing competition from other online shooters. It starts with the season 15 update that’s coming on February 18th that’ll tease a new hero and introduce an in-game Perks system for existing ones, plus the return of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278781/overwatch-2-season-14-6v6-test">6v6 competitive queues Blizzard tested late last year</a>. There’s also the return of loot boxes and then, in April, a <em>Counterstrike</em>-like mode, two new characters, and a revamped ranked queue that lets you ban heroes and vote on maps.</p><p>Reintroducing loot boxes may be a polarizing move, as games that implement them have received backlash over the years for their predatory nature. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/16/23171133/overwatch-2-loot-boxes-free-to-play">Blizzard removed them from <em>Overwatch</em> a few years ago</a> in favor of an in-game shop when it restructured its monetization model after going free-to-play. The company will responsibly publicize drop rates and is guaranteeing that you’ll receive an item of “Rare” rarity or better in each box, plus a guaranteed “Epic” after opening five and a “Legendary” after opening 20. We’re not sure whether you’ll still be able to purchase cosmetics directly from a rotating in-game shop, but you can earn loot boxes as part of weekly and event rewards, and you can get up to three guaranteed Legendary loot boxes in each seasonal battle pass.</p><p>Stadium is arguably the biggest change announced for <em>Overwatch 2</em> so far. The new gameplay mode is a best-of-seven romp between two teams of five that’s akin to <em>CounterStrike: Go</em> or <em>Valorant</em>. You’ll earn currency each round, with rotating maps and objectives alternating between Control, Clash, and Push.</p><p>The cash goes toward upgrades for your hero that are unique to the mode, whether you’re unlocking an ability or upgrading it with enhanced potency or transformative effects that buff your offense and team utility. You can even choose between first-person or third-person POVs. It’s getting its own ranked queue, too, and launches with 14 heroes to start, with more planned to be added in future updates alongside a steady rollout of new maps.</p><p>Season 16 will also introduce Freja, a high-mobility character who can dash horizontally and jump vertically while wielding a dual-mode crossbow that enables both rapid-fire shooting and precision sniping. You’ll be able to play her for a bit during a trial weekend in Season 15. Blizzard is also teasing a new character for Season 18 named Aqua, appropriately named for his water-based abilities.</p><p>As for the new Perks system, it promises to enhance all of the game’s heroes with two unique upgrades per match. Your first upgrade is a minor one that lets you choose one of two slight boosts, perhaps a slightly stronger passive or a reduced cooldown for a core ability. The second upgrade offers a more substantial play style shift designed to help turn the tides of battle — Torbjorn can choose between a stronger level three turret or the ability to mount it on a wall, for example.</p><p>These drastic changes are almost necessary for any service-based online arena shooter to stand out amidst growing competition, as evidenced by <em>Fortnite</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24315134/fortnite-ballistic-counter-strike-first-person-shooter-fps">recently receiving a similar mode</a> as Epic Games continues experimenting. There are only so many players to go around, after all, especially with newcomer <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337409/marvel-rivals-fantastic-four-season-1-date-trailer">Marvel Rivals</a></em> making a loud and very noticeable Namor-sized splash of late.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
