In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637319/nintendo-today-news-app">its mobile news app today</a>, Nintendo made some surprise announcements about its ink-shooting franchise.</p><p>First up, a spinoff game called <em>Splatoon Raiders</em> is in the works for the Switch 2, though there aren’t a lot of details. The new game will take players to an area known as the Spirhalite Islands, investigating some kind of mystery alongside the fictional pop group Deep Cut. It appears the game may be a single-player offshoot of the franchise, though there is currently no word on when it will launch.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23339801/splatoon-3-review-nintendo-switch">the online shooter <em>Splatoon 3</em></a> is getting a big update on June 12th, which will bring it up to version 10.0. It will introduce 30 remixed weapons and the classic Urchin Underpass map from the first <em>Splatoon</em> on the Wii U. The game will also be getting enhanced for the Switch 2, with what Nintendo calls “more detailed visuals” and a “smoother appearance” in certain locations. Players will be able to play against each other on both platforms. The update will be available for free.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/682063/the-new-york-times-nyt-games-crossplay-scrabble-pips<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>The New York Times</em>’ games team is trying something new: it’s about to start testing a <em>Scrabble</em>-like game it calls <em>Crossplay</em>, but instead of folding the game into the main NYT Games app, <em>Crossplay</em> will be a standalone app. The game is soft launching in New Zealand on iOS on June 10th.</p><p>I was recently shown a demo of the game by Jonathan Knight, head of games at <em>NYT</em>, and I think it will look familiar to any fans of <em>Scrabble</em> or <em>Words with Friends</em>. The game takes place between two players. Each turn, your goal is to build a word out of the up to seven letter tiles on your tray and the letters already on the board. Every letter has a different point value, and you can boost your score by taking advantage of bonus tiles on the board that multiply your letter or word scores.</p><p>(The <em><em>NYT</em></em> did not provide screenshots I could publish; Knight says that a screenshot of the game right now doesn’t represent where it will be when it launches more widely.)</p><div><p>“We’re really presenting a very pure, classic, elevated version of the game”</p></div><p>The <em>NYT</em> has a few of its own tweaks to differentiate <em>Crossplay</em> from similar games, including different positions for bonus tiles and a different letter distribution, Knight says. The end of the game has a clever twist, too: after all of the letter tiles have been drawn from the virtual bag, each player gets just one additional turn instead of having to clear their tray of tiles to end the game.</p><p>Knight argues that <em>Crossplay</em> is its own app because it’s an experience that would be hard to fit in another app. “We’re very specifically wanting to reach all new audiences with this game,” particularly people that love to compete and love word games, he says.</p><p><em>Crossplay</em> requires a free <em>NYT</em> account to play, and your friends from the main <em>NYT</em> Games app will carry over, Knight says. “Certain aspects” of the game will be exclusive to paid subscribers, such as a feature that will help you review your matches. But he says <em>Crossplay</em> won’t have many of the things that can make other free mobile games frustrating.</p><p>“In a world where mobile games have become little mini casinos, and it’s often hard to find the game itself behind all of the treasure chests and friction and aggressive monetization tactics and coins and all of that, we’re really presenting a very pure, classic, elevated version of the game that you can just get in and enjoy without all that business,” Knight says.</p><p>The <em>NYT’s</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/31/22911274/wordle-new-york-times-free-word-game-acquisition">acquisition of <em>Wordle</em></a> arguably kicked off the race for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279439/news-games-crossword-wordle">daily puzzle games</a>, with places like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23984103/puzzmo-acquired-hearst-zach-gage">Hearst</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152045/linkedin-games-crossclimb-queens-pinpoint">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276945/netflix-is-getting-a-daily-word-game-from-ted">Netflix</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24295846/words-with-friends-single-player-daily-puzzles-wordle">Zynga</a> putting their own stamps on the genre. Overall, the <em>NYT’s</em> games business is growing, according to Knight, including “tremendous downloads,” growing app use, and subscriptions.</p><p><em>NYT</em> puzzles were played 11.1 billion times in 2024, according to statistics shared with <em>The Verge</em> by <em>NYT</em> spokesperson Jordan Cohen. <em>Wordle</em> was played 5.3 billion times, “3.3 billion successful <em>Connections</em> were made,” and <em>Strands</em>, the <em>NYT’s</em> word search game, was played 1.3 billion times.</p><p>The <em>NYT</em> games team is still developing new puzzles for the main games app, such as <em>Pips</em>, a logic game, that it started beta testing in Canada in April.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
