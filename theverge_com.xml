            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/631102/xbox-360-hack-homebrew-badupdate-exploit-usb<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Xbox 360 modders have discovered a new way to get homebrew apps and games running on the console. A new software-only exploit known as <a href="https://github.com/grimdoomer/Xbox360BadUpdate">BadUpdate</a> allows you to use a USB key to hack past Microsoft’s Hypervisor protections and run unsigned code and games.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUK__yGXmds">Modern Vintage Gamer has tested</a> BadUpdate and found that you don’t even have to open up your Xbox 360 console to get it running. Unlike the RGH or JTAG exploits for the Xbox 360, this BadUpdate method just requires a USB key. If you have the time and patience to get this running successfully, you’ll be able to run the Xbox 360 homebrew store which includes games, apps, emulators, utilities, and even custom dashboards.</p><p>There are some limitations, though. If you want to take advantage of BadUpdate then you’ll also need to manually patch every executable you want to run on your Xbox 360. Modern Vintage Gamer says the exploit isn’t always reliable either, or takes some time to pull off. As this exploits Microsoft’s custom Hypervisor on the Xb0x 360, you’ll also need to run this exploit every single time you boot up the console.</p><p>You’ll just need a USB key, the exploit code, and a trial version of <em>Rock Band Blitz</em> that helps enable the bypass. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUK__yGXmds">Modern Vintage Gamer walks through</a> all the steps in his detailed YouTube video, and there’s a brief guide on the <a href="https://github.com/grimdoomer/Xbox360BadUpdate">GitHub repository</a> that houses this software-only exploit.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Roblox is launching and open-sourcing Cube 3D, the first version of its foundational AI model for generating 3D objects.</p><p>“With Cube, we intend to make 3D creation more efficient,” Roblox says <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/03/introducing-roblox-cube">in a press release</a>. “With 3D mesh generation, developers can quickly explore new creative directions and increase their productivity by deciding rapidly which to move forward with.”</p><p>The model is trained on 3D objects, as Roblox explains in its press release:</p><div><blockquote><p>To achieve this, we’ve taken inspiration from state-of-the-art models trained on text tokens (or sets of characters) so they can predict the next token to form a sentence. Our innovation builds on the same core idea. We’ve built the ability to tokenize 3D objects and understand shapes as tokens and trained Cube 3D to predict the next shape token to build a complete 3D object.</p></blockquote></div><p>The actual data used to train the model includes “a combination of licensed and publicly available datasets, as well as experience data from the Roblox ecosystem,” spokesperson Samantha Spielman tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Down the line, Cube 3D will be able to generate objects using images as inputs, too. “It will ultimately be a multimodal model, trained on text, images, video, and other types of input – and will integrate with our existing AI creation tools,” according to Roblox.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
