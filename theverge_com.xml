While the console isn’t discounted, a number of recommended add-ons are cheaper than ever (some are discounted for the first time), including microSD Express cards, carrying cases, controllers, screen protectors, and more.</p><p>We’re covering Prime Big Deal Days from multiple angles here at <em>The Verge.</em> Our main guide has well over 100 deals we think are fantastic, including 4K TVs, Bluetooth speakers, earbuds, and more. We also have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/782478/october-amazon-prime-day-deals-guide">a comprehensive guide</a> to help you navigate the several other roundups and deal articles we’ve published during the sale.
