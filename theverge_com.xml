            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279435/8bitdo-ultimate-mobile-gaming-controller-android-hall-effect<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>8BitDo has announced its <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-mobile-gaming-controller/">Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller</a>, the company’s first gamepad that attaches directly to smartphones and mobile devices using an expanding clamping mechanism. It’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=theverge02-20">available for preorder now for $49.99</a> and is expected to be released on November 29th, 2024.</p><p>The Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller can be attached to smartphones or smaller tablet devices measuring between 100mm and 170mm in length. For expanded compatibility, instead of plugging in with USB-C, 8BitDo’s new controller connects wirelessly over Bluetooth but only supports Android devices.</p><p>The use of Bluetooth necessitates a 350mAh rechargeable battery in the controller, which 8BitDo says is enough for 15 hours of play on a 1.5-hour charge. That added battery also means the Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller weighs 236 grams, making it heavier than competitors’ offerings like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22753567/backbone-one-plus-iphone-gaming-controller-android-phones">Backbone One</a>, which connects through a device’s charging port and weighs 138 grams.</p><div><figcaption><em>The controller features Hall effect joysticks and triggers.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: 8BitDo</cite></p></div><p>Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24187539/gamesir-g8-bluetooth-mobile-controller-ios-android-nintendo-switch-pc">GameSir’s G8 Plus smartphone controller</a>, 8BitDo is using <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained">drift-resistant</a> magnetic Hall effect sensors in its joysticks and triggers so players will potentially avoid experiencing unwanted movements or button presses while gaming. The controller also features a pair of shoulder buttons, a four-way directional pad with a “clicky” feel, turbo, macro, and profile buttons, and two additional programmable paddle buttons on the back.</p><div><figcaption><em>The controller is compatible with 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software allowing it to be customized and reconfigured.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: 8BitDo</cite></p></div><p>Unlike some of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185806/gaming-8bitdo-controller-ultimate-2c-hall-effect">8BitDo’s more budget-friendly offerings</a>, the Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller fully supports customization through the company’s Ultimate Software, which is available as a desktop and mobile app. In addition to remapping controls, creating macros, and even setting up multiple profiles, if you’re an FPS player, you can use it to adjust the sensitivity of the controller’s triggers so they’re more immediately responsive.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24278489/ring-battery-doorbell-plus-deal-sale</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-buy%E2%80%99s-gaming-sale-including-deals-on-the-asus-rog-ally-and-scuf%E2%80%99s-mobile-controller.1019604/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24278489/ring-battery-doorbell-plus-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re a gamer looking to save but can’t wait until another a month until Black Friday, it might be worth checking out <a href="https://howl.me/cnnelayGOJc"><strong>Best Buy’s three-day gaming sale</strong></a>. Now through October 27th, the retailer’s offering discounts on gaming gear, but some of the best deals are on hardware specifically. </p><p>For example, Best Buy has some notable deals on Windows handheld consoles, like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review"><strong>Asus ROG Ally</strong></a>, which is on sale&nbsp;with a Z1 Extreme chip for <a href="https://howl.me/cnnexVKi7NU">$549.99 ($100 off)</a> (and even cheaper at $499.99 for My Best Buy Plus and Total members). That’s $50 shy of its best price to date, and nearly half the price of its successor, the ROG Ally X. Admittedly, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">ROG Ally X</a>, offers more impressive performance and battery life, but the ROG Ally is still more powerful than Valve’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">Steam Deck</a> with a larger 1080p and 120Hz display. Alternatively, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review"><strong>Lenovo Legion Go</strong></a> is also on sale for <a href="https://howl.me/cnnd4I8l55Z">$599.99 ($150 off)</a> with 1TB of storage, which is one of its better prices to date. The handheld isn’t as fast or as lightweight as the ROG Ally, but it does offers a larger 8.8-inch 144Hz display so it can double as a decent Windows tablet. It also has detachable controllers and even a kickstand.</p><p>It’s not all pricey handhelds, either. Gaming accessories like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24168172/scuf-nomad-iphone-mobile-controller-hall-effect-specs-price"><strong>Scuf’s Nomad&nbsp;controller</strong></a><strong> </strong>have dropped to their best prices to date, selling for <a href="https://howl.me/cnnd84vVxJJ">$79.99 ($20 off)</a>, with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SCUF-Wireless-iPhone-Mobile-Controller/dp/B0D49HBW9D/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> matching that deal too. A mobile controller for your iPhone, Scuf’s device is similar to&nbsp;rivals from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review">Backbone</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23191199/razer-kishi-v2-mobile-game-controller-android-review">Razer Kishi</a> but offers full-size, drift-free Hall effect sticks. And while the video game deals aren’t as impressive, there are a few noteworthy ones to consider, like the  open-world&nbsp;title <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em>, which is down to one of its better prices to date of <a href="https://howl.me/cnneJt0bAvO">$29.99</a> <a href="https://howl.me/cnneJt0bAvO">($20 off)</a> for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.</p><div><p>The ROG Ally is Asus’ first crack at a Steam Deck rival. It’s a Windows-based PC gaming handheld with a seven-inch 1080p, 120Hz touchscreen and integrated gamepad controls.</p></div><div><p>The clamp-style mobile controller works with the iPhone and offers a few pro-level features at a relatively low price, including full-size, drift-free Hall effect sticks (with swappable stick toppers) and a pair of customizable rear paddle.</p></div><div><div><h2>Verge Deals on X<!-- --> <!-- --> / </h2><p>Join more than 50,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals</p></div><p><a href="http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud">Follow us!</a></p></div><p><h3>A few more ways to save</h3></p><div><ul><li>The <strong>Ring Battery Doorbell Plus</strong>, our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22954554/best-video-doorbell-camera">top battery-powered video doorbell pick</a>, is down to an all-time low of $99.99 ($40 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Ring-Battery-Doorbell-detection/dp/B09WZBPX7K?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cnnc0e9JlIQ">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fring-battery-doorbell-plus-8211-smart-wi-fi-video-doorbell-with-head-to-toe-hd-video-satin-nickel%2F-%2FA-88293229">Target</a>. The doorbell boasts an impressive 1536p HD video resolution as well as a head-to-toe view, allowing you to get a better view of packages and visitors. Compared to other battery doorbells we’ve tested, the Plus is also more responsive. Other handy features include color night vision, live view, and two-way audio, though you’ll need to pay $4.99 subscription fee for other perks like recorded video and alerts for packages.</li><li>You can purchase a refurbished <strong>iRobot Roomba i4 Evo </strong>on sale from <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F384464991557">eBay</a> for $129.99 when you apply the code <strong>HOLIDAYCHEER </strong>at checkout, which costs $320 less than buying it new. The Roomba i4 Evo is the upgraded version of our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23846479/best-budget-robot-vacuum-robot-mop">favorite budget-friendly robot vacuum</a>, the Roomba i3. Aside from offering a bigger battery, it’s otherwise identical and capable of mapping and cleaning your house just as well as the pricier, more capable Roomba j7. Bear in mind it lacks AI-powered obstacle avoidance and you can’t set virtual keep-out zones, but those are fair trade-offs at this price. </li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/5/23902100/samsung-smarttag2-item-tracker-announce"><strong>Samsung’s Galaxy SmartTag2</strong></a> starts at&nbsp;$21.22 ($9 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-SmartTag2-Bluetooth-Tracker-Tracking/dp/B0CCC69HN3/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, which is a little over $1 shy of its best price to date, while <a href="https://howl.me/cnmMTtAN8eI">Best Buy</a> has the device for $22.49. The ultra wideband tracker&nbsp;works with Samsung’s Galaxy Find network, making it a particularly great option for Samsung device owners looking to keeps tabs of their belongings. Unlike its predecessor, it also offers a more robust IP67 water and dust resistance rating and a user-replaceable battery capable of lasting up to 700 days.</li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As <em>Semafor</em> points out, the <em>Zorse</em> name “identifies the offspring of a zebra and another equine,” so it seems like the game will focus on wordplay like that.</p><p>Cohen says <em>Zorse</em> is currently only available in Canada, meaning I can’t play it myself.

Hearst — which publishes the likes of <em>Cosmopolitan</em>, <em>Esquire</em>, and the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> — has announced that it has acquired Puzzmo, a puzzle gaming platform led by indie developers Zach Gage and Orta Therox. The move puts Hearst directly up against the gaming efforts of <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em>. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

It features a number of notable Gage-designed titles like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21114098/spelltower-plus-iphone-ipad-zach-gage-interview-app-store"><em>SpellTower</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/13/13262994/really-bad-chess-zach-gage-iphone-ipad"><em>Really Bad Chess</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/18/14961332/typeshift-iphone-ipad-word-game-zach-gage"><em>Typeshift</em></a>, along with a streamlined daily crossword puzzle. The site also features community features like leaderboards and multiplayer options. “There’s great stuff out there,” Gage told me in October of the newspaper games space. “But there isn’t this holistic place where people can go and build a community around these games.”</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23984103/puzzmo-acquired-hearst-zach-gage">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-6b4f5af4-b9d5-472e-90dc-4b6250780da1"><div><p>A printable Puzzmo for the holiday weekend.</p><p>Puzzmo, the online platform <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23929222/puzzmo-newspaper-games-crossword-zach-gage">reimagining classic games</a>, is offering a free <a href="https://launch.puzzmo.com/">mini puzzlebook</a> you can print out and pass around to friends and family members.
