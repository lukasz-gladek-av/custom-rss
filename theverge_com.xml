            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24283263/amd-radeon-rdna-4-gpus-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>AMD’s Q3 2024 earnings call today <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24283077/amds-ai-earnings-continue-to-rise-while-game-console-fortunes-continue-to-decline">wasn’t bullish on gaming revenue overall</a>, but it did confirm a hot new rumor on GPUs — specifically, the launch of AMD’s next-gen RDNA 4 parts early next year. “We are on track to launch the first RDNA4 GPUs in early 2025,” said AMD CEO Lisa Su, and the company <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2504851/amd-officially-schedules-next-gen-gpus-for-early-2025.html">confirmed to <em>PCWorld</em></a><em> </em>that it’s the first time it’s shared those plans publicly. </p><p>“In addition to a strong increase in gaming performance, RDNA 4 delivers significantly higher ray tracing performance and adds new AI capabilities,” Su said on the call.</p><p>AMD confirming those chips might help lend credibility to other leaks, too. Earlier today, <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/101385/amd-could-have-ton-of-reveals-for-ces-2025-strix-halo-rdna-4-gpus-new-x3d-cpus-and-more/index.html">a Chiphell leaker rumored</a> that AMD would announce its RDNA 4 graphics at CES 2025 in January, alongside its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24211083/what-if-amd-gaming-tablet-but-hugely-more-powerful-plugged-in">leaked Strix Halo</a> and Fire Range gaming notebook parts, its confirmed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/6/24237735/amd-z2-extreme-gaming-handheld-pc-chip">Ryzen Z2 handheld gaming chips</a>, and more.</p><p>AMD expects its gaming revenue to continue to decline this quarter, due in no small part to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles aging out, and<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/30/24209938/amd-q2-2024-earnings-datacenter-ai-revenue"> it’s not exactly the company’s primary focus these days anyhow</a>. On today’s call, Su pointed out how gaming only accounts for two percent of the company’s revenue, while data center is now well over half of the company’s business. She says that after spending 10 years turning AMD around, her next task is to “make AMD the end-to-end AI leader.”</p><div><p>The company had previously revealed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24240173/amd-udna-gpu-ai-gaming-rdna-cdna-jack-huynh">it’s turning its back on flagship GPUs to chase AI first</a>, so you shouldn’t expect new consumer RDNA 4 parts to compete with Nvidia’s best and priciest GPUs. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
