He joined in 2018.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo recently made the unexpected decision to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717610/nintendo-switch-original-price-increase">increase the prices of its last-gen Switch hardware</a> due to “market conditions,” adding $30 to the cost of the $199.99 Switch Lite, $40 to the standard $299.99 Switch, and $50 to the $349.99 Switch OLED. The price difference between the Switch OLED and the standalone Switch 2 now stands at a mere $50. But we found a deal that’s worth checking out for those who don’t want to spend anywhere near $400 for a Switch OLED.</p><p>Woot is still offering the <strong>Switch OLED that comes with white Joy-Con controllers and a free download code for <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em></strong>, which is one of the console’s best games. You’ll pay just $289.99 at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-nintendo-switch-oled-mario-kart-8-deluxe-bundle-international-model-2" rel="sponsored">Woot</a>, which was already a good deal at the OLED’s original $349.99 price, let alone compared to its new, inflated price. This deal is available for the next four days, or until supply runs dry.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->290</span></p><div><p>The Nintendo Switch OLED Model: Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Bundle includes a digital copy of <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>.</p></div></div><p>While the Switch 2 is currently getting all of the attention, the Switch OLED remains a great choice due to its vast game library full of modern classics. Some of its games may run better on the Switch 2, but you’ll still get the same experience overall on the last-gen console. In fact, the Switch OLED’s screen is superior in some ways to what’s offered in the newer hardware.</p><p>Looking past the facts that it’s a smaller 720p screen and locked to 60Hz refresh rate, the OLED panel knocks the socks off the Switch 2’s LCD when it comes to color accuracy, contrast, and brightness control. Since there’s an abundance of vibrant games available for the console, including <em>Super Mario Odyssey </em>and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em>, to name a couple, the Switch OLED’s screen will likely impress whoever’s playing on it.</p><p>Something to note: The discounted Switch OLED model is the “International version,” and the biggest difference between this and something you can get at Walmart or Target is that it has a 90-day warranty through Woot. If you can look past that, it includes a power adapter for US outlets, and the console itself is region-free, meaning that games from any region will play as intended.</p><div><p id="other-deals-you-might-like"><h2>Other deals you might like</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>This month’s <strong>Humble Choice lineup for PC gamers</strong> is worth the price of admission. <a rel="sponsored" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/482924/2091208/25796?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fmembership">$14.99</a> is all that it costs to get Steam codes for <em>Persona 5 Royal</em>, <em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</em>, cozy game <em>My Time at Sandrock</em>, <em>Lil Gator Game</em>, and more. You get to keep them forever, even if you cancel your membership. Not only that, paid members get discounts on other games in Humble’s store for as long as they subscribe, including on <a rel="sponsored" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/482924/2091208/25796?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-switch">digital Switch</a> and <a rel="sponsored" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/482924/2091208/25796?u=http%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fkirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-star-crossed-world-upgrade-pack-switch-2">Switch 2 upgrades</a>, among others.</span></li><li><span>We think that the <strong>16-inch Asus Zenbook S 16 laptop</strong> is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/713373/best-laptops-for-students">a fantastic choice for students</a> going back to school, or those who just want a great-looking and capable machine that doesn’t cost an arm and a leg. Its usual $1,399.99 price isn’t too much to ask, given that it has a 3K 120Hz OLED screen, AMD’s fast Ryzen AI 9 365 processor, 24GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and an <em>enormous </em>trackpad. But it’s an even easier recommendation right now at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-zenbook-s-16-16-3k-oled-touch-screen-laptop-copilot-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-9-365-24gb-memory-1tb-ssd-scandinavian-white%2F6584435.p" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, as it costs $999.99 (likely for a limited time). Something unexpected about this laptop is that its integrated graphics are more capable than we expected. It can run games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> at above 60 frames per second with some settings turned down.</span></li><li><span>If you’re a fan of Studio Ghibli films (how could you not be?), some of them are available on <strong>Blu-ray in gorgeous Steelbook editions</strong> starting at $16.29 at Amazon — a 40 percent discount off their usual $26.99 list price.
