            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/657686/nvidia-driver-hotfix-release-bugs-crashes-fixes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia has released another hotfix driver that primarily addresses bugs and crashes with its RTX 50-series GPUs. The <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5652">576.26 hotfix driver</a> is based on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/649599/nvidia-driver-576-02-bug-fixes-crashes-download-game-ready">576.02 driver release</a> earlier this month, which itself included a large amount of fixes for bugs and crashes.</p><p>This latest hotfix driver includes all the fixes in the 576.15 hotfix that was released last week, including a fix for the newly introduced <a href="http://GPU temperature bug">GPU temperature bug</a>. It also addresses flickering issues in <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, track corruption on <em>Forza Motorsport</em>, and <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> randomly crashing on RTX 50-series cards. There are a variety of fixes for <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, <em>Dead Island 2</em>, and <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> on RTX 50-series GPUs, too.</p><p>Nvidia has also included yet another supposed fix for black screen issues plaguing a range of LG monitors when using DisplayPort 2.1 mode. There’s also a fix for “grey screen crashes with multiple monitors” and “momentary display flicker occurs when running in DisplayPort2.1 mode with a high refresh rate” on RTX 50-series cards.</p><p>This is the fifth time Nvidia has released a hotfix driver over the past couple of months, which is a highly unusual amount and speaks to the persistent bugs and crashes that Nvidia GPU users have been reporting since the release of the RTX 50-series in January. I wrote last week that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/653115/nvidia-gpu-drivers-black-screen-crashes-issues">Nvidia’s GPU drivers are a mess</a>, and just a week later we already have another hotfix that attempts to address the latest problems.</p><p>It’s a far cry from three years ago when Nvidia was proudly boasting of its driver quality, and mocking AMD for releasing beta drivers. “We don’t release sub-par beta drivers with minimal testing, let alone multiple conflicting beta drivers forked from different development branches that support different games and products, which confuse customers,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fgame-ready-driver-program-ultimate-gaming-platform%2F" rel="sponsored">said Nvidia</a> in April 2022.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But it will “clarify” the “situation regarding importing” after May 2nd.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
