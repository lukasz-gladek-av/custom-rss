            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/644117/microsoft-quake-ii-ai-generated-tech-demo-muse-ai-model-copilot<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615048/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-model-gaming-muse">unveiled its Xbox AI era</a> earlier this year with a new Muse AI model that can generate gameplay. While it looked like Muse was still an early Microsoft Research project, the Xbox maker is now allowing Copilot users to try out Muse through an AI-generated version of <em>Quake II</em>.</p><p><a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/wham">The tech demo</a> is part of Microsoft’s Copilot for Gaming push, and features an AI-generated replica of <em>Quake II</em> that is playable in a browser. The <em>Quake II</em> level is very basic and includes blurry enemies and interactions, and Microsoft is limiting the amount of time you can even play this tech demo.</p><p>While Microsoft originally demonstrated its Muse AI model at 10fps and a 300 x 180 resolution, this latest demo runs at a playable frame rate and at a slightly higher resolution of 640 x 360. It’s still a very limited experience though, and more of hint at what might be possible in the future.</p><p>Microsoft is still positioning Muse as an AI model that can help game developers prototype games. When <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615048/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-model-gaming-muse">Muse was unveiled in February</a>, Microsoft also mentioned it was exploring how this AI model could help improve classic games, just like <em>Quake II</em>, and bring them to modern hardware.</p><p>“You could imagine a world where from gameplay data and video that a model could learn old games and really make them portable to any platform where these models could run,” said Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer in February. “We’ve talked about game preservation as an activity for us, and these models and their ability to learn completely how a game plays without the necessity of the original engine running on the original hardware opens up a ton of opportunity.”</p><p>It’s clear that Microsoft is now training Muse on more games than just <em>Bleeding Edge</em>, and it’s likely we’ll see more short interactive AI game experiences in Copilot Labs soon. Microsoft is also working on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628666/microsoft-xbox-copilot-for-gaming">turning Copilot into a coach for games</a>, allowing the AI assistant to see what you’re playing and help with tips and guides. Part of that experience will be available to Windows Insiders <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643235/microsoft-copilot-vision-windows-desktop-apps-mobile">through Copilot Vision</a> soon.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
