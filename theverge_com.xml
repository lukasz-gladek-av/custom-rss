            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24279789/fortnite-espn-football-island-disney<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Disney is releasing an experience tied to <em>Fortnite — </em>but it’s not the big “persistent universe” featuring all things Disney that was teased earlier this year. This new experience launching today is instead all about ESPN, and it’s called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15KQwebh_lw">ESPN Football Island</a>.</p><p>In the experience, you’ll be able to participate in activities, challenges, mini-games, and a big <a href="https://overwatch-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Payload">Payload-style game</a> called “Touchdown Rush” where you guard a football from your opponents as it moves toward an end zone. ESPN Football Island will also have persistent progression and its own unlockable cosmetics that will be exclusive to the experience.</p><p>ESPN Football Island was built using the Unreal Editor for <em>Fortnite </em>(UEFN), a powerful set of development tools Epic launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/22/23645671/fortnite-unreal-editor-epic-games-state-of-gdc-2023-creative">last year</a> to let people make <em>Fortnite</em> experiences. While this ESPN island is a branded Disney experience that’s separate from <em>Fortnite’s</em> main battle royale modes, Disney properties have been a frequent presence within battle royale, including with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/15/24221374/fortnite-marvel-absolute-doctor-doom">latest season’s Marvel theme</a>.</p><p>If you want to try ESPN Football Island yourself, you can access it by entering the code 4481-0077-4190 from the <em>Fortnite</em> menu.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
