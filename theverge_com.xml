            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>You want your games to play the smoothest they possibly can — but sometimes, screen technology gets in the way. That’s why some of the latest TVs and handhelds feature <em>variable refresh rate</em> (VRR) screens that can compensate when your graphics can’t deliver a consistent 60 or 120 frames per second.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has a VRR screen — and originally, Nintendo advertised that the Switch 2 would also work with your VRR-capable TV. But Nintendo soon <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oliemack.bsky.social/post/3lmxv4nwjp22g">scrubbed mentions of docked VRR</a> from its website, and on May 16th, it apologized. “Nintendo Switch 2 supports VRR in handheld mode only,” the company <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-apologises-for-error-with-mention-of-switch-2-vrr-tv-support">told <em>Nintendo Life</em></a><em>, </em>apologizing for “the incorrect information.”</p><p>But I’ve just confirmed that the official Nintendo Switch 2 dock <em>does</em> support VRR — by plugging the Steam Deck into it.</p><p>In fact, we found multiple rival handhelds can output 4K at 120Hz with both HDR and VRR if you plug them into the Nintendo Switch 2 dock. I saw the same with the Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS, and an Asus ROG Ally X <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">with Bazzite</a>, each outputting to my Samsung S90C TV. We got the idea from Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1lnh0fe/psa_switch_2_dock_supports_vrr_and_hdr_on_steam/?share_id=Pge9JSi-B5Dxocskxn-Yu&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">where u/DynaMach</a> and others have reported VRR working this way.</p><p>It’s not particularly <em>practical</em> to play a PC handheld via Nintendo’s dock, because you’ll need a female-to-male USB-C extension cable and you’ll need to continually hold it against Nintendo’s spring-loaded platform to keep it from getting ejected — but I just so happened to have one of those cables lying around.</p><p>And before you ask, yes, I did actually test that 4K VRR actually works at up to 120 frames per second — I didn’t just trust SteamOS’s flag that it was supported. I downloaded <a href="https://github.com/Nixola/VRRTest">the open-source VRRTest tool</a> and messed with various settings, just to check that intermediate framerates between 48fps and 60fps and 90fps all stayed smooth on my TV as the framerate fluctuates.</p><p>So if the Switch 2 supports VRR, and the dock supports VRR, why does Nintendo not offer VRR display output from the Nintendo Switch 2?</p><p>It would be a boon in many games, whether we’re talking about games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> that don’t run at 60fps on Switch to begin with, or even games that only occasionally dip below that threshold (say, 55fps) where that dip currently manifests as a big stutter in your gameplay.</p><p>Personally, I think it’s possible Nintendo just doesn’t think the Switch 2 is ready to put it on the big screen.</p><p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review"><em>Digital Foundry</em> found “clear problems”</a> even in the Switch 2’s handheld VRR mode, including judder in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>No Man’s Sky</em>’s 40fps “performance” modes, as well as <em>Hitman: World of Assassination’s</em> unlocked-but-capped 60fps mode — although Nintendo’s own Welcome Tour showed proper VRR support.</p><p>“Clearly the feature is in there and working, because the Welcome Tour proves it, but the actual implementation in other games so far is disappointing,” <em>Digital Foundry</em>’s Rich Leadbetter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uQ5CMfFc7c&amp;t=2332s">explained on the channel’s podcast</a>.</p><p>But if you’re looking for technical reasons why Nintendo might not pass along VRR to the official dock, Leadbetter tells me he hasn’t yet heard a good theory. He does believe, however, that Nintendo probably made an honest mistake when it wrote, then apologized for writing, that the Switch 2 would support VRR in TV mode. He doubts that Nintendo axed the feature at the last minute.</p><div><p>This is just the latest technological weirdness around the Switch 2’s launch, like we saw when testing the Switch 2’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/695915/switch-2-usb-c-third-party-docks-dont-work-authentication-encryption">semi-locked-down USB-C video output</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/693182/nintendo-switch-2-webcam-mystery-1080p-480p-uvc-iso-bulk-ugreen-elgato">why the best webcams didn’t work</a>.</p></div><p>But as before, Nintendo is staying silent: it didn’t have a comment for our story.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/697937/nintendo-switch-2-vrr-steam-deck-rog-x-ally-120hz]]></content:encoded>
