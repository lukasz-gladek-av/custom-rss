The new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/07/revealing-the-hyperpop-collection-with-three-new-designs-for-ps5-accessories-launching-this-march/">Hyperpop Collection</a> includes colorful neon console covers and controllers that really add a pop of color to a PS5. Sadly, if you own a PS5 Pro then you won’t be able to enjoy the RGB in your living room fun.</p><p>There are three colors available: techno red, remix green, and rhythm blue (RGB!). All three are very different to the console covers that Sony has shipped for the PS5 so far, and they certainly look like they’d fit in well with RGB lights. Sony says the collection is designed with RGB in mind and to “take over” your room. “Inspired by the glow of the RGB lights of your impressive gaming setups, these new colors go LOUD in the best possible way,” says Leo Cardoso, from Sony’s color, material, and finish design team.</p><p>The Hyperpop Collection launches on March 12th, with preorders kicking off at 10AM local time on January 16th at Sony’s <a href="https://sonyps.prf.hn/click/camref:1101l5nbBL/%5Bp_id:1011l394533%5D/destination:http%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2F" rel="sponsored">PlayStation Direct</a> website and retailers. The PS5 console covers are priced at $74.99 and only available in limited quantities, and the DualSense controllers are $84.99.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/857603/sony-ps5-covers-controller-hyperpop-color-accessories]]></content:encoded>
