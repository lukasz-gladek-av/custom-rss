            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/633884/mythic-quest-side-quest-the-last-raid<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/charles-pulliam-moore">Charles Pulliam-Moore</a> <span>is a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Aside from cutscenes, most of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tv-reviews/24350444/mythic-quest-season-4-review-apple-tv-plus">Mythic Ques</a>t </em>takes place in the real world. But Apple’s upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296445/mythic-quest-season-4-premiere-date-side-quest">spinoff series <em>Side Quest</em></a> will give us a much better look at what the game looks like from within.</p><p>While some of <em>Side Quest</em>’s four episodes focus on people’s lives outside of and away from <em>Mythic Quest</em>, the final episode, titled “The Last Raid,” takes place within the fictional MMORPG and follows high schoolers Devon (Van Crosby), Kelly (Melanie Brook), Rory (Alice Wen), Seth (David Andrew Calvillo), and Freddie (Justin Jarzombek) setting out to fight powerful bosses. In this exclusive clip from the episode, the kids have been playing <em>Mythic Quest </em>for years and made an annual tradition of taking on big raids to commemorate becoming friends in the game.</p><p>“The Last Raid” makes <em>Mythic Quest </em>(the game) look a bit like a dated <em>World of Warcraft </em>clone compared to cutscenes from <em>Mythic Quest</em>’s (the series) more recent seasons. But the episode, and the rest of <em>Side Quest</em>, may offer a better sense of what keeps players returning to <em>Mythic Quest</em>.</p><p>The entire season hits Apple TV Plus on March 26th.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
