Analogue says the first preorders are its top priority and that “all open orders will ship before restock orders ship.” That means new orders could be delayed if something throws a wrench into Analogue getting the first ones out the door.</p><p>The Analogue 3D, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23915941/analogue-3d-nintendo-64">announced in October 2023</a>, hit <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762883/analogue-3d-delay-q4-2025">repeated delays</a> before finally shipping on November 18th. Like the company’s previous consoles, including the Game Boy-inspired <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22831589/analogue-pocket-review">Analogue Pocket</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/7/16981722/analogue-super-nt-snes-nintendo-review">Super Nt</a> that recreated the Super Nintendo, the Analogue plays original N64 cartridges from every region, including both PAL and NTSC carts, using an FPGA that perfectly recreates the Nintendo 64’s functionality rather than emulating it.</p><p>The Analogue 3D works with original N64 controllers. It’s also compatible with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/716292/8bitdo-64-wireless-controller-nintendo-analogue-3d">wireless controller from 8BitDo</a> explicitly designed for the console.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/826302/analogue-3d-console-nintendo-64-restock-price-increase]]></content:encoded>
