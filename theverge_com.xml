In many ways, it’s exactly what we hoped for: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">a Switch, only better</a>. And yet there’s something… underwhelming about it. Maybe it’s unfair, but we’ve come to expect Nintendo to consistently amaze us with either how its consoles work or the games you can play with them. In this case, it still feels like a Switch. Only better. And <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685505/nintendo-says-your-bad-switch-2-battery-life-might-be-a-bug">not universally better, either</a>.</p><p>On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a>, now that a number of folks on our team have spent some real time with the Switch 2, it’s time to talk about how we feel about this new console. First, <em>The Verge</em>’s Andrew Webster joins the show to talk through his review, from the controllers to the design to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2">the game-changing games</a> here and yet to come. Then, <em>The Verge</em>’s Ash Parrish tells us about her experiences traveling with the Switch 2, how her experience has compared to her first demos of the device, and the games she’s been playing so far. Then we pivot a bit, and talk about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/684247/xbox-ally-x-hands-on-gears-of-war-reloaded">the Xbox Ally X</a> and Microsoft’s own vision for handheld gaming.</p><p>Finally, <em>The Verge</em>’s Sean Hollister helps us answer a question from the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579493/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc">the state of consoles</a>. Everything in gaming seems more expensive than ever, and more expensive all the time; is it time for the console business to change?</p><p>If you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started:</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
