            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/660057/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Rockstar Games is delaying the highly anticipated release of <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> to May 26th, 2026. The game had originally been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158510/gta-6-release-date-fall-2025">planned to release in fall 2025</a>, but Rockstar Games now says the team needs extra time “to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.”</p><p>In a message posted on the <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258aa538o412ok/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-coming-may-26-2026">Rockstar Games website</a>, the development team apologized for the delay:</p><div><blockquote><p>We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.</p><p>With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.</p><p>We look forward to sharing more information with you soon.</p></blockquote></div><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23988446/gta-vi-trailer-leaked-vice-city">first <em>GTA VI</em> trailer</a> was revealed in December 2023, and since then we’ve heard very little about the game aside from the narrowed down release date that’s now been pushed to next year. The next installment in the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> franchise will be set in Vice City, and feature the series’ first female protagonist — Lucia — with Bonnie and Clyde–inspired story elements.</p><p><em>GTA VI</em> is a highly anticipated title, and we might get some more details about the game’s delay during parent company Take-Two’s next financial results on May 15th. Take Two’s stock price dropped 8 percent in premarket trading on the NASDAQ this morning after the news of the delay.</p><p><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> is still massively popular 11 years after its launch, recently taking the number one spot on Twitch as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/655394/gta-5-most-watched-twitch-game-gta-vi">most watched game of 2024</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
