He previously wrote for <em>Business Insider, Rolling Stone, </em><em>Futurism, </em>and <em>Popular Science.</em></span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you’re going to prove to your siblings that you’re still the family’s <em>Mario Kart </em>champion, you’re going to need an extra controller to make sure it’s a fair race. Fortunately, <strong>8BitDo’s Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller</strong> — which is compatible with the Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, and Windows machines — is marked down to a new low of $55.99 ($14 off) at Amazon in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F194QFT2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">black</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F2H6VKP8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">white</a> ahead of Black Friday.</p><p>The Ultimate 2 has all the hallmarks of a premium wireless gamepad, including drift-resistant TMR joysticks, Hall effect triggers, rumble, motion controls, and programmable rear buttons. It has the same general layout as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-SwitchTM-2-Pro-Controller-Switch/dp/B0F3VTFD6J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Nintendo’s Switch 2 Pro Controller</a>, too, with a pair of offset joysticks, four face buttons, and a directional pad. It can be connected to the Switch or Switch 2 via Bluetooth, the included 2.4Ghz USB-C adapter, or a USB-C cable. Windows connectivity is limited to wired mode or the included 2.4GHZ adapter.</p><p>Additionally, 8BitDo includes a wireless charging cradle, though you can also plug it into a power adapter or power bank with a USB-C cable to top it off. A <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/814551/8bitdos-latest-wireless-controllers-can-now-shake-to-wake-the-switch-2">recent firmware update</a> even introduced the ability to wake the Switch 2 from sleep mode by gently shaking the controller. The latest firmware won’t be preinstalled, mind you, but you can easily download it using 8BitDo’s <a href="https://app.8bitdo.com/Ultimate-Software-V2/">Ultimate Software V2</a> on your PC or Mac.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller doesn’t feature a 3.5mm audio jack like Nintendo’s official pro-grade controller. Nonetheless, its drift-resistant joysticks and lower price should more than make up for that small, technical shortcoming.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandt Ranj</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/827225/8bitdo-ultimate-2-bluetooth-controller-black-friday-deal-sale-2025]]></content:encoded>
