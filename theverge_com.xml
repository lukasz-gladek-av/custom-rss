Previously, at Protocol, The Wall Street Journal, and Wired.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Switch 2 is a hit (and a supply chain success story). Microsoft is starting to show off its plan for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad">the future of Xbox</a>. And everywhere you look, there are reasons to think we’re headed toward a very different kind of gaming device. Maybe it’ll be even more modular and portable. Maybe it’ll be even more like a Windows PC. Maybe it’ll be all that a bunch of other things besides.</p><div><p>On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a>, Nilay and David are joined by <em>The Verge</em>’s <a href="http://[Threads is finally getting DMs | The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/news/684120/threads-direct-messaging-inbox-dm-test-availability)">Jake Kastrenakes</a> to talk all about the future of gaming. We’ll have more of a Switch 2 review on the show next Tuesday, but for now there’s a lot of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">Xbox Ally stuff </a>to talk about, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">3.5 million Switch 2s</a> to reckon with. Before we get into that, though, we talk a bit more about this year’s WWDC, why Apple executives spent so much time <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685106/apple-ai-siri-delay-craig-federighi-greg-joswiak-wwdc-2025">apologizing for and explaining Siri</a>, and why <em>F1 </em>seemed to be what the company <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/f1-apple-movie-strategy-tim-cook-lewis-hamilton-1236424270/">actually wanted to talk about</a>.</p></div><div><p>After that, we run through some AI news. Because there’s a lot of it. Disney is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/685433/disney-universal-sue-midjourney-copyright-infringement">suing Midjourney</a>; Google Zero is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684192/online-publishers-are-facing-a-chatbot-calamity">rapidly approaching</a>; Alexa Plus is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684560/amazon-alexa-plus-one-million-users-coming-summer-2025">apparently actually out there</a>; and the Dia browser has some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/web/685232/dia-browser-ai-arc">big ideas about chatbots</a>. And it all <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685045/sam-altman-average-chatgpt-energy-water">uses some water</a>, says Sam Altman, citing no sources.</p></div><div><p>Finally, in the lightning round, it’s time for another round of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/685599/fcc-commissioner-democrat-anna-gomez-trump-carr-first-amendment-tour">Brendan Carr is a Dummy</a>, plus the latest on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682633/warner-bros-discovery-splitting-company">Warner Bros. Discovery split</a>, some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685659/pny-duolink-v3-usb-flash-drive">super-fast USB drives</a>, and Meta’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684120/threads-direct-messaging-inbox-dm-test-availability">next new messaging platform</a>.</p></div><p>If you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started, beginning with gaming and gadget news:</p><p>And in AI news:</p><p>And in the lightning round:</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
