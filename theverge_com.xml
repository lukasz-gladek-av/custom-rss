Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The team of nearly 200 Activision Blizzard developers behind the <em>Overwatch</em> franchise has unionized. Formed under the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the Overwatch Gamemakers Guild is the latest wall-to-wall Blizzard union to be recognized by parent company Microsoft since the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24205366/world-of-warcraft-developers-form-union-blizzard-entertainment"><em>World of Warcraft</em> development team announced its own union</a> last July.</p><p><a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/overwatch-game-developers-secure-union-recognition-communications-workers-america">The CWA announced on Friday</a> that “an overwhelming majority of workers have either signed a union authorization card or indicated that they wanted union representation.” The <em>Overwatch</em> union unit includes game developers across production, engineering, design, art, sound, and quality assurance, pushing for job security, salary, and layoff protection improvements.</p><p>“After a long history of layoffs, crunch, and subpar working conditions in the global video game industry, my coworkers and I are thrilled to be joining the broader union effort to organize our industry for the better, which has been long overdue,” organizing committee member Foster Elmendorf said in the CWA’s statement.</p><p>Allegations that Activision Blizzard fostered a workplace environment of toxicity and sexual harassment emerged following a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay">lawsuit filed by the state of California in 2021</a>, prior to the company being acquired by Microsoft in 2023. Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has denied that the company was responsible for reported abuse concerns and instead <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/1/23744109/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-denies-harassment-variety">blamed the issues on labor organizers.</a> Following its $68.7 billion acquisition by Microsoft, Activision Blizzard agreed to pay <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/15/24003556/california-activision-blizzard-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-settlement">$54 million to settle the lawsuit</a>.</p><p>The CWA says that over 2,600 workers at Microsoft-owned gaming studios have now joined its ranks, including a union formed by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094602/activision-blizzard-qa-workers-unionizing-microsoft">600 quality assurance workers employed at Activision</a> in March 2024. These strings of unionization efforts follow a labor neutrality agreement that was signed between the CWA and Microsoft in 2022 that made it easier for staffers at subsidiaries like Activision Blizzard to organize.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
