He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Roblox is launching a new licensing platform that will make it easier for companies to offer their intellectual property (IP) to creators so they can build approved experiences. The platform includes a license manager that “equips rights holders with new self-serve IP management tools” and a licenses catalog that creators can browse and use to apply for “licensed use of IP,” according to a newsroom post <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/07/roblox-launches-new-licensing-platform-for-experiences">from Roblox CPO Manuel Bronstein</a>.</p><p>The platform is initially launching with four partners: Lionsgate, Netflix, Sega, and Kodansha. Seven IPs will be available for “licensed use‬ by eligible creators,” including <em>Squid Game</em>, <em>Stranger Things</em>, <em>Twilight</em>, <em>Saw</em>, and <em>Like a Dragon</em>. “Two more will follow in the coming weeks, with‬ additional IPs being added later this year,” according to Bronstein.</p><p>Initially, “full-experience adaptations” will be the “first form of‬ agreement” that Roblox is offering, but “we’re exploring additional license types and offering more ways‬ to bring IP to Roblox for all types of creators,” Bronstein says.</p><div><p>Epic Games’ <em>Fortnite</em> also lets creators build experiences using official assets from franchises like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296627/fortnite-tmnt-roguelike-user-made-games-creators"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em></a> and <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/let-the-games-begin-start-creating-squid-game-islands-in-fortnite?lang=en-US"><em>Squid Game</em></a>. At some point, <em>Fortnite</em> creators will be able to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678399/epic-games-fortnite-ai-darth-vaders-tech-creators">make <em>Star Wars</em> experiences</a>, too.</p></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/707075/roblox-creators-licensing-netflix-stranger-things-lionsgate-twilight]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/706967/8bitdo-pro-3-wireless-bluetooth-controller-tmr-swappable-buttons</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-pro-3-is-8bitdo%E2%80%99s-first-controller-with-swappable-buttons.1244151/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>8BitDo has released a new version of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22364301/8bitdo-pro-2-controller-review-switch-back-buttons">wireless Pro controller</a> that was last updated in 2021. Many of 8BitDo’s recent controller releases, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619229/8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-tmr-anti-drift-joysticks">Ultimate 2</a>, feature an asymmetrical joystick layout like Nintendo and Microsoft use. But the <a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-pro-3">new Pro 3</a> mirrors the design of the PlayStation DualSense controller, with side-by-side sticks that are now upgraded with drift-resistant <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">TMR technology</a>. The Pro 3 is also 8BitDo’s first controller that lets you easily swap the arrangement of its ABXY buttons.</p><p>The 8BitDo Pro 2 launched at $49.99 four years ago, but the new Pro 3 is debuting with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFGQ6J35/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">slightly steeper $69.99 price</a>. 8BitDo has also switched to using a 1,000mAh rechargeable battery for the Pro 3, and while the company says it offers up to 20 hours of gameplay on a full charge, it’s not removable. The Pro 3 includes a convenient charging dock that doubles as storage for its 2.4GHz dongle. When the controller dies, it can still be used while connected to a console via USB, and it will charge while you play.</p><p>The Pro 3 is available for preorder starting today and officially will be on sale on August 12th. There are three color options, each of which matches different retro consoles: gray (PlayStation), G classic (Game Boy), and purple (GameCube).</p><p>The Pro 3’s design is nearly identical to the Pro 2, but it’s gained a few extra buttons. It carries forward the Pro 2’s back buttons while introducing an additional set of smaller shoulder buttons. Its triggers also use Hall effect sensors for improved accuracy and durability, while newly added switches let you choose a longer trigger for racing games or a shorter one for faster reaction times in FPS titles.</p><p>Compatibility includes support for Windows, Android, both Switch consoles (with waking capabilities), SteamOS (you can shake the controller to wake the OLED Steam Deck), and Apple’s hardware, with Bluetooth, USB, or wireless 2.4GHz connectivity.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>The Pro 3 includes a pair of ball-top caps that give it an arcade machine feel.</em></figcaption> <cite>Image: 8BitDo</cite></span></p></section><p>Out of the box, the Pro 3 uses the Xbox’s button layout, but you can swap the A and B buttons to match Nintendo Switch controllers or rearrange them all to whatever layout you prefer. The Pro 3 works with 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software V2 so that you can remap the layout, and the controller can store and switch between three different custom profiles.</p><p>Although the ergonomics are questionable, 8BitDo is also including a pair of arcade-style ball-top caps that can be attached to the Pro 3’s joysticks.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/706967/8bitdo-pro-3-wireless-bluetooth-controller-tmr-swappable-buttons]]></content:encoded>
