            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24288014/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-snoop-dogg-times-square-music<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>In front of thousands of fans in Times Square, with most of the sprawling screens displaying his face, Snoop Dogg provided a twist on one of hip-hop’s iconic lines. “It ain’t nothin’ but a gangsta party,” he chanted. “It ain’t nothin’ but a <em>Fortnite </em>gangsta party.”&nbsp;The moment was part of a concert that also featured Ice Spice, all performed live in New York while being broadcast as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285464/fortnite-remix-the-prelude-event-how-to-watch">an in-game event for anyone logged in to the game</a>. The battle royale has had plenty of concerts and events in recent years, but the Snoop collaboration is part of a plan to more deeply integrate music into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24065901/fortnite-metaverse-disney-epic-partnership">the budding metaverse</a>.</p><p>“This is a partnership,” Snoop said during an interview after the show. “Most games just want one song and you don’t even see the artist. So for them to let us be a part of the game, and that community, it’s deep.”</p><p>In the past, <em>Fortnite</em>’s big musical moments have largely been singular virtual concerts from the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling">Ariana Grande</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/29/24187226/fortnite-metallica-concert-interview">Metallica</a>. But over the years, music has steadily permeated the game to the point that Snoop’s Times Square performance was just a kickoff point for a monthlong event.</p><p><em>Fortnite</em>’s current season, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24283508/fortnite-remix-chapter-2-concert-snoop-dogg-ice-spice">dubbed Chapter 2 Remix</a>, debuted this weekend, rewinding the clock with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20905428/fortnite-chapter-2-season-1-release-date-battle-pass-black-hole">a version of the battle royale map from several years ago</a>. But there’s a twist — hence the “remix” in the title. Each week, the game will change slightly, themed around a different artist. Snoop is up first. You can enlist him as a companion, visit a heavily guarded Dogg Pound compound, or rock out as his tracks play on the radio as you drive around the island.</p><p>If you boot up <em>Fortnite Festival</em>, the rhythm game developed by <em>Rock Band</em> studio Harmonix, he’s the new headlining act, which means you can buy his songs to play along to, unlock Snoop-themed guitars and drum sets, and buy a crip walk emote that plays “Drop It Like It’s Hot.” Snoop will be followed by Eminem, Ice Spice, and the late Juice WRLD, with future updates introducing elements like <a href="https://x.com/andredotuasset/status/1853219859741475322?t=EH9BlSHw3u3Xp4yw0XECiA">a gun that spits Eminem lyrics</a>.</p><p>According to Nate Nanzer, head of global partnerships at <em>Fortnite</em> developer Epic, there have been two key points in the evolution of music in the game that led to this point. The first was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report">Travis Scott’s “Astronomical” concert</a>, which showed the scale possible with these kinds of virtual events, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233946/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-record-breaking-player-count">an audience topping 12 million</a>. “After we did Travis Scott we had everybody coming to us saying ‘Hey, I want to do that,’” says Nanzer.</p><p>The second was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23992574/fortnite-festival-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band">the launch of <em>Fortnite Festival</em> last year</a>. Like the battle royale mode, <em>Festival</em> has seasons, each “headlined” by a different artist, which, to date, has included stars like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137317/billie-eilish-fortnite-festival-date">Billie Eilish</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24079009/lady-gaga-comes-to-fortnite-tomorrow">Lady Gaga</a>. “If you look at all of the things we did prior, they tended to be more one-off,” says Nanzer. “We’d do an event, and then months or even years would go by before we did something else. What <em>Festival</em> did was give us this venue to be able to celebrate music more regularly.</p><p>For Snoop’s son Cordell Broadus, there was one particular moment that convinced him Snoop should be in <em>Fortnite</em>. In 2022, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/21/23034095/fortnite-wu-tang-clan-gear">a collaboration with the Wu-Tang Clan</a> featured an in-game glider that would play the chorus to “C.R.E.A.M” as players flew down to the battle royale island. “I kept saying: ‘I gotta put his music in there,’” he explains. “Because every time I play<em> Fortnite</em> that’s what I hear. So a lot of the inspiration came from seeing them doing it, and seeing that <em>Fortnite</em>’s not afraid to really deal with hardcore hip-hop.”</p><p>That feeling grew stronger as the more ambitious virtual concerts continued to make waves. “We’re real competitive,” says Broadus. “So we’re competing with Travis Scott. What he did with <em>Fortnite </em>was huge, and I feel like we topped that tonight. But we’ll let the people decide.” (Snoop was quick to clarify that “I didn’t say that, he said that.”)</p><p>The <em>Fortnite</em> collaborations that get headlines — and a prime Friday night spot in Times Square — feature huge artists. But part of turning the game into a viable venue for music, according to Nanzer, is integrating it in multiple ways so that all kinds of artists can be featured. In addition to virtual concerts and headlining <em>Festival</em>, there are the emotes, in-game radio stations, and individual tracks you can buy to play in <em>Festival</em>.</p><div><p>Not all of these ideas have worked out. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21423004/fortnite-party-royale-concert-series-dominic-fike">Epic tried to create a virtual tour stop for artists in 2020</a>, going so far as to build out a studio space in Los Angeles, and the effort has largely fizzled out. But as the company continues to try to push <em>Fortnite</em> beyond its battle royale roots, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic">games like <em>Lego Fortnite</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24258447/fortnite-creators-first-person-shooters-fps-unreal-editor">a concentrated focus on community-made games and experiences</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest">a still-mysterious virtual world built with Disney</a>, music is another important tool to make the game more than just another live-service shooter, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">an increasingly difficult space to compete in</a>. That’s true at various scales, from Snoop in New York to an indie band getting its first airtime on a <em>Fortnite</em> radio station.</p></div><p>“We want to work with the biggest artists in the world,” says Nanzer, “but we also want to figure out if we can break artists in <em>Fortnite</em>.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
