The policy was announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/822718/roblox-age-estimation-verification-chat-rollout">in November 2025</a> and was rolled out to Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/12/safety-snapshot-age-checks-for-chat">in December</a>, but now users will be prompted to complete an age check to be able to chat in “all regions where chat is available,” <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2026/01/roblox-age-checks-required-to-chat">Roblox says</a>.</p><p>The company’s facial scan age check process uses technology from Persona, which is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707125/reddit-age-verification-uk-online-safety">also used by Reddit</a>. If a user wants to appeal the result of their age check, they can also verify their age via ID verification, and a parent can also use parental controls to update the age of their child.</p><p>Once a user’s age has been set, they’ll be able to chat with other users in similar age groups. “By default, users in each age group can chat with users in the groups directly above and below theirs (i.e., users 9-12 can chat with users in their own group, as well as those in the under 9 and 13-15 groups),” according to Roblox. Users younger than 9 must have parental consent to use chat.</p><p>“Tens of millions of daily active users have already completed an age check, and we expect<br>many more to follow,” Roblox says. “In Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands, where age checks have been required to chat since early December, more than 50% of daily active users have completed the process.”</p><div><p>Multiple states filed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760162/roblox-louisiana-lawsuit-child-predators-safety">lawsuits</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/793711/another-state-is-suing-roblox">last</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/816549/texas-roblox-lawsuit-child-safety">year</a> against Roblox over child safety issues. In addition to requiring age checks, the company has also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760805/roblox-sexual-content-lawsuit-age-verification">locked down sexual content</a> and given parents <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641167/roblox-parental-controls-block-friends-experiences">more parental controls</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/856696/roblox-age-check-estimation-chat]]></content:encoded>
