            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/674176/nintendo-switch-2-usb-mouse-support<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/wes-davis">Wes Davis</a> <span>is a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>You’ll be able to use a USB mouse with the Nintendo Switch 2 in at least one game, as a Koei Tecmo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CstlgmcDgy0&amp;t=623s">developer commentary video</a> for the upcoming<em> Nobunaga’s Ambition: Awakening Complete Edition</em> revealed this week. That’s great news if your wrists, like mine, started preemptively cramping the first time you saw video of someone tipping a Joy-Con 2 controller on its edge for mouse mode.</p><p>While demonstrating the game’s use of the Joy-Con 2 as a mouse, producer Michi Ryu stops and plugs in a USB mouse. The Switch 2 displays a message that says a mouse has been connected, and he continues to play with both a mouse and his left Joy-Con 2, switching between them seamlessly, the same way you’ll be able to go back and forth between gyro and mouse control <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642493/nintendo-switch-mouse-controls-metroid-prime-4">in <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a>.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switch-2-supports-usb-mouse-controls-developer-reveals/"><em>VideoGamesChronicle</em> notes</a>, the original Switch had mouse and keyboard support, though only some games took advantage, like the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fturok-switch%2F" rel="sponsored">Nightdive-developed <em>Turok</em> port</a>. (If you own that game and never noticed the “Mouse” option in its input settings, go plug in a USB mouse and keyboard and try it out — you won’t want to go back.)</p><p>This time around, Nintendo is embracing mouse support more. For instance, the company published a video to its Nintendo Today app earlier this month, showing that when you put a Joy-Con 2 on its edge for mouse mode, an onscreen pointer appears for navigating the system’s menu.</p><p>So does the <em>Nobunaga’s Ambition</em> video, mean a standard mouse works interchangeably with a Joy-Con 2 controller anywhere where mouse control is supported? I sure hope so, but we don’t know that yet. And Nintendo didn’t immediately respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s email asking if that was the case.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/673768/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review-danganronpa<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em> starts off by asking a simple question: what happens when you pluck a handful of colorful teenagers from their homes, plop them in a state-of-the-art school filled with every convenience, then force them to fight for their lives? Your guide as you navigate this question is an unsettling and creepy-cute mascot that knows more than it’s let on, and there’s an overarching mystery to the world that you can’t quite put your finger on. </p><p>If you, like I, answered “<em>Danganronpa</em>!” — as this premise sounds very much like the plot of the quirky and irreverent murder-mystery series from Spike Chunsoft — then congratulations! We’re both totally wrong! And after 45 in-game days with <em>LDA,</em> I still have no idea what’s going on, and I love it.</p><p>I’m going to be gentle with myself and you for thinking <em>LDA</em> is another entry in the genre of high school-themed killing games. After all, it was developed by Kazutaka Kodaka, creator and writer of the <em>Danganronpa </em>franchise, in collaboration with Kotaro Uchikoshi, known for his work on the adventure-puzzle game series <em>Zero Escape</em>. And though <em>LDA</em> oozes with the DNA from both series, it stands so completely apart mechanically and narratively that while I can get a grasp on the former, I’m lost with the latter.</p><p>The premise is simple enough. You play as Takumi Sumino, who gets whisked away to the Last Defense Academy, where he and a group of others use their newly awakened powers to defend the school from monster attacks for 100 days. Should they fail, the invaders will destroy the school and thereby… because of plot… all of humanity. Usually past a certain point, I can figure out a game’s core gameplay loop and rough narrative thrust. When the first body dropped in <em>Danganronpa</em>, I immediately understood that I’d be spending the rest of the game solving my classmates’ murders. But I haven’t been able to figure out <em>LDA</em>.</p><div><p><em>LDA</em> fills the gaping hole <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23557639/fire-emblem-engage-nintendo-switch-review"><em>Fire Emblem Engage</em></a> created and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23688312/advance-wars-reboot-camp-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Advance Wars </em>remakes</a> could not fix</p></div><p>I understand the gameplay loop easily enough: it’s a tactical RPG with visual novel-like relationship-building elements. Combat takes place on a gridded battlefield with each combatant able to attack in a different configuration, similar to chess. One of Takumi’s abilities attacks enemies in a straight line. My ally, Gaku, attacks in a rectangular pattern. Each of my allies’ attacks contributes to a voltage meter that allows us to use our special abilities when full. And if one of my allies should fall, they’ll be revived before the next wave of enemies. </p><p>I like how the tactical combat isn’t like <em>Fire Emblem</em> or <em>Triangle Strategy</em>. <em>LDA </em>is unique, as you’re not trying to manage the complex rock-paper-scissors formula of what weapons are strong or weak against each other. Instead, life is the engine that drives combat. Actions you take are determined by how many action points, or AP, you have, and killing certain enemies grants you more AP. On the flip side, allies who are near death can unleash big special attacks that can clear entire battlefields at the cost of losing them for the rest of the wave.</p><p>Combat then becomes a function of playing with life totals — my enemies and mine. I’ll arrange my attacks in such a way that every time I act, I kill an enemy and gain more AP so I can just keep going, denying my enemies the chance to fight back. Then, when I’m out of AP, I can unleash a killing blow that ends the round. My allies get revived the next round, and I can start the process all over again. I’ve been left so unsatisfied by the crop of tactical RPGs lately, and <em>LDA</em> fills the gaping hole <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23557639/fire-emblem-engage-nintendo-switch-review"><em>Fire Emblem Engage</em></a> created and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23688312/advance-wars-reboot-camp-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Advance Wars </em>remakes</a> could not fix.</p><p>But while I’ve got a handle on the combat, I still haven’t the faintest clue of the story it’s trying to tell. My confusion is so thorough that as I go through each new day, my experiences start sounding like wartime letters from the front lines.</p><div><blockquote><p>It’s day 33. Our self-proclaimed leader, Hiruko, is still missing. We’re starting to suspect she’ll never return. Meanwhile, the enemy keeps hurling themselves at our defenses. So far, we’ve been able to hold them off. Gaku recently developed his power, revealing himself to be a peerless ranged fighter. But our forces are nowhere near full strength, since Ima, Kako, and Shouma refuse to fight. And alas! Our foodstores have burnt up and I fear we’ll starve soon. War is grim, but I fight knowing the closer I get to the 100th day is a day I am closer to returning home… or so I hope.</p></blockquote></div><p><em>LDA</em>’s narrative is so unlike anything I’ve ever experienced that not knowing what’s happening next is part of the fun. I like getting dragged along for the ride, discovering new developments alongside the characters, who are themselves a delight. <a href="https://aftermath.site/darumi-amemiya-the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-emo-cringe-punk">As other outlets have pointed out</a>, Darumi Amemiya is the physical manifestation of the irony-poisoned and terminally online dirtbag edgel(ady), and I adore her even if her characterization gets uncomfortably familiar sometimes. </p><p>I also really enjoy how the characters are over-the-top caricatures themselves — Darumi’s the creepy murder-obsessed emo girl, Takemaru’s the typical fighting-obsessed delinquent — but make decisions like normal people. I often struggle to get into “transported to another world” stories because none of the decisions made in them have ever made sense to me, a woman who can’t turn off her overly logical and reason-obsessed brain in order to just go with the flow. So it’s incredibly refreshing to see these characters push back on the circumstances they’ve been dropped in. </p><p>Instead of just accepting that they’ve been taken from everything they’ve ever known and forced to fight <em>and die</em> (even if that death is temporary), some of my allies maintain a healthy level of skepticism, question everything, and refuse to fight. I know I would! And even better, other characters in the game understand and acknowledge that as a reasonable position. There’s no rah-rah speech of “You must fight!” that convinces them to take up arms. The reluctant characters are given the space to come around on their own time and for their own reasons.</p><p>That may sound boring. After all, in an isekai-like narrative, the characters are usually forced to get on board quickly otherwise there wouldn’t be a plot. So seeing a game take its time with the reluctant characters, letting them work through their hangups in a natural and unforced way, was pleasing to my brain.</p><p>In the almost 50 days I’ve spent with <em>LDA</em>, I do have some working theories as to where the overall story will go. How it gets there, though, I have no clue, but I’m excited to see what twists the game will take along the way.</p><p><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em> is out now on Switch and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/673938/gabe-newell-valve-founder-brain-computer-interface-first-chip-starfish<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve co-founder and CEO Gabe Newell, the company behind <em>Half-Life</em> and <em>DOTA 2</em> and <em>Counter-Strike</em> and preeminent PC game distribution platform Steam, has long toyed with the idea that your brain should be more connected to your PC. It <a href="https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014734/Biofeedback-in-Gameplay-How-Valve">began over a decade ago</a> with in-house psychologists studying people’s biological responses to video games; <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/13/2947088/valve-reveals-secret-hardware-project-wearable-computing">Valve once considered earlobe monitors</a> for its first VR headset. The company publicly explored the idea of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhj3C1H5JWo">brain-computer interfaces for gaming</a> at GDC in 2019.</p><p>But Newell decided to spin off the idea. That same year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125379/is-gabe-newells-neuralink-competitor-coming-out-of-stealth">he quietly incorporated</a> a new brain-computer interface startup, Starfish Neuroscience — which has now revealed plans to produce its very first brain chip later this year.</p><p><a href="https://starfishneuroscience.com/blog/ultra-low-power-miniature-electrophysiological-electronics/?header-bg=card-bg0">Starfish’s first blog post</a>, spotted <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1925459695713525986">by Valve watcher Brad Lynch</a>, makes it clear we’re not talking about a complete implant yet. This bit is the custom “electrophysiology” chip designed to record brain activity (like how Neuralink can “read your mind” so patients can interact with computers) and stimulate the brain (for disease therapy), but Starfish isn’t claiming it’s already built the systems to power it or the bits to stick it into a person’s head.</p><p>“We anticipate our first chips arriving in late 2025 and <strong>we are interested in finding collaborators for whom such a chip would open new and exciting avenues</strong>,” writes Starfish neuroengineer Nate Cermak (bolding theirs), suggesting that Starfish might wind up partnering with other companies for wireless power or even the final brain implant.</p><p>But the goal, writes Starfish, is a smaller and less invasive implant than the competition, one that can “enable simultaneous access to multiple brain regions” instead of just one site, and one that doesn’t require a battery. Using just 1.1 milliwatts during “normal recording,” Starfish says it can work with wireless power transmission instead.</p><p>Here’s the chip’s current spec sheet:</p><div><ul><li><span>Low power: 1.1 mW total power consumption during normal recording </span></li><li><span>Physically small: 2 x 4mm (0.3mm pitch BGA) </span></li><li><span>Capable of both recording (spikes and LFP) &amp; stimulation (biphasic pulses) </span></li><li><span>32 electrode sites, 16 simultaneous recording channels at 18.75kHz </span></li><li><span>1 current source for stimulating on arbitrary pairs of electrodes </span></li><li><span>Onboard impedance monitoring and stim voltage transient measurement </span></li><li><span>Digital onboard data processing and spike detection allows the device to operate via low-bandwidth wireless interfaces. </span></li><li><span>Fabricated in TSMC 55nm process</span></li></ul></div><p>Neuralink’s N1, for comparison, has 1,024 electrodes across its 64 brain-implanted threads, <a href="http://whole ASIC consumes approximately 6 mW">a chip that consumed around 6 milliwatts as of 2019</a>, a battery that periodically needs wireless charging, and the full implant (again, not just the chip) is around 23mm wide and 8mm thick. The Elon Musk-led company has reportedly already implanted it in three humans; while some of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/9/24152758/neuralinks-first-implant-in-a-human-started-to-detach-from-the-patients-brain">threads did detach</a> from the first patient’s brain, he still has functionality and <a href="https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/full-q-and-a-neuralink-patient-noland">has been giving interviews</a>.</p><p>Starfish says it could be important to connect to multiple parts of the brain simultaneously, instead of just one region, to address issues like Parkinson’s disease. “there is increasing evidence that a number of neurological disorders involve circuit-level dysfunction, in which the interactions between brain regions may be misregulated,” Cermak writes.</p><p>In addition to multiple simultaneous brain implants, <a href="https://starfishneuroscience.com/research/">the company’s updated website says</a> it’s working on a “precision hyperthermia device” to destroy tumors with targeted heat, and a brain-reading, robotically guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) system for addressing neurological conditions like bipolar disorder and depression.</p><p>In case you’re wondering how any of this might make its way back to gaming, I’ll leave you with Valve’s talk from GDC 2019 about brain-computer interfaces.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
