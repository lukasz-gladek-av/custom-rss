But in Japan, Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/2025/250527.html">announced a new partnership</a> with Japanese third-party retail sites to combat fraudulent Switch 2 listings.</p><p>Mercari, Yahoo Auctions and Yahoo Flea Market, and Rakuten Rakuma are the participating websites that will, according to a machine translation of Nintendo’s announcement, “proactively remove listings” and establish “a collaborative system for sharing information.” Nintendo says only “fraudulent listings” that violated the sites’ terms of service agreement would be targeted for removal.</p><p>In <a href="https://support.yahoo-net.jp/PccAuctions/s/article/H000014527">a translated statement on Yahoo Japan’s website</a>, the retailer stated that there will be a probationary period for the Switch 2 starting June 5th in which Yahoo Japan will remove listings for the console or suspending the accounts selling them. According to Yahoo Japan, it will revise the probationary period as necessary.</p><p>Scalpers are the bane of any console launch. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/25/23137789/aio-buying-bots-ps5-xbox-series-x-console-shortage">Bots flood online buying queues</a> to snap up units before real humans can click “Add to Cart.” Bot users then take advantage of consumer FOMO by listing consoles for exorbitant prices. Meanwhile, other sellers use deception to trick people into buying what they think is a console but is actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ebay-issues-warning-to-scammers-selling-photos-of-ps5s">a picture of a box</a> or some other worthless item. (Anti-scalpers would later use <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nintendeal.com/post/3lnjzg2iswk2w">a version of this practice</a> for the Switch 2.)</p><p>Hopefully, Nintendo’s plan with third-party sites in Japan works well enough to expand it to other regions.</p><div><p>To cut down on scalpers during the Switch 2 preorder window, Nintendo sent out preorder invitations to users with over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641559/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gameplay-requirements">50 hours of gameplay and a Nintendo Switch Online subscription</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Starting May 28th and lasting till June 11th, Sony’s putting on its annual Days of Play summer event in which PS5s, PS5 accessories, and some of the console’s most popular games will go on sale. The sale is Sony’s first time discounting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">the PS5 Pro</a>, which launched last year. </p><p>You can check out the details of the sale on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/27/celebrate-days-of-play-2025-starting-on-may-28/?sf277411446=1">PlayStation’s website</a>, but here’s a short list of what you can get.</p><div><ul><li><span>In the United States and Canada, you can get a PlayStation 5 console plus Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Bundle (Digital and Standard) starting at $399.99 USD / $509.99 CAD, a savings of up to $119.99 USD / $159.99 CAD compared to buying each separately.</span></li><li><span>In select regions such as Europe and Asia, the PlayStation 5 console (Digital and Standard) will be on sale starting at €399.99 / £339.99 / ¥65,980.</span></li><li><span>$50 USD off PlayStation 5 Pro console </span></li></ul></div><div><p>Though traditionally timed to take advantage of all the announcements made during the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/603313/summer-game-fest-returns-on-june-6th">Summer Game Fest starting June 6th</a>, this year’s Days of Play sale has an interesting significance for Sony and the other console manufacturers, specifically Nintendo. Xbox has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659430/microsoft-xbox-console-controller-game-price-increases-worldwide">raised the prices on its console globally</a>. Meanwhile, Sony recently cited <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/13/ps5-price-to-rise-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/">high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates</a> as the reason for<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/647869/sony-ps5-price-rise-uk-europe-australia-new-zealand"> increasing the price of its consoles in Europe, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand</a>. In light of the Trump Administration’s chaotic tariff policy, that increase <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/666584/sony-earnings-tariffs-ps5-price-us-manufacturing">is expected to</a> (but has not yet) hit North America. The Play Days sale may be your last chance to get a PS5 in the US before those prices potentially go up.</p></div><p>Additionally, with single digit days left until the Switch 2 launches, the PS5’s $399.99 sale price, which includes one of the console’s most popular and most played games, is a cheaper and better deal than the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">$450 Nintendo wants from you for a Switch 2</a> (or the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer">$500 it wants for the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle</a>.) With the announcement of this sale event and with Summer Game Fest looming in the distance, we can probably expect Sony to announce a PlayStation State of Play event sometime soon.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
