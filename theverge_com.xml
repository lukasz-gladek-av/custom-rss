The second season of the hit Prime Video show will premiere in December, and the show has already been renewed for a third, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/fallout-renewed-season-3-release-date-season-2-1236394393/"><em>Variety</em> reports</a>.</p><p>The second season will “pick up in the aftermath of Season One’s epic finale and take audiences along for a journey through the wasteland of the Mojave to the post-apocalyptic city of New Vegas,” according to a description included in <em>Variety</em>. Production wrapped on the season <a href="https://x.com/falloutonprime/status/1920533288629792880">last week</a>.</p><p>There’s no word on when the third season might premiere. Hopefully the early renewal means we’ll see it sooner rather than later.</p><p>The first season was excellent, and as my colleague Ash Parrish wrote, it got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126474/fallout-review-amazon-prime-video">the postapocalyptic vibes exactly right</a>. Fingers crossed that the second season keeps up the quality of the first – I’ll be clearing some time during the holiday season to watch the new episodes.</p><p>The show has already gotten more than 100 million viewers worldwide, which makes the show rank “among Prime Video’s top three most-watched titles ever,” <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/fallout-season-2-season-3-prime-video">Amazon says</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
