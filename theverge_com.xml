            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I still wouldn’t buy an Xbox Ally, and I still don’t think the tweaked version of Windows that shipped with it is ready for primetime. The Xbox Full Screen Experience (FSE) needs work. But two months after I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/799698/xbox-ally-x-review-asus-microsoft-full-screen-experience">panned the cheaper $600 white Xbox Ally and wasn’t quite sold on the $1,000 black one</a>, one of my most-hated Windows issues is getting better.</p><p>I didn’t stop testing these handhelds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/799698/xbox-ally-x-review-asus-microsoft-full-screen-experience">after my October review</a>; I’ve been playing <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> and <em>Blue Prince</em> on them. I installed FSE on an MSI Claw 8 AI Plus, too. And after too many updates to count, I’m finally beginning to trust two of these handhelds to save my game (and battery life) when I put them to sleep. Even the third isn’t as bad as it was.</p><p>Sleep has been the biggest reason to buy a Steam Deck or a Nintendo Switch over a Windows handheld. For me, it’s the whole point of handheld gaming. If I can pause and resume at any time just by pressing the power button, I can tackle big games five, 10, 20 minutes at a time and actually finish them. It’s a whole different gaming lifestyle when you don’t have to save and quit every session, and when you can just press one button to do it.</p><p>Windows has been <em>terrible</em> at sleep for years, but in December, I haven’t lost my game once with the pricier black Xbox Ally X when trusting it to sleep. I recently left a game open for almost exactly nine full days, and the game was right where I left off when I came back. Battery drain while sleeping seems reasonable, too: I’m only losing 4 to 8 percent of its battery from one day to the next. (I lost 40 percent of the battery during that nine-day span.)</p><p>There are other bugs: Sometimes I don’t have control right away after resuming from sleep; sometimes the Xbox and Asus buttons stop working for a bit when Windows decides to automatically update things in the background. And, after that nine-day stretch, Windows spontaneously decided I had to authenticate and reset my PIN before it’d let me log in.</p><p>Also, the SSD in my colleague Tom Warren’s Xbox Ally X died, so there’s that, but sleep worked reliably for him before then. Assuming the SSD is the drive maker’s fault, the Xbox Ally X is feeling like a product I can live with. (We’ve asked Asus about the SSD.)</p><p>The white vanilla Xbox Ally, with AMD’s Z2 A chip, is a different story. I’ve been testing <em>two</em> of them for months, and even after installing every Windows, Asus, Game Bar, and Xbox App update, including several that claimed to address sleep, I’ve watched both units repeatedly wake up without ever being touched. I’d leave them on my desk all day while I worked and watch them light up all by themselves, draining their batteries in the process.</p><p>On November 19th, I put a black Xbox Ally X and a white Xbox Ally to sleep, side by side, with 96 percent and 93 percent battery, respectively. Thirteen hours later, the white unit was completely dead, while the black unit was still at 91 percent.</p><p>On November 20th, I tried again at 88 percent and 82 percent battery, respectively. Nearly four days later, the white one was dead; the black one had 61 percent left.</p><p>I tried factory resetting one of the white units, and I think something has improved since then. I’ve had many days where my game’s waiting for me when I wake it from sleep. But on December 6th, I found it roasting itself inside my shoulder bag at 10:55AM. Logs showed me it woke itself up around midnight the previous evening and turned off its own screen at around 1AM, but never went back to sleep. Because its screen was off and its fan near silent, I didn’t notice it was still on when I put it in the bag.</p><p>And on December 7th, that same factory-reset, fully updated Xbox Ally mysteriously stopped charging overnight at 54 percent.</p><p>Asus claimed it wasn’t yet able to reproduce my issues. But I’m seeing these problems across two different units, I’ve seen scattered reports elsewhere on the web, and we know that the Xbox Ally’s AMD Z2 A processor fundamentally supports fewer sleep modes than the Xbox Ally X. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/807711/xbox-ally-sleep-fail-bazzite-fix-performance#:~:text=Two%20days%20after%20programmer%20Antheas%20Kapenekakis%20obtained%20the%20hardware%20and%20consulted%20with%20two%20contacts%20at%20AMD%2C%20the%20three%20fixed%20it">Bazzite had to consult with AMD</a> to get sleep working in Linux on the Z2 A chip.</p><p>I’m not sure why Microsoft is taking so long to fix it in Windows, or how complicated the issue might be there. Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, and hasn’t offered me a substantive comment in the past. But I wonder if it might be unique to that Z2 A chip, because I’m not having much trouble with the Intel Lunar Lake inside the MSI Claw 8 AI Plus, either, now that I’ve manually <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/812970/xbox-full-screen-experience-is-worse-on-my-msi-claw-than-it-is-on-the-xbox-ally">updated to a later BIOS that wasn’t showing up</a> when I first tested the Xbox experience there.</p><p>With the Intel Claw 8, a handheld <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/769609/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-intel-review">I originally couldn’t trust to sleep</a>, I now can — and I’ve seen battery drain as little as 2 percent per day while it’s snoozing. I ran into bugs in the Insider Preview, including one black screen and a persistent issue that capped my frame rate at 30fps until I changed power modes, but bugs are to be expected there.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22960536/steam-deck-faq-valve-one-month-later">It took time for the Steam Deck</a> to be fully baked, and perhaps Microsoft needs some time too. If it’s finally figured out how to put a PC to sleep, and the vanilla Xbox Ally is just one exception, that’ll change the whole conversation around Windows handhelds.</p><p>Even today, the vanilla Xbox Ally may no longer be a bad deal. You can currently find it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0FM6C3ZMN?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">for $489 at Amazon</a>, or <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.asus.com%2Fus%2Frog-xbox-ally.html" rel="sponsored">$499 at Asus</a>, and just <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.asus.com%2Fus%2Frog-xbox-ally.html" rel="sponsored">install Bazzite instead</a>. Bazzite is more reliable than Windows, has higher performance, and is just all around better in my tests, unless you play games that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284644/apex-legends-loses-linux-steam-deck-support-anti-cheat">use incompatible anti-cheat software</a> or you’re tightly tied to a library of “Xbox” PC games.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/843010/xbox-ally-x-sleep-battery-drain-two-months-later]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Nex Playground is apparently <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m7du6uaaec2p">one of the hottest</a> consoles this holiday season thanks to its kid-friendly games and fun, motion-controlled gameplay. And now through December 14th, the cube-shaped console is on sale for its Black Friday low of around $199 ($50 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Playground-AI-Powered-Transforms-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0D2JGYX3F?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. There are some other great deals still available you might have missed this week, too, including a sizable discount on the new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Buds-Cancellation-Transparency/dp/B0FGKTDTRB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Google Pixel Buds 2A</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GENKI-Moonbase-Desktop-Charger-Moonlight/dp/B0FL1RBYJR/ref=sr_1_2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Genki’s Moonbase Charging Station</a>, which looks straight out of <em>Star Wars</em>.</p><div><div><h2>Featured Products</h2></div><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div><p>The <strong>Nex Playground</strong> easily connects to your TV and provides a clever interactive solution that encourages you and your family to move around. A built-in camera and AI software track your movements with precision, so <em>you</em> are the controller. The cube-shaped console comes with five games (<em>Fruit Ninja</em>, <em>Starri</em>, <em>Party Fowl</em>, <em>Go Keeper</em>, and <em>Whack-a-Mole Deluxe</em>), but there are a ton of others you can download; however, a three-month subscription ($49) or an annual Play Pass ($89) is required to enjoy the full catalog and seasonal drops.</p><p><strong>Genki’s Moonbase</strong> features a sleek retro-futuristic design, and it’s currently down to an all-time low of $89.99 ($50 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GENKI-Moonbase-Desktop-Charger-Moonlight/dp/B0FL1RBYJR/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. The power strip features three AC plugs (1,250W max power) and four USB-C ports that can deliver up to 240W of total power; a single USB-C port, meanwhile, can go up to 140W with the right cable, though one isn’t included with your purchase. The strip also features a non-removable, 1.5-meter braided cable, making it easy to reach the nearest outlet.</p><p>Each AC plug is spaced far enough apart to accommodate larger power adapters, but the main selling point here is a touch-sensitive button that lets you cycle through colors and toggle the charging station’s lights on and off. All in all, the Moonbase is a powerful power strip that looks cool and lets you charge up to seven devices simultaneously.</p><p>Google recently <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://store.google.com/us/collection/offers?" rel="sponsored">launched a holiday sale</a> that runs through December 24th, with many items matching the pricing we saw during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. One of the standout deals is the <strong>Pixel Buds 2A</strong>, which have returned to their all-time low of $99 ($30 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Buds-Cancellation-Transparency/dp/B0FGKTDTRB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fgoogle-pixel-buds-2a-wireless-earbuds-with-active-noise-cancellation-bluetooth-headphones-hazel%2FJ39TC8J6Z8%2Fsku%2F6642707" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, and the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://store.google.com/product/pixel_buds_2a" rel="sponsored">Google Store</a>.</p><p>The Pixel Buds 2A are Google’s latest, most affordable pair of wireless earbuds, but they don’t skimp on features. They offer active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode, along with excellent sound for the price. They also provide hands-free Gemini support, allowing you to quickly get directions, brainstorm ideas, and summarize messages. The earbuds offer up to 10 hours of listening time with ANC disabled and carry an IP54 rating, too, which isn’t great but should provide at least some protection against rain and sweat.</p><div><p id="a-few-more-deals-to-check-out"><h2>A few more deals to check out</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Apple’s <strong>M4-powered MacBook Air 13</strong> is on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2025-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop/dp/B0DZDC3WW5/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fapple-macbook-air-13-inch-laptop-apple-m4-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-16gb-memory-256gb-ssd-midnight%2FJJGCQ8RH7G" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> starting at $749 ($250 off), which is just a few dollars shy of its Black Friday low. However, if you purchase it at Best Buy, you’ll also get a free $25 gift card. The slim laptop offers an impressive combination of performance and battery life, with double the base RAM of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24114684/apple-macbook-air-m3-13-15-inch-2024-review">predecessor</a> (16GB versus 8GB) and two Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C ports. It’s still relatively limited with 256GB of base storage, but it remains one of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops">best laptops available</a>, especially with the current discount. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/627186/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-15-inch-2025-laptop-review">Read our review</a>.</span></li><li><span>Hoto’s new <strong>PixelDrive electric screwdriver</strong> is on sale for the first time at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FKBJL68H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, where you can snag it for $59.99 ($20 off). The cordless PixelDrive is great for small- to medium-sized projects, whether you’re assembling electronics or putting together furniture. It features up to 6Nm of torque, along with a single multi-function button that allows you to change the screwdriver’s direction, switch to an 80RPM precision mode for delicate tasks, or boost up to 200RPM with one finger. It also has a built-in pixelated display, so you can quickly check the battery life and see which of the six torque levels you’re using.</span></li><li><span>The <strong>Lego Super Mario Goombas’ Playground</strong> set is as adorable as it sounds, and it’s currently down to $8.99 ($6 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CV25P9MF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Flego-super-mario-goombas-playground-super-mario-toys-and-playset-71433%2FJXPLL2HJ4Z%2Fsku%2F6582434" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>. The set comes in at a relatively light 171 pieces, which you can use to build three Goomba figurines, a tree trunk, and a seesaw. Each Goomba has its own evil (but cute) expression, and they can stack on top of each other to make a small Goomba tower. There’s even a lever on the back of the tree trunk that can make a Goomba pop out, so you can play a round of peekaboo before placing the set on a desk or bookshelf.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzE5"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandon Russell</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/844093/nex-playground-google-pixel-buds-2a-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
