It was already down to six <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23953640/sony-pushes-back-its-live-service-game-ambitions">by the end of 2023</a>, before the well-received launch of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337875/sony-playstation-horizon-zero-dawn-helldivers-2-ghosts-of-tsushima-movie-tv-show"><em>Helldivers II</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234909/sony-concord-ps5-shutdown-poor-sales-launch-pc">the disaster that was <em>Concord </em></a>in 2024. Now, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects"><em>Bloomberg’s</em> Jason Schreier has confirmed</a> with Sony that two unannounced live service projects have been canceled.</p></div><p>One was from <em>Syphon Filter</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18514683/days-gone-review-ps4-open-world-zombie-game"><em>Days Gone</em></a> developer Bend Games, while Schreier <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lfvfm2febc2e">reports</a> the other shuttered title was a live-service <em>God of War </em>game that Bluepoint Games “has been working on for the last couple of years.”</p><p>Bluepoint Games is one of several developers Sony <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22665426/sony-buys-bluepoint-games-remake-remaster-demons-souls-shadow-ico-uncharted">acquired in recent years</a> as it was building up a queue of live service projects, with many ports and remasters under its belt, including <em>Demon’s Souls</em>, the first three <em>Uncharted </em>games, <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>, and others. Now, Schreier says the studios won’t close, but there’s no word yet on what their next projects will be. </p><p>The live service approach to gaming once seemed wide open following the success of <em>Fortnite </em>and other titles, but games like <em>Concord</em>, <em>Anthem</em>, and <em>Redfall </em>have shown how difficult it can be. At Sony alone, the list of canceled service titles <em>Bloomberg </em>has already reported on included the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-22/playstation-employees-at-insomniac-studio-fear-identity-theft-after-massive-hack">Spider-Man game</a> revealed by the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/19/24007570/insomniac-games-hack-wolverine-x-men-ryhsida">Insomniac ransomware breach</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-27/sony-cuts-900-jobs-in-gaming-shuts-down-london-division"><em>Twisted Metal</em></a>, and a Destiny-linked game <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-02/sony-s-bungie-maker-of-halo-and-destiny-faces-reckoning-after-mass-layoff">from Bungie</a> called <em>Payback. </em></p><p>However, we’re still expecting to hear more about Bungie’s revived <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23735830/bungie-marathon-sci-fi-pvp-extraction-shooter"><em>Marathon</em></a><em> </em>extraction shooter and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23732791/fairgames-playstation-showcase-ps5-sony-haven-studios"><em>Fairgames</em></a>, a PvP heist title from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/21/22989187/sony-playstation-haven-studios-acquisition-jade-raymond-new-multiplayer-game">Haven Studios</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345484/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-january-launch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s coming a little later than we initially thought, but The Pokémon Company (TCPi) has finally announced when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248306/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hands-on"><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em></a>’s long-awaited <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296690/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trade-cards">trading functionality</a> is rolling out.</p><p>Today, TCPi revealed that, along with <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s next set of cards, the game’s trading feature is set to launch later this month. TCPi didn’t specify an exact date in its statement about the update, but it did explain that trading will involve some restrictions and costs.</p><p>In order to swap cards, people will first have to be friends with one another in the game. Trades can only occur if players are offering up cards with the same rarity, meaning that you won’t be able to trade powerful EX cards for more common ones that are easier to pull. Additionally, TCPi trading is limited to cards that have rarities of 1-4 diamonds or a single star full-art cards, and TCPi noted that “items must be consumed in order to trade.”</p><p>It’s not clear which particular items players will need for trades, but it feels likely that the process will involve spending Poké gold, one of <em>Pocket</em>’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684">multiple in-game currencies</a> that can be purchased in exchange for real money. The item requirement sounds like logical (but not exactly welcome) way for <em>Pocket</em> to generate even more revenue given how easy it is to accumulate certain duplicates from every set. </p><p>In a follow-up <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1880027099836411924">post to X</a>, <em>Pocket</em>’s official account stated that it was hearing people’s immediate concerns about how this is all going to work in practice, and encouraged everyone to provide more feedback once the feature is out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
