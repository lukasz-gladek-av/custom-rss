The 8BitDo Ultimate 3E Controller for Xbox follows last August’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717994/8bitdo-wireless-xbox-controller-rare-40th-anniversary-edition">Ultimate 3-mode Controller for Xbox — Rare 40th Anniversary Edition</a> with some excellent upgrades, less branding, and a big price hike. It’s got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks</a>, Hall effect triggers with adjustable stops for improved reaction times, and swappable ABXY buttons. It was announced at CES 2026 but isn’t expected to launch until sometime in Q2 of 2026 for $149.99, putting it in competition with more premium console controllers like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ROG-II-Wireless-Controller/dp/B0G36827DR/ref=sr_1_3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">recently announced ASUS ROG Raikiri II</a>.</p><p>The Ultimate 3E Controller is also one of 8BitDo’s most customizable controllers. It comes preinstalled with two standard joysticks that can be replaced with two tall joysticks, a “thick-neck” joystick, or a dome-capped stick. The standard metal D-pad can be swapped out to one with a circular design, but it’s the controller’s ABXY buttons that stand out. Unlike the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/706967/8bitdo-pro-3-wireless-bluetooth-controller-tmr-swappable-buttons">8BitDo Pro 3, which only lets you swap out the button caps</a>, the Ultimate 3E includes two interchangeable button modules: one with squishy silicone membrane buttons, and one with clicky micro switches that are accessible by removing the controller’s faceplate.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>The controller’s ABXY buttons are part of a module that can be swapped out to provide a different feel when pressed.</em></figcaption> <cite>Image: 8BitDo</cite></span></p></section><p>In addition to the Hall effect triggers, the Ultimate 3E has two pairs of shoulder buttons, a pair of remappable bumpers on the back, and six-axis motion controls that are limited to PC gaming. The bases of both joysticks are surrounded with RGB rings that light up and react to movements, but battery life is still rated at a decent 18 hours of playtime between charges on an included dock.</p><p>The Ultimate 3E doesn’t connect to the Xbox using Microsoft’s native wireless protocol and instead relies on a bundled 2.4GHz USB dongle. But Bluetooth is included for connecting to Apple and Android devices, or you can tether to consoles and PCs using a USB cable to minimize lag. The controller is also compatible with 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software X (a variant of its Ultimate Software V2 for its Xbox controllers) so you can customize its performance and remap controls to make custom profiles that are swappable using a button on the Ultimate 3E.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/848331/8bitdo-ultimate-3e-controller-xbox-wireless-tmr-swappable-joysticks]]></content:encoded>
