Based on an interview with Larian CEO Swen Vincke, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTg5MzY2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NDk4NDY1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0Q4ODFLSVAzSTkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.D26Cs7X_5kH5HuJT2frcX_AMIXyuXWefzz5NK2VlXEI">reported that</a> the studio uses AI tools for things like developing concept art and writing placeholder text. But following some initial backlash, Vincke later clarified <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai">to IGN</a> that the studio is “neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI” and published his own statement on X.</p><p>Larian announced <em>Divinity</em> last week at The Game Awards with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxzyVeAG00w">“cinematic” teaser trailer</a> that didn’t reveal much about the game itself. Here’s what <em>Bloomberg</em> reported about Larian’s use of AI in <em>Divinity</em>:</p><div><blockquote><p>Under Vincke, Larian has been pushing hard on generative AI, although the CEO says the technology hasn’t led to big gains in efficiency. He says there won’t be any AI-generated content in <em>Divinity</em> — “everything is human actors; we’re writing everything ourselves” — but the creators often use AI tools to explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text.</p><p>The use of generative AI has led to some pushback at Larian, “but I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it,” Vincke said.</p></blockquote></div><p>Vincke’s AI comments have received <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/1po5xa7/comment/nucssg1/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=comment_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Flarian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai">some pushback</a>, including former Larian employee Selena Tobin <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/anoxicart.bsky.social/post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g">saying on Bluesky</a> “consider my feedback: i loved working at @larianstudios.com until AI.” A few hours after <em>Bloomberg’s</em> report, IGN published the following statement from Vincke, which Larian has also shared with <em>The Verge</em>:</p><div><blockquote><p>We’ve been continuously increasing our pool of concept artists , writers and story-tellers, are actively putting together writer rooms, casting and recording performances from actors and hiring translators.</p><p>Since concept art is being called out explicitly - we have 23 concept artists and have job openings for more. These artists are creating concept art day in day out for ideation and production use.</p><p>Everything we do is incremental and aimed at having people spend more time creating.</p><p>Any ML tool used well is additive to a creative team or individual’s workflow, not a replacement for their skill or craft.</p><p>We are researching and understanding the cutting edge of ML as a toolset for creatives to use and see how it can make their day-to-day lives easier, which will let us make better games.</p><p>We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI.</p><p>While I understand it’s a subject that invokes a lot of emotion, it’s something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone’s working day better, not worse.</p></blockquote></div><div><p>Vincke also posted <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001011042642505833">a statement on X</a>:</p></div><div><blockquote><p>Holy fuck guys we’re not “pushing hard” for or replacing concept artists with AI.</p><p>We have a team of 72 artists of which 23 are concept artists and we are hiring more. The art they create is original and I’m very proud of what they do.</p><p>I was asked explicitly about concept art and our use of Gen AI. I answered that we use it to explore things. I didn’t say we use it to develop concept art. The artists do that. And they are indeed world class artists.</p><p>We use AI tools to explore references, just like we use google and art books. At the very early ideation stages we use it as a rough outline for composition which we replace with original concept art. There is no comparison.</p><p>I talked about how we use ML here if you would like to know more: <a href="https://t.co/41KPNjaqI7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/</a></p><p>We’ve hired creatives for their talent, not for their ability to do what a machine suggests, but they can experiment with these tools to make their lives easier.</p></blockquote></div><p>Vincke’s stance seems less supportive of AI than positions taken by other big gaming companies, including Krafton’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805509/krafton-pubg-ai-first-developer-agentic-gpu-cluster">move to becoming “AI First”</a> and Nexon’s CEO <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/">saying that</a> “it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI.” Some indie developers, on the other hand, are promoting the fact <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/827650/indie-developers-gen-ai-nexon-arc-raiders">that they’re “AI free.”</a></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/845713/larian-ceo-divinity-ai-swen-vincke]]></content:encoded>
