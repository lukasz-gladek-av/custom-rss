That trend continues in <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>with a new Rotom Phone that feels like it was designed for urban exploration.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/801113/pokemon-legends-za-rotom-phone-pokedex-review">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MzA4ODY=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126232/fallout-pip-boy-review">Fallout Pip-Boy review: a wearable fit for the wasteland</a></h2><div><p>It’s hard to say what, precisely, makes a design timeless. Some classic gadgets are simply beautiful, while others remain functional years after they come out. The list of truly timeless products in tech is small, but there’s one name that looms large: RobCo Industries’ Pip-Boy. Sure, it’s relatively simple, and some of its features only work if you’re stuck underground. But when a design hasn’t changed for 200 years, you know it’s doing something right.</p><p>For those who have been living under an irradiated rock, a Pip-Boy is a wrist-worn computer that — despite originally being meant for the pre-war world and, later, life inside of a Vault-Tec vault — has become an indispensable tool for survival out in the wasteland. It’s large and rugged, though not particularly heavy or uncomfortable, and is outfitted with plenty of satisfyingly chunky dials and buttons. From an aesthetic perspective, it’s surprisingly versatile, pairing with everything from a Vault-Tec jumpsuit to raider armor. You never really have to worry about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/27/24113500/wearables-smartwatches-smart-glasses-smart-rings-etiquette">when and where it’s okay to wear one</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126232/fallout-pip-boy-review">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MzQ0MjA=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24108802/3-body-problem-vr-headset-review">3 Body Problem VR headset review: magical tech in need of more apps</a></h2><div><p>Arthur C. Clarke famously said that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,” and that’s never been more true than with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24102256/netflix-3-body-problem-review"><em>3 Body Problem</em></a> VR headset. It’s so far ahead of everything else on the market that it doesn’t seem possible. There’s really no doubt: this is the best way to experience virtual reality. Sadly, there’s far too little software to take advantage of all of that advanced tech; at launch, there’s only a single app available. And even though that one app is a game that could alter the fate of mankind forever, that doesn’t quite nudge the headset into “must buy” territory.</p><p>But let’s start with that hardware because it is indeed incredible. It’s a sleek metallic headset that’s so light you can barely feel it at all. It’s completely wireless, and unlike, say, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price">Apple Vision Pro</a>, it seems to work for just about everyone right out of the box. No fussing around with visual settings or specially-fitted seals. Just put it on and go. There are also no loading times, and the battery life appears to be infinite. How they managed to squeeze all of that inside such a tiny device is baffling. I’m eagerly awaiting the moment iFixit gets their hands on it.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24108802/3-body-problem-vr-headset-review">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjU1ODI=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719653/purah-pad-review-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">Purah Pad review: a rugged tablet designed for the dangers of Hyrule</a></h2><div><p>It’s never easy to follow up a beloved device, especially when it’s one that managed to fuse ancient technology with a modern-day phablet. But the Purah Pad — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/3/7/14809872/sheikah-slate-review-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">a spiritual successor to the Sheikah Slate</a> — manages to add more utility to a device that already let you control physics. It still doesn’t have much in the way of entertainment options, but its new design and feature set are ideal for those traveling around Hyrule, particularly if you also have a wearable that gives you power over space and time.</p><p>In terms of hardware, the Purah Pad has a slightly more streamlined setup than its predecessor, with a seven-inch display flanked by physical buttons and other controls on the sides and a USB Type-C port at the bottom. It has a rather ornate design that fits right in among any other ancient tech you might have but also results in a gigantic bezel that can obscure the edges of the display. It’s form over function. I should also note that somehow, once again, this device has infinite battery life.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719653/purah-pad-review-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODE2NTA=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2022/11/18/23461245/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-rotom-phone-review-pokedex">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet Rotom Phone review: it’s a literal lifesaver</a></h2><div><p>As the <em>Pokémon</em> world <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23415407/pokemon-scarlet-violet-hands-on-preview-nintendo-switch">becomes a bigger, richer place</a> filled with an ever-growing number of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/6/23443302/we-finally-have-a-name-for-the-coin-pokemon">new monsters</a>, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21134790/pokemon-home-pokedex-transporter-move-3ds-games-switch-android-ios">pokédexes</a> trainers receive at the beginning of their journeys have similarly evolved with the release of each new <em>Pokémon </em>game. At first, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23462858/pokemon-violet-scarlet-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Pokémon Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>’s</a> new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2022/8/3/23291273/pokemon-scarlet-violet-rotom-phone-second-camera">Rotom Phone</a> might not look like a major step up from the first-gen model introduced in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962722/pokemon-sword-shield-review-nintendo-switch-launch-date"><em>Pokémon Sword </em>and <em>Shield</em></a> or seem at all novel compared to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em></a>’ deific <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Arc_Phone">Arc Phone</a>. But <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23415407/pokemon-scarlet-violet-hands-on-preview-nintendo-switch">the Paldea region</a>’s most popular smartphone features a number of useful updates to classic apps, UI changes, and new lifesaving safety features that make using it feel like a completely new experience.</p><p>Though pokédexes have a long history of taking design cues from Nintendo’s handheld consoles, <em>Pokémon Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>mark the return of Generation VIII’s Rotom Phone — an otherwise ordinary smartphone that becomes supercharged <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-sword-shield-guide/2019/12/3/20992445/how-to-get-rotom-forms-catalog-heat-wash-fan-frost-mow">after being possessed by a Rotom</a>. While the jump from Generation VII’s Rotom Dex to the original Rotom Phone saw the device go through a drastic redesign to improve pocketability, the Generation IX Rotom Phone is more of an incremental hardware update meant to make the phone more useful for adventuring. Aside from a new second camera module and a thin built-in ring light around back, <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>’s Paldean Rotom Phone looks more or less exactly like last generation’s model and comes in a familiar fiery red-orange but can also be customized with a variety of cases.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2022/11/18/23461245/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-rotom-phone-review-pokedex">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTI0Nzk0" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22576224/tva-tempad-review-loki-season-1-review-marvel-timedoor">TVA TemPad review: who needs TikTok when you can control time and space?</a></h2></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MjY5MjI1" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/3/7/14809872/sheikah-slate-review-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Zelda Sheikah Slate review: Link’s new phablet has magic, but no Netflix</a></h2><div><p>The Sheikah Slate is not your run-of-the-mill gadget. Bestowed upon hero of light Link in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, the Slate is severely limited in its feature set and unable to do basic modern-day tasks, like browsing Netflix or accessing a global communications network linked together by satellites. It does, however, pack some pretty unique specs and comes capable of performing feats of alien magic.</p><p>The Slate’s screen appears to fall right in the middle of phablet territory, not quite a 7-inch tablet and too bulky to compete with the standard iPhone. The display seems powered by some mystical liquid-crystal technology developed likely by the Zoras, a race of ancient humanoid amphibians. Its Hylian-01 chip also looks like the world’s first mobile quantum processor, or else how could it achieve its near-unlimited processing power, or conduct instantaneous matter transfer over long distances?</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/3/7/14809872/sheikah-slate-review-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li></ul></section></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/801966/fictional-gadget-reviews]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Though the <em>Pokémon </em>games’ Rotom Phones haven’t really changed all that much design-wise over the past few years, each generation has introduced new functionalities that made upgrading a no-brainer. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962722/pokemon-sword-shield-review-nintendo-switch-launch-date"><em>Sword </em>/ <em>Shield</em>’s</a> Rotom Phone — the very first one — came with a bare-bones camera that made it easy to snap wide-angle (screen)shots out in the Galar region’s Wild Area. The second-generation Rotom Phone’s camera in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2022/11/18/23461245/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-rotom-phone-review-pokedex"><em>Scarlet </em>/ <em>Violet</em></a> was a significant improvement, but the device’s real standout feature was its ability to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2022/11/18/23461245/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-rotom-phone-review-pokedex">keep you from plummeting to your death</a> if you fell from a great height.</p><p>While neither of the early Rotom Phones were as visually interesting as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em></a>’ Arc Phone, they both spoke to how the <em>Pokémon </em>universe’s consumer tech has become increasingly streamlined and robust. That trend continues in <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>with a new Rotom Phone that feels like it was designed for urban exploration.</p><p>Like its predecessors, the third-gen Rotom Phone’s conservative design is a reminder of how <em>Pokémon</em>’s gadgets have lost some of their personality in the time since Pokédexes went from being physical objects to downloadable applications. But what the new phone lacks in aesthetic flair, it makes up for with improved hardware and a couple of fresh tricks — including one that makes leaping across rooftops a snap — that make it a must-have for anyone <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637256/pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-day-night-cycle">visiting present-day Lumiose City</a>.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODAxNzU4"><p><span>$<!-- -->0</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Hands-free usability is more robust</li><li>More functional camera array with zoom</li><li>Roto-Glide is a game-changer</li><li>Excellent call quality and battery life</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Physical design is getting a little long in the tooth</li><li>No accessories</li><li>Might not work outside of the Kalos region</li><li>No snazzy Pokédex art</li><li>Still can’t send your helper Rotom into battle</li></ul></div></div></div><p>As nice as it was to see <em>Scarlet </em>/<em> Violet</em>’s Rotom Phone come with a second lens, one of the most frustrating things about the device was that there was no way to zoom in on things from a distance while you were wandering around Paldea. That second lens seemed like it didn’t really <em>do </em>anything. You had to get physically close to wild pokémon and <em>then </em>open up the camera app in order to take eye-catching photos of them, which made it very easy to wind up getting attacked. That would have been a nonstarter in <em>Z-A</em>’s Lumiose, where unpartnered monsters will go out of their way to fight humans without hesitation.</p><p>But in addition to adding a handy new zoom feature by way of a third (very functional) lens, the new Rotom Phone’s back-facing camera array can also be used while you are moving — something that opens up a new world of possibilities for trainers who fancy themselves shutterbugs. It’s easy to post up in Lumiose’s Wild Zones, hide in the tall grass, and snap photos of wild pokémon without them being aware of your presence. And being able to move while you’re using the back cameras also makes it relatively simple to get the hell out of dodge in instances when something does catch sight of you and decides to launch an attack. (You do still have to remain still while you’re using the new Rotom Phone’s improved front-facing camera, though.)</p><p>While the new Rotom Phone’s front-facing camera can be used for video calls, when you try to take a selfie, the electric / ghost pokémon living within the device will automatically activate the back-facing cameras and turn the handheld around. Previously you had to hold the second-generation phone in your hand or with a selfie stick in order to capture pics of yourself with your favorite partner pokémon. But the new phone’s resident Rotom can be directed to move the device around while taking pictures from various angles and distances, which gives you the ability to strike a pose hands-free.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->5</strong><span><figcaption>A pride of sleeping Pyroar.</figcaption> <cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></span></p></section><p>This is especially useful if you’ve downloaded the app to participate in Lumiose’s Z-A Royale and want to update your profile picture to something emotive. One major drawback, though, is that the new possessed phone requires you to stay still while you’re directing it to take pictures of you. Using the phone’s limited selection of built-in music, you can coax your pokémon to sleep or get it worked up before you snap a candid or dramatic photo. None of the third-gen Rotom Phone’s built-in filters are all that great, but it’s easy enough to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/676287/nintendo-switch-2-mobile-app-screenshots-backup-upload">transfer them to another device</a> if you want to do some artistic post-processing of your own.</p><p>Along with the Z-A Royale hub, an updated, Lumiose-specific Pokédex is the new Rotom Phone’s most useful application. It does all the basic ’dex stuff like track how many pokémon you’ve seen and caught, where specific species live within the city, and how they move. It also features a separate listing of pokémon with Mega Evolved forms, but what’s great about this version of the Pokédex is that it gives every pokémon that you can catch its own unique entry, which was not the case on the last Rotom Phone for some reason.</p><p>Unfortunately, the new Pokédex does not display the same kind of fancy artwork for monsters that <em>Scarlet </em>/<em> Violet</em>’s did. But the new interface is cleaner, more intuitive to use, and does away with the last generation’s excess skeuomorphism. The default map application also provides you with helpful information about which pokémon appear in Lumiose’s Wild Zones, where Z-A Royale battle zones pop up, and details about locations like shopping centers and Pokémon Centers.</p><p>By far, the new Roto-Glide functionality is what sets this generation of Rotom Phone apart from others. The last phone featured a safe-landing mode that activated whenever it detected that you had suddenly fallen a considerable distance. Roto-Glide builds on that idea by giving you a brief boost up when you jump from a ledge, which enables you to do a kind of bounce through the air. It’s ideal for leaping across rooftops or completing some of Lumiose’s many scaffolding obstacle courses.</p><p>Like the Arc Phone and both of the other Rotom Phones, the new model has fantastic battery life and call reception — at least within Lumiose City. I haven’t been able to test the phone out beyond the city’s limits, and it’s not clear whether this model would work outside of the Kalos region. I also wasn’t able to figure out how to activate the phone’s wide-screen tablet mode, but other people seem to enjoy it. The thing runs like a dream, though.</p><p>My biggest issue with the third-gen Rotom Phone is that it does not seem as if there are all that many (if any) cool accessories to help you make it feel more personal. The device appears to come in a variety of colors, like red, blue, yellow, white, and a stony gray. But it would have been great to see this model get some of the nifty phone cases that can be purchased across Paldea.</p><p>Roto-Glide aside, the new Rotom Phone is a somewhat incremental upgrade if you’re coming from the last generation, but you will need one if you really want to get the most out of your time in Lumiose City. The beefed-up camera alone makes this a much more useful tool to have as you embark on your next <em>Pokémon </em>journey, and if there are some stylish accessories <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pokemon/777169/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-nmega-raichu">in the pipeline</a>, the device will be damn near perfect.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTE="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Charles Pulliam-Moore</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/801113/pokemon-legends-za-rotom-phone-pokedex-review]]></content:encoded>
