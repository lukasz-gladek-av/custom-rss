The logical answer is “I will play <em>Mario Kart World</em>,” and I respect those of you who feel that way. I, too, will be playing some <em>World</em>, in part because it’s one of the few game series that my wife and I enjoy playing together (and I need to justify this purchase somehow). But, it won’t be the first thing I’m doing.</p><p>I won’t be licking any cartridges either — I already know they’re going to taste bad — or huffing Switch 2 exhaust fumes. Actually, I’m sad to say that the very first thing I’ll be doing with my unit is plugging it in to charge and walking away for a while to pick my kid up from gym class. However, when I return I’ll be tearing through the setup screens, and… seeing how <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/9/23592822/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-best-way-classic">Metroid Prime Remastered</a></em> looks.</p><p>Don’t dash my dreams of the Switch 2’s graphics upscaling giving all of my Switch favorites a glow-up. I <em>know </em>that’s probably not how this is going to work, having seen how Sony’s PSSR tech can’t “automagically” make PS4 games run better in a much more powerful console, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">PS5 Pro</a>. Let me live in that fleeting moment before hope inevitably turns to melancholy, after which I’ll wait for Nintendo to (hopefully) trickle out updates on a game-by-game basis.</p><p>Anyway… what will you be doing first with your Switch 2? Let’s hear it. Looking for easter eggs in the box design? Flipping your unit for profit? (Hopefully not!) Turning on any of the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Faccessibility%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOop3p1KE4RjZvacOojRB6uVg1ewVJeP3zik95DkM7vrvNCEs-76N" rel="sponsored">Switch 2’s interesting accessibility features</a>?

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>No Man’s Sky</em> is about to take flight on yet another new platform: developer Hello Games announced today that the sci-fi exploration game will be getting a free update that will enhance it for the Nintendo Switch 2, which launches on June 5th.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/23/23179322/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-release-date">The game came to the original Switch in 2022</a>, and Hello Games says getting it crammed onto Nintendo’s previous console was “a bit of a technical miracle,” while calling the Switch 2 version “a huge leap forward.” On the Switch 2, the game will improve both the amount and quality of stuff on screen at any given moment. “We’re rendering significantly more than before, at a higher resolution <em>and </em>improved framerate,“ the developer says.</p><p>It will also feature full multiplayer support, which was missing from the first Switch version of the game. Additionally, the Switch 2 version of <em>No Man’s Sky</em> will include features like touchscreen support, gyro controls, and cross-save.</p><p>The new platform is part of a larger update that spans all versions of the game. Called Beacon, it introduces something of a settlement management element to the game. Here’s how Hello Games explains it:</p><div><blockquote><p>Beacon completely overhauls settlements, bringing towns and their management to No Man’s Sky. There are huge new robotic settlements to discover, with impossibly new sci-fi buildings. Players can become town mayor and take ownership of multiple settlements. You can construct buildings and upgrade each one, with new building types like jukebox bars where you can choose the music, merchants where you can build custom starships or even ponds you can chill and fish at.</p><p>Each inhabitant can be conversed with, with their own abilities and attributes to manage. As town mayor you’ll be enlisted to welcome new settlers, resolve disputes, and make choices to create prosperity. A well managed settlement can make their owners rich in resources, but they need to be protected. Travellers can hire a squadron of wingmen, who will now defend towns when they come under attack from roving pirates.</p></blockquote></div><p>As with all updates for <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, Beacon will be free to download. It launches today.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
