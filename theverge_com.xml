            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Ahead of the CES show floor officially opening on Tuesday, January 6th, many companies have already announced new tech, gadgets, concepts, and AI-powered upgrades that will be released over this year.</p><p>Yesterday’s CES Unveiled event delivered even more announcements and reveals. If you’re already struggling to keep on top of all the news coming out of the show, we’ve rounded up some of the best hardware and upgrades that have debuted so far. But there’s still more to come, so you can check back here every day, or catch up on all of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/836627/ces-2026-news-gadgets-announcements"><em>The Verge</em>’s CES 2026 coverage here</a>.</p><div><p><cite>Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>First <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/835525/samsung-z-trifold-announcement-us-availability">announced last month</a>, <em>The Verge</em>’s Allison Johnson finally got some hands-on time with the Galaxy Z TriFold that uses a pair of inward-folding hinges to expand from a chunky phone to a large tablet. For now it’s only available in Korea, but the Z TriFold is expected to be available in the US sometime in Q1 2026 for what will most likely be a hefty chunk of change. Its biggest selling point, according to Johnson, is the potential to carry around a laptop replacement in your pocket. “The thing that makes the TriFold feel like it could finally be The One — the one device you can carry around, leaving all others behind — is none other than DeX. On the TriFold, DeX isn’t just a desktop environment when you pair it with an external display. It’s a whole standalone mode with windowing to your heart’s content.”</p><p>If you always seem to remember what groceries you need <em>after</em> you get home from the store, GE Appliances’ new package-scanning fridge can help you create a comprehensive shopping list. Launching in April 2026 for $4,899, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/851934/ge-appliances-smart-fridge-barcode-scanner-tablet">GE Profile Smart 4-Door French-Door Refrigerator with Kitchen Assistant</a> has a scanner on the front you can use to scan empty packages, and you can manually add items to a shopping list using an 8-inch tablet on the door. There’s even a camera inside the fridge you can remotely access through an app to check if you’ve run out of something while you’re shopping.</p><p>Clicks is best known for its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/617479/clicks-blackberry-keyboard-case-android-motorola-google-pixel-samsung-galaxy-availability">smartphone cases that add a physical BlackBerry-style</a> compact keyboard. Its latest creation has that same keyboard, but also a 4.03-inch OLED screen, front and rear cameras, a headphone jack, and a 5G data connection, and it runs Android 16. The Clicks Communicator is designed to be an alternative to your daily driver smartphone that you can limit to essential apps to minimize distractions. At $499 it’s priced similarly to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/phone-review/646135/google-pixel-9a-review-a-midrange-phone-done-right">Pixel 9A</a>, but <a href="https://clicksphone.com/communicator">you can reserve one now</a> for a limited time to get a discount.</p><p>As TCL and Hisense have done, LG is looking to usurp the dominance of Samsung’s The Frame in the art TV category. Its new LG Gallery TV leverages the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.lg.com/global/newsroom/lg-story/beyond-news/how-true-wireless-and-lg-gallery-transform-the-tv-into-a-digital-art-masterpiece/" rel="sponsored">company’s Gallery+ service</a> that launched earlier this year to display everything from art to gaming scenes. The Gallery TV is a mini-LED TV with what is likely a matte coating, but LG describes it as having a “specialized screen that reduces glare and minimizes reflections for an art-like viewing experience.” It comes with a white frame, and while you can purchase additional wood-colored frames, pricing for the LG Gallery TV hasn’t been announced.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854082/lg-cloid-home-robot-fold-laundry-ces">LG’s CLOiD</a> is a home robot that can potentially do more than just clean your floors. The robot features a pair of articulated arms with seven degrees of motion mounted to a mobile base with a torso that can tilt and bend. LG says CLOiD can perform household tasks like folding and stacking laundry, putting food in the oven, or fetching something from your fridge. Can it do that faster or more reliably than you can? That remains to be seen, but CLOiD could be even more useful as a mobile smart home hub you can converse with as it follows you around the house.</p><p>Samsung’s Family Hub smart fridges aren’t new, but the company will soon be introducing a new feature for added convenience: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/853758/shut-the-fridge-door">voice-activated door opening and closing</a>. When your hands are full of groceries, or are dirty while you’re whipping up a meal, you’ll be able to ask Bixby to “Shut the fridge door,” or “Open the door,” and it will open over 90 degrees giving you full access. If your mouth is full of food and you can’t properly articulate what you want, the door can also be opened or closed using a tap of your palm or the back of your hand.</p><p>If you pulled a <em>Honey, I Shrunk the Kids</em> on the Las Vegas Sphere, you’d end up with something like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/853234/switchbot-obboto-ai-globe-desk-light-ces-2026">SwitchBot’s new dome-shaped Obboto RGB desk lamp</a>. It’s wrapped in over 2,900 color-changing LEDs and can display preset animations, animated GIFs, AI-powered “mood animations,” music visualizers, or just the local weather and time if you want to be practical. Pricing and availability haven’t been announced yet.</p><p>Petkit’s new automatic pet feeder that can dole out up to seven days of wet food isn’t just about alleviating guilt about leaving your furry friend behind while you travel. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/850992/petkit-ai-camera-yumshare-daily-feast-automatic-wet-food-feeder-eversweet-ultra-fountain">Yumshare Daily Feast</a> uses an NFC tracking system to remove meals that haven’t been eaten in 48 hours and UVC lighting to sanitize the system for delivering fresh ones. What’s potentially even more useful is an AI-powered 1080p night vision camera that tracks when and how much your pet eats to provide insights on their diet and possible health issues. It’s expected to launch in April 2026 and will be sold through pet food companies.</p><p>Six years after its first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/4/14155650/lg-oled-4k-tv-w-ces-2017-specs-release-date">Wallpaper TV debuted in 2017</a>, LG has revived the line with its new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/853886/lgs-wallpaper-oled-tv-returns-to-ces-and-its-wafer-thin">LG OLED evo W6</a>. The TV is 9mm thick thanks to its redesigned internal architecture and features a new mount so it can sit completely flush against a wall. Further improving installation is the W6’s use of LG’s Zero Connect Box which wireless sends a video signal from up to 33 feet away. The only physical cable you need to route to the W6 is for power. It will be available in 77 and 83-inch sizes.</p><p>GameSir may have already clinched the title for weirdest controller at CES 2026. The company shared more details about its upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/851259/gamesir-switch-turbo-drive-controller-steering-wheel-wireless-force-feedback">Swift Drive gamepad</a> that features a small steering wheel in the middle of the controller. The wheel’s connected to a high-precision Hall effect encoder and an equally small direct drive motor that provides force feedback effects while playing racing games and sims. There are additional haptic motors located in the gamepad’s Hall effect triggers to simulate effects like ABS braking, and it’s got RGB lighting effects that can be synced to your game. Pricing and availability haven’t been revealed yet.</p><p>It’s not quite as adorable as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24325152/yukai-engineering-mirumi-robot-ces">furry Mirumi robot</a> that debuted at last year’s CES, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/849367/yukai-engineering-baby-fufu-robot-fan-kids-cooling-ces-2026">Yukai Engineering’s new Baby FuFu</a> is potentially more practical. It looks like a cuddly cat that’s huffing and puffing and features an internal fan that will keep young kids cool while preventing tiny fingers from reaching any dangerous moving parts. It’s expected to arrive in mid-2026 for $50 to $60.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/854159/ces-2026-best-tech-gadgets-smartphones-appliances-robots-tvs-ai-smart-home]]></content:encoded>
