If a DLC drop gets delayed, Steam will let developers reschedule it up to 3 months later. And if developers have to cancel a DLC, buyers must get a refund for the item value.</p><p>Steam is also redefining what a season pass is:</p><div><blockquote><p>Because a Season Pass is effectively a DLC pre-purchase, creating a Season Pass on Steam has many of the considerations and restrictions as outlined in the documentation on&nbsp;<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/prepurchase">pre-purchases</a>. For these reasons, we will not offer a Season Pass except in a few rare cases with partners with which we have a well-established relationship and that have a proven track record on Steam.</p></blockquote></div><p>Steam also provided a strong disclaimer for developers:</p><div><blockquote><p>If you aren’t ready to clearly communicate about the content included in each DLC AND when each DLC will be ready for launch, you shouldn’t offer a Season Pass on Steam.</p></blockquote></div><p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/pc-gaming/steam-is-forcing-games-to-be-more-clear-about-whats-in-their-season-passes-and-only-allowing-devs-with-a-proven-track-record-to-sell-them/">As noted by <em>Games Radar</em></a>, the new rules might be more challenging for indie developers who don’t have a lot of games under their belts to pass Steam’s requirements. They also may not have enough resources to build up a guaranteed DLC list — but in that case perhaps they aren’t big enough to offer a season pass anyway.</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301975/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-doge-plan"><h2>Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have spelled out their plans for DOGE</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301740/hyundai-ioniq-9-three-row-electric-suv-laas"><h2>The Hyundai Ioniq 9 is a three-row electric SUV with room to grow</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300569/jaguar-rebrand-new-logo-ev"><h2>Jaguar is now JaGUar</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24300617/doj-google-search-antitrust-chrome-breakup"><h2>DOJ says Google must sell Chrome to crack open its search monopoly</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301489/amazon-echo-show-21-smart-display-price-specs-release-date"><h2>Amazon’s new&nbsp;Echo&nbsp;Show 21 has a huge screen and built-in&nbsp;smart home&nbsp;hub</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
