            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301557/new-york-times-connections-creator-take-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The New York Times</em> wants to shut down a copy of its popular <em>Connections</em> word game. The publication sent a cease and desist letter to the owner of <a href="https://connections.swellgarfo.com/">a website</a> that lets you make your own <em>Connections</em> games. The site also has a full archive of all of the <em>NYT’s</em> past <em>Connections</em> puzzles, which the <em>NYT</em> keeps behind a paywall.</p><p>The <em>Connections</em> creator website is built and run by Anthony Salazar, a freelance web developer who runs the creative studio <a href="https://swellgarfo.com/">Swellgarfo</a>. Earlier this month, striking <em>New York Times</em> tech workers used Salazar’s <em>Connections</em> tool to make their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289634/nyt-tech-guild-connections-strike-edition-custom-creator">own strike-themed puzzle</a>. Salazar previously told me that he built the archive using the <em>NYT’s</em> publicly available API.</p><p>In the letter, which Salazar shared with <em>The Verge</em>, the <em>NYT’s </em>counsel alleges that the website “unlawfully copies and reproduces” <em>Connections</em>, which constitutes “trademark and copyright infringement in violation of The Times’s intellectual property rights.” The letter also says that the <em>NYT</em> has three trademark applications pending in connection with <em>Connections</em>.</p><p>Salazar has been given three business days to take down the site. If that doesn’t happen, the <em>NYT’s </em>counsel says it’s “prepared to take further action if necessary to protect its valuable intellectual property rights,” such as filing a lawsuit.</p><p>Salazar tells <em>The Verge</em> that he will “definitely take down the archive.” But he wants to keep the creator open, saying that it’s used by schools globally. “It’s not like I am getting paid for it or competing with their users (of which I am one),” Salazar says. He’s not sure about the specific timeline for when things might happen, though.</p><p>The <em>NYT</em> says people should just play <em>Connections</em> on its website. “Mr. Salazar’s website violates the intellectual property rights of <em>The New York Times</em>,” spokesperson Jordan Cohen says in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “Anyone looking to play the original <em>Connections</em> game can do so for free on <em>The Times’s</em> own platforms. Those looking to solve puzzles from the <em>Connections</em> archive can do so by subscribing to <em>New York Times</em> Games.”</p><div><p>The <em>NYT</em> targeted <em>Wordle</em> clones with legal takedowns <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094234/ny-times-wordle-clones-files-dmca-copyright-takedowns-knockoffs">earlier this year</a>. The publication has also warned AI search engine Perplexity <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24270774/new-york-times-cease-and-desist-letter-perplexity-ai-search-engine">to stop using its content</a> and is suing OpenAI and Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/27/24016212/new-york-times-openai-microsoft-lawsuit-copyright-infringement">for copyright infringement</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301435/final-fantasy-14-mobile-square-enix<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Have you heard that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22877031/final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker-review-square-enix-pc">critically acclaimed MMORPG <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a> is getting a mobile version? In a video announcement, <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> game director Naoki Yoshida announced <em>FFXIV Mobile</em>, a joint production between Square Enix and Tencent’s Lightspeed Studios<em>. </em>The announcement was accompanied by a teaser trailer showing Warriors of Light in locations all across the game’s world of Eorzea. </p><p>It seems as though <em>FFXIV Mobile</em> will be a reset of sorts for the MMORPG, featuring content from the base game without anything from its five expansions. In the video, Yoshida said that Lightspeed Studios was working to, “faithfully recreate the story, duties, battle content, and other aspects of the original game.” Lightspeed Studios, known for<em> </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/16/17128526/pubg-mobile-hands-on-review-vs-xbox-fortnite"><em>PUBG Mobile</em></a>, is a subsidiary of Tencent which has had success adapting a number of mobile games from other companies’ IP including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294524/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-game"><em>Monster Hunter</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301541/pokemon-unite-team-game-strategy-tencent-nintendo-switch"><em>Pokémon</em></a>, and<em> </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906035/call-of-duty-download-number-biggest-launch-ever"><em>Call of Duty</em></a>.</p><p>The teaser trailer didn’t exactly show what <em>FFXIV Mobile</em> combat would look like. But judging from the little bit of battle it did show, it seems like Square Enix might be aiming to make a <em>FFXIV</em> version of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/18/16979602/final-fantasy-xv-pocket-edition-ios-android"><em>Final Fantasy XV Pocket Edition</em></a> — a stripped down mobile version of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/28/13757150/final-fantasy-15-review-ps4-xbox-one">2016 RPG</a> with simplified combat controls and chibi-fied character art. <a href="https://ffxivmobile.com/web202409/index.html#/news/detail?lang=en&amp;id=6902e2b0-8ec9-4c15-ab88-a81935362931"><em>FFXIV Mobile</em>’s website boasts</a> that players will have access to nine job classes (the full-version of the game has 21) that they’ll be able to switch classes with a single tap rather than requiring players to dig into their inventory and equip a job stone.</p><p>Neither Yoshida’s video nor the website went into detail about how much the game will cost and what, if any, traditional mobile game elements will make it in. However, according to a report in Japanese gaming magazine <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202411/23633"><em>Famitsu</em></a>, <em>FFXIV Mobile</em> will be free-to-play but will not contain any gacha elements. This potentially means the game will have to incorporate monetization some other way and if Square Enix knows anything at all about its player base, then expect to pay for mounts and, critically, player costumes. After all, glamour is the true endgame.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24300547/xbox-cloud-gaming-game-library-streaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft is starting to open up Xbox Cloud Gaming to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/games-apps/cloud-gaming/set-up-smart-tv-xbox-app">existing Xbox game libraries</a> today. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can now stream 50 games that they already own, including <em>Balatro</em>, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, a variety of <em>Final Fantasy</em> titles, and <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>.</p><p>The expansion to 50 more games is just the beginning of opening up the Xbox game library to cloud streaming. “Our library of cloud-playable titles will continue to grow, as we work with our partners around the world to bring you a diverse and expansive selection of great games across devices,” says Ashley McKissick, corporate vice president of Xbox Experiences and platforms engineering.</p><p>The 50 additional games will be available through TVs, smartphones, tablets, and PCs through a web browser. Microsoft is also planning to bring Xbox library streaming to Xbox consoles and the Xbox app on Windows next year.</p><p>This expansion is part of a long-running project known as Project Lapland inside of Microsoft. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/11/24268038/xbox-cloud-gaming-project-lapland-game-library">I revealed last month</a> that Microsoft was planning to start letting Xbox Insiders get access to more games on Xbox Cloud Gaming in November, and these initial 50 games are the start of eventually expanding this to thousands of Xbox games to cover entire libraries.</p><p>The original Project xCloud was&nbsp;<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2019/11/14/expanding-project-xcloud-more-games-more-ways-to-play/">supposed to launch</a>&nbsp;with game library streaming in 2020, but it never did, and Microsoft then announced it would support game libraries on Xbox Cloud Gaming&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/9/23159492/xbox-game-pass-cloud-gaming-library-owned-games-feature">in 2022</a>. That never happened either, and I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/11/24268038/xbox-cloud-gaming-project-lapland-game-library">reported last month</a> that the work to make this a reality has been complicated. Microsoft has to ready thousands of games on its custom Xbox cloud servers while balancing save files, game updates, and much more. </p><p>While thousands of games will eventually be available through Xbox Cloud Gaming, I’m told some publishers will hold certain games back due to licensing requirements or deals.</p><p>Microsoft was also planning to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24267339/microsoft-xbox-android-purchase-games-us-court-ruling">enable game purchases in its Xbox mobile app</a> for Android in the US in November, thanks to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores">court ruling</a>&nbsp;last month that forces Google to stop requiring Google Play Billing for apps in the Play Store. Google won a temporary administrative stay on this ruling late last month, so it’s no longer clear when Microsoft will be able to enable game purchases in its Xbox mobile app on Android.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
