This is according to a video posted by Randy Pitchford, CEO of<em> Borderlands</em> developer Gearbox Interactive, that was ironically deleted and reposted because it went up too early.</p><p>“I wanted to be the one to tell you the launch date is changing,” Pitchford said in the video. He reassured players that development was going well, in fact, so well that it was determined the game should be released earlier. But when the news was announced (officially at 11AM) gamers and press immediately started speculating that the bumped up release date has nothing to do with how well development is going. Instead, Gearbox may be simply trying to get <em>Borderlands 4 </em>in as many hands as it can before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23987993/gta-6-news-trailers-rockstar-games"><em>GTA VI</em> </a>tears a big ole’ hole in the video game market.</p><p><em>GTA VI</em> doesn’t have a set release date yet, and we’ve only been given <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158510/gta-6-release-date-fall-2025">the nebulous timing of Fall 2025</a>. Well, September is technically fall in the US, and big AAA games like<em> Borderlands </em>don’t move up their release dates on a whim. Given that<em> GTA VI </em>and <em>Borderlands 4</em> share a publisher in Take-Two Interactive, it seems even more likely that the new release date is merely getting out of the way of a late September launch window for<em> GTA VI.</em> </p><p>However, if what you want is more info on <em>Borderlands 4</em>, Pitchford closed his video by sharing that Sony will present <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/29/watch-the-borderlands-4-gameplay-deep-dive-state-of-play-on-april-30/"> a 20-minute State of Play presentation</a> on April 30th at 2PM PT/ 5PM ET.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
