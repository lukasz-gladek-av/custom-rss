According to <a href="https://status.playstation.com/">Sony’s PSN status page</a>, account management, gaming and social, PlayStation Video, PlayStation Store, and the PlayStation Direct website are all dealing with issues.</p><p>For gaming specifically, Sony says that “you might have difficulty launching games, apps, or network features.” Sony is vowing to fix the problems “as soon as possible.”</p><p>Around when I first published this article at 7:28PM ET, a colleague wasn’t able to load their purchased digital games or see their friends, trophies, or even their online status on their PS5. At about 11:45PM ET, I tried to play <em>Fortnite</em> on my PS5, but the game showed an error message and wouldn’t let me log in. I was able to start my digital copy of <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, however.</p><p>“We are aware some users might be currently experiencing issues with PSN,” Sony says in an 8:46PM ET post on <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888041723831484682">the @AskPlayStation X account</a>.</p><p>Sony’s status website says the issues started at 7PM ET, but <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/playstation-network/">Downdetector shows</a> user reports starting to come in about an hour earlier at around 6PM ET. At the peak, there were a bit less than 70,000 reports of problems on Downdetector. An r/PlayStation thread about the outage has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1ik8p8k/is_psn_down_nothing_is_working/?sort=new">more than 9,000 comments</a>.</p><p>Sony didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><div><p>PSN had an outage that lasted for around eight hours back <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/30/24258989/ps5-ps4-playstation-network-down-outage-offline">in October</a>. It dealt with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24107918/playstation-network-outage-march-2024">a partial outage in May, too</a>.</p></div><p><em><strong>Updates, February 7th</strong>: Added @AskPlayStation’s tweet, noted that the outage has been going on for hours, and added details about my own experiences with the outage.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
