            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>The Game Awards are back once again to showcase a metric ton of commercials, provide the gaming public with their monthly dose of Muppets, and validate gamers’ opinions on which title should be named the Game of the Year. I don’t wanna say it’s a foregone conclusion what this year’s GOTY will be — <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/777653/silksong-impressions-team-cherry-metroidvania-sherma-is-cool">Silksong</a> </em>may surprise us — but it’s pretty obvious that <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/656405/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-xbox-ps5-pc">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a></em> is the frontrunner and for good reason. It’s netted 12 nominations, the most out of this year’s contenders, including all five craft awards (Direction, Art, Music and Score, Narrative, and Audio Design).</p><p>On the announcements side, Crystal Dynamics and Amazon Games are planning something <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-will-be-at-the-game-awards-this-week">related to the <em>Tomb Raider</em> series</a>. Keighley also probably had plans to reveal big news about <em>Resident Evil: Requiem</em>, but unfortunately <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/playstation-accidentally-leaks-leon-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem/">it got spoiled early</a> thanks to some leaked key art on the PlayStation Store. Here’s all the news, announcements, and trailers from The Game Awards 2025.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article"><div><p>Here comes Leon.</p><p>Capcom showed off a fresh (and gruesome) look at the next <em>Resident Evil</em>, including the reveal that Leon Kennedy will be part of the terror of <em>Requiem</em> when it launches in February.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODQzMTg4" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/843188/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-casey-hudson">The next Star Wars game is the spiritual successor to Knights of the Old Republic</a></h2><div><p>The next <em>Star Wars</em> game is coming from the director of<em> Mass Effect</em> and <em>Knights of the Old Republic</em>.</p><p><em>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</em> was revealed during The Game Awards with a brief trailer that got Geoff Keighley so excited his voice started cracking. Like any announcement trailer, it was brief, featuring a spaceship landing on a rainy planet and a woman in white robes staring into the camera as a lightsaber zhooms to life. According to the trailer’s YouTube description, <em>Fate of the Old Republic</em> is a single-player narrative game and the spiritual successor to the <em>KOTOR </em>series.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/843188/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-casey-hudson">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>I think they’re ONTOS omething.</p><p>The team behind Soma revealed their next horror game, which is narrated by none other than Stellan Skarsgård. It’s described as “a sci-fi thriller taking you to the edge of existence” and is due out next year.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>A loopy reveal.</p><p>Not long ago <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/838078/lost-4-dead">Bad Robot teased its first game</a> from the designer of <em>Left 4 Dead</em>. Now you can see it in action: it’s called <em>4:Loop</em>, and it’s a co-op shooter about, uh, 3D printing humans. It’s listed as “coming soon” for the PS5 and PC.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Up next from the team behind Baldur’s Gate 3.</p><p>Larian Studios’ new RPG is called <em>Divinity</em>, though we don’t have much else in the way of information, other than the fact it’s supposedly bigger than <em>BG3</em> and the debut trailer is <em>really</em> gross.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Badger, badger, badger.</p><p>If there’s one thing these video game streets need is a good old-fashioned mascot platformer. <em>Bradley The Badger</em> is a mascot that seems to know he’s in a platforming game. In the trailer that debuted during The Game Awards pre-show, he’s transported from his colorful world to one much less fun...then it gets weird.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>It’s a dog herd sheep world out there.</p><p>The first announcement of the night was extremely adorable with <em>The Free Shepherd</em>, which is launching on the PS5 and Steam in 2027. If you’re looking for some herding action in the meantime, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/764810/herdling-panic-review-pc-switch-playstation-xbox">be sure to check out <em>Herdling</em></a>.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Catfish and Crouton are goin’ on the road.</p><p>Ahead of The Game Awards, Compulsion Games has announced that<em> South of Midnight</em> is going multi-platform. The southern gothic action-adventure game, first released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/647143/south-of-midnight-review-xbox-compulsion-games">on Xbox earlier this year</a>, is coming to PlayStation and Nintendo Switch 2 in spring 2026. Come for the incredibly cool southern folklore inspired narrative, but stay for your adorable companion Crouton and the yarn-spinnin’ Catfish.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>It’s almost that time.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/841710/the-game-awards-2025-preview-geoff-keighley">The shine may be wearing off The Game Awards</a>, but the show is still often worth a watch if you like catching the latest game reveals. This year’s edition kicks off at 8PM ET, with a pre-show airing 30 minutes before that.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODQxNzEw" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/841710/the-game-awards-2025-preview-geoff-keighley">The Game Awards are losing their luster</a></h2><div><p>It’s Game Awards season, y’all. That special time of the year when we gather together to celebrate video games and the people who make them… by watching expensive commercials briefly punctuated by the odd awards speech or musical performance. For better or worse, The Game Awards is the biggest night on the video game event calendar. But with the way things have been going, lately it’s been more “worse” than it has been “better.”</p><p>Between host and industry hypeman Geoff Keighley’s two video game vanity projects, The Game Awards is older and ostensibly more mature than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/679598/summer-game-fest-2025-trailers-news">Summer Game Fest</a>. Conceived in 2014 as a way to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/7/18131058/game-awards-2018-geoff-keighly-creaotr-streaming-tga-hydrobot">celebrate both the people who make and play games,</a> the show has always been part awards ceremony, part commercial product. That idea has been executed with varying degrees of success. (Remember the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2016/12/02/the-good-the-bad-and-the-cringeworthy-of-the-2016-game-awards/">Schick Hydrobot</a>?) But for the last few years, it’s felt like the awards part was increasingly getting in the way of the commercial part.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/841710/the-game-awards-2025-preview-geoff-keighley">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>It’s Expedition 33 vs. the world.</p><p>The Game Awards’ Game of the Year nominees <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1990467468436050379">are out</a>: <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, <em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, <em>Hades II</em>, <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, and <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>. <em>Expedition 33</em> got 12 nominations, the most <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1990471331893416105">“in TGA history.“</a></p><p>The show takes place on December 11th.</p></div></li></ul></section></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/841973/the-game-awards-2025-annoucements-news-trailers]]></content:encoded>
