The company says that the event will include “a look at upcoming titles from across our first-party studios, in addition to incredible new titles from our third-party partners across the globe.” And after the event wraps up there will be a second stream focused entirely on <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, which is due to launch later this year.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24173601/xbox-games-showcase-june-2024-microsoft">Last year’s showcase</a> included major announcements covering games like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24174839/perfect-dark-reboot-xbox-microsoft">Perfect Dark</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172041/doom-the-dark-ages-xbox-summer-game-fest-trailer">Doom: The Dark Ages</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172097/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-xbox-bethesda-release-date-trailer-date">Starfield</a></em>.
