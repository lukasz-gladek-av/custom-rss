He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony is suing Tencent to attempt to stop the release of <em>Light of Motiram</em>, which Sony describes as a “slavish clone” of its <em>Horizon</em> series of games, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/sony-sues-tencent-allegedly-ripping-off-horizon-video-games-2025-07-28/">as reported by <em>Reuters</em></a>. <em>Light of Motiram</em> was announced last year with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTMxBhy2dp0">a trailer</a> featuring an aesthetic that’s quite similar to the <em>Horizon</em> franchise — including huge robot animals and even a title font that resembles the <em>Horizon</em> games.</p><p>In its complaint, Sony alleges that “unlawful copying of the protected audiovisual elements of the <em>Horizon</em> games, as well as its deliberate adoption of a confusingly similar character mark, constitutes both copyright and trademark infringement that should be enjoined immediately.”</p><p>According to the lawsuit, Tencent started developing <em>Light of Motiram</em> in 2023. At the Game Developers Conference in March 2024, Tencent allegedly pitched Sony on a proposal that would have its Aurora Studios subsidiary “develop a <em>Horizon</em> sequel game under the requested license,” which Sony rejected. “Apparently, Tencent was undeterred by SIE’s refusal to license its <em>Horizon</em> intellectual property,” Sony says.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3319630%2FLIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM%2F" rel="sponsored">game’s Steam page</a>, <em>Light of Motiram’s</em> developer and publisher is Polaris Quest. In the lawsuit, Sony alleges that “Upon information and belief, Tencent Shanghai does business under the names ‘Aurora Studios’ and/or ‘Polaris Quest.’”</p><p>Sony says that it “had discussions with Tencent” to informally try to “resolve its concern that <em>Light of Motiram</em> violated its intellectual property rights.” However, Sony alleges that Tencent “again sought to license the <em>Horizon</em> intellectual property,” to which it “communicated clearly and unequivocally that it would not license the <em>Horizon</em> assets to Tencent, objected to <em>Light of Motiram</em>, and insisted that it be withdrawn.”</p><p>Tencent didn’t reply to a request for comment.</p><p>This isn’t the only high-profile lawsuit over allegedly similar video games. Last year, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248602/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-pocketpair-patent-infringement-lawsuit">against <em>Palworld</em>-developer Pocketpair</a>. Pocketpair said in May that it had to remove features from the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/663210/palworld-updates-feature-removed-nintendo-lawsuit">due to the lawsuit</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/714870/sony-tencent-horizon-clone-lawsuit]]></content:encoded>
