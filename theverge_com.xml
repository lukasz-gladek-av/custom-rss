On Wednesday, Nintendo announced, of all things, the “Alarmo” alarm clock. But in classic Nintendo fashion, the clock has some playful tricks.</p><p>The clock responds to your movements, which you can use to snooze your alarm with motion. Its faces feature Nintendo characters from franchises like <em>Super Mario</em> and <em>Zelda</em>, and you can set the alarm to wake you up with music from those franchises. The Alarmo can also track how much you move in your sleep.</p><p>The Alarmo — officially, the “Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo” — is available to purchase in “early access” for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers and at the Nintendo NY store. We’ve actually already picked one up, and we’ve published some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24266272/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock-hands-on">initial impressions and a bunch of photos</a>.</p><p>Here’s all of our coverage of Nintendo’s Alarmo clock.</p></section><div><div><h2>Highlights</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266353/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock#dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTE5NjY=">Nintendo’s original alarm clock prototypes were a lot less playful</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266353/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock#dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTI3OTA=">Nintendo is making an alarm clock so you can wake up to Zelda and Super Mario sounds</a></li></ul></div><section id="updates-section"><ul><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTQyNzU=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24266272/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock-hands-on">A closer look at Nintendo’s adorable Alarmo clock</a></h2><div><p>Look, I’m a sucker for instant gratification. It’s often one of my favorite things about living in New York City. This morning, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265984/nintendo-alarmo-alarm-clock-date-price">Nintendo announced its $99 Alarmo clock</a>, and when the company’s store in Rockefeller Center opened a couple hours later, I walked in and picked one up. Did I feel a little iffy about paying $108.91 after tax for a plastic alarm clock? You bet. But fortunately, in my field, this counts as a work expense. (Technically, this product is called Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo — but no one is ever going to refer to it that way. It’s Alarmo.)</p><p><em>The Verge</em>’s senior entertainment editor Andrew Webster will have a full review of Alarmo coming up, but I wanted to check it out for myself. Mostly, I was curious about the audio quality. If the speaker in this relatively tiny clock sounds tinny or shrill, that would ruin the whole concept for me.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24266272/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock-hands-on">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Now anyone can buy an Alarmo.</p><p>Nintendo’s motion-sensing (and <em>Doom</em>-playing, with some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/3/24286842/nintendo-alarmo-doom-hack-usb-custom-firmware-instructions">unsanctioned modification</a>) alarm clock is now available for anyone in the US to buy from its online store “while supplies last,” the company <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1890491214639645040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1890491214639645040%7Ctwgr%5E6aaf9cb3f67b6ae3103de2b26e2a29621a11952d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.engadget.com%2Fhome%2Fsmart-home%2Fanyone-in-the-us-can-now-buy-nintendos-alarmo-clock-from-the-online-store-171945008.html">announced yesterday</a>.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTkwNQ==" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342984/nintendo-alarmo-wide-release-date">Nintendo’s Alarmo will be available for everyone starting in March</a></h2><div><p><cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p>Another day, another announcement from Nintendo that isn’t <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/11/24341043/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-details-leaks">the next Switch</a>. Today the company revealed that its alarm clock, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24266272/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock-hands-on">Alarmo</a>, will be available at select retailers starting this March. The announcement includes <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1878897739666280752">the US</a>, <a href="https://x.com/nintendouk/status/1878804278841618846?s=46">UK</a><a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1878897739666280752">,</a> and <a href="https://x.com/NintendoEurope/status/1878804253751304335">Europe</a>.</p><p>The $99 alarm clock launched late last year, but is currently only available to those with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. Today’s news opens that up to the larger public. The motion-controlled device lets users turn it off simply by getting up, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">though in my experience</a>, that functionality wasn’t much use if you share a bed. It also includes a number of sounds and themes based on Nintendo properties, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318663/tcxmn">including <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> through a recent update.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342984/nintendo-alarmo-wide-release-date">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6OTcwMw==" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/3/24286842/nintendo-alarmo-doom-hack-usb-custom-firmware-instructions">Can Nintendo’s Alarmo run Doom?

Our phones, filled with games and videos and social feeds, allow us to fill every moment with <em>something</em>, whether we’re on a long flight or in line for 30 seconds waiting for coffee. But the silly and playful <em>While Waiting</em> is a good reminder that that can be a good thing — an opportunity for our minds to wander in unexpected directions.</p><p>Possibly the best way to describe <em>While Waiting</em> is that it’s what would happen if <em>WarioWare</em> also tried to tell the story of a human life. Which means that it’s a collection of extremely short, often weird minigames that all fit together to follow the story of a singular character through moments of waiting. It starts right from the beginning: the first thing you’re asked to do is wait to be born.</p><p>From there, you jump through time via idle moments. You have to wait for the commercials to end while watching a show with your parents, or wait to fall asleep while lying in bed, or wait for the water to heat up to take a shower. In each instance, you can simply wait and do nothing, and eventually, time will pass and whatever you’re waiting for will happen. But this is a game, after all, so you can also mess about.</p><p>There are a handful of stickers to collect in each level that hint at what you can do. While you wait to get your grade on an exam, for instance, you can sneak around the classroom and spy on your friends’ grades. It plays out like a stealth game, as you have to avoid your teacher’s gaze, lest you be forced back to your desk.</p><p>The tricky part is figuring out what you’re able to do, and how to do it, in a very limited timeframe. And since almost every level is different, that challenge repeats itself over the 100 or so minigames. This is eased by the incredibly simple controls. You use one stick to move around and one button to interact with things. That’s it, aside from another button that does nothing but let you play with a fidget toy.</p><p>For the most part, the minigames are very silly. You have to make sure you remembered to pack underwear for a flight or push through crowds to get a better view of fireworks. One of my favorite stages involved making up constellations to impress a date. It’s all very charming and goofy, often using wonky physics to add some slapstick comedy. Some of the stages can be melancholy as well; one involves simply waiting to grow up.</p><p>But each one shows that, in those brief moments of idling around that we’re so eager to fill with distractions, something surprising can happen — if only you’re bored enough to pay attention.</p><p><sub>While Waiting <em>is available now on the Nintendo Switch and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
