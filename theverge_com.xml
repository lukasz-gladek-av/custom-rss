He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Remember <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618748/nvidia-admits-the-rtx-5080-is-affecte">when Nvidia categorically told us</a> that “no other Nvidia GPUs” had shipped, or would be shipping, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/617901/nvidia-confirms-rare-rtx-5090-and-5070-ti-manufacturing-issue">missing render units</a>? Well, you can imagine our surprise to read that the company’s RTX 50-series laptop GPUs might be affected as well, <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/GeForce-RTX-5000-Auch-Notebook-GPUs-sind-vom-ROP-Schwund-betroffen-10306989.html">with <em>Heise Online</em></a> <a href="https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/news/hardware/grafikkarten/65685-fehlende-rops-auch-mobile-geforce-rtx-50-gpus-betroffen.html">and <em>Hardwareluxx </em>reporting</a> that Nvidia has asked manufacturers to check their laptops for fewer ROPs than promised.</p></div><p>But Nvidia tells <em>The Verge</em> there isn’t actually a problem with those notebook GPUs. “All partners continue to run checks as part of our standard testing procedure,” Nvidia GeForce global PR director Ben Berraondo tells us, adding that Nvidia will reach out to both German publications to discuss.</p><p>We asked very specifically:</p><p><strong>Did we just go from “no other GPUs are affected” to ‘“some laptop GPUs” are also affected?</strong></p><p>The answer was “Nope.”</p><p><strong>Just to triple-check, the “nope” means that no laptop GPUs are affected by the missing ROP issue, yes? </strong></p><p>“Correct, no further issues,” says Berraondo.</p><p>That’s a fairly categorical denial, and it sounds like laptop buyers can expect to find the full complement of ROPs in their Nvidia 50-series laptops either way — either because there never was an issue to begin with or because there’s no longer an issue now that partners will catch it during these tests.</p><p>Both <em>Heise </em>and<em> Hardwareluxx</em> have suggested that these tests are unusual in one way: some laptops may be delivered in April or May instead of planned March release dates. However, <em>Heise</em> also reports one other possible reason for delays: that “Nvidia only recently distributed the final vBIOS for the notebook GPUs,” according to Google Translate.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/625087/jackbox-games-smart-tvs-cloud-aws-gamelift-streams<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Jackbox Games are going to be available on smart TVs as part of a new cloud streaming service, <a href="https://www.jackboxgames.com/blog/jackbox-coming-to-your-smart-tv-for-free">according to a blog post</a>. Jackbox aims to launch a beta of the service on “one or two smart TV platforms in the Spring of 2025.”</p><p>Generally, Jackbox titles are offered in bundles called “Party Packs” that you can play on platforms like game consoles and PCs. This new native smart TV app could make it easier to jump into a Jackbox game, since you won’t need to launch the titles from a device like a game console.</p><p>To start, this Jackbox service will only offer a “small collection” of “ad-supported” games for free. But down the line, Jackbox plans to “also offer our entire catalog of games for a subscription fee.” (You can already subscribe to <a href="https://luna.amazon.com/subscription/jackbox-games/B09R97C6ZG">a Jackbox Games channel</a> on Amazon’s Luna cloud gaming service for $4.99 per month to access the Jackbox catalog.)</p><p>Jackbox’s service relies on Amazon’s new AWS GameLift Streams technology that lets companies build their own cloud gaming apps and experiences. GameLift Streams is also being used by companies like Bandai Namco, which relies on it to “stream an immersive metaverse platform to fans of its Gundam franchise,” <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250305783339/en/Amazon-GameLift-Streams-Empowers-Developers-to-Stream-Games-to-Virtually-Any-Device/">according to a press release</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
