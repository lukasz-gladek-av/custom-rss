Genki’s parent company, Human Things, will pay Nintendo an undisclosed amount of money in damages to close the case, according to a <a href="https://t.co/VETArfNCMZ">legal filing submitted on Monday</a>, and has agreed to stop giving its products names that are “confusingly similar” to official Nintendo intellectual property.</p><p>The dispute began in January after Genki showed off an accurate <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">3D-printed Switch 2 mockup</a> at CES, even including the console’s logo, days before it was officially launched by Nintendo. The company also began to promote its range of Switch 2 accessories before the console was announced.</p><p>Nintendo later <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660815/nintendo-lawsuit-genki-switch-2-accessories">filed a complaint</a> against the accessory maker in May over alleged “trademark infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising.” Nintendo said it didn’t provide Genki with technical Switch 2 specifications, and alleged that Genki either “unlawfully or illicitly obtained an authentic Nintendo Switch 2” prior to the console’s public release, or “cannot claim compatibility with enough certainty to make its advertising claims in good faith.”</p><p>The financial terms of the settlement haven’t been disclosed. According to the settlement filing, Genki attests that it “did not obtain access to” a Switch 2 before the console’s launch announcement, and the origins of the 3D-printed dummy unit remain unclear.</p><p>In the original lawsuit filing, Nintendo said that Genki had also infringed its trademark by marketing third-party accessories and services using language that alluded to Nintendo’s IP, such as “Genki Direct,” and “Genki Glitch 2.” Nintendo accused Genki of “taking advantage of the trust and loyalty that Nintendo fans have for the Nintendo brand and mark and causing actionable harm.”</p><p>Genki is still permitted to reference Nintendo branding in its own products in a “nominative fair use manner” under the new settlement agreement, but only when the company is making verified compatibility claims or to clarify its affiliation with Nintendo products as a third-party accessory producer.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/774236/nintendo-switch-2-genki-lawsuit-settlement#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/774236/nintendo-switch-2-genki-lawsuit-settlement]]></content:encoded>

While plenty of YouTube and TikTok videos have blamed Microsoft for the issues, Phison has identified “early versions of firmware and BIOS” as the problem instead.</p><p>“Many of the reports originate from media testing conducted on hardware running early versions of firmware and BIOS,” says Michael Wu, GM and President of Phison US, in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “These versions are performance preview drives and are not identical to those provided to end users through official distribution channels. We have observed that outdated firmware is still being used on some SSDs and we encourage any reviewers facing this to leverage updated channel firmware readily available through manufacturer-provided update utilities.”</p><p>YouTuber JayzTwoCents <a href="https://youtu.be/TbFIUu_7LIc">claimed last week</a> that the “Windows update and SSD problem is WAY worse than we thought!” JayzTwoCents showed a Crucial T500 drive (with a Phison E25 controller) failing after Microsoft’s latest Windows 11 security updates, and needing a power cycle to come back to life. It’s not clear whether JayzTwoCents was using pre-release SSD firmware, or even an early motherboard BIOS.</p><p>Phison was able to replicate issues reported by the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/hkepc/permalink/2301321666981945/">PCDIY! community</a> though, and found that these were down to engineering preview firmware. “Phison examined the exact SSDs used in the PCDIY! testing and determined PCDIY! was utilizing an engineering preview firmware, which is not the final firmware used in the Corsair Force Series MP600 SSD 2TB and other drives with the E16 controller available for sale to consumers on the market,” explains Wu. Phison also performed the same tests on consumer SSDs and found no crashes or failures.</p><p>Microsoft said late last month that it had “found no connection” between its security updates and the drive failures reported on social media and elsewhere. That didn’t stop many people, including prominent YouTubers, from blaming Microsoft for the SSD issues. That’s hardly surprising though, given Microsoft’s history of chaotic Windows updates.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/774201/phison-windows-11-ssd-issues-early-firmware#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/774201/phison-windows-11-ssd-issues-early-firmware]]></content:encoded>
