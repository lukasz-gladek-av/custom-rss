            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Every month, Circana video game analyst Mat Piscatella posts fascinating data about video game sales on Bluesky, highlighting trends like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/846693/video-game-hardware-sales-november-2025-circana">November’s historically bad month for game hardware</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/825171/battlefield-6-had-a-big-launch-month"><em>Battlefield 6</em>’s big launch in October</a>. But he doesn’t just share data about what is selling the most; as of late, he’s also posted delightful lists of games that have sold just a single physical copy over a certain period of time, and the lists often include retro games that take me down memory lane or titles that I didn’t even know existed.</p><p>The list of games that sold one physical copy <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m632god4cc25">in October</a>, for example, includes the Xbox 360 version of <em>Burnout Paradise</em> and <em>Hasbro Family Game Night 3</em> for the PS3. On Thursday, Piscatella posted the “<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3md22ljxazs2o">2025 Circana Thread for Sickos</a>” highlighting games that only sold one physical unit over the <em>whole year</em> across various handhelds and consoles.</p><p>That list of games that sold a single unit in October was born out of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/markcasey.bsky.social/post/3m62zi33ssk22">a question</a> from a user on Bluesky, Piscatella tells <em>The Verge</em>. “People seemed to enjoy the combination of journey down memory lane and the treasure hunting idea of these games being out there somewhere,” Piscatella says. Then people started asking him about it, so he thought it’d be fun to keep doing it.</p><p>Circana is able to track the data because it has agreements with “all major retailers” that let it compile and analyze point-of-sale data, Piscatella says. “I​​f a retailer’s point-of-sale system scans a product as a sale, it will show up in the data.” That means all the games he has mentioned in these threads “had one new unit floating around out there somehow that was sold through a register or via an online purchase. Perhaps it was a unit that had been lost somewhere in the back, or was buried under a display, or who knows.”</p><p>While it’s fun to look back and laugh at some of the games people bought — I feel sorry for the poor soul who purchased <em>Metroid: Other M</em> for the Wii last year — people buying an older, obscure game from a store is more common than you might think, Piscatella says. “There were more than 1,000 games across all platforms (including PC) that sold between one and five new physical units in the US during 2025, while over 3,500 different games sold at least one new physical unit at retail last year overall,” according to Piscatella. “Retailers have all kinds of stuff hidden away in those stores of theirs.”</p><p>I asked Piscatella how long he plans to continue making the threads highlighting games selling just one copy. “So long as it stays fun, I reckon,” he says. “But who knows.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/867004/circana-gaming-sales-data-mat-piscatella-one-copy-obscure-games]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[This coming-of-age adventure game made me feel a little too seen]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/865082/perfect-tides-station-to-station-review-steam</link>
            <guid>1415053</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There’s a lot about <em>Perfect Tides: Station to Station</em>’s Mara that I find relatable. Like me, she’s recently moved to a place simply called “the City” from the middle of nowhere, and like me, she’s an avid writer. But these biographical details aren’t the important thing; it’s the way she’s painted by the game’s incredibly sharp writing where I start to feel uncomfortably seen. There are a lot of characters in media that are awkward or socially anxious, but few that are drawn with such piercing specificity.</p><p>The point-and-click game is minimalist in its mechanics. Consisting mostly of conversations, it’s broken up by a few puzzles, object interactions, and minigames. This is not a complaint: it’s in talking to people that the game shines, because it’s how we get to see most of Mara. And she’s such a realized and resonant portrait of a person that I found myself grasping at where we were different as a coping mechanism against spending the <em>whole</em> time introspecting. I pride myself, for example, on never having had an awful boyfriend. In this, surely, I could find some self-soothing superiority over this poor video game character.</p><p>The dynamics of Mara’s relationship with her controlling, older, long-distance partner are sketched with both narrative and mechanical thoughtfulness. In one conversation, a health bar suddenly appears, and you must navigate a particularly difficult conversation without losing all of your hearts, some of which you gain only if you’ve spent time nurturing other connections. It’s one of many neat metaphors, and combined with the clever moment-to-moment writing, led to a particularly notable moment, which wrenched an “oh, for fuck’s sake” out of my mouth in real life.</p><p>It was then that I had completely bought into <em>Station to Station</em> . I thought I had the shape of it. Dear relatable Mara and her messy relationships that I could hold as a simplifying buffer between us. But the game wouldn’t settle for simplicity.</p><p>Aside from conversation, the other important mechanic is Mara’s writing. These manifest in assignments for school, guest blog posts, and, in one real low moment for Mara, an overly involved forum post, and you’ll need to combine topics together to complete the piece in question. These topics include the city, music, and sex, and they level up as you talk to people and experience the world. It’s a pretty simple but effective representation of how writing works: you learn things through living and then combine ideas into, hopefully, something new and expressive.</p><p>There’s one piece that works differently. Mara writes a story that is clearly a thinly veiled allegory for her own life, and a tutor gives her some relatively harsh feedback. For the rest of the game, the story looms in the back of her mind. You can’t fix this just by combining a thought your friend had about movies and your own ruminations on death caused by your ailing grandmother. But each of those might help a little as you chip away at it bit by bit. Without getting too self-indulgent about my own recent writing experiences, suffice to say <em>Station to Station </em>had once again skewered me. I had Mara work on it whenever I could, every time reminded of my own festering project and the trust necessary to wait and address it slowly.</p><p>At this point in the game, it’s clear that the aforementioned partner is not Mara’s only problem. In fact, most of her interactions with other characters are marred in some way or another. I, for one, would simply not get involved with these people! But again, the game resists simplicity. Although it always presents harmful interpersonal dynamics honestly and without excusing bad behavior, it absolutely refuses the idea of shutting yourself away to avoid them. Because you would miss out on too much. Too much joy, too much connection, too much potential.</p><p>In one of the only conversations in the game that feels purely uncomplicated and productive, a character tells Mara “you just have to risk it with someone and see.” <em>Station to Station </em>argues, over and over again, that being open to others, despite the risk of awkwardness, and of not being treated well, is worth it. Mara is naive, and not very good at knowing what she wants, let alone asking for it. And she does get hurt. But she also lives a much more beautiful life when she doesn’t close herself off to experiences and people. She deals with the consequences, and through this she learns and grows and flourishes. My knee-jerk perceived superiority in being avoidant is suddenly the crack through which <em>Station to Station</em> has sunk its claws into me. I will be thinking about it for a very long time.</p><p>There’s a lot more I could talk about, like the multiple excellent musical interludes, or the hugely exaggerated animations that feel genuinely expressive while also being consistently comedic. I could even complain bitterly about some of the incidental environmental puzzles and the way they ground the story to a screeching halt if you happened to miss one small interaction point. But what kept me thinking about the game long after the credits rolled was its emotional honesty and the emotional honesty it demanded of me while playing it.</p><p>After playing the game, I stewed for a couple of days, thinking about Mara, myself, and one particularly memorable bit of karaoke. And then it hit me: I never finished Mara’s rewrite. No matter how important it felt in the moment, it turned out to be much less crucial than Mara and I opening ourselves up and accepting the consequences, good and bad.</p><p><sub>Perfect Tides: Station to Station<em> is out now on PC.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE0MTA="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Castello</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/865082/perfect-tides-station-to-station-review-steam]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Intel and AMD have split the Windows laptop market for years, but the x86 players may be getting outnumbered. It’s not just Apple MacBooks and MediaTek-based Chromebooks using Arm chips anymore. There are finally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/862985/asus-zenbook-a16-snapdragon-x2-ces-early-testing-hands-on">competent Qualcomm Snapdragon laptops</a> running Windows, and — as soon as this spring — Nvidia will finally power Windows consumer laptops with Arm chips all by itself.</p><p>They won’t have an Nvidia graphics chip next to an Intel CPU, but rather an Nvidia N1 system-on-chip at the helm — and overnight, a Lenovo leak revealed that the company has built six laptops on the upcoming N1 and N1X processors, including a 15-inch gaming machine.</p><p>Dataminer Huang514613 posted the product names to X, which also include 14 and 16-inch models of the Ideapad Slim 5, two variants of the 15-inch Yoga Pro 7, and a Yoga 9 transforming 2-in-1.</p><p>You don’t need to take Huang’s word for it alone: <a href="https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht517560-legion-space">this update page</a> for the company’s Legion Space control software still shows the existence of a “Legion 7 15N1X11” gaming laptop, where the “N1X” refers to Nvidia’s gaming SoC.</p><p>And just by using Google, I found a publicly indexed web portal where Lenovo has listings for password-protected “Nvidia N1x Portal Prod” and Nvidia N1x Portal Test” websites, too:</p><div><p>Lenovo may be the world’s biggest laptop maker, but it isn’t the only one prepping such laptops. Dell was tipped to launch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678000/nvidia-arm-gaming-laptop-mediatek-alienware">an Alienware gaming laptop by early 2026</a> as well, and it <a href="https://x.com/Olrak29_/status/2010609089563467907/photo/1">may have been prepping a Dell Premium</a> laptop (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/851047/dell-xps-14-16-13-laptops-brand-return-ces-2026">now XPS</a>) with Nvidia N1X as well. That’s already eight different Nvidia laptops that might be coming.</p></div><p>Three days ago, <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20260120PD216/nvidia-notebooks-launch-arm-windows-2026.html"><em>Digitimes</em> reported</a> that we should expect Nvidia to launch its N1 and N1X laptop platform this spring, with more devices available this summer, after <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250721PD208/mediatek-nvidia-ai-pc-launch-2026.html">a previous delay</a> — and that the company already has N2 and N2X chips on the roadmap for late 2027.</p><p>While we don’t truly know how much power the N1 and N1X have, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-n1x-soc-leaks-with-the-same-number-of-cuda-cores-as-an-rtx-5070-n1x-specs-align-with-the-gb10-superchip">a Geekbench leak</a> (which has to be taken with a grain of salt; fake specs have been planted there before) suggested the N1X variant may have as many CUDA cores as a desktop RTX 5070 graphics card and 20 CPU cores, like Nvidia’s GB10 “Superchip” in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/798775/nvidia-spark-personal-ai-supercomputer">DGX Spark</a> mini-PC. I’m comfortable sharing that because Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-ceo-confirms-n1-chip-is-actually-gb10-superchip-used-in-dgx-spark">all but confirmed the N1 and GB10</a> are two halves of the same coin.</p><div><p>Nvidia’s Arm PC chips have been a <em>long</em> time coming, but the company has powered consumer devices with Arm before. Every Nintendo Switch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/20/13346004/nintendo-took-the-guts-from-the-nvidia-shield-for-its-new-console">carries an Nvidia Tegra chip</a>, and that Tegra line <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/8/4603612/what-is-the-nvidia-tegra-tab">previously powered tablets</a> up to and including the original <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/23/3540550/microsoft-surface-review">Microsoft Surface RT</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/31/4573596/nvidia-shield-review">Nvidia’s one-off Shield handheld</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935215/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review-streaming-stick-dolby-vision-4k-price-specs-features">Shield TV</a> set-top-boxes.
