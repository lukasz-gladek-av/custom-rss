And if you owned <em>Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</em> ahead of Monday’s announcement at 12PM ET, you’ll get <em>Reloaded</em> as a free upgrade.</p><p>Last year, Microsoft announced a new game in the series, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172052/gears-6-xbox-summer-game-fest-trailer"><em>Gears of War: E-Day</em></a>, which doesn’t yet have a release date. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
