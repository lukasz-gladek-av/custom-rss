            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24315134/fortnite-ballistic-counter-strike-first-person-shooter-fps<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Epic Games is about to let <em>Fortnite</em> creators publish experiences with first-person modes, and to help show what’s possible, Epic itself is introducing a tactical FPS shooter that seems like it will play a lot like <em>Counter-Strike </em>or <em>Valorant.</em></p><p>The new mode, called “Ballistic,” is “an adrenaline-filled, round-based 5v5 competitive game mode where strategy, tactical teamwork, and individual prowess are essential for victory,” <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-goes-first-person-with-ballistic-a-tactical-5v5-shooter-launching-in-early-access-dec-11">according to an Epic blog post</a>. Players will be split into two teams, with one that has to plant the bomb — sorry, I mean the “Rift Point Device” — and another that has to defend against that. Between rounds, you’ll be able to buy gear for the next one. Teams will switch sides after six rounds, and the first to win seven rounds will be crowned the victor.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Epic has cribbed a game idea for <em>Fortnite: </em>its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23993046/fortnite-is-going-full-speed-ahead">racing</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23992574/fortnite-festival-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band">festival</a> modes both borrow a lot from Psyonix’s <em>Rocket League</em> and Harmonix’s <em>Rock Band</em> (Epic owns both studios), the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic"><em>Lego</em> survival mode</a> has a lot of similarities to <em>Minecraft</em>, and Epic even admitted that the (now-gone) Impostors mode <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722606/epic-games-fortnite-imposters-mode-copy-among-us-credit">was inspired by <em>Among Us</em></a>. Heck, the game’s main battle royale mode was actually a spinoff that followed the success of <em>PUBG</em>.</p><p>But now that Epic is trying to make <em>Fortnite</em> into something more akin to <em>Roblox</em> (another inspiration!), where players are encouraged to sample lots of experiences instead of just one, modes like Ballistic and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/21/24183255/its-going-to-be-a-busy-weekend-in-fortnite">Reload</a><em> </em>let Epic experiment with different ideas without changing the core battle royale experience. And since your purchased <em>Fortnite</em> outfits and gear generally work across all of the modes, there’s a financial incentive for Epic to add more experiences, too.</p><p>Ballistic launches in early access on December 11th. <em>Fortnite</em> creators will be able to publish their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24258447/fortnite-creators-first-person-shooters-fps-unreal-editor">own experiences</a> with first-person modes <a href="https://x.com/FNCreate/status/1864747437384176063">that same day</a>.</p><div><p><em>Ballistic</em> is arriving during an already busy time for <em>Fortnite</em>. The game’s Japanese-themed season kicked off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/30/24309607/new-chapter-new-island">at the beginning of the week</a>, and on Friday, Epic launched the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294616/fortnite-og-permanent-december-release-date">permanent version of its throwback OG mode</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
