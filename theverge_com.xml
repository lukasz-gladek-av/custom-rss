During the Xbox Developer Direct showcase, the studio showed off more gameplay for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682371/beast-of-reincarnation-game-freak-xbox-games-showcase-trailer">its action RPG <em>Beast of Incarnation</em></a>, and confirmed that it will be launching in the summer of 2026 on the PS5, Xbox, and PC.</p><p>Here’s the overview that aired during the event:</p><p><em>Beast of Reincarnation</em> is set in a postapocalyptic Japan in the year 4026, and it’s described as a “one-person one-dog action RPG,” with a world and gameplay designed to evoke the feelings of “warmth, trust, and loneliness.” In practice, it looks a little like a cross between <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Monster Hunter</em>, which means lots of cool monster designs and what looks to be very intense combat that blends elements of real-time action and turn-based RPGs. And, yes, it definitely seems like you can pet the dog.</p><p>In development for six years, the game was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23716737/game-freak-developer-project-bloom-game">first revealed back in 2023 under the codename Project Bloom</a>, and has since undergone a publishing shift. It was originally under the label Private Division, which was previously part of Take-Two Interactive. But the label has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289932/take-two-private-division-publisher-sale">since been sold off</a> and is now operating under the name Fictions.</p><p>And while Game Freak is best known as the primary developer behind the <em>Pokémon</em> series, the studio has dabbled in outside projects from time to time, though these tend to be smaller-scale titles like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/3/23537624/apple-arcade-game-freak-pokemon-pocket-card-jockey-ride-on">Pocket Card Jockey</a></em> or <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/21/9008871/tembo-the-badass-elephant-review-xbox-ps4-pc">Tembo the Badass Elephant</a></em>. <em>Beast of Incarnation</em> represents the studio’s biggest non-<em>Pokémon</em> project to date.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/865588/beast-of-reincarnation-trailer-date-pokemon-game-freak]]></content:encoded>
