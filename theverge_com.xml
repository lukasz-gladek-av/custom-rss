In a statement sent to <em>The Verge </em>on Fandom’s behalf, Katie Schroeder confirmed Miller’s departure and noted that, while the company is currently being overseen by interim leadership, “we have not announced a new CEO as of yet.”</p><p>After leaving StubHub to <a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/fandom-perkins-miller-ceo-1203129212/">join Fandom in 2019</a>, Miller oversaw the company’s <a href="https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/fandom-buys-tv-guide-metacritic-gamespot-1235391144/">$50 million acquisition of a number of entertainment content platforms</a> from Red Ventures including <em>TV Guide, Metacritic, GameSpot, </em>and <em>Giant Bomb</em>. At the time, Miller said that the deal was meant to “expand our business capabilities and provide immersive content for our partners, advertisers and fans.” The deal <a href="https://kotaku.com/giant-bomb-gamespot-metacritic-fandom-layoffs-1850008228">also led to</a> multiple <a href="https://aftermath.site/fandom-gamespot-screen-junkies-layoffs-restructuring">rounds of layoffs</a> for the editorial staff at some of Fandom’s newly-acquired properties. During <a href="https://siliconvalleyjournals.com/fandom-cuts-11-of-workforce-affecting-gamespot-and-other-gaming-outlets/">an all-hands meeting last October</a>, Miller pointed to corporate restructuring and missed revenue targets as some of the causes of the layoffs.</p><p>While Fandom’s IP-specific wikis are popular, they have become widely known for being difficult to navigate due to a preponderance of aggressive ads that often make pages unstable to the point of being nearly unusable. When asked about Fandom’s user experience during a <em>Decoder </em>episode back in 2023, Miller said that he thought “we’re doing our best to make it as elegant as we can, and yet, we need to drive the economics.”</p><p>Though Fandom hasn’t named who might replace Miller, the <a href="https://www.playonsports.com/"><em>PlayOn! Sports Network</em></a> — which aggregates videos of high school organized sports — <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/playon-sports-names-perkins-miller-170000443.html">announced today</a> that he has signed on as its new CEO.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTE="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Charles Pulliam-Moore</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/804821/fandom-ceo-perkins-miller-departure]]></content:encoded>
