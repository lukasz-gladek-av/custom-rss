Valve has moved recommendations into one tab “so you can explore new games and content without having to sift through multiple areas.” The Categories tab is also now “fully personalized” with hubs based on things like genres or games that are great on Steam Deck that you can dive into.</p><p>“With these changes, we’re aiming to make your experience smoother and more tailored to your needs,” Valve says. “We’ve been hearing from players, and experiencing ourselves, that some of the most commonly visited areas of Steam were hard to get to. So whether you’re a frequent shopper or looking to build your game library, this new layout is designed to get you where you want to go with less effort.”</p><div><p>Valve initially rolled out the changes <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F593110%2Fview%2F500579345320904590" rel="sponsored">in beta in July</a>.</p></div><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/785110/valve-steam-redesigned-store-menu-personalized-recommendations#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/785110/valve-steam-redesigned-store-menu-personalized-recommendations]]></content:encoded>

Aside from that, though, it’s not really clear what to expect from the event. Sony says it will span around 35 minutes and include “new looks at anticipated third-party and indie titles, plus updates from some of our teams at PlayStation Studios.”</p><div><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/sony-playstation/678933/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-news-trailers">most recent State of Play in June</a> featured a number of welcome surprises — including <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770509/007-first-light-state-of-play-september-2025">007 First Light</a></em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/783944/final-fantasy-tactics-remake-review-square-enix-playstation">the <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> remaster</a> — so something similar could happen here.
