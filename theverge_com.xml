That includes the interactive Hello, Mario! app featuring an interactive 3D version of Mario’s head that reacts to being poked, tugged, and flung around the screen. The app will be available as a free download for the Switch, Switch 2, and iOS and Android devices starting on February 19th, 2026.</p><p>The My Mario physical products coming to the US include apparel for infants and toddlers; a board book that, like the mobile app, lets kids interact with Mario’s face; plush versions of Mario and items from the games; and a collection of bath and water toys. There’s not a lot that will appeal to adults that aren’t devoted Nintendo collectors, although there are two block sets featuring colorful wooden versions of Super Mario characters that include Amiibo functionality that could be hard to resist.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>Nintendo’s wooden block sets may appeal both to kids and grownup Super Mario fans.</em></figcaption> <cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></span></p></section><p>The My Mario collection will be available through Nintendo’s New York and San Francisco stores on February 19th, but the company says the products “will also begin arriving at select retail stores nationwide this spring and will continue to expand throughout the year.” Ideally that will also include Nintendo’s online store for those who can’t find a retail location carrying them.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/858587/nintendo-my-mario-apparal-toys-book-mobile-app]]></content:encoded>
