            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/charles-pulliam-moore">Charles Pulliam-Moore</a> <span>is a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Though Nintendo’s live-action <em>Legend of Zelda </em>movie <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682751/legend-of-zelda-live-action-movie-date-delay">won’t be out until May 7th, 2027</a>, we finally know who is going to be playing the titular princess and her faithful knight.</p><p>This morning via its news app, Nintendo announced that Bo Bragason (<em>Renegade Nell</em>, <em>The Radleys</em>) and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth (<em>The Haunting of Bly Manor</em>, <em>Pinocchio</em>) have been cast as Princess Zelda and Link, respectively. In <a href="https://x.com/nintendo/status/1945433161124688335?s=46">an X post about the casting</a>, Shigeru Miyamoto — who is producing the film — expressed that he is “very much looking forward to seeing” Bragason and Ainsworth on the big screen together.</p><p>Aside from the fact that <em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em>’ Wes Ball is directing the <em>Zelda </em>movie, we still don’t know all that much about the project. But the <em>Zelda </em>feature is very much a part of Nintendo’s larger push into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23608700/super-nintendo-world-entertainment-miyamoto-takahashi-interview">different kinds of entertainment like movies and theme parks</a>.</p><p>The company knocked it out of the park with <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>, and it seems to have plans on trying again <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/666569/super-mario-world-movie-sequel-nintendo-universal">with a sequel</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/analysis/706610/donkey-kong-movie-copyright-notice-nintendo-strategy">a new <em>Donkey Kong </em>project</a>. A live-action <em>Legend of Zelda </em>could be another hit for Nintendo, but fans are probably going to need to see a bit of Hyrule before they’re ready to hop on the hype train.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/708143/nintendo-zelda-movie-casting-bo-bragason-benjamin-evan-ainsworth]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707106/cyberpunk-2077-mac-release-date">launching on macOS tomorrow</a>, and CD Projekt Red is now <a href="https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/mac/sp-technical/issue/2891/cyberpunk-2077-mac-system-requirements">sharing details</a> on exactly what Mac you’ll need to get the most out of the game. While <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> has been optimized for a variety of Macs, from early M1 models up, if you want the top “very high fidelity” config then you’ll need an M3 Ultra or M4 Max machine with 36GB of unified memory.</p><p>CD Projekt Red is using dynamic “for this Mac” presets that will assign settings and resolutions based on your Mac’s hardware. M1 Macs will be able to run <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, as long as you have 16GB of unified memory. That gives you the “minimum” config, which runs at 1440 x 900 resolution or 1600 x 900 (using MetalFX dynamic resolution scaling) with a target performance of 30fps.</p><p>If you want 60fps then CD Projekt Red is recommending an M3 Pro or higher with 18GB of unified memory, which will run at 1080p resolution (using MetalFX DRS) with a target of 60fps. You’ll likely be able to achieve 60fps by dropping the resolution below 1080p on some older Apple silicon hardware, though.</p><p>The remaining “high fidelity” and “very high fidelity” configs will be reserved for some of the most powerful Apple silicon chips. High fidelity requires an M2 Ultra or M3 Max chip with 36GB of unified memory, and will enable 60fps gameplay at 1440p with MetalFX DRS. Very high fidelity is reserved for M3 Ultra or M4 Max chips with 36GB of unified memory, and will also deliver 60fps gameplay at 1440p with MetalFX DRS enabled.</p><p>None of the “for this Mac” presets enable ray tracing by default, though. If you want to play around with ray tracing then <a href="https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/mac/sp-technical/issue/2897/ray-tracing-on-mac">CD Projekt Red recommends</a> an M3 or newer chip. An Apple M3 Pro device with 18GB of unified memory will be able to handle the medium ray tracing preset at 1080p (with MetalFX DRS) and 30fps. If you want <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> ray-traced at 60fps on Mac then you’ll need an M3 Max or higher chip with 36GB of unified memory, which will run the medium ray tracing preset at 60fps at 1080p with MetalFX DRS.</p><p>AMD’s FSR upscaling and frame generation will also be available in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on Mac, so it’s possible with a mixture of settings you’ll be able to find an even sweeter spot for playing this game on a Mac than the presets provide. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> will be available from Apple’s own Mac App Store, Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG.com on July 17th, and the game supports cross progression across all platforms.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/708100/cyberpunk-2077-mac-system-requirements-modes-ray-tracing]]></content:encoded>
