            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jess-weatherbed">Jess Weatherbed</a> <span>is a news writer focused on creative industries, computing, and internet culture. Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The indie-focused open gaming marketplace Itch.io has abruptly deindexed adult content from its browse and search pages, warning that some games will be permanently removed from the platform. In <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content">a blog post on Thursday</a>, Itch.io creator Leaf Corcoran said that the update was due to concerns that the website’s payment processors had “about the nature of certain content” hosted on the platform, following similar scrutiny against Steam.</p><p>“Our ability to process payments is critical for every creator on our platform,” said Corcoran. “To ensure that we can continue to operate and provide a marketplace for all developers, we must prioritize our relationship with our payment partners and take immediate steps towards compliance.”</p><p>While Itch.io hosts a variety of gaming content, adult and pornographic titles are often among the top-sellers on the platform. Content creators who host their work on Itch.io were given no warning ahead of the decision. “We know this is not ideal, and we apologize for the abruptness of this change,” said Corcoran. It’s unclear if customers are currently <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knybgc4siigl22kc5t4new4w/post/3luoizccnzx2y">able to access</a> games and visual novels that they had paid for prior to the update. We’ve reached out to Itch.io for clarification.</p><div><p>Credit card companies like Visa and Mastercard have rules that restrict some kinds of illegal and NSFW content. Steam <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-pulls-adult-only-games-from-steam-as-it-tightens-rules-to-appease-payment-partners">similarly purged some adult titles</a> last week after quietly changing its policy guidelines to ban any content that might violate rules set by the platform’s payment providers and card networks. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/itch.io/post/3luovbe444k2h">Backlash against</a> <a href="https://x.com/basterbinez/status/1948198319471415683">both gaming</a> <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/itch-follows-in-steams-footsteps-and-nukes-adult-games-you-cant-even-download-them-anymore-if-you-paid-for-them.1251720/">platforms online</a> has likened the situation to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18129532/tumblr-nsfw-porn-ban-fallout-storystream-updates-news">Tumblr banning pornographic content</a> in 2018, a decision that Matt Mullenweg, CEO of Tumblr’s parent company, Automattic, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/29/23377446/tumblr-matt-mullenweg-post-nsfw-porn-internet-service-moderation-policies">attributed to pressure from credit card companies</a>, and is widely believed to have driven many users away from the platform.</p></div><p>Itch.io has yet to provide full guidance for creators that outlines the content that will be permitted on the platform following this change, but notes that creators will be required to confirm that their NSFW content abides by any rules set by their account’s payment processors. That is, of course, providing that this doesn’t cause a Tumblr-esque mass exodus of users who may now be looking for an alternative service to host, sell, and buy NSFW games.</p><p>“We are currently conducting a comprehensive audit of content to ensure we can meet the requirements of our payment processors,” said Corcoran. “Pages will remain deindexed as we complete our review. Once this review is complete, we will introduce new compliance measures.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/712890/itch-removes-adult-nsfw-games-steam-payment-providers]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister">Sean Hollister</a> <span>is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/21578775/lego-nintendo-game-boy-fan-model-nick-lever-masters">We asked for the perfect Lego Nintendo Game Boy</a>… did Lego deliver? After <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339971/nintendo-game-boy-lego-release-date-october-2025">revealing this January</a> that it would take up the challenge, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=13923&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fgame-boy-72046" rel="sponsored">it has revealed</a> a most impressive take on the 1989 classic that’ll cost a relatively reasonable $60 in the US. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-Game-Boy/dp/B0DX3J6MT7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">It’s already up for preorder today</a> for an October 1st ship date. At 3.5 inches (14cm) wide and 5.5 inches (9cm) tall, it looks like it’ll have almost the same dimensions as the original.</p></div><p>As you’ll see in the many images below, this Game Boy doesn’t <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21578775/lego-nintendo-game-boy-fan-model-nick-lever-masters">rely on miniature hats</a> for its iconic fuchsia A and B buttons — Lego has seemingly created pitch-perfect buttons that appear to recess into the frame. The console’s curves are also captured remarkably well!</p><p>And unless I’m very much mistaken, it comes with <em>printed</em> tiles rather than sticker labels to help replicate the Game Boy’s many, many iconic labels for its buttons, volume dial, on-off switch, “Dot Matrix With Stereo Sound” highlight, as well as larger features like the Game Boy’s mono speaker grille, battery compartment latch, and serial number around back that have proven difficult to emulate in bricks. (That serial number has an easter egg, by the way.)</p><div><p><cite>GIF by The Verge / video by Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>But perhaps best of all, this Lego Game Boy can show off actual scenes from the classic games using swappable lenticular lenses that’ll show you different images when viewed from different angles. You can pop in a brick-built cartridge of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening </em>or <em>Super Mario Land</em>, and “watch” the classic Nintendo logo drop as you rotate the screen downwards (you’ll have to imagine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz2QPBkDkFc">the Game Boy’s da-DING beep</a>). Or, pop in a different lenticular lens to see Link cozy up to Marin on the beach in <em>Awakening</em>’s most bittersweet scene:</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/14/24073412/i-built-that-lego-game-boy-and-now-its-even-better">I built Nick Lever’s fan-designed Lego Game Boy myself</a>, and have the real deal that plays actual cartridges too, but I’m going to be mighty tempted to pick up the official Lego one as well. If those buttons move when you push them, I doubt I’ll resist! Do wish it came with <em>Tetris</em>, too, though.</p><div><p>Lego and Nintendo have also recreated part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3eYc6dMOhw">the original US Game Boy commercial</a> using the set. It’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMeI3BwtTje/">on Instagram</a>, and you may be able to play it (with a tap) in its embedded form below.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/712786/here-is-legos-official-nintendo-game-boy-with-lenticular-display]]></content:encoded>
