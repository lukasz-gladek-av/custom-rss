He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>In July, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/697125/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-2025">Microsoft’s sweeping layoffs hit Xbox hard</a>, and shuttered the entire game studio that was building <em>Perfect Dark</em>. Officially, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696877/xbox-perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-the-initiative-layoffs">the game was canceled</a>. But unofficially, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/-perfect-dark-developer-lays-off-staff-after-funding-deal-falls-through">reports <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Jason Schreier</a>, Microsoft gave <em>Perfect Dark</em>’s other set of developers — <em>Tomb Raider</em> studio Crystal Dynamics<em> — </em>a chance to revive the game.</p></div><p>Here’s where it gets potentially confusing: Microsoft doesn’t own Crystal Dynamics — that studio belongs to the Embracer Group, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/630234/embracer-group-aftermath-saber-matt-karch-stephen-totilo">has had</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163110/embracer-laid-off-more-employees-than-riot-games-entire-workforce">many</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/28/24114402/embracer-selling-gearbox-borderlands-developer-take-two">troubles</a> of its own. So Embracer was trying to cut a deal with <em>yet another</em> publisher, the giant Take-Two, to buy, fund, and publish the game. But, Schreier reports:</p><div><blockquote><p>the talks collapsed at least in part because the companies involved were unable to come to terms over long-term ownership of the <em>Perfect Dark</em> franchise, said the people, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about sensitive negotiations.</p></blockquote></div><p>When that deal fell through, it reportedly led to the new round of layoffs at Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-more-following-perfect-dark-cancelation">that <em>IGN</em> reported last week</a>, and Schreier writes that Crystal Dynamics has now “fully” abandoned the game.</p><p>Seems Microsoft didn’t want to give up the rights to <em>Perfect Dark</em>, which it presumably obtained when it bought Rare in 2002. (For the uninitiated, <em>Perfect Dark</em> was a spiritual successor to Rare’s hit <em>Goldeneye 007</em> on the Nintendo 64, a game that itself went many decades without a revival because of <a href="https://licensinginternational.org/news/mgm-and-eon-productions-partner-with-nintendo-and-microsoft-to-bring-iconic-goldeneye-007-video-game-to-a-new-generation-of-gamers/">a complicated licensing situation</a>.) That feels like a crummy reason for the game to stay canceled, but we don’t know the details.</p><div><p>Microsoft <em>was</em> able to broker a previous deal to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24218424/hifi-rush-studio-tango-gameworks-saved-krafton-microsoft">save <em>Hi-Fi Rush </em>developer Tango Gameworks by selling it to <em>PUBG</em> giant Krafton</a>, but it was under a lot of pressure there. <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> had already been released, had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152137/xbox-hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-matt-booty">become a “break out hit” that won “prestige and awards”</a>, and gamers were pissed that Microsoft had rewarded its developers with layoffs.</p></div><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/769372/microsoft-perfect-dark-revival-take-two-deal#comments">2<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/769372/microsoft-perfect-dark-revival-take-two-deal]]></content:encoded>
