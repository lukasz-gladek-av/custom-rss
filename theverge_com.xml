They’re currently $143.98 ($86 off) at <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Felectronics%2Faudio%2Fheadphones%2Fearbuds-in-ear-headphones%2Fproducts%2Fsony-inzone-buds-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-gaming-earbuds-for-playstation-5-and-pc---white%2F412019.html" rel="sponsored">GameStop</a>, dropping them to a new all-time low price. <em>The Verge’s</em> commerce editor, Cameron Faulkner, says they deliver excellent sound quality and versatility, with a USB-C audio transmitter that allows them to connect to everything from a PlayStation 5 to a Steam Deck and a Nintendo Switch 2.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->144</span></p><div><p>Sony’s wireless gaming buds offer low latency, active noise cancellation, and support for both Bluetooth and USB-C.</p></div></div><p>Sony’s InZone Buds offer many of the same features as the company’s flagship earbuds, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23803374/sony-wf-1000xm5-earbuds-review">WF-1000XM5</a>, which remain <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds">our favorite overall earbuds</a>. They use the same drivers, and they borrow the XM5’s active noise cancellation and mic transparency capabilities. Additionally, they offer up to 12 hours of battery life on a single charge, or a total of 24 hours with the charging case (which can fit the USB-C transmitter).</p><p>The InZone Buds feature multiple sizes of silicone ear tips, and if you have a PC, Sony’s InZone app can perform a sound test to help you choose the right ear tip for your inner ear shape. If you struggle to find a comfortable fit, a feature like this can be seriously useful. The earbuds also include a microphone, plus touch gestures for muting the mic, adjusting the volume of your audio, and toggling between noise cancellation settings — all of which can be customized via the InZone app.</p><div><p id="other-deals-worth-checking-out"><h2>Other deals worth checking out</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>If you’re looking for something to charge your phone, wireless earbuds, and smartwatch, the <strong>Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station</strong> is down to $65.99 ($45 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-Charging-%C3%AF%C2%BC%C5%92Cable-Bundle-White/dp/B0CFXQMZJT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. The Qi2 charger features a tree-like design, with three different charging areas. The main charging pad delivers up to 15W to a phone, while a second charging pad can quickly replenish the Apple Watch. Meanwhile, the base features a pad for wireless earbuds. The 3-in-1 charging station comes with a 40W USB-C PD wall charger and a USB-C cable, so you won’t need to buy any additional accessories to start charging your devices.</span></li><li><span>Preorders for the upcoming <strong>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Trilogy</strong> 4K release are now live, with a prelaunch discount of $70 ($30 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Mutant-Turtles-Trilogy-Limited/dp/B0FMGKJTY8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. The trilogy includes the original live-action <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>, <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze</em>, and <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III</em>. The first <em>TMNT</em> movie from 1990 is still the best one 35 years later, with turtle costumes from Jim Henson’s Creature Shop that still hold up. I remember watching it as a kid and being completely terrified by the building fire fight scene.</span></li><li><span>The <strong>Samsung Music Frame</strong> is currently down to an all-time low price of $127.99 ($260 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Q-Symphony-Customizable-HW-LS60D-ZA/dp/B0CTKT886K/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1803388-REG%2Fsamsung_hw_ls60d_za_music_frame.html" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H Photo</a>. The 12.9 x 12.9-inch picture frame can connect to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi with support for surround sound when paired with one of Samsung’s new TVs or soundbars. It also boasts Dolby Atmos support for more immersive audio and a pair of woofers, tweeters, and midrange drivers. The Music Frame can be mounted on the wall or displayed on media furniture with a stand, and it can actually be customized with a physical photo, unlike the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573890/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-picture-frame-speaker-review">Sonos / Ikea Symfonisk frame speaker</a> from a few years back.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/776630/sony-inzone-buds-samsung-music-frame-deal-sale#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzE5"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandon Russell</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/776630/sony-inzone-buds-samsung-music-frame-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
