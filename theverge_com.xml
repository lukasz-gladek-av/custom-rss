Nintendo will host a 30-minute Direct showcase featuring games that will keep the vanilla Switch warm in the twilight of its last days as Nintendo’s premier console.</p><p>This direct won’t feature any news on the Switch 2 and therefore probably won’t have too many big reveals. Nintendo likely wants to save any big-time announcements for the Switch 2 direct next month. However, there are still a few unchecked boxes on fans’ Switch 1 wishlist like, say, remasters of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</em> and <em>Twilight Princess</em>, that could make an appearance. We’ll find out during the direct on March 27th at 10AM ET.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article"><div><p>Get into the groove.</p><p><em>Rhythm Heaven</em> <em>Groove</em> is filled with a bunch of silly-looking mini-games, where you’ll have to catch ingredients, crush cans, and flap your wings while keeping in time with the rhythm. It’s coming to the Switch in 2026, marking the first new <em><em>Rhythm</em> Heaven</em> game since 2015.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Who up questing with their dragons?</p><p>To start today’s Nintendo Switch Direct, Square Enix let us know what fans have already expected: its making an HD 2D remake of <em>Dragon Quest I</em> and <em>II</em>.

Nintendo unveiled a new trailer for the game that serves as an introduction of sorts, showcasing the alien world you’ll be exploring along with Samus’ various abilities, including new psychic powers that work both in combat and in puzzle solving. While no specific release date was announced, the game is due out in 2025 for the Switch.</p><p><em>Beyond</em> has been in development for a quite a while.

Notably, Nintendo says that “there will be no updates about Nintendo Switch 2 during this presentation.”</p><p>With the launch of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/629964/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review-nintendo-switch">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a></em> last week, there aren’t a lot of first-party games currently on the Switch calendar.
