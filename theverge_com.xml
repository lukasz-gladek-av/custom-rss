They include tweaks to the PS5’s liquid metal cooling design aimed to give the console “more stable” cooling. </p><p>The changes follow unproven claims that the liquid metal used in the first PS5 can leak and damage the console. Some sites even recommended against keeping the PS5 vertical after a repair shop owner and YouTuber was <a href="https://wololo.net/2023/01/05/youre-killing-your-ps5-by-using-it-vertically-due-to-a-design-flaw-by-sony-according-to-hardware-experts/">partially misquoted</a> by jailbreak site Wololo.net. Wololo <a href="https://wololo.net/2023/01/07/ps5-liquid-metal-issues-thecod3r-addresses-some-questions-in-new-video/">later followed up</a>, saying its original story contained a “critical misunderstanding” — ultimately, it doesn’t seem like this was ever a widespread issue.</p><p>Even so, Sony writes that it changed the design for the PS5 Pro, quoting Shinya Tsuchida, PS5 Pro Mechanical Design Lead:</p><div><blockquote><p>We spent quite some time conducting research on insulation when we were designing the original PS5. The basic structure remains the same in the PS5 Pro, but we made some improvements by adding fine grooves where the liquid metal is applied, so that the cooling effect is more stable. When we were doing research for the original PS5, we anticipated that semiconductors would continue to advance and become much denser, so we believed liquid metal technology would become crucial. It turns out we were right, and it was integral when designing the PS5 Pro.</p></blockquote></div><p>The rest of the blog post and its images may be familiar to you if you already saw <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/105278/ps5-pro-teardown-is-a-battery-hatch-this-years-hottest-repair-trend">iFixit’s teardown</a> of Sony’s very expensive console, in which it noted that the inside of the PS5 Pro contains more thermal management than electronics.</p><p>Some of that includes a larger cooling fan that the company says has redesigned fan blades, including “smaller blades in between” them. The blog also explains why it’s so hard to see the traces on the PS5 Pro’s motherboard: the board hides extra electrical layers beneath, to speed up memory access.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/652597/bethesda-oblivion-remaster-livestream-tomorrow<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Xbox has confirmed the <em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> remaster. After years worth of rumors, Bethesda has finally acknowledged that the<em> Oblivion</em> remaster is real. <a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1914341006188712023">In a post on social media</a>, Bethesda revealed a simple image featuring the roman number IV — alluding to the fact that <em>Oblivion</em> is the fourth in the<em> Elder Scrolls</em> series — and the date and time of April 22nd at 8AM PT. Of course this all means that tomorrow morning, Bethesda will reveal more about the remaster including, hopefully, a release date.</p><p>Rumors have been circulating about an <em>Oblivion</em> remaster since 2023. The first hints were revealed in documents related to the Federal Trade Commissions case against Microsoft where an <em>Oblivion</em> remaster was mentioned alongside several other planned games including what became <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>. Then, last week, images from the alleged remaster <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/648877/oblivion-remaster-images-leaked-microsoft">leaked on a developer’s website</a> before being swiftly taken down which all but confirmed the game’s existence.</p><p>Unless you count<em> Elder Scrolls Online</em> which released its eighth expansion just last year, there hasn’t been a new mainline entry in the <em>Elder Scrolls</em> series since <em>Skyri</em>m in 2011. (Unless you also count <em>Skyrim</em>’s many, <em>many</em> ports for each new console generation since its launch.) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17447808/elder-scrolls-6-announcement-reveal-bethesda-e3-2018"><em>Elder Scrolls VI</em> was announced in 2018</a> but since then, no word on its development. An <em>Oblivion</em> remaster then is perfectly timed to tide fans over while they wait for Todd Howard and the development gang to give them something, <em>anything</em>, on the new game.</p><p>You can watch the <em>Oblivion</em> remaster livestream tomorrow April 22nd at 8AM PT/ 11 AM ET on Bethesda’s <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Ed_E2crglcw?si=F_1LNlvlUwyBF_XS">YouTube</a> channel.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
