Both games also have “updated quality of life features for modern day gaming,” according to the Battle.net store page for the collection. While the third game is supported on Macs, the first two are PC-only.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->5</p><div><figcaption>Warcraft II: Remastered.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Blizzard</cite></p></div></div><p><em>Warcraft III: Reforged </em>2.0<em> </em>looks like the company’s attempt to make up for the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/warcraft-iii-reforged/">widely-panned</a> 2020 remaster, <em>Warcraft III: Reforged,</em> a game that was so hated that the company started offering a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/blizzard-is-offering-refunds-upon-request-for-warcraft-3-reforged/">no-questions-asked automated refund policy</a><em>. </em>Blizzard says it has updated environments and “fully customizable visuals,” as well as an option to play with the game’s original graphics at a higher resolution. </p><div><p>If you don’t want all three, you can get them individually. Blizzard charges $9.99 for <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/warcraft-1-remastered?p=1849794"><em>Warcraft I: Remastered</em></a><em>, </em>$14.99 for <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/warcraft-2-remastered?p=1849795"><em>Warcraft II: Remastered</em></a>, and $29.99 for <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/warcraft-3-reforged?p=44414"><em>Warcraft III: Reforged</em></a><em>.</em></p></div><p>In addition to the remasters, Blizzard also announced a January 2025 Hearthstone / StarCraft crossover called “Heroes of StarCraft”<em> </em>centered around <em>StarCraft. </em>(It’s no new <em>StarCraft </em>game, but at least Blizzard mentioned the series, I suppose). Blizzard is also updating <em>World Of Warcraft</em>, adding things like a new dungeon to the modern version, and a version of Mists of Pandaria for <em>WoW</em> Classic that resembles the expansion as it was in 2012. And <em>Warcraft Rumble</em> will launch in beta on PC on December 10th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
