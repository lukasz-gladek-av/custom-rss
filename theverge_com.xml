            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289844/microsoft-windows-on-arm-emulator-prism-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Microsoft is testing a big Windows on Arm update to let more x64 software and games run under Prism emulation on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186432/microsoft-windows-on-arm-qualcomm-copilot-plus-pcs-prism-emulator">Copilot Plus PC with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite</a> or X Plus processors. The capability comes as part of the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/11/06/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-27744-canary-channel/">Windows 11 Insider Preview&nbsp;Build 27744</a>, rolling out to testers in the Canary Channel.</p></div><p>This way, Qualcomm’s new chips can run more kinds of apps that don’t have native ARM64 versions and, until now, weren’t usable with emulation. It could even enable <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/new-windows-build-avx-on-sdxe">games that use AVX2, like <em>Starfield</em></a> and <em>Helldivers 2, </em>to work on Windows on Arm.</p><p>With this update, Microsoft’s emulator will open up support for 64-bit x86 software to use processor extensions like AVX, AVX2, BMI, FMA, and F16C. However, it says 32-bit software still won’t be able to detect the new emulator support, so some programs still might have trouble.</p><p>While many apps, including Photoshop, Hulu, and Chrome, already have native ARM64 versions for Windows, others require emulation, and some still won’t work at all. According to Microsoft, the new emulator is already enabled “in limited use” on retail PCs, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24214172/adobe-premiere-pro-is-available-on-snapdragon-x-elite-laptops">allowing Premiere Pro 25 to run on Arm</a> — after it was initially blocked — while Adobe works on a native version.</p><p><em><strong>Correction, November 6th: </strong>A previous version of the article incorrectly stated Blender needed to be emulated. It now has an ARM64 version.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289837/roblox-banning-preteens-social-hangout-spaces<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Roblox is going to block kids from accessing certain types of experiences following reports alleging that the platform has enabled child abuse.</p><p>One new measure will stop kids under 13 from accessing experiences with “certain types of interactive features,” Roblox says <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/updating-experience-guideline-policies-to-keep-our-younger-users-safe/3249079">in a post on its developer forum</a>. Those include “social hangouts,” where the primary purpose is to communicate with others over text or voice chat, and “free-form 2D user creation” experiences, where players can do things like draw on a chalkboard or whiteboard. This change goes into effect beginning November 18th.</p><p>Another change stops kids under 13 from playing, searching for, or being able to discover unrated experiences. This change goes into effect after December 3rd. If a creator wants to let a player under 13 access their game, they will have to complete a questionnaire and make sure that all of the information regarding their experience meets Roblox’s requirements for its current All Ages or 9 plus ratings. Roblox says it will start enforcing those requirements “next year.”</p><p>There have been multiple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24265145/roblox-hindenburg-reseach-dau-child-safety-short-seller-report">recent stories</a> about Roblox’ allegedly poor protections for children, including <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/?srnd=undefined">a <em>Bloomberg</em> article</a> titled “Roblox’s Pedophile Problem.” In October, the company announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277992/roblox-pre-teen-children-parent-accounts-default-settings">changes for pre-teen users</a> and a new type of account to let parents manage their kids on Roblox.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
