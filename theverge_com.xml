            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/21/24302238/timestop-d20-digital-watch-dnd-price-availability<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dice hoarding is a common hobby among <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> players, but I’m betting most won’t have a digital watch in their collection. Alongside displaying the time, day, and date, <a href="https://timestoptech.com/products/d-20-black-resin?variant=45891310125292">the Timestop D-20</a> includes all the dice-rolling features you need to play tabletop roleplaying games directly from your wrist at the push of a button.</p><p>The watch allows the wearer to digitally roll a 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, 12-, 20-, or 100-sided dice, alongside “Advanced Combat” features such as rolling up to 12 dice at once, and D20s with advantage or disadvantage (a fancy way of rolling two dice and taking either the higher or lower results). It’ll also display specific icons when a D20 rolls a 1 or a 20 — known as a “critical failure” or “critical success” respectively in D&amp;D.</p><p>“We wanted a fun animation while rolling, but also an overall subdued look so you could ‘take the game with you’ and even wear the watch at the office,” Timestop says in its <a href="https://timestoptech.com/blogs/super-twisted/dungeons-development-of-the-d-20-watch">blog describing the design process</a>. “We included day and date complications with a perpetual calendar so it was still a practical timepiece.”</p><p>Pricing starts at $99 and is available in three colors: <a href="https://timestoptech.com/collections/all">black, orange, and stainless steel</a>. Shipping starts next year, with stock available for delivery in either January or February.&nbsp;</p><p>One feature you won’t find on the Timestop D-20 is an alarm, because alarms “aren’t fun,” according to its creator. Otherwise, it’s water-resistant, features a backlit LCD display, and uses a replaceable coin cell battery that can last up to three years with “typical use.” I’m not sure how many fireball spells would be considered typical, but it certainly offers a more unique way to play than traditional dice or digital dice-rolling apps.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
