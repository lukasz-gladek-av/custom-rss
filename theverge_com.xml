Starting today, a select number of users will have the ability to play around in their <em>NMS</em> universe across a collection of platforms with the new cross-save functionality. According to the announcement, adding cross-saving was a bit of an undertaking for the development team.</p><p>“It’s very common for players to rack up thousands of hours of saves,” <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/11/cross-save-ps5-pro-normandy/">the announcement reads</a>. “Adding&nbsp;cross-save&nbsp;for us is a little bit like moving house, the longer people have lived there the more complicated it is to move them.”</p><p><em>No Man’s Sky</em> now supports cross-saves across PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Series S/X, Xbox Game Pass, PC, Steam Deck, PSVR 1 / 2, PCVR, GOG, and Nintendo Switch. Players can <a href="https://cloud.nomanssky.com/cross-save">visit this site</a> to link their different platform accounts and read the cross-save FAQ. However, only a select few players will be able to play their saves across different platforms with Hello Games rolling out the functionality to more players in the coming days.</p><p>November 7th is known in the BioWare fandom as N7 Day (get it, <strong>N</strong>ovember <strong>7</strong>th) — a semi-official community holiday celebrating all things <em>Mass Effect</em>. In 2021, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22446499/no-mans-sky-mass-effect-normandy-starship">Hello Games introduced <em>Mass Effect</em>’s famous starship</a>, the SSV Normandy SR-1 as a collectible ship. For this year’s N7 Day, the Normandy is back for players to claim for a limited time.</p><p>In addition to cross-saves and cool ships, to coincide with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">the launch of the PS5 Pro</a>, <em>No Man’s Sky</em> is also getting an enhanced version compatible with the souped up console. Updated features include 4K resolution at 60fps, support for 8K resolution at 30fps, and improved lighting. </p><p>All three updates are available now and are completely free.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
