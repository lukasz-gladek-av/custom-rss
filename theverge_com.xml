He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, the long-awaited sequel to <em>Hollow Knight</em>, has a new release year window: 2025, as revealed in a very brief clip during today’s Nintendo Switch 2 Direct.</p><p><em>Silksong</em> was first announced for Windows, Mac, Linux, and the Nintendo Switch in 2019. It was originally intended to be DLC for <em>Hollow Knight</em>, but <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/hollow-knight-silksong-revealed">according to developers Team Cherry</a>, “it quickly became too large and too unique to stay a DLC, as initially planned.” The game will take place in a new kingdom, with new moves and new weapons at your disposal as well as new enemies to take on.</p><p>Nintendo featured gameplay of <em>Silksong</em> during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8lvHT_IQbM">a broadcast at E3 2019</a>. But since then, there have only been a few substantial updates about the game. Xbox showed a new trailer for it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/12/22175400/hollow-knight-silksong-sequel-xbox-game-pass-trailer">in June 2022</a> and said it would be available within 12 months. The game was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/9/23717855/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed">delayed shortly before that deadline</a>. The game was announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/16/23356667/hollow-knight-silksong-playstation-ps5-ps4-still-no-release-date">for PlayStation, too</a>. And in January, Matthew Griffin, who works on marketing and publishing for <em>Silksong</em>, <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1880523110816051696">stated that</a> “the game is real, progressing and will release.”</p><div><p>Now that the game has a release window, it might almost be time to <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hollow-knight-silksong-fans-in-clown-makeup">take off our clown makeup</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo says they will have “clearer image quality” and higher resolution than the original releases.</p><p>Nintendo also promised that games like <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>, <em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</em>, <em>Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</em>, <em>Super Mario Strikers</em>, <em>Chibi-Robo! Plug Into Adventure</em>, <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em>, and <em>Pokémon Colosseum</em> will be available on the service.</p><p>The GameCube game library will launch on the same day as the Switch 2, June 5th, and will be available as part of the Nintendo Switch Online: Expansion Pack.</p><p>Since its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17874798/nintendo-switch-online-launch-subscription">launch in 2018</a>, Nintendo’s slowly built up its online subscription service by offering games from console generations past, alongside other neat features. In addition to enabling cloud saves and online play, the base service offers players access to games from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/17/18185533/nintendo-switch-online-classic-nes-games-blaster-master-zelda-2">the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries</a>, along with the recently added <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284073/nintendo-music-streaming-app-switch-online-subscribers">Nintendo Music app</a>. The more expensive Expansion Pack subscription adds games from the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591722/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-advance-games-expansion-pack">Game Boy Advance</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688780/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-64-sega-genesis-controllers">Nintendo 64, and Sega Genesis</a>, plus DLC from <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, <em>Animal Crossing</em>, and <em>Splatoon 3</em>.</p><div><p>Before this addition, GameCube games weren’t totally absent from the Switch. Nintendo has remastered or ported a handful of games to the system over the years, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/9/23592822/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-best-way-classic"><em>Metroid Prime </em>and<em> Metroid Prime 2</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/14/23873435/nintendo-switch-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-trailer"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438499/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Sunshine</em></a> (before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307522/mario-limited-time-nintendo-switch-disney-vault">yanking the collection that contained <em>Sunshine</em> from stores</a>).</p></div><p>Last year, Nintendo conducted a secretive online playtest that was initially thought to be for GameCube games with online multiplayer features. That test <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275596/nintendo-switch-online-beta-playtest-program-leak-mmo">was actually for an MMO</a>, but at least Nintendo was a little late in adding GameCube games, rather than never doing it at all.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

His coverage areas include audio (Sonos, Apple, Bose, Sony, etc.), home theater, smartphones, photography, and more.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>During its Switch 2 event today, Nintendo confirmed that both <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> will be offered as enhanced “Switch 2 Edition” titles. The critically acclaimed games will feature “enhanced resolution and frame rates” and HDR support. Nintendo didn’t go into specifics on those upgrades, but the titles were running at a perfectly smooth 60fps during the stream.</p><p>Both titles pushed the original Switch hardware to its limits with occasional frame rate drops, so if Nintendo is able to deliver buttery-smooth gameplay on the new console, many early buyers will be happy to replay these classics.</p><p>The company also demonstrated a new second-screen experience in its Nintendo Switch app for Android and iOS. A “Zelda’s Notes” feature will be able to show your location on a map in the massive world of either game, and it can help guide you to shrines and koroks that you haven’t yet discovered. “It’s a game-specific service that’s exclusive to the Switch 2 Editions of these titles,” the company said.</p><p>If you already own the original games, the upgrades will be available as separate purchases or at no additional cost if you have a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch Online app will be renamed to a simpler “Nintendo Switch” at the end of May, Nintendo confirmed during the stream.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Now that Nintendo has finally given us the rundown on the Switch 2, we can finally answer one of the biggest questions we had about the new console: “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637523/nintendo-today-switch-2-c-button-leak">what’s the deal with that ‘C’ button?</a>”</p><p>The button, present on the right Joy-Con directly below the home button, is square and marked with a “C.” The mysterious new button was shown briefly in the video debuting the Switch back in February and was present in every mock-up and leak of the console. In the Switch 2 Direct, Nintendo finally revealed the purpose of the button, a new feature called GameChat.</p><p>As its name implies, GameChat enables Switch 2 players to communicate using the console’s built-in microphone. Nintendo noted how the Switch 2’s microphone will feature background noise filtering to ensure that GameChat calls come through clearly. And in addition to giving people a way to talk directly to one another, GameChat also features screen sharing functionality that will allow you to broadcast your gaming to friends on group calls. Notably, you will <em>not</em> have to be playing the same game while using GameChat, meaning that people within a call will be able to play and screen-share different titles simultaneously.</p><p>In a press release, Nintendo announced parents looking to monitor their children’s use of GameChat will be able to enable or disable the feature through the Nintendo Switch Parental Control smartphone app.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch Online smart device app*** will be soon renamed to the Nintendo Switch app. It’ll continue to offer voice chat when playing supported titles on a Nintendo Switch system, as well as game-specific services for titles such as Splatoon™ 3 and Animal Crossing™: New Horizons. On Nintendo Switch 2, you can enjoy chatting with friends with GameChat while playing Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games or compatible Nintendo Switch games (app not required).<br>The updated app will also include ZELDA NOTES, a new game-specific service that supports players on their adventures in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition.</p><p>The GameChat feature represents a major step forward in Nintendo’s social gaming offerings. Of the three major manufacturers, Nintendo was the only one that did not have a way for players to communicate with their friends via the console. Shortly after the launch of the original Switch, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/18/15995098/nintendo-switch-online-app-out-now-ios-android">Nintendo released a mobile app</a> that let users participate in voice chat for select games, but it’s awkward to use an app for a feature that comes standard in other consoles.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
