He joined in 2018, and served as commerce editor at Polygon until May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you’ve been wanting to grab a subscription to Nvidia’s GeForce Now cloud game streaming service, now’s a good time to commit. That’s because six-month subs to its mid-tier Performance subscription — which offers ad-free 1440p gameplay, short queue times, plus ray-tracing on supported games — is 40 percent off. Instead of $49.99, you’ll pay <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce-now%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3D%252449.99%2520%2F%25206%2520months%2520after%2520promotion" rel="sponsored">$29.99</a>, a reasonable price if you don’t have a gaming PC, or just want a reliable way to play many (but <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce-now%2Fgames%2F" rel="sponsored">maybe not all</a>) of your Steam, Epic Games Store, and other titles away from your PC.</p><p>Each tier of GeForce Now offers different session lengths; the Performance tier caps you at six hours of playtime before freeing up your virtual machine for another player. However, you can simply start a new session immediately after. This deal will be active through July 6th, and after your six months are up, you’ll be charged the full price unless you cancel beforehand.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->30</span></p><div><p>GeForce Now is a cloud game streaming app that’s accessible from your browser, as well as on some TVs, set-top boxes, phones, tablets, handhelds, and soon, the Steam Deck. It also works with the Apple Vision Pro and the Meta Quest 3.</p></div></div><p>This discount comes at an especially opportune time for Steam Deck owners, as the official GeForce Now should be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337977/nvidia-native-geforce-now-app-steam-deck-vr">launching soon for Valve’s handheld</a>, although an exact date hasn’t been publicly confirmed. Now, it might seem kind of redundant to play Steam games via the cloud when you can simply load them onto a Steam Deck’s storage, but Nvidia’s virtual machines are more powerful. You’ll be gaining visual fidelity not possible on the Deck, but adding some input latency — a given with any and all cloud game streaming services.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/672451/tamagotchi-paradise-virtual-pet<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There are still plenty of Tamagotchi devices that have you focusing on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/27/24352864/bandais-new-star-wars-tamagotchi-makes-you-responsible-for-raising-vader">raising just a single digital character</a>, but the new <a href="https://tamagotchi-official.com/us/series/paradise/">Tamagotchi Paradise</a> puts you in charge of a planet full of needy dependents. To make it a little easier to navigate its digital world, the device includes a full color screen and complements its three button controls with a dial on the side for zooming from a view of the entire planet right down to the cellular level of your virtual pets.</p><p>Launching in Japan first on July 12th, 2025, for $45, the Tamagotchi Paradise experience starts with you hatching an entire planet in an event called the Egg Bang. From there you can zoom in on your world to one of three different unique ecosystems called Tama Fields that include land, water, and sky. Which ecosystem you start with is dependent on which of three colored versions of the Tamagotchi Paradise you buy, but you’ll eventually be able to unlock all three Tama Fields as you play.</p><p>Each Tama Field will affect how the Tamagotchi characters grow and evolve through unique activities and foods. The game includes over 50 different Tamagotchis separated into 12 different species that can be raised from eggs, but Tamagotchi Paradise expands that with a breeding mechanic so two compatible characters can create new Tamagotchi with 50,000 possible combinations available. Two Tamagotch Paradise devices can also be physically connected, letting characters from each interact to potentially start a family or become foes that prank each other and even get in fights.</p><p>If caring for a planet full of virtual pets isn’t hard enough, the device’s dial even lets you zoom in on Tamagotchis to the cellular level, which is how you care for and cure them when they get sick. It sounds exhausting, but unlike kids, dogs, or cats, if the responsibilities become overwhelming, you can simply pop out the device’s AAA batteries for some respite.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
