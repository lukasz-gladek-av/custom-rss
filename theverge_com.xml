Next year, instead of a new game, the company will opt to release a paid expansion for <em>F1 25</em> as part of “a strategic reset for the F1 Franchise,” <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/f1/f1-25/news/f1-franchise-announcement">EA says</a>. The next full <em>F1</em> game, a “reimagined” experience, will arrive in 2027.</p><p>The 2026 DLC for <em>F1 25</em> is a “premium content update” that will “align with the sport’s major changes for the 2026 season, bringing fans new cars, sporting regulations, teams, and drivers,” <a href="https://news.ea.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/EA-SPORTS-Announces-Plans-for-Future-EA-SPORTS-F1-Experiences-Including-2026-FIA-Formula-One-World-Championship-Season-Expansion--All-New-F1-Game-in-2027/default.aspx">according to EA’s press release</a>. (F1 cars are in for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24173356/f1-2026-tech-changes-explained">some major changes next year</a> that the DLC will presumably need to account for.) Timing and pricing for the expansion will be announced sometime in 2026.</p><p>EA is vague on specific details about its plans for the 2027 game, but says it will be “a deeply authentic and innovative representation of the action and thrill of Formula 1, reimagined into a more expansive experience with new ways to play for fans around the world.” It’s described as “part of a multi-year strategic investment in the EA Sports F1 franchise, with support from both Formula One Management and the F1 teams.”</p><p>Apple is betting big on F1, too, signing a major multi-year deal to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/801597/apple-tv-f1-exclusive-sports-racing-streaming">stream F1 races on Apple TV</a> in the US starting next year.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/823675/ea-f1-25-2026-2027-dlc-expansion-update-game]]></content:encoded>
