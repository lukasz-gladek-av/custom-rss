(I hope the whole main cast returns because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/18/23879408/baldurs-gate-3-cast-dnd-high-rollers-one-shot">they’re all so great</a>.)</p><p>It’s unclear when this new <em>Baldur’s Gate</em> series might debut. Larian isn’t involved in the series, <a href="https://x.com/i/timeline">Geoff Keighley reports</a>.</p><p>“After putting nearly 1000 hours into the incredible world of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, it is a dream come true to be able to continue the story that Larian and Wizards of The Coast created,” Mazin said to <em>Deadline</em>. “I am a devoted fan of D&amp;D and the brilliant way that Swen Vincke and his gifted team adapted it.” (Mazin has even completed the game in its super-hard <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/30/23982661/baldurs-gate-3-patch-5-details">Honour Mode</a>, the article says.)</p><p>Mazin is also still working on the third season of <em>The Last of Us</em>, which <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/hbo-casey-bloys-the-pitt-heated-rivalry-euphoria-interview-1236700801/">may be its last</a>. The show’s other co-creator, Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann, announced last year that he would be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696939/the-last-of-us-co-creator-neil-druckmann-is-stepping-back">stepping away from the series</a> to focus on the studio’s games.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/874682/hbo-baldurs-gate-3-tv-show-craig-mazin]]></content:encoded>

As noted in its <a href="https://ir.roblox.com/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-2025-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">2025 year-end earnings report</a>, 45 percent of Roblox’s daily active users have completed an age check as of January 31st. Of those who have verified their age, 27 percent are adults. Roblox also reported that this age category is spending more money on its platform than users under 18.</p><p>Roblox is planning to try to pull in more adult players by expanding certain “high-fidelity” genres on its platform, as the earnings report notes: “We are prioritizing some of the largest and highest-monetizing genres in the gaming market—e.g. Shooters, RPGs, and Sports &amp; Racing.” Roblox is also putting more emphasis on performance and graphics quality as part of its push to attract older audiences.</p><div><p>The shift toward players over 18 follows a wave of lawsuits over child safety on Roblox, including in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/816549/texas-roblox-lawsuit-child-safety">Texas</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/793711/another-state-is-suing-roblox">Kentucky</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760162/roblox-louisiana-lawsuit-child-predators-safety">Louisiana</a>. In addition to age checks, Roblox has rolled out a number of changes intended to improve kids’ safety on its platform, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760805/roblox-sexual-content-lawsuit-age-verification">age-gated content</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/731010/roblox-is-introducing-a-new-label-for-experiences-focusing-on-sensitive-issues">content labels</a>, an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770305/roblox-esrb-age-ratings-iarc-age-estimation">experiences rating system</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641167/roblox-parental-controls-block-friends-experiences">more parental controls</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/874675/roblox-earnings-q4-2025-increasing-adult-players]]></content:encoded>
