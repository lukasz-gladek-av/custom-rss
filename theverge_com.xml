Though the company didn’t share any card art, it says that the game will feature “strategic and tactical” battles between two players using decks featuring their favorite Pals like Blazamut, Celaray, and Grizzbolt.</p><div><p>The <em>Palworld </em>TCG will be debuting right in the thick of The Pokémon Company’s 30 year anniversary multimedia blitz, which will naturally include <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-tcg/product-gallery/pokemon-day-2026-collection">special sets of <em>Pokémon </em>cards</a>.
