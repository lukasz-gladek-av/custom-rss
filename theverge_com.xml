            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>If you’re looking for a webcam that works with the Nintendo Switch 2’s new GameChat mode that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/video/685229/nintendo-switch-2-gamechat-c-button-mario-kart">lets you video chat with friends and see their faces within games</a>, it looks like the biggest brand in PC accessories is still your best bet.</p></div><p>Logitech is the first webcam maker to confirm to <em>The Verge</em> that the vast majority of its cameras work — all of them, in fact, save for the high-end Logitech Brio 4K.</p><p>“All of our webcams except Brio 4K work out of the box with Switch 2,” Logitech spokesperson Leila Lewis definitively tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>When the Nintendo Switch 2 launched three weeks ago, webcam manufacturers had no idea which cameras would be compatible with the new Switch, and some of the best-reviewed cameras simply didn’t work. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682008/which-webcams-work-with-nintendo-switch-2">It was a weird mystery, a wild west</a>, and webcam makers had to figure it out on their own.</p><p>Many didn’t even have a Switch 2 to test with, my sources tell me, and had to compete with consumers to buy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">the fastest-selling game console of all time</a>. Nor did Nintendo provide compatibility guidelines, it seems, as manufacturers like Elgato and Ugreen had to reverse-engineer why their seemingly compatible cameras weren’t showing up when they plugged them in.</p><p>But that mystery now seems to be solved — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/693182/nintendo-switch-2-webcam-mystery-1080p-480p-uvc-iso-bulk-ugreen-elgato">the answers are not what we expected</a>! — and manufacturers are now seemingly free to update any of their firmware-updatable webcams and make them compatible with the new Switch.</p><p>Logitech doesn’t seem to be promising an update for the Brio 4K. “Brio 4K is built with the security features of Windows Hello that are not supported on the Switch 2 anyway,” Lewis tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>But again, all its other webcams reportedly work — which won’t be all that surprising to anyone who’s been following the webcam saga. When Nintendo and webcam makers weren’t originally able to provide lists of working webcams, Redditors <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l5mgn0/tested_usb_cameras_with_switch_2_master_list/">crowdsourced their own list,</a> which includes far more working webcams from Logitech than any other manufacturer.</p><p>A few Redditors say you can even get the Brio 4K working if you want, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1lflhz6/logitech_brio_4k_webcam_working_on_switch_2/">with a firmware downgrade</a>. Do that at your own risk, though.</p><p>So far, Elgato and Ugreen have committed to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/693182/nintendo-switch-2-webcam-mystery-1080p-480p-uvc-iso-bulk-ugreen-elgato#:~:text=USB%20transfer%20mode-,Ugreen%20says,-its%20CM826%20/%2055512">upgrading specific cameras</a> to work with the Nintendo Switch 2. Obsbot has generically confirmed it will do some sort of firmware updates, and Insta360 is still looking into it. Anker is non-committal.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/694565/logitech-webcams-work-with-nintendo-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Gaming laptops come in various shapes and sizes, though many of the heavy hitters remain thick and beefy machines that maximize cooling to get the most out of their powerful chips. Most are awash in RGB lighting and edgy designs geared towards capital-G Gamers, but there are also thinner, lighter options that are more portable and less showy. </p><p>Our go-to recommendation that checks the boxes for most people is, and has been for a while, the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14. It’s a gaming laptop that doesn’t forget the “laptop” part. The G14 is a versatile machine for both play and work, and it travels exceptionally well.</p><p>Other great, though pricey, recommendations include the big and heavy Asus ROG Strix Scar and Lenovo Legion Pro 7i, or the Razer Blade 16 for lots of graphics power in a thin and sleek design.</p><p>The most important part of any gaming laptop, just like desktop PCs, is the graphics card. Laptop GPUs can’t stack up to full-size cards that reach much higher wattage in desktops, but that doesn’t stop the likes of Nvidia from making things a little confusing with the naming scheme on its RTX brand of GeForce cards. So keep in mind that, for example, an RTX 5090 laptop card doesn’t come anywhere near the performance of a desktop 5090. Desktops may always win out in raw performance, but gaming laptops are a simpler turnkey solution that can easily go places (yes, even the ones that feel like you’re toting around a cinderblock). </p><p>Even more confusing: the same GPU in one laptop may not perform as well in another if it’s throttled by thermal constraints. We try to test a wide range of gaming laptops, as well as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops">regular laptops</a>, and these are the ones we confidently recommend.</p><div><h2>What we’re looking for</h2><section><p>Our gaming laptop testing involves a mix of synthetic benchmarks and experiential testing (playing a bunch of graphically-intensive games). We run benchmark tests like Geekbench, Cinebench, and 3DMark; as well as in-game ones from titles such as Cyberpunk 2077 and Black Myth: Wukong. We also use the laptops in our day-to-day work to see how they fare with multitasking productivity apps and real-world battery life.</p></section><section><p>A gaming laptop is a pricey purchase, but we want to ensure you’re getting a good, capable machine for the money. If it has a super-high cost, it should offer something special.</p></section><section><p>Some people may be fine with a baseline of 30 frames per second, but we expect a gaming laptop to achieve a smoother 60 fps, or much higher, at high resolutions. </p></section><section><p>The higher the resolution and higher the refresh rate, the better. Games look their best when they’re crisply sharp and buttery smooth, as long as the laptop’s chips are up to the task.</p></section><section><p>Gaming laptops usually range from having a handful of ports to being littered with lots of I/O for external monitors, a mouse, keyboard, and other accessories. A thinner, more portable model may not have as many ports as a giant desktop replacement, but it should still offer much more than something like a MacBook.</p></section><section><p>Some gaming laptops still start with a 512GB SSD, but with how big modern games can be, you really want 1TB or more. Thankfully, most have user-replaceable drives, so you’re not limited to what’s configured from the factory. Some even have extra M.2 slots, so adding storage is easy.</p></section></div><div><nav><h2>In this article</h2><ul><li><a href="#yzdsDK">The best gaming laptop</a></li><li><a href="#u4ab2G">The most powerful gaming laptop</a></li><li><a href="#the-best-mid-to-high-tier-gaming-laptops-for-most-people">The best mid-to-high-tier gaming laptops for most people</a></li><li><a href="#csm3NI">The best budget gaming laptop</a></li><li><a href="#VRjKsk">A sleek 16-inch gaming laptop</a></li><li><a href="#63PrM1">The best convertible gaming laptop</a></li></ul></nav></div><div><p id="yzdsDK"><h2>The best gaming laptop</h2></p></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->1800</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Balanced performance, battery life, and portability</li><li>OLED display</li><li>Programmable LED strip on the lid</li><li>Great keyboard and smooth trackpad</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Gets a bit hot and loud under load</li><li>Soldered RAM</li><li>Thermally throttles its GPUs</li></ul></div></div></div><p><em><em><strong><sub><em>CPU:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> AMD Ryzen 9 270, HX 370 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>GPU:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060, RTX 5070, RTX 5070 Ti, RTX 5080 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>RAM:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 16GB, 32GB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Storage:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 1TB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Display:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 14-inch OLED, 2880 x 1800, 120Hz, 500 nits / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Dimensions: </em></sub></strong><em><sub>12.24 x 8.66 x 0.63 to 0.64 inches / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Battery</em></sub></strong><em><sub>: 73Whr / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Weight:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 3.31 pounds</sub></em></em></em></p><p>Asus’s ROG Zephyrus G14 has been a favorite among <em>Verge</em> staffers for years now, and it remains our go-to pick for its balance of power and portability. It can be your full-time gaming machine as well as your commuter-friendly everyday laptop. Asus <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155889/razer-blade-14-2024-asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-comparison">redesigned it in 2024</a> and toned down its more playful aesthetics for a sleeker, refined look, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338219/blink-and-youll-miss-these-zenbook-duo-and-rog-zephyrus-updates">for 2025</a> it just got a modest chip bump with RTX 50-series graphics and the ability to charge via USB-C on either side (but you still need to use its proprietary charger for max wattage). </p><p>It now starts at $1,799.99 instead of $1,699.99. But you get a little more for your extra money since even the base Zephyrus G14 comes with a lovely, high-res OLED display capable of a 120Hz refresh rate, and it still has a great keyboard and trackpad. Games play well on high settings, though due to the thin chassis, the G14 — and even its 16-inch sibling, the Zephyrus G16 — are known to get a little hot to the touch, and their fans are quite noisy.</p><p>Zephyrus laptops are never going to offer quite the same performance as much thicker models, like the Asus ROG Strix or other chunkers running equivalent GPUs — they just don’t have as much thermal headroom. But if you want a jack-of-all-trades notebook that puts gaming at the forefront, the G14 (or G16, if you want to go bigger and have the budget) is unlikely to steer you wrong.</p><div><p id="u4ab2G"><h2>The most powerful gaming laptop</h2></p></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->4800</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Top-tier gaming performance in a laptop</li><li>4K Mini LED screen is massive, looks great, and gets very bright</li><li>Mechanical keyboard is loud but feels awesome to type on</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Astronomically expensive</li><li>Battery drains very fast, even during regular tasks</li><li>Fans get loud</li><li>120Hz refresh is half the speed of cheaper laptops with 2.5K OLEDs</li></ul></div></div></div><p><em><em><strong><sub><em>CPU:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> Intel Core Ultra 9 285HX / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>GPU: </em></sub></strong><em><sub>Nvidia Geforce RTX 5080, RTX 5090 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>RAM:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 64GB, 96GB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Storage:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 2TB, 6TB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Display:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 18-inch Mini LED 4K (3840 x 2400), 120Hz display, 1,000 nits, 100 percent DCI-P3 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Dimensions:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 15.9 x 12.08 x 1.26 inches / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Battery:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 99.9Whr / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Weight:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 7.93 pounds</sub></em></em></em></p><p>The MSI Titan is your pick if budget isn’t a concern. It <em>starts</em> at a ridiculous $4,799.99 with Intel’s flagship Core Ultra 9 285HX CPU and Nvidia’s second-highest GPU, the RTX 5080. The RTX 5090 configuration costs $5,799.99 or more with expanded storage and RAM. The Titan pairs these flagship chips with a massive 18-inch 4K / 120Hz Mini LED screen that gets incredibly bright, along with 64GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD.</p><p>It’s loaded with RGB (including an illuminated haptic trackpad), a mechanical keyboard by SteelSeries, five USB ports (two of which are Thunderbolt 5), and a four-speaker / dual-woofer sound setup. It can tackle most games you throw at it on ultra settings. The screen may not be as fast as other laptops with 2.5K / 240Hz panels, but 4K at 18 inches looks so crisp. You have to pay out the nose for this no-holds-barred experience, but the nearly eight-pound behemoth is about as powerful as laptops get right now.</p><p>In the past, our choice for this tier of laptop was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23840504/asus-rog-strix-scar-x3d-gaming-laptop-price-review">Asus’s ROG Strix Scar 17</a> using one of AMD’s X3D chips. That model was especially unique since it was significantly cheaper (under $4,000). Perhaps the <a href="https://us-store.msi.com/Laptops/Gaming-Series/Raider-GE-Series/msi-Raider-A18-HX-A9WJG-052US">18-inch MSI Raider</a> with the Ryzen 9 9955HX3D and RTX 5090 could sway me away from the Titan, but we’ll have to try it out first. (At $5,099.99, the Raider isn’t exactly a budget pick either.)</p><div><p id="the-best-mid-to-high-tier-gaming-laptops-for-most-people"><h2><strong>The best mid-to-high-tier gaming laptops for most people</strong></h2></p></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->3200</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Great graphics performance in the latest high-end games</li><li>Lots of ports and easy access to RAM / SSDs</li><li>Animated lid and wraparound RGB are fun</li><li>Very good QHD / 240Hz Mini LED screen</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Typical gaming laptop issues (pricey, hefty, and not great battery life)</li><li>Competition offers OLED screens</li><li>Customizing lid animations is a pain</li></ul></div></div></div><p><strong><sub><em>CPU:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>GPU: </em></sub></strong><em><sub>Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>RAM:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 32GB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Storage:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 2TB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Display:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 16-inch Mini LED 2560 x 1600, 240Hz display / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Dimensions:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 13.94 x 10.55 x 0.9 to 1.21 inches / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Battery:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 90Whr </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Weight:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 6.17 pounds</sub></em></p><p>You don’t have to spend Titan money to land somewhere in the ballpark of excellent gaming performance. There are a few great options in the mid-to-high tier of gaming laptops, sporting RTX 5080 graphics (or the RTX 5070 Ti if you need to save a bit more). My top pick is the Asus ROG Strix Scar 16, followed closely by the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->2970</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Great performance at 2.5K and even at 4K on an external monitor</li><li>Beautiful OLED screen</li><li>One of the best keyboards in this class of gaming laptops</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>No face or fingerprint unlock</li><li>Numpad makes things slightly cramped, with off-center trackpad</li><li>Lenovo’s apps are slightly more invasive with notifications than others</li></ul></div></div></div><p>The <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-rog-strix-scar-16-16-2-5k-240hz-gaming-laptop-intel-core-ultra-9-hx-32gb-ram-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-2tb-ssd-off-black%2F6632087.p%3FskuId%3D6632087" rel="sponsored">16-inch ROG Strix Scar</a> is decked out with a wraparound RGB light bar that creates a colorful underglow and a dot-matrix LED lid for adorning fun illuminated animations. The Strix Scar’s game performance is exceptional, with its RTX 5080 nearly matching the 5090 in the much thinner <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/649577/razer-blade-16-2025-rtx-5090-review">Razer Blade 16</a> — and for $1,200 less.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/legion-laptops/legion-pro-series/legion-pro-7i-gen-10-16-inch-intel/len101g0039">Lenovo Legion Pro 7i</a> is a similarly specced 16-incher, offering the same CPU and GPU in a better, metallic build. It’s got its share of RGB lighting, but it’s done a little more tastefully than the Asus. Meanwhile, the Strix Scar’s 2.5K / 240Hz screen is a Mini LED display that’s bright, colorful, and visually pleasing. It matches the resolution and refresh rate of the OLED on Lenovo’s Legion Pro 7i, but the OLED on the Lenovo is even better, with a punchier look.</p><p>It’s a bit of a toss-up between these two: the Lenovo has the better screen and build quality, yet it lacks face or fingerprint unlocking. But the Asus is $200 cheaper, and I prefer the trackpad and better key spacing of its numpad-less design. You can’t go wrong here, so picking one based on small nuances like that or just whatever you can get a deal on is fair. (The Lenovo has dipped to as low as $3,099 at retailers like <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1875949-REG%2Flenovo_83f50052us_16_legion_pro_7.html%2Fspecs" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H Photo</a>, and a savings of $400 is significant.)</p><div><p id="csm3NI"><h2>The best budget gaming laptop</h2></p></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->850</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Good pricing</li><li>AMD or Intel CPU options</li><li>RTX 4050 is fine for 1080p gaming</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>16:9 aspect ratio is outdated</li><li>Not a ton of ports, and only one of them is USB-C</li></ul></div></div></div><p><em><em><strong><sub><em>CPU:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> AMD Ryzen 7 7445HS, Intel Core i5-13420H / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>GPU: </em></sub></strong><em><sub>Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>RAM:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 16GB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Storage:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 512GB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Display:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 15.6-inch IPS, 1920 x 1080, 144Hz, no touch option / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Dimensions:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 14.09 x 10.04 x 0.93 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Battery</em></sub></strong><em><sub>: 70Wh </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Weight:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 5.06 pounds</sub></em></em></em></p><p>Our previous pick among budget gaming laptops was the HP Victus 15 with an RTX 3050 GPU, which cost around $800 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23438982/hp-victus-15-gaming-laptop-review-specs-price">in 2022</a> when it wasn’t on a steep sale for less. It had a 60Hz screen and just 8GB of RAM, which feels a little paltry for gaming on Windows 11 in 2025. Now, you can get the same chassis with a 1080p / 144Hz screen, a newer RTX 4050 GPU, and either AMD Ryzen 7 7000-series or Intel 13th-Gen CPU for around $850 to $900.</p><p>Nvidia has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692045/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5050-desktop-laptop-gpu-gddr6-gddr7">recently announced its RTX 5050</a> laptop GPU, which is set to slowly trickle out into new laptops for about $999. We’ll have to see how that stacks up in future testing.</p><p>The Victus isn’t going to wow you with the best screen or highest-quality components for a keyboard or trackpad, but it does emphasize a solid graphics card in an affordable package. It’s the kind of laptop that will excel with live service games like <em>Minecraft</em> or <em>Fortnite</em>, as well as indie titles. Just don’t expect high or ultra settings on the latest AAA games. With the right expectations, a more inexpensive gaming laptop like the Victus can treat you well.</p><div><p id="VRjKsk"><h2>A sleek 16-inch gaming laptop</h2></p></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->4900</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Great fit, finish, and build</li><li>Slim and sleek design for a gaming laptop</li><li>Excellent OLED screen comes standard</li><li>Very good performance, especially in DLSS 4 supported games</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Starts expensive and gets expensive-er</li><li>Middling battery life</li><li>Thinness aside, minimal improvements over last year’s model</li><li>A cheaper 5080 laptop may be money better spent</li><li>The matte black finish smudges easily, and the Razer lid logo is still a little cringe</li></ul></div></div></div><p><em><em><strong><sub><em>CPU:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> AMD Ryzen AI 9 365, Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>GPU: </em></sub></strong><em><sub>Nvidia Geforce RTX 5060, 5070, RTX 5070 Ti, RTX 5080, RTX 5090 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>RAM:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 16GB, 32GB, 64GB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Storage:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 1TB, 2TB, 4TB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Display:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 16-inch OLED, 2560 x 1600, 240Hz / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Dimensions:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 13.98 x 9.86 x 0.59 to 0.69 inches / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Battery</em></sub></strong><em><sub>: 90Wh / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Weight:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 4.71 pounds</sub></em></em></em></p><p>The Razer Blade 16 has long been touted as the MacBook Pro for gamers, and after thickening up for a few years, it’s back to an ultra-thin chassis without much compromise to performance. It’s flush with ports, has a great keyboard and massive trackpad, and its AMD chips can be paired with a variety of Nvidia GeForce RTX GPU — ranging from the 5060 for $2,399.99 to the top-tier 5090 for a much steeper $4,499.99.</p><p>The Blade sports a lovely 16-inch OLED display with 2560 x 1600 resolution and 240Hz refresh, even for the entry-level configuration. The look of its stealthy matte black design and green Razer logo may not be to everyone’s liking, but pair that with its thinness, and you’ve got something that can travel and blend in almost anywhere.</p><p>I tested the RTX 5090 version in our review, and while it’s impressive, it can be a little hard to justify spending $4,500 without getting the maximum capabilities of that flagship GPU, since the Blade 16’s thinness throttles the 5090. But it’s such a nice overall package if you want your gaming laptop to do it all.

Now, the $3 billion startup is setting its sights on the gaming industry.</p></div><p>This week, I was granted access to a new interactive gaming experience that Runway <a href="https://play.runwayml.com/">plans to make available</a> to everyone as soon as next week, according to CEO Cristóbal Valenzuela. The consumer-facing product is currently quite barebones, with a chat interface that supports only text and image generation, but Valenzuela says that generated video games are coming later this year. He says that Runway is also in talks with gaming companies about both using its technology and accessing their datasets for training.</p><p>Based on his recent conversations, Valenzuela believes the gaming industry is in a similar position to Hollywood when it was first introduced to generative AI. There was considerable resistance, but over time, AI has been gradually adopted in more areas of the production process. Valenzuela says Amazon’s recent show, <em>House of David</em>, was made in part with Runway’s technology, and that his company is working with “pretty much every major studio” and “most of the Fortune 100 companies.” </p><p>“If we can help a studio make a movie 40 percent faster, then we’re probably gonna be able to help developers of games make games faster,” he says. “They’re waking up, and they’re moving faster than I would say the studios were moving two years ago.”</p><p>Naturally, I couldn’t let Valenzuela get off our Zoom call without asking him about his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-23/meta-held-deal-talks-with-startup-runway-in-ai-recruiting-push">recent acquisition talks</a> with Zuckerberg: “I think we have more interesting intellectual challenges being independent, and remaining independent for now.” </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/694531/runway-ai-video-games-generate]]></content:encoded>

There’s usually a great deal happening on a mid- or high-end TV from LG, TCL, Hisense, or Amazon’s own Fire TV brand — even if the biggest discounts remain reserved for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Amazon Prime Day, and during the lead-up to the Super Bowl.</p><p>Right now, there are a number of discounted 4K TVs to choose from, spanning a wide variety of prices, sizes, and feature sets. Whether you want a secondary screen for the bedroom, or a high-end OLED that’s built to provide the ultimate gaming or cinematic experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals.</p><div><p id="FXxWVp"><h2>The best 4K TV deals for most people</h2></p></div><div><p id="268sW3"><h3>Samsung Q8F</h3></p></div><p><strong>Samsung’s Q8F</strong> is available for $697.99 ($50 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-85-Inch-Processor-Quantum-AirSlim/dp/B0DYVPQZRH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-55-class-q8f-series-qled-4k-uhd-samsungvision-ai-smart-tizen-tv-2025%2F6617399.p%3FskuId%3D6617399" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> for the 55-inch model, which is its lowest price ever and an excellent value for a QLED 4K TV. Its quantum dot LED panel boasts great contrast (especially in HDR content). The Q8F has a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.0 ports. This means you can play in 4K at up to 60Hz with a Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series S/X, or a PlayStation 5 Pro, or at a faster 120Hz refresh rate bumped down to 1440p resolution. Samsung is also including two free months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with purchase, which will allow you to stream games directly to your TV through the cloud, eliminating the need for a console.</p><p>The TV is powered by Samsung’s Q4 AI processor, which is used to upscale HD video to 4K when necessary, to optimize the picture in real-time, and make navigating its interface feel snappy. Samsung also touts the Q8F’s audio system, which adjusts the EQ and boost dialogue volume when needed. If you’ve cut the cord with cable, you can watch over 2,700 free channels of TV (over 400 of which are exclusive to Samsung TVs) in addition to streaming services. You can save $200 by jumping up to the 85-inch model, which is on sale for around $1,797.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-85-Inch-Processor-Quantum-AirSlim/dp/B0DYVQGMS9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-85-class-q8f-series-qled-4k-uhd-samsungvision-ai-smart-tizen-tv-2025%2F6617395.p%3FskuId%3D6617395" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->698</span></p><div><p>Samsung’s Q8F is an excellent all-around TV thanks to its 120Hz panel, wide color reproduction, and adaptive audio system.</p></div></div><div><p id="tcl-qm7k"><h3>TCL QM7K</h3></p></div><p>If you want a 55-inch TV with a gorgeous and bright QD-Mini LED panel without spending over $1,000, the <strong>TCL’s QM7K</strong> is the set to get.

It features a native 144Hz refresh rate with support for up to 288Hz speeds at 1080p when playing games with VRR. However, only two of its four HDMI ports support those speeds; the other two top out at 4K/60Hz or 1440p/120Hz. It also features a dynamic light algorithm to prevent images from appearing washed out.</p><p>The TV boasts up to 2,500 local dimming zones, according to TCL, but that depends on the size you get. The folks at <em><a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/tcl/qm7k#:~:text=TCL%2065QM7K-,966,-288">RTINGS</a></em> found out that the 65-inch version has 966 zones, though even with fewer of them in the 55-inch model, it should still provide good brightness control. Having more dimming zones means the TV can control the brightness of more precise sections of the screen, helping to avoid blooming, which is when an area around the source of light on the screen is too bright, breaking the realism of the image. The QM7K is powered by TCL’s AiPQ Pro processor, which uses AI to manage its contrast, color, clarity, motion, and upscaling. TCL partnered with Bang &amp; Olufsen to provide the TV’s audio system. You can get a 75-inch model for around $1,299.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-65-Inch-QD-Mini-Premium-Mini-LED/dp/B0DVX9RF7S?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ftcl-75-class-qm7k-series-4k-uhd-hdr-qd-mini-led-smart-tv-with-google-tv-2025%2F6621474.p%3F" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> if you need a bigger screen.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->748</span></p><div><p>TCL’s midrange QM7K has a QD-Mini LED TV with a 144Hz refresh rate, hundreds of local dimming zones for more precise brightness controls, and a Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system.</p></div></div><div><p id="panasonic-z85"><h3>Panasonic Z85</h3></p></div><p>We have a dedicated section for high-end OLED TV deals below, but <strong>Panasonic’s Z85</strong> is such a good value that it deserves consideration for folks who may be on a budget.

The Z85’s OLED panel is its standout feature, as it achieves perfect black levels and vivid color. It has a 120Hz refresh rate panel, and two of its four HDMI ports support that speed at 4K. The Z85 also supports both Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium, which minimize screen tearing and other visual artifacts when playing on a PC with a compatible video card.</p><p>The 4K TV features an HCX Pro AI Processor MKII to control its color, contrast, and clarity, optimizing the image and sound quality of whatever you’re watching in real-time. The TV’s audio system features a built-in subwoofer for enhanced bass.

It features a QLED panel that can deliver more contrast and brightness than a typical LED TV, with support for HDR10 Plus and Dolby Vision with a peak brightness of 600 nits. The 4K set features a processor capable of AI upscaling and full array local dimming with 160 local dimming zones. A panel with full array local dimming offers better control of brightness and contrast than direct- or edge-lit LED panels (<a href="https://youtu.be/tjUZmaMRwtQ">this video</a> from LG shows how it works, but lower your volume first), providing a more consistent picture across the entire screen. The QD7’s obvious weak point is gaming, due to its 60Hz refresh rate, but if that’s not important to you, it remains a superb value.

The 55-inch model received its first price drop to around $2,296.99 ($203 off) at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1885601-REG%2Flg_oled55g5wua_oled_evo_ai_g5.html" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H Photo</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-Upscaling-Filmmaker-Orchestra-OLED65G5WUA/dp/B0DYQGRHX3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. LG claims that the 4K TV’s OLED panel offers a 33 percent jump in brightness over its predecessor. It has a 120Hz refresh rate, with support for Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium, plus a near-instantaneous 0.1ms response time, and fast gaming at 165Hz with VRR available on all four of its HDMI ports. The G5 can also play games via the cloud with the Xbox app.</p><p>The TV’s Alpha 11 4K AI Processor enables AI Picture Pro to manage the brightness, depth, and clarity of every frame, and it will automatically upscale non-4K video. The G5’s audio system features five up-firing speakers, providing more sophisticated surround sound than most TVs can provide. LG’s G5 is a luxe TV with great specs that will likely remain on the cutting edge of screen tech for the next few years.

Like the G5, it has a 120Hz panel with support for VRR, Nvidia G-Sync, and AMD FreeSync Premium (the option exists to enable a 144Hz mode if you dig in the TV’s options). Its embedded A9 AI Processor Gen7 offers higher-quality video upscaling and image optimization compared to the C3. The biggest difference between the C4 and G5 is its maximum brightness. The C4 tops out at an advertised 1,000 nits, though that will vary depending on the content you’re watching. It has a three-channel audio system, which might sound impressive compared to other TVs, but still can’t compete with a soundbar. When you’re not watching videos or playing games, you can also enable the C4’s Gallery Mode to display art. The LG C4 shares many of the same core features as the G5, but at nearly $1,000 less.

It’s currently $1,198 ($100 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Inch-Ultra-A90K-Playstation%C2%AE/dp/B09R9BVJ9Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsony-42-class-bravia-xr-a90k-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv-2022%2F6505134.p%3F" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>.
