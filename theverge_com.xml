The company’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fforums%2Fgeforce-graphics-cards%2F5%2F557712%2Fverified-priority-access-geforce-rtx-5090-and-rtx-%2F" rel="sponsored">just announced a way</a> for Nvidia fans to sign up for “Verified Priority Access” to buy the elusive two-slot <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349976/nvidia-rtx-5090-fe-small-form-factor-sff-hands-on">SFF-friendly</a> RTX 5090 and 5080 Founders Edition graphics cards.</p></div><p>Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/13/23402674/nvidia-rtx-4090-priority-access-founders-edition-test">a similar Verified Priority Access program for the RTX 4090</a>, the new program is invite-only, but this time you’ll apply for access by filling out <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Faccount%2Frtx-50-series-verified-priority-access%2F" rel="sponsored">this form</a> rather than being pre-selected. The site will check that you’ve already had an Nvidia account (accounts created after January 30th need not apply) and ask you whether you’d prefer a 5090 or a 5080. Then, it’ll apparently use an algorithm to figure out if you’re a real gamer (analyzing your Nvidia app / GeForce Experience use) before offering a card. Limit one per person.</p><p>“Invites will begin rolling out next week,” writes Nvidia. The company doesn’t say how many cards have been allocated to this program, so it’s difficult to tell if this is a meaningful way to get cards to gamers rather than scalpers.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Limited Run Games has apologized for a potential issue with two games it has offered on NES carts — <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/products/rugrats-adventures-in-gameland-nes?srsltid=AfmBOor7R0BG6JejMy28YyXdN9ia6HjlBtr_7uNJwaQGw7cvSEsoANre"><em>Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland</em></a> and <em><a href="https://limitedrungames.com/products/piopow-nes?srsltid=AfmBOorUQV5glZhhc5LdcgYVkNYtbli34NYqlAkeRror1NQbLO5pDsHn">Piopow</a></em> — that could cause damage to the cartridges or to NES consoles. The statement follows a <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/02/this-cartridge-is-a-tiny-time-bomb-limited-run-accused-of-selling-carts-which-can-damage-your-nes"><em>Time Extension</em> report</a> about the games.</p><p>In a statement <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:zfac4c44fukmi4vawiprnjbt/post/3liimbs5vmc2j?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.timeextension.com%252Fnews%252F2025%252F02%252Fthis-cartridge-is-a-tiny-time-bomb-limited-run-accused-of-selling-carts-which-can-damage-your-nes">emailed to customers</a>, Limited Run says those two games weren’t manufactured by its “regular” manufacturing partner. “Due to an issue with voltage regulation, there is a small chance that prolonged use of these titles could result in damage to either the cartridge or the console hardware,” Limited Run says.</p><p>The company is stopping further shipments of the games to customers so that it can re-manufacture them itself “via our trusted manufacturing partner,” according to the statement. Anyone who has already received the games will be sent “a newly manufactured version of their title automatically,” Limited Run says. The company does not recommend using the older version of the games.</p><p>Customers can ask for a refund if they want by contacting customer service. The two games currently aren’t for sale.</p><p>Limited Run says the manufacturer that produced <em>Rugrats</em> and <em>Piopow</em> “has only worked on a very small handful” of Limited Run titles, and the company is “going through our back catalogue of NES titles manufactured by this supplier and testing for possible issues.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
