            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Late last year, Nintendo hosted a mysterious Switch Online playtest, and on Thursday, the company announced that it would be doing another test as part of the “Nintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program” and that it will be opening applications soon. This second round will be a test of the “same service” as before.</p><p>Last time, Nintendo asked participants not to share details about the playtest, but leaks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275596/nintendo-switch-online-beta-playtest-program-leak-mmo">appeared anyway</a> indicating that the test was for some kind of MMO-style game.</p><p>Applications for this next playtest will be open to users 18 or older with an active Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack as of Thursday at 6PM ET <em>and</em> with a Nintendo Account registered in Japan, United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Canada, Brazil, or Mexico. Users can apply as individuals or as a group of up to four people “if everyone in the group meets the Application Qualifications,” according to Nintendo.</p><p>You can prepare your application <a href="https://playtest-p.nintendo.com/en-us">on Nintendo’s website</a> from Friday, July 18th at 6PM ET to Monday, July 21st at 10:59AM ET.</p><p>You can actually submit your application from Monday, July 21st at 11AM ET to Wednesday, July 23rd at 10:59AM ET, though Nintendo says applications will be accepted “on a first-come, first-served basis.”</p><p>Nintendo expects to accept “as many as 40,000 participants worldwide,” a big jump from the 10,000 participants allowed for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266478/nintendo-switch-online-invite-application-beta-playtest">the October test</a>. If you participated in that playtest, you can participate in this next one, too, <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1945971033330102298">Nintendo says</a>.</p><p>The playtest itself will run from Monday, July 28th at 9PM ET to Sunday, August 10th at 8:59PM ET.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/709530/nintendo-switch-online-playtest-program-july-august-invitations-application]]></content:encoded>

He joined in 2018, and covers gaming, PCs, accessories, and more.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Razer’s new <em>Pokémon</em> collaboration is a missed opportunity. The four PC gaming peripherals in this lineup are simply reskinned versions of products that already exist, and which cost $20 to $40 more than their all-black counterparts. You really should be getting more for your money here.</p><p>For example, the themed BlackWidow V4 X keyboard should include at least one highly detailed custom keycap (switching out Alt for pokéball designs doesn’t cut it). Maybe the Kraken V4 X headset could have included themed pop filters of pokémon silhouettes. I’m just spitballing, which I guess is something that neither Razer nor The Pokémon Company did enough of during this collaboration.</p><p>You might be totally happy with how these Razer products look, in which case you can buy them at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsearchpage.jsp%3Fid%3Dpcat17071%26loc%3D1719813%26ref%3D388%26st%3Drazer%2BPok%25C3%25A9mon%2B%2Bedition" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FCVB8QNR,B0FCVF8CCV,B0FCVFBWVX,B0FCVJBBXM&amp;pf_rd_r=DGZ43G35FX5SV32W84R3&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, or from <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fcollabs%2Fpokemon" rel="sponsored">Razer</a> itself. But I know a good collaboration when I see one. <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/msi-toystory-limited-edition-pc-hardware-reveals-rtx-5070-buzz-lightyear-gpu-and-woody-motherboard">MSI’s <em>Toy Story</em>-branded gaming PC components</a> are the kind of high-effort work that I expect to see when a major entertainment brand gets involved. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uniqlo.com%2Fhk%2Fen%2Fcontents%2Ffeature%2Fut-magazine%2Fs176-from-momas-video-game%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dthe%2520game%2520design.-%2CSimCity%25202000%2C-By%2520assuming%2520a" rel="sponsored"><em>SimCity 2000</em> Uniqlo T-shirts</a>?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/brandon-russell">Brandon Russell</a> <span>is a commerce writer covering deals and buying guides. Previously, he was a freelance writer for Popular Mechanics, Men’s Health, and Esquire.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Today is <strong><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></strong> launch day, and what better way to celebrate than with a discount? The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a>-exclusive game is currently $62.99 ($7 off) at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.costco.com/.product.4000373240.html" rel="sponsored">Costco</a> for members. Nintendo games rarely go on sale, even after several months on shelves, so any amount off the retail price is a big win on launch day.</p><p>If you were on the fence about whether to get the game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2">let our review assuage any concerns</a>. It rules. <em>The Verge’s</em> Ash Parrish describes it as a “fantastic feast.” The game offers satisfying punching mechanics, creative level design, and the unmistakable polish that most Nintendo games possess. Whereas <em>Mario Kart World</em> was a pretty good launch title, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Switch 2</a>’s first must-have game.</p><div><p id="more-deals-to-check-out"><h2>More deals to check out</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>The <strong>Anker Charging Station (7-in-1, 100W)</strong> is a great desk accessory for charging multiple devices, and it’s currently down to $35.99 ($14 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CHFF6P5Z?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, which is an all-time low price. The charging station offers a maximum output of 100W, allowing you to charge power-hungry devices quickly. There are seven ports in total — three AC outlets on the back, and four USB ports (two USB-C and two USB-A) on the front. In addition, the charging station offers surge protection and a 5-foot built-in cable, giving you flexibility to position it where you want.</span></li><li><span>The <strong>CMF Buds Pro</strong> with active noise cancellation are down to just $29 ($20 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJ8R2NNP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, the lowest price we’ve seen. The wireless earbuds feature a stem design similar to AirPods, and offer premium features like transparency mode, an adjustable EQ, and up to 6.5 hours of battery life. With microphones inside and outside the earbuds, the ANC feature can suppress noise of up to 45dB, giving you peace and quiet at the coffee shop.</span></li><li><span><strong>Epic Games</strong> is hosting a <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/sales-and-specials/summer-sale">summer sale through July 31st</a>, offering modest discounts on games like <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em> for $47.99 ($12 off), <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> for $44.99 ($5 off), and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> for $52.49 ($17 off). One of the most notable perks of the sale is that each purchase lands you an extra 20 percent back in Epic Rewards using Epic’s payment system through August 31st. You can redeem Epic Rewards on future game purchases or add-ons, though Epic says you can’t use the rewards on subscriptions like Fortnite Crew.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/709274/donkey-kong-bananza-costco-sale-deal]]></content:encoded>
