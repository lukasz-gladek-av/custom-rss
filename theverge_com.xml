But he also said <em>Erdtree </em>is “about the same volume as the Limgrave part of the base game,” the starting area of <em>Elden Ring</em>, containing “slightly more content.” </p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24183692/hidetaka-miyazaki-interview-shadow-of-the-erdtree-difficulty">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjEwNTg1" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/610585/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview">Elden Ring Nightreign takes a big swing at a bigger audience</a></h2><div><p>It’s inaccurate and reductive to call <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320097/elden-ring-sequel-nightreign-the-game-awards-trailer">Elden Ring Nightreign</a></em> a <em>Dark Souls </em>take on <em>Fortnite</em>. And yet, if pressed for an extremely brief elevator pitch — say, the kind you’d give to your friends who are curious about soulsborne games but are put off by all the discussions of their difficulty — it’s about as best as you could do. In my hands-on time with the game, I was compelled to ask my team at the outset of our very first run, “Well… where we droppin’ boys?” as we flew over the map in the claws of spectral birds. The similarity to<em> Fortnite</em> and other battle royale games was so striking, the reference simply had to be made. But once we got on the ground, <em>Fortnite</em> took a big ol’ backseat and <em>Elden Ring</em> reemerged as the foremost game <em>Nightreign</em> compares to.</p><p><em>Nightreign</em> strips out the combat and visual aesthetics of <em>Elden Ring</em> and lays them over gameplay that combines multiplayer battle royale action with roguelike live, die, repeat mechanics. Matches will take place over three days. During daylight, players will assault a Limgrave-like map (called Limveld), either solo or in teams of three, beating regular enemies and mini-bosses for powerful weapons, accessories, and runes to level up their characters. As daylight turns to night, a destructive, HP-draining storm called Night’s Tide shrinks the map, forcing the players to a tiny arena where they’ll face a major boss. Defeat the boss to begin the next day, when the cycle repeats and the match ends by defeating the final boss on the third night.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/610585/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Lo-fi beats to chill / Waterfowl Dance to.</p><p>If video game soundtracks are what you use to get through the workday, then FromSoftware has a gift for you.

Bandai Namco has seemingly heard the great hue and cry from reviewers and players alike that <em>Erdtree </em>is far too difficult. In response, the publisher <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-calibration-update-1122">is implementing a “calibration update”</a> that will reduce the level of difficulty by making players stronger. According to the patch notes for this update:</p><p>The key to understanding this update is the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment">Scadutree Fragments</a>. They are DLC-specific upgrade materials that increase a player’s attack and defense. The fragments are scattered throughout the map, requiring considerable exploration to find, but the increased power they grant makes them a high-priority resource.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186473/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-update-difficulty-nerf">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Live-action turtle pope.</p><p>It’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> day, and Bandai Namco has released a new live-action trailer for the <em>Elden Ring</em> expansion. Crucially, the short video shows what Miriel, Pastor of Vows would look like IRL. He, too, apologizes for the unseemly state of affairs.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MjM1NDk=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24182462/tips-for-starting-shadow-of-the-erdtree-elden-ring">Here are some small but helpful tips for starting Shadow of the Erdtree</a></h2><div><p>Before <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> finally goes live, Bandai Namco has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178537/great-haircut-tarnished">implemented a patch</a> that adds a couple of small features and updates just in time for the DLC’s launch in a few short hours. FromSoftware also shared a new launch trailer to herald the DLC’s arrival, but it’s chockful of spoilers, so beware. The update isn’t particularly earth-shattering, but it does include some things worth keeping in mind before all you Tarnished <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc">get your head beat in by the vicious monsters patrolling the Shadow Lands</a>.</p><p>Firstly, we get new hair options! I was pretty down on <em>Elden Ring</em>’s character creator <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/25/22951205/elden-rings-character-creator-black-hairstyles">for its lack of Black hairstyles</a>. It just didn’t make sense that the character creator was so robust and detailed but lacked hairstyles that represent a good chunk of the human population. There are five new styles to choose from, with two of them being dreadlocks. I chose the loose loc option so my Tarnished can finally get rid of her abhorrent pigtails. I’m not sure if the “white hairs” option was present in the base game or a new addition with this patch, but I really like how it adds gray to my locs, reminding me of when I started picking out errant gray hairs when I had locs.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24182462/tips-for-starting-shadow-of-the-erdtree-elden-ring">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Elden Ring has an ‘issue’ on Steam Deck right now.</p><p>“Leaving your Steam Deck inactive for more than 5 minutes may stop the game from accepting inputs,” <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1803730488751743427">according to the <em>Elden Ring</em> X account</a>.

According to Bandai Namco <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-107">on the game’s website</a>, the patch intends to “encourage more versatility in terms of gameplay” — if “encourage” also means “make you a nigh unkillable god in single player.” A lot of weapons and spells were buffed, very few things were nerfed, and it seems like it’s going to get a lot harder to kill your friends in PVP. The patch notes are indeed massive, but I’ve picked out a few highlights.</p><p><strong>Glintstone Pebble / Shard Spiral: </strong>increased attack power</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/13/23402616/elden-ring-dlc-patch-notes-update">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTAyMTg2" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/4/23009950/elden-ring-giant-map-game-design-from-software">All hail Elden Ring’s ever-growing map</a></h2><div><p>One of <em>Elden Ring’s</em> most polarizing features is its willingness to withhold information. While it’s less arcane than earlier FromSoftware titles like <em>Dark Souls</em>, the game constantly hands you items, quests, and mechanics <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22954823/elden-ring-open-world-guide">with very little explanation</a>. But after 130 hours and counting in the Lands Between, I’m in love with how well it sometimes deploys that obscurity. And there’s no better example than <em>Elden Ring’s</em> map, which has transcended a simple open-world convention to become one of my very favorite pieces of the game.</p><p>If you’re still in the early areas of <em>Elden Ring</em>, you might want to skip this post because I’m going to talk about a mechanic that relies on mystery. But if you’ve played a bit of the game, you might know what I’m talking about. <em>Elden Ring’s </em>map offers a constant give-and-take of showing players new spaces to explore, then pulling back a curtain to more places that they didn’t even realize could <em>exist. </em>It withholds information only to reveal it in a way that’s delightful, satisfying, and entirely in keeping with the world’s vast scope. It’s not just an interface element — it’s a meta-game in its own right.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/4/23009950/elden-ring-giant-map-game-design-from-software">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTAzOTU2" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/15/22979436/elden-ring-speedrunners-world-record-race-30-minutes">Elden Ring speedrunners race to the bottom</a></h2><div><p><em>Elden Ring</em> is just so massive and its bosses are so tough that the average player will probably take over 60 hours to beat it.
