He previously worked at <em>Android Police</em> and <em>Tech Advisor</em>.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>12-year-old browser game GeoGuessr is getting a belated port to PC, with a new listing for the game now in the Steam Store. Despite its age, GeoGuessr will launch in Early Access when it goes on sale some time in April 2025.</p><p>GeoGuessr <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/12/4323978/geoguessr-map-game-google-street-view-exploration">first launched in 2013</a>, and tasks players with figuring out their coordinates after being dropped into a random Google Street View location. Over the years it’s developed an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22846869/geoguessr-competitive-esport-reddit-geowizard-google-street-view">unlikely competitive esports scene</a>, which the Steam edition looks to capitalize on, with a focus on competitive modes and ranked play.</p><p>The <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3478870%2FGeoGuessr_Steam_Edition%2F" rel="sponsored">Steam listing</a> explains that the game will remain in Early Access “for at least six months,” while the developers add “new game modes, maps, and competitive features.” At launch it will support ranked Solo Duels and unranked Team Duels, including <a href="https://x.com/geoguessr/status/1904516547806150715">cross-play with the browser version</a>.</p><p>What we don’t know is exactly when in April GeoGuessr will launch on Steam, or how much it will cost. While the game’s browser version was initially free, it now only allows you to make three guesses per day before requiring a <a href="https://www.geoguessr.com/pro">paid subscription</a>, starting from $2.49 per month. GeoGuessr’s iOS and Android apps are locked behind the $2.99 Pro Unlimited plan, but the Steam app will require a new account that will not be synced with existing Geoguessr accounts, so may have its own pricing structure.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
