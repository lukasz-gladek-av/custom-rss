            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/657294/wii-homebrew-channel-archived-stolen-nintendo-code<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/wes-davis">Wes Davis</a> <span>is a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The GitHub repository for The Homebrew Channel (HBC), a popular piece of software used on hacked Nintendo Wiis, has been archived. Its maintainers are accusing the creators of “libogc,” a software toolkit HBC relies on, of stealing both Nintendo-made and open-source code and presenting it as their own, according to a <a href="https://github.com/fail0verflow/hbc?tab=readme-ov-file">ReadMe posted to the repository yesterday</a> by <a href="https://github.com/fail0verflow">hacking group fail0verflow</a>. (Hat tip to <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1916557212509478946">X user OatmealDome</a>.)</p><p>HBC is a central piece of the Wii homebrew community, serving as a launcher for non-Nintendo-approved software without needing to re-run an exploit. Through it, you can do things like load GameCube and Wii game files, run older console emulators, and more from a USB-connected hard drive or the Wii’s SD card slot. HBC is also one of the cleanest ways to back up your own Wii or GameCube collection, as you can copy files from game discs using Nintendo’s own hardware.</p><p>In its ReadMe, fail0verflow, which owns the HBC repository, writes that although they knew early on that libogc used some stolen Nintendo code, they thought much of the rest of it was original code and decided to “reluctantly” continue using it. However, they say that after <a href="https://github.com/derek57/libogc">another developer</a> claimed the code was actually lifted from the open-source RTEMS without attribution, they filed an issue that libogc’s developers closed and replied to with “verbal abuse” before deleting it. HBC’s developers say they now “consider it impossible to legally and legitimately compile this software at this point, and cannot encourage any further development.”</p><p>WiiHacks, one of the most well-made guides for hacking a Wii, still seems to offer all of the file downloads needed to hack a Wii. But as <a href="https://gamerant.com/wii-homebrew-copyright-infringement-stolen-nintendo-code-accusations/"><em>GameRant</em> notes</a>, that could change, particularly with the HBC developers admitting that some Nintendo code was used in the tooling it relies on. Nintendo has been known to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">go after emulation projects</a> in the past, after all. If you’ve already hacked a Wii, none of this will matter much. HBC itself hasn’t had any major updates for years — just don’t count on any persistent bugs going away anytime soon, if ever.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Google is quietly building key features of its Play Games app, which lets you track achievements on Android games, directly into the Play Store, <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-may-kill-google-play-games/"><em>Android Police</em></a> reports — signaling plans that the former may be headed for the infamous <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20977968/google-graveyard-products-shut-down-dead-not-supported-discontinues-spring-cleaning">Google Graveyard</a>.</p><p>Coder and self-proclaimed APK teardown specialist <a href="https://x.com/AssembleDebug/status/1916711620618694864">AssembleDebug posted on X</a> that Google hasn’t made any significant updates regarding user interface and features in the Google Play Games apps in months. However, AssembleDebug has seen updates under the hood of the Google Play Store app that include upcoming Gamer Profiles and the ability to “follow” other users. AssembleDebug says the Play Store can already track gamers’ achievements.</p><p>Google Play Games for Android <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/24/4553190/google-play-games-app-for-android-will-be-available-today">launched in 2013</a> to compete with Apple’s Game Center — at a time when smartphone gaming was hitting its stride and, for the first time, really challenging portable video game systems for people’s attention. Google has often moved features between apps as they aged, like when Google Pay bowed out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/23/24080605/google-wallet-pay-mobile-payments-credit-cards-keys">in favor of Google Wallet</a>.</p><p>The Google Play Games app isn’t the same as the company’s Google Play Games for PC service, which lets you play select Android games on Windows computers (and has been in beta for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891046/google-play-games-android-games-windows-pc-beta-launch">more than three years</a>). Last month, Google said it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628323/google-play-games-android-mobile">bringing more games</a> to the PC app. The Google Play Games app on Android, though, looks slated for redundancy before it finally sees itself out.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
