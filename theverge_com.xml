            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/657370/blue-prince-ios-port-app-store<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Apple’s App Store review yet again let at least one unofficial mobile port of a hot new game slip through – this time, for <em>Blue Prince</em>. But shortly after we published this article, the port that we found disappeared from the App Store.</p><p>In a joint post <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/blueprincegame.bsky.social/post/3lnvalzzzas2j">on Monday</a>, <em>Blue Prince’s</em> developer, Dogubomb, and its publisher, Raw Fury, said that they have “received reports of games claiming to be <em>Blue Prince</em> on iOS.” Currently, the game is only available on Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation.</p><p>Before it was removed, I easily found one iOS copy of the game just by searching <em>Blue Prince</em> on the App Store – it was the first search result. The icon looked like it would be the icon for a hypothetical mobile version of the game, the listing had screenshots that looked like they were indeed from <em>Blue Prince</em>, and the description for the game matched the description on Steam.</p><p>But on the iOS clone’s listing, the game’s seller was listed as “Samet Altinay,” and I can’t find any connection between this person and <em>Blue Prince</em> outside of this app. The copyright was also attributed to “DogBomb” — notice the missing “u.”</p><p>I purchased the now-removed, unofficial version of <em>Blue Prince</em>, which cost $9.99, and installed it on my iPhone 16 Pro to test it out. In a few minutes of playing, it appeared to be a barely modified version of the actual <em>Blue Prince</em> game, though with a few tweaks to make it better-suited for mobile, like a virtual joystick. I also quickly ran into a major bug: when I tried to walk through one of the doors from the Entrance Hall, I fell through the floor.</p><p>Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Before the listing was pulled, the unofficial mobile port was the #8 paid app in the Entertainment category on iOS. When I published the article, it only had one three-star review, with the writer saying they also hit a bug that caused them to fall through the floor.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>Notice the mobile-friendly virtual joystick and map icon?</em></figcaption> <cite>Screenshot by Jay Peters / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>If you, like me, bought this clone version of the game, you might want to try to get a refund. Apple has a support document about how to request a refund <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118223">on its website</a>.</p><p>Dogubomb and Raw Fury have not officially announced an iOS port of <em>Blue Prince</em>. “We have no news about other platforms at this time, but if that changes we will make an official announcement,” they said in their post. “While we investigate we would kindly ask that you do not purchase or download these apps.”</p><p>Apple has previously allowed copycats of games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22879295/wordle-clones-app-store-removal-online-backlash-copycats"><em>Wordle</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/31/24056800/here-come-the-palworld-mobile-clones"><em>Palworld</em></a> to appear on the App Store.</p><p><em><strong>Update, April 28th</strong>: The Blue Prince iOS clone we found was removed from the App Store.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/657294/wii-homebrew-channel-archived-stolen-nintendo-code<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/wes-davis">Wes Davis</a> <span>is a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The GitHub repository for The Homebrew Channel (HBC), a popular piece of software used on hacked Nintendo Wiis, has been archived. Its maintainers are accusing the creators of “libogc,” a software toolkit HBC relies on, of stealing both Nintendo-made and open-source code and presenting it as their own, according to a <a href="https://github.com/fail0verflow/hbc?tab=readme-ov-file">ReadMe posted to the repository yesterday</a> by <a href="https://github.com/fail0verflow">hacking group fail0verflow</a>. (Hat tip to <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1916557212509478946">X user OatmealDome</a>.)</p><p>HBC is a central piece of the Wii homebrew community, serving as a launcher for non-Nintendo-approved software without needing to re-run an exploit. Through it, you can do things like load GameCube and Wii game files, run older console emulators, and more from a USB-connected hard drive or the Wii’s SD card slot. HBC is also one of the cleanest ways to back up your own Wii or GameCube collection, as you can copy files from game discs using Nintendo’s own hardware.</p><p>In its ReadMe, fail0verflow, which owns the HBC repository, writes that although they knew early on that libogc used some stolen Nintendo code, they thought much of the rest of it was original code and decided to “reluctantly” continue using it. However, they say that after <a href="https://github.com/derek57/libogc">another developer</a> claimed the code was actually lifted from the open-source RTEMS without attribution, they filed an issue that libogc’s developers closed and replied to with “verbal abuse” before deleting it. HBC’s developers say they now “consider it impossible to legally and legitimately compile this software at this point, and cannot encourage any further development.”</p><p>WiiHacks, one of the most well-made guides for hacking a Wii, still seems to offer all of the file downloads needed to hack a Wii. But as <a href="https://gamerant.com/wii-homebrew-copyright-infringement-stolen-nintendo-code-accusations/"><em>GameRant</em> notes</a>, that could change, particularly with the HBC developers admitting that some Nintendo code was used in the tooling it relies on. Nintendo has been known to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">go after emulation projects</a> in the past, after all. If you’ve already hacked a Wii, none of this will matter much. HBC itself hasn’t had any major updates for years — just don’t count on any persistent bugs going away anytime soon, if ever.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
