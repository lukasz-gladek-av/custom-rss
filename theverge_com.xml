            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>It’s that time of year: A whole bunch of Pokémon news is incoming. February 27th is the date the franchise first debuted, and The Pokémon Company uses it as a chance to outline its plans in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/881332/nintendo-pokemon-presents-pokemon-day">a Pokémon Presents showcase</a>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/618678/pokemon-presents-2025-all-the-biggest-news-and-trailers">Last year’s event included the announcement of <em>Pokémon Champions</em></a>, and the 2026 edition should be particularly big, as this year represents the franchise’s 30th anniversary.</p><p>TPCi says simply that it will feature “the latest news and updates from the world of Pokémon,” without getting into any specifics. But there’s a good chance we’ll hear about the next mainline entry in the series, given that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23462858/pokemon-violet-scarlet-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em> launched back in 2022</a>. Personally, I’m hoping for an unexpected spinoff along the lines of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23893260/pokemon-sleep-insomnia-app-nintendo-aid">Pokémon Sleep</a></em>.</p><p>One thing we do know is that after the show ends, both <em>Pokémon FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> are getting a re-release on the Switch.</p><p>The showcase airs at 9AM ET, and you can keep up with the most important news right here.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODg1MzIx" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/885321/pokemon-winds-and-waves-trailer-browt-pombom-gecua">Pokémon Winds and Waves launch on the Switch 2 in 2027</a></h2><div><p>It’s time to say goodbye to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23462858/pokemon-violet-scarlet-review-nintendo-switch">the Paldea region</a> because a new generation of mainline <em>Pokémon </em>games are on the way.</p><p>During today’s big <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/885578/pokemon-presents-2026-news-trailers">Pokémon Presents stream</a>, Nintendo announced that <em>Pokémon Wind </em>and <em>Waves </em>are the next installments in the core game series. The games will launch in 2027 and are exclusive for the Nintendo Switch 2. Nintendo also shared a trailer showcasing a new trio of starter pokémon — Browt, Pombon, and Gecua — and a number of different environments you’ll be able to explore as you play through the games.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/885321/pokemon-winds-and-waves-trailer-browt-pombom-gecua">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Green means go.</p><p>As a reminder, now that the stream is over, <em>Pokémon FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> — remakes of the original games for the GBA — are now available on the Switch.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>A battle royale.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/620196/pokemon-champions-online-pokemon-battles-nintendo-switch-mobile">battle-focused spinoff <em>Pokémon Champions</em></a> has a launch date — or a month, at least. The Nintendo Switch version is out in April, while mobile players will have to wait until later in the year.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Nintendo’s making a mini Game Boy music player.</p><p>Sure, you can just pull up digital versions of the Junichi Masuda’s music from <em>Pokémon Red </em>and <em>Blue</em>. Or you can pick up one of the new Game Boy-inspired music players Nintendo is releasing along with 45 different cartridges that seem to play one song each.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Some GameCube flavor.</p><p>As part of the Nintendo Classics line for NSO subscribers, Nintendo is bringing the GameCube cult classic <em>Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</em> to the Switch 2.
