            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/27/24353227/sony-m10s-inzone-oled-burn-in-warranty<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony is upping the limited warranty on some InZone gaming monitors to three years and is <a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/televisions-projectors-monitors/sdm-27q10s/articles/00350326">tossing in OLED burn-in coverage</a> for the 27-inch M10S. The company announced the additional coverage today after launching both the InZone M10S OLED and M9 II LED in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24253167/sony-inzone-gaming-monitor-m10s-480hz-oled">September</a> with only one-year limited warranties out of the box. Sony says other than that, the limited warranties remain as they were.</p><p>Manufacturers have long been averse to talking about burn-in or have outright categorized the phenomenon as “normal use,” denying warranty claims to fix it on various panel types. However, OLEDs have historically been more susceptible to burn-in, especially when used with many static images like those from a PC. In recent years, OLED has improved to be less sensitive to burn-ins.</p><div><p>Sony is the latest in a trend of manufacturers adding burn-in coverage. Alienware was one of the first to specifically include OLED burn-in within its three-year coverage on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/9/22966303/alienware-curved-aw3423dw-qd-oled-34-inch-quantum-dot-pc-gaming-monitor-hands-on">QD-OLED monitor launched in 2022</a>, and for its latest 27-inch 4K model <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335564/alienware-27-inch-4k-240hz-oled-price-date">coming this year</a>. And in 2023, The Verge’s Sean Hollister asked LG to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22336413/lg-27gr95qe-b-oled-gaming-monitor-review#:~:text=Originally%2C%20LG%20wouldn%E2%80%99t%20confirm%20that%20to%20me.%20In%20fact%2C%20the%20company%20had%20originally%20reserved%20the%20right%20to%20reject%20warranty%20claims%20if%20this%20monitor%20experiences%20burn%2Din">explicitly warrant the company’s OLED monitors</a> against burn-in and they agreed and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23827701/lg-oled-burn-in-warranty-two-desktop-monitor-windows">changed their verbiage</a>.</p></div><div><figcaption><em>A Samsung representative on this Best Buy product listing says the three-year warranty on the 32-inch Odyssey OLED G8 covers burn-in.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot: The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Since then, companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/7/24064465/asus-rog-msi-oled-monitor-warranty-burn-in-cover-expanded">MSI and Asus</a> have also pledged to cover OLED burn-in on some models, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334049/asus-samsung-msi-27-inch-4k-oled-240hz-monitors">their latest ones</a> (in some countries). It’s important to research the warranty included in the model you’re buying to determine whether burn-in coverage is included. For instance, Samsung’s website shows a general policy for its warranty that <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/legal/LGL10000300/#standard-limited-warranty">excludes burn-ins</a>, however, an online rep <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/questions/samsung-32-odyssey-oled-g8-g80sd-4k-uhd-240hz-0-03ms-smart-gaming-monitor-with-hdr-silver/6573686/question/2a8f4805-d47e-3416-9cec-dad034fbce5b#:~:text=OLED%20Safeguard%2B%20helps%20prevent%20burn,year%20warranty%20for%20this%20model">confirmed it does cover it on a 32-inch Odyssey OLED G8</a>. However, the company still <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334049/asus-samsung-msi-27-inch-4k-oled-240hz-monitors#:~:text=Samsung%20hasn%E2%80%99t%20confirmed%20its%20warranty%20situation%20for%20its%20latest%20G8%20model">hasn’t clarified</a> if burn-ins are covered for its latest 27-inch Odyssey OLED G8 gaming monitor.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
