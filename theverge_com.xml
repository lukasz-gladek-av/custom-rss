            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337949/nvidia-ace-ai-npcs-pubg-ally-teammate<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia has spent the last two years showing off its digital “ACE” characters that can have in-game conversations with you using generative AI. But at CES 2025, the company is taking the ACE characters a step further by showing how they can be “autonomous game characters” — including, sometime this year, a teammate to help you get a chicken dinner in <em>PUBG</em>. </p><p>Nvidia says that ACE characters can use AI to “perceive, plan, and act like human players,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fnvidia-ace-autonomous-ai-companions-pubg-naraka-bladepoint%2F">per a blog post</a>. “Powered by generative AI, ACE will enable living, dynamic game worlds with companions that comprehend and support player goals, and enemies that adapt dynamically to player tactics.” The characters are powered by “small language models (SLMs)” that are “capable of planning at human-like frequencies required for realistic decision making” as well as “multi-modal SLMs for vision and audio that allow AI characters to hear audio cues and perceive their environment.”</p><p>As for how that will work in <em>PUBG</em>, you’ll be able to team up with the “<em>PUBG</em> Ally,” which Nvidia and <em>PUBG</em> publisher Krafton are calling the “world’s first Co-Playable Character (CPC).” The Ally will be able to “communicate using game-specific lingo, provide real-time strategic recommendations, find and share loot, drive vehicles, and fight other human players using the game’s extensive arsenal of weapons,” Nvidia says. </p><p>Basically, it sounds like an AI teammate you can talk with natural language who’s supposed to be as capable as a human. And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEKUSMqrbzQ">a video</a> shows the Ally indeed helping a player find specific loot, bringing over a vehicle, and attempting to flank opposing players. But the video is heavily edited and isn’t live, so I’m skeptical that the Ally will work as well as is being shown here.</p><p>AI characters built with ACE are coming to other games, too. <em>Naraka: Bladepoint Mobile PC Version</em> will get a “a local inference AI Teammate feature” in March 2025, while <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> on PC will get the feature “later in 2025,” according to Nvidia’s blog post. “AI Teammates powered by NVIDIA ACE can join your party, battling alongside you, finding you specific items that you need, swapping gear, offering suggestions on skills to unlock, and making plays that’ll help you achieve victory.”</p><p>Krafton’s upcoming life simulation game called <em>inZOI </em>will also get CPCs called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk9z1upOj3U">“Smart Zoi.”</a> And Nvidia says that ACE characters can be bosses, too, and they’ll be used for boss encounters in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8XeiZ4djKw&amp;t=2s">Wemade Next’s <em>MIR5</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The 2025 Scar 16 and 18 come with RGB lights all the way around the bottom of the chassis as well as a user-programmable LED dot-matrix display on the lid, as seen on other ROG devices <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24023549/asus-rog-phone-8-pro-ai-price-release-date-specs-features-gaming-smartphone">like Asus’ gaming phones</a>. </p><p>Beneath the flashy exterior, the Scar 16 and 18 can be maxed out with an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor and Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 GPU. It can also be configured with up to 64GB of DDR5-5600 RAM and a 2TB PCIe Gen4 SSD. The ROG Nebula HDR display comprises a 16:10 2.5K Mini LED panel with a peak brightness of 1,200 nits and a 240Hz refresh rate. There are two Thunderbolt 5 ports included, and the design allows for easy access to the bottom panel for component upgrades. </p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</p><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The Strix Scar 16 and 18 have all the cooling tech you’d expect from a gaming laptop of this caliber, including an end-to-end vapor chamber and sandwiched heatsink. Combined with the Conductonaut Extreme liquid metal treatment on the GPU and CPU, Asus claims that it can keep fan noise levels to a library-like 45dB, even during extended gaming sessions.</p><p>On top of all that, the ROG Strix Scar comes with the aforementioned light show. Asus calls it AniMe Vision, and you can customize it to display personalized animations and sync it with any other AniMe Vision devices you own. Download some prebaked artwork or cook up your own using <a href="https://rog.asus.com/content/anime-matrix-pixel-editor/">Asus’ pixel editor</a> — the choice is yours.</p><p>The ROG Strix Scar starts at $2,599; Asus says its new gaming laptops will begin shipping in February.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335012/asus-rog-flow-z13-gaming-tablet-amd-ryzen-max-plus-price-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asus has a new version of its Surface Pro-like gaming tablet for CES, and it’s making some sizable changes both inside and out. The Asus ROG Flow Z13 for 2025 is once again a slightly chunky, almost-half-inch-thick, 13-inch tablet with a built-in kickstand, magnetic keyboard cover, a bunch of ports, and a clear window on its rear with RGB lighting to show off its innards.</p><p>That fun glass window is now larger, with a direct view of the motherboard, but the biggest change for the ROG Flow Z13 is its switch to integrated graphics. That may seem like a step backward for a gaming-focused tablet since gamers covet dedicated GPUs, but Asus is outfitting it with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337025/amd-ryzen-ai-max-strix-halo-fire-range-9955hx3d">AMD’s powerful new “Strix Halo” processor</a>. The ROG Flow Z13 can be configured with the Ryzen AI Max 390 for $1,999.99 or the Ryzen AI Max Plus 395 for $2,199.99. The top-end model with the Max Plus 395 has 16 CPU cores and 40 graphics cores, while the base-model Ryzen AI Max Plus 390 (curse these names) has 12 CPU cores and 32 graphics cores. The Z13 utilizes a redesigned stainless steel vapor chamber for cooling these graphics-heavy chips, which are capable of 120W TDP. </p><p>All that power in the Z13 is responsible for driving a 13-inch, 2560 x 1600 touchscreen display with a speedy 180Hz refresh rate (up from 165Hz on the last-gen model), which you don’t often find in laptops and tablets of this size. For ports, it’s got two USB 4, one USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, HDMI 2.1, a microSD card slot capable of UHS-II speeds, and a 3.5mm combination headphone / mic jack. It’s also got a 5-megapixel front-facing webcam and 13-megapixel rear-facing camera — so you can flash your RGB as you awkwardly take tablet photos in public. It also has Wi-Fi 7.</p><p>The Z13 supports USB-C Power Delivery for charging, but that won’t be powerful enough to allow its full performance under load. Instead, it comes with a 200W power adapter that uses Asus’ proprietary and reversible slim power jack — like on its recent laptops.</p><p>Other quality-of-life improvements for the Z13 include a new detachable keyboard with larger keycaps and a more generously sized touchpad. And on its right side, beside the power button and volume rocker, is a new “ScreenXpert” button that summons a Command-Center-like widget that includes multiple-display window management controls, quick access to operating modes like Turbo mode or Silent mode, and other settings like muting your mic. It’s primarily there to help control things while in tablet mode since the keyboard contains shortcuts for most of these functions.</p><p>I got a quick glimpse of the new ROG Flow Z13 at a preview event, and Asus sent me a preproduction model right before CES to get a little bit of hands-on time. It’s what I’m writing this post on right now, and boy do I appreciate the updates to this keyboard cover. The 1.7mm key travel and bigger touchpad go a long way toward getting work done. While the Ryzen 395 chip has the potential to be power-hungry, the battery life on the Z13 shows some promise. Asus is only claiming 10 hours of battery life, and I did manage to get through a full eight-plus-hour workday of Chrome tabs, streaming music (though the speakers seem kind of bad at first listen), and writing across multiple virtual desktops the day before flying to CES — with pretty much no issues.</p><p>I definitely prefer a proper laptop to a tablet with a kickstand and keyboard cover, but being able to remove the keyboard deck for a little more flexibility and comfort when it’s time to fire up a game is pretty slick. I tried out a little <em>Helldivers 2 </em>on the Flow Z13, and it performed quite well, especially for a tablet. Set to the Z13’s native 2.5K resolution, in-game render scale on Ultra Quality, and texture details on medium, I saw 60fps or just slightly under, and it looked really nice. If I bumped it down from Ultra Quality to Quality scaling, it jumped up to an even smoother 80fps. This was, of course, while the tablet was plugged in and its fans were blasting on Turbo mode. Diving in again while unplugged dropped the Ultra Quality render scale performance down to the 45 to 50fps range since playing on battery limits you to Performance mode instead of Turbo.</p><p>This is preproduction hardware, but so far, it’s pretty impressive for integrated graphics. AMD’s new chip might have something special here for thin and light devices, but since it lacks Thunderbolt 5, that means the Flow Z13 can’t use the full GPU bandwidth of Asus’ new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/24100176">XG Mobile eGPU</a>. (Previous models could use the older XG Mobile via its proprietary connector.) But of course, that would make this somewhat portable PC gaming solution a little less portable, and the new XG Mobile costs about as much as the Flow Z13 itself.</p><p>But does a gaming tablet make much sense in 2025 when portable PC gaming is being so adequately served by the Steam Deck and a bunch of other dedicated handhelds? We’ll have to see how a production model of the ROG Flow Z13 fares when it launches sometime in February.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

Di Benedetto / The Verge</p></div><p><time datetime="2025-01-07T04:00:00.000Z"> <!-- -->Jan 7, 2025, 4:00 AM UTC</time></p><div><h2>Share this story</h2></div></div></div><div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Razer announced it’s overhauling the Razer Blade 16 inside and out. In addition to a new CPU and GPU, the Blade 16 is now thinner overall than the outgoing 2024 model and comes with a few tweaks to its audio system and keyboard. </p><p>The new Blade 16 comes with up to a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU and a “next-gen Nvidia<strong> </strong>GPU.” The company also bumped its speaker array from four to six speakers, while the display carries over the 240Hz OLED <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/4/24024217/razer-gaming-laptop-updates-blade-16-18-oled-4k-ces">introduced to the line last year</a>. This is the first time Razer has put an AMD processor in the Blade 16.</p><p>Razer says it’s packing all of that into a chassis that’s over 30 percent thinner than last year’s model at just 0.59 inches — or 14.9 millimeters — thick<strong> </strong>in the front and 0.69 inches (17.4mm) in the back, not including the feet. For reference, the 16-inch MacBook Pro M4 is 0.61 inches (15.5mm) thick, including feet. The new Razer Blade&nbsp;is also deeper than last year’s model, measuring 250.5mm front to back, versus 244mm for the 2024 Blade 16. Despite all of that, Razer says it increased the travel of its keyboard keys from 1mm to 1.5mm. And there’s now a Copilot key, of course.</p><p>That thinness may come at a cost: the new Blade 16 has a 90Wh battery that it says can charge to 80 percent in about 45 minutes. The fast charging may come in handy; the larger 95.2Wh battery in the Blade 16 we <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23588660/razer-blade-16-2023-review-specs-features-design">reviewed in 2023</a> already felt like it wasn’t up to the task. That review unit was also a hot laptop. Razer says it’s using a new thermal gel that covers more interior surface area than the 2023 model.</p><div><div><p><figcaption><em>The 2025 model (top) vs. the thicker 2024 model (bottom).</em></figcaption></p></div><div><figcaption><em>2024 (left) vs. 2025 (right).</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>The AMD chip it’s using might help things, though. When <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24324299/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-gaming-laptop-review-amd-strix-point">we tested an Asus ROG Zephyrus G16 with that Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU</a> against the same laptop with an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H, the AMD version ran for three hours longer in non-gaming tasks and put out slightly less heat, though Asus puts a much lower power draw cap on its gaming laptops than Razer does. Naturally, we won’t know how any of that affects the new Blade 16 until we have one in hand to test. </p><p>The 2025 Razer Blade 16 is due out in the first quarter of this year. Razer didn’t announce pricing, but you can bet it won’t be cheap.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->10</p><div><figcaption><em>The new Razer Blade 16.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Razer</cite></p></div></div></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/4/24307731/ces-2025-tvs-gaming-smart-home-wearables-news"><h2>CES 2025: all the news, gadgets, and surprises</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24325799/dell-pro-max-premium-plus-ces-laptop-pc-rebrand-announcement"><h2>Dell kills the XPS brand</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337396/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-5070-ti-5070-price-release-date"><h2>Nvidia announces next-gen RTX 5090 and 5080 GPUs</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337117/microsoft-bing-search-results-google-design-trick"><h2>Microsoft is using Bing to trick people into thinking they’re on Google</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336154/samsung-the-frame-pro-features-specs"><h2>Samsung announces The Frame Pro: could this be the perfect TV?</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></main><div><h2>More from this stream<!-- --> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/4/24307731/ces-2025-tvs-gaming-smart-home-wearables-news">CES 2025: all the news, gadgets, and surprises</a></h2><ul><li><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335238/msi-gaming-laptops-cyborg-stealth-raider-vector-nvidia-rtx-intel-amd-ces">MSI’s 2025 gaming laptops have the latest from Nvidia, Intel, and AMD — plus lots of RGB</a></h3><p><time datetime="2025-01-07T04:00:00.000Z"> <!-- -->Jan 7, 2025, 4:00 AM UTC</time></p></li><li><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335564/alienware-27-inch-4k-240hz-oled-price-date">Alienware’s 27-inch 4K 240Hz OLED monitor is only a couple months away</a></h3><p><time datetime="2025-01-07T04:00:00.000Z"> <!-- -->Jan 7, 2025, 4:00 AM UTC</time></p></li><li><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335027/msi-titan-18-dragon-edition-norse-myth-gaming-laptop-ces-price-specs">The Titan Dragon Edition is MSI’s latest all-out gaming laptop</a></h3><p><time datetime="2025-01-07T04:00:00.000Z"> <!-- -->Jan 7, 2025, 4:00 AM UTC</time></p></li><li><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24332341/alienware-area-51-16-18-rgb-laptop-price-specs-ces">Alienware’s new Area-51 laptops have light-up trackpads and fans</a></h3><p><time datetime="2025-01-07T04:00:00.000Z"> <!-- -->Jan 7, 2025, 4:00 AM UTC</time></p></li></ul><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/4/24307731/ces-2025-tvs-gaming-smart-home-wearables-news">See all <!-- -->177<!-- --> stories</a> </div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The panel covers 95 percent of the Display P3 and 99 percent of the sRGB color gamuts, and it has support for G-Sync and FreeSync Premium. For video inputs, it has one DisplayPort 1.4 port and two HDMI 2.1 ports, plus a 65W USB-C Power Delivery port with alt mode support for DisplayPort. It also has two USB-A 2.0 ports for peripherals, 3.5mm for audio (plus four built-in 3W speakers), and even an ethernet jack.</p><p>The hardware specs don’t jump off the page compared to other gaming monitors in its class, but the Google TV integration sets it apart. You’ll find it familiar if you’ve used a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/6/24214471/google-chromecast-line-discontinued">Chromecast</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/6/24214055/google-tv-streamer-features-price-matter-thread">Google TV Streamer</a>, or select <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/1/23619895/sony-2023-tv-lineup-bravia-xr-features">TVs from Sony</a>, Hisense, and the like. It delivers recommendations based on your watch history, and you can use Google Assistant voice commands to search for specific content within its deep library of apps as it pulls options from all available sources. You can also cast content from supported mobile apps. Most other smart monitors, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/31/24020920/lg-myview-4k-smart-monitor-display-tv-webos">LG’s MyView line</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23735566/samsung-smart-monitor-2023-m80c-m70c-m50c-tv">Samsung M series</a>, use their own custom operating systems, and most of them are more focused on productivity than gaming.</p><p>The Omen 32x also has some unique tricks we haven’t seen before, such as native support for streaming your screen to four platforms — including Twitch, YouTube, and Instagram — simultaneously with no additional hardware. It can stream up to two webcam sources in addition to what’s on your screen. You can also mirror your Android-based smartphone to the display and use it in desktop mode within a multiview window while you’re gaming. HP even built in wireless KVM functionality, allowing you to operate everything using the same keyboard and mouse.</p><div><figcaption><em>HP’s 2025 G2 monitors, like the pictured Omen 34c G2, have a minimum 180Hz refresh rate.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: HP</cite></p></div><p>HP is also updating its mainstream G2 line of monitors for 2025, including the $479.99 Omen 34c G2, a 34-inch WQHD curved ultrawide (21:9) display with FreeSync Premium, DisplayHDR 400, and a 4,000:1 contrast ratio. We’re also getting new 27-inch 16:9 options in the 1080p Omen 27 G2 for $249.99 in May, the QHD Omen 27q G2 for $299.99 in April, and the QHD 27qs G2 for $449.99 in June. </p><p>All will benefit from factory color calibration for the first time, and the former three will support boosted refresh rates up to 180Hz. The 27qs G2, however, is distinguished as the only monitor in the G2 lineup with an IPS Black display and the first ever with a 280Hz refresh rate. IPS Black displays are said to offer higher contrast ratios (2,000:1 on the 27qs G2) and better color accuracy than ordinary IPS panels.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The company announced its Titan 18 HX laptop at CES 2025. It’s an 18-inch behemoth with an illuminated touchpad, Intel’s Core Arrow Lake processor, and Nvidia’s new RTX 50-series GPU for a starting price of around $5,000. </p><p>But is that really outrageous enough?</p><p>It’d be much wilder to also release a fully unhinged Titan adorned with dragon designs and runes inspired by Norse mythology. And that’s exactly what MSI is doing with its Titan 18 HX Dragon Edition Norse Myth. It has the innards of the standard Titan, complete with a new dedicated heat pipe cooler just for its PCIe Gen5 SSD to maximize transfer speeds, and it adds a massive etching of a hand-drawn dragon head to its lid as well as a 3D-printed dragon coin under glass within the palm rest. Now we’re talking.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>According to MSI, those Norse runes on the lid mean “Dragon Edition.”</em></figcaption></p></div><p>We’re still awaiting pricing information, but spec-wise, this thing is roaring. It packs an Intel Core Ultra 9 285HX CPU, Nvidia RTX 5090 GPU with 24GB of GDDR7 VRAM, up to 96GB of DDR5 RAM, one slot of Gen5 NVMe M.2 storage, and three extra slots of Gen4 SSD storage.</p><p>It has an 18-inch 4K Mini LED screen capable of 3840 x 2400 (16:10) resolution at 120Hz refresh, a six-speaker audio setup (two of which are woofers), Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, Cherry mechanical keyboard switches with per-key RGB illumination, a 99.9Wh battery, and a power adapter capable of delivering 400-freaking-watts. </p><p>For I/O, you get two Thunderbolt 5 USB-C ports, three USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports, HDMI 2.1, gigabit ethernet, and a full-size SD card slot. This whole fire-breathing magnesium alloy package weighs in at a <em>hefty</em> 3.6 kg / 7.94 lbs, but it’s somehow not as heavy as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/24096382">Alienware’s boat anchor of a new 18-inch Area-51 laptop</a>.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</p><p><figcaption><em>The inlaid dragon medallion has some nice detail work within it.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>MSI has done Dragon Edition laptops before, but compared to previous incarnations, the new Titan Dragon Edition looks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22227970/msi-ge76-raider-dragon-edition-ge66-tiamat-gaming-laptop-nvidia-rtx-3000-series">more fierce</a> and actually less garish — just <a href="https://www.msi.com/Laptop/GT70_Dragon_Edition/Specification">look at this old thing</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/alienware%E2%80%99s-new-area-51-laptops-have-light-up-trackpads-and-fans.1075602/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24332341/alienware-area-51-16-18-rgb-laptop-price-specs-ces<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Alienware is bringing back its Area-51 computer line, and its new flagship laptops are much showier than the secretive air base they’re named after. The bombastic, UFO-like Area-51 laptops are paired with a range of top-flight specs featuring Intel Arrow Lake CPUs and next-gen Nvidia GPUs — coming in two sizes: big (16-inch) and bigger (18-inch). They’ll start at a pricey $3,199 when select configurations launch by the end of Q1 2025, with an entry-level $1,999 model and other configs coming later.</p><p>Unlike last year’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24026555/dell-alienware-m16-r2-ces-2024-gaming-laptop">M16 R2</a>, which trimmed down the protruding butt found on many Alienware laptops, the Area-51 has a full-on dump truck for a rear. And this protrusion, where all its ports are located, even lights up with a soft, supple glow of RGB illumination. The Area-51’s RGB light show extends to per-key keyboard illumination, a light-up trackpad, and lit case fans. The light-up fans are visible through the intake holes on the top deck as well as a seethrough Gorilla Glass panel on the underside, also showing off some of the laptop’s innards.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The teal case color has a bit of a shimmer in the right light.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The Area-51 duo will rely on their RGB lighting for their splashiest pops of color, as both sizes of Alienware laptops come in just one chassis color, called liquid teal. The anodized finish is said to take inspiration from the aurora borealis, looking nearly charcoal black in a dimly lit room until its lid or underside shows a slight shimmer of iridescence when the light catches it.</p><p>Housed within that aluminum chassis, the Area-51 sports some high-end specs. It can be outfitted with up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU, Nvidia’s new 50-series GPUs, up to 64GB of dual-channel DDR5 RAM, and up to 2TB NVMe PCIe Gen5 SSD. Powering all of that in each the 16-inch and 18-inch laptops is a sizable 96Wh battery. Alienware doesn’t list any battery life estimates in the Area-51’s tech specs. We’ve asked how many hours of use people should expect when unplugged and haven’t yet heard back. </p><p>The Area-51 duo use a new thermal architecture to keep all this hot hardware cool, and Alienware claims it moves up to 37 percent more airflow while running 15 percent quieter than the older Alienware X16 R2 from 2024. All those specs and improved thermals sound nice on paper, but keep in mind, these new Area-51 models are hefty laptops. Remember that older X16 R2 laptop that Alienware compares them to? The X16 R2 weighs six pounds. At 7.6 pounds, the new 16-inch Area-51 weighs about as much as the average American newborn baby, and the 18-inch is even heavier at nearly 10 pounds.</p><div><div><p><figcaption><em>The seethrough glass panel on the bottom has some alien-like glyphs.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>That absolute unit of a derriere offers lots of I/O.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>Tipping the scales like that, the Area-51 laptops don’t feel like just a resurrection of Alienware’s flagship brand name but a throwback to older, basically immobile desktop replacement laptops. That does come with some benefits, like a plethora of rear-mounted ports including HDMI 2.1, 2.5 gigabit ethernet (RJ-45), three USB Type-A 3.2 Gen 1 5Gbps ports, two Thunderbolt 5 / USB-C ports, and a headphone jack and full-size SD card slot on the side. </p><p>The big drawback here is that the displays also feel a little retro, since the laptops use older IPS display tech. Both machines have 2560 x 1600 QHD panels with 3ms response time and up to 300Hz refresh (240Hz on the 16-inch), but there’s no fancy tandem OLED or anything of the sort like Alienware’s parent company Dell put in its upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/24092096">Pro Premium laptop</a>. If you want OLED displays from Alienware, you’ll instead have to check out its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23011794/alienware-aw3423dw-review-qd-oled-curved-gaming-pc-monitor">gaming monitors</a> — of which, it announced a new 27-inch 4K QD-OLED at CES 2025 as well as some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/24099606">Area-51 and Aurora prebuilt desktops. </a></p><p><em> Photography by Antonio G.

The Omen Max 16 has a light bar on the front of its metal body (black or white) that can reflect off your desk, and you can control the colors using Omen Light Studio software. HP’s HyperX brand is also launching an incredibly modular Pulsefire Saga Pro gaming mouse that lets you swap out buttons and body components to your liking.</p><div><figcaption><em>HyperX Pulsefire Saga Pro modular gaming mouse.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G.

Today, the company announced the EliteBook Ultra G1i, the Intel version of the laptop that launched in 2024 with Qualcomm chips. And the EliteBook X and convertible X Flip, which launched with AMD chips last year, now have Intel G1i versions as well.</p><p>You can configure EliteBooks with privacy screens, which makes it harder for onlookers to see what you’re doing while you work in public.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->7</p><div><figcaption><em>EliteBook X and X Flip.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G.
