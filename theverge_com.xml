            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347034/marvel-snap-banned-tiktok-bytedance<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The divest-or-ban law <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/18/24346961/tiktok-shut-down-banned-in-the-us">aimed at TikTok</a> is also taking down other ByteDance-linked apps, including the popular card game <em>Marvel Snap</em>. The app suddenly cut off access Saturday night, seemingly without warning, surprising gamers who weren’t aware of its connection to ByteDance.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/19/23413064/marvel-snap-second-dinner-hearthstone-ios-android">card game battler set in the Marvel universe</a> is developed by Second Dinner, which is based in California. But the game is published by Nuverse, a company owned by ByteDance. As a result, it’s subject to the same shutdown order. </p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880850204095811821">a statement on X</a>, Second Dinner called the takedown a surprise and said, “Marvel Snap isn’t going anywhere. We’re actively working on getting the game up as soon as possible and will update you once we have more to share.”</p><p>Just before the calendar turned over to January 19th, 2025, the game disappeared from the App Store for iPad and iPhone players and from Google Play for players on Android. For players on PC, the game is still listed in Steam at the moment, but <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1997040/discussions/0/510696076432380503/">many players</a> are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelSnap/comments/1i4pmgy/comment/m7xogf3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reporting</a> they were signed out and can’t sign back in.</p><p>An in-game message now tells players:</p><div><blockquote><p>Sorry, Marvel Snap isn’t available right now</p><p>A law banning Marvel Snap has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use Marvel Snap for now. Rest assured, we’re working to restore our service in the U.S. Please stay tuned!</p></blockquote></div><p>Oddly, unlike TikTok, it doesn’t appear that players were given much warning about the law’s effect, and many people may not have realized it was even connected to ByteDance, including people who were still spending money on in-game items expecting to be able to keep playing it. </p><p>Other ByDance apps quickly disappeared from app stores along with TikTok, including Lemon8 and CapCut. The effect on other ByteDance-linked apps is mixed; however, it may take time to remove them. The <a href="https://www.larksuite.com/">Lark app</a> that offers a Slack-like collaboration platform was available initially but has now been removed, while other Nuverse-published games, like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9-%E3%83%AA%E3%83%90%E3%82%A4%E3%83%90%E3%83%AB-%E5%9C%B0%E4%B8%AD%E6%B7%B1%E3%81%8F%E3%81%B8/id1665908849"><em>Earth: Revival - Deep Underground</em></a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/ragnarok-x-3rd-anniversary/id1545808948?mt=8"><em>Ragnarok X: 3rd Anniversary</em></a><em>,</em> are still available in the App Store as of this writing, just after midnight ET on the 19th.</p><p><em><strong>Update, January 19th: </strong>Noted reports that Marvel Snap PC players can’t log in and added </em><a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880850204095811821"><em>a statement</em></a><em> from game developer Second Dinner.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/18/24346862/genshin-impact-developer-20-million-fine-ftc-data-lootboxes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/genshin-impact-game-developer-will-be-banned-selling-lootboxes-teens-under-16-without-parental">announced on Friday</a> that <em>Genshin Impact</em> developer Cognosphere has agreed to a $20 million settlement and several restrictions on how it sells its loot boxes and manages children’s personal data. According to the FTC, the company “actively marketed” its loot boxes to children and misled players about their odds of winning prizes.</p><p>Cognosphere allegedly also “deceived children and other users about the real costs of in-game transactions,” by requiring them to buy virtual money that involved multiple currency exchanges. Players often spent “hundreds of dollars on prizes they stood little chance of winning,” according to Bureau of Consumer Protection Director Samuel Levine. For years, loot boxes have been likened to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18226852/loot-boxes-gaming-regulation-gambling-free-to-play">a form of legal gambling</a>. </p><p>The complaint, filed by the Department of Justice, also accuses the <em>Genshin Impact</em> developer of marketing to kids using approaches like posts on social media channels and in-game banners. The company then allegedly collected their personal information in violation of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule. Once the settlement is approved, the company is required to delete any data for children under 13 whose parents haven’t consented to their data being collected.</p><p>Other requirements of the settlement include that Cognosphere must offer an option to buy loot boxes directly and not just through virtual money. It’s also forbidden from misrepresenting pricing, features, and winning odds for loot boxes, and it must disclose exchange rates for multi-tiered virtual currency. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
