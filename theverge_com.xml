The system is a hybrid handheld console just like the original Nintendo Switch, which has gone on to sell <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/605948/nintendo-switch-lifetime-sales-nintendo-ds">over 150 million units</a> after eight years. The Switch 2 can play most digital and physical games released for the first Nintendo Switch, and both Nintendo and Switch game developers are pushing game updates to further improve backwards compatibility. The new system can run some (but not all) original Switch games at higher resolutions and frame rates than the older console thanks to patches or paid Switch 2 Edition upgrades. My colleague Andrew Webster called the Switch 2 “the Switch, just better” in <em>The Verge’s </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">review</a>.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/691190/nintendo-switch-2-restock-best-buy]]></content:encoded>

If you fall into the latter bucket, you may appreciate knowing that HP is offering <strong>20 percent off its latest Omen gaming laptops</strong>, which are equipped with Nvidia’s powerful RTX 50-series graphics chips. Using coupon code <strong>LEVELUP20</strong> at checkout knocks hundreds off a batch of configurations, including one I think is a particularly good value.</p><p>If you click <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/ConfigureView?langId=-1&amp;storeId=10151&amp;catalogId=10051&amp;catEntryId=3074457345621934320&amp;urlLangId=&amp;quantity=1" rel="sponsored">this link</a>, you’ll navigate to HP’s customization page for the 17.3-inch Omen laptop. Once you’re there, click on “esports pro” (even if you don’t identify as one), and you’ll see the configuration that I think is the best deal. It features a 17.3-inch QHD IPS screen with variable refresh rate support (from 48Hz going up to 240Hz). Powering this unit is an AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 processor and the aforementioned Nvidia RTX 5070 graphics chip with 8GB of video RAM. It includes 16GB of DDR5 5600MHz RAM and a 1TB PCIe 4.0 SSD (both the memory and storage can be upgraded later on, if you want). It originally sold for $2,149.99, but entering the promo code knocks the price down to $1,399.99.</p><div><p id="other-deals-we-think-are-great"><h2>Other deals we think are great</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>If you enjoy spooky video games, the remake of<strong> <em>Silent Hill 2</em></strong> was one of 2024’s best games. Your patience (or perhaps your ignorance of its existence) has been rewarded with a huge discount, one that knocks 55 percent off its original price of $69.99. You can snag a Steam PC code on the cheap from <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/silent-hill-2?add_voucher=OMENVIP" rel="sponsored">Fanatical</a>, where it costs $31.25 when you enter offer code <strong>OMENVIP</strong> at checkout (it may apply automatically). Thanks to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lsbnrcvijk2z">Wario64</a> for surfacing this one.</span></li><li><span>Acer’s Chromebook Spin 714 has long been a technical showcase, at least as far as Chromebooks are concerned. And now the company’s latest model, the <strong>Chromebook Plus Spin 714</strong>, is down to $579 at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Facer-chromebook-plus-spin-714-laptop-with-google-ai-14-wuxga-touch-intel-core-ultra-5-115u-8gb-lpddr5-256gb-ssd-steel-gray%2F6576960.p%3FskuId%3D6576960" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, which is $220 off its original $799 price. You’re not alone in thinking that even the discounted price is costly, but it’s one of the best models you can buy if you’re looking for something that’s built like a premium, long-lasting laptop. The 714 features a 14-inch 1,920 x 1,200 touchscreen with Intel’s Cure Ultra 5 115U processor, 8GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 256GB SSD. It also features two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports and a full-size HDMI port. Buying any Chromebook Plus device this year (such as this one) will also get you free access to Google’s AI Pro plan for one year, which includes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/651239/google-criticized-over-its-sparse-gemini-2-5-pro-safety-report">Gemini 2.5 Pro</a>, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/673719/google-veo-3-ai-video-audio-sound-effects">Veo 3</a> AI video generator, and 2TB of cloud storage.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/691109/hp-omen-5070-gaming-laptop-silent-hill-2-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
