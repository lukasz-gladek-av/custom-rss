Now, Valve has a notice designed to warn Steam users when they visit an early access game’s store page if it’s been a minute since the last update. If the dev’s lofty goals for a 1.0 release were a little too lofty, then it’s probably time to do some due diligence before spending money on what may be abandonware.</p><p>Valve hasn’t formally announced the feature, but both <em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-now-includes-a-warning-flagging-potentially-abandoned-early-access-games">Eurogamer</a> </em>and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/steam-now-warns-you-if-that-early-access-game-youre-eyeing-up-has-been-abandoned-by-its-devs/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a> point it out as first highlighted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lhgj6fphkx2y">SteamDB</a>. One example where you can see this warning in action is the store listing for <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F321830%2FCavern_Kings%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Cavern Kings</em></a>, which flags that its developers have not updated the game in over eight years.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>A screenshot of the </em>Cavern Kings<em> store page on Steam shows its warning to players that it’s likely abandoned.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>That’s probably long enough to safely say the game is abandoned (though the developer has since worked on <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1184760%2FShovel_Knight_Pocket_Dungeon%2F" rel="sponsored">another title</a>). On the other hand, Pirate Software’s <em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F567380%2FHeartbound%2F" rel="sponsored">Heartbound</a></em> currently has a warning for not being updated in 13 months. And the recent “mostly negative” user reviews track with that. But the developer just <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F567380%2Fview%2F516325480311292020" rel="sponsored">posted an update note</a> in January to explain the hiatus, and also <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F567380%3Femclan%3D103582791458518140%26emgid%3D508445172204307048" rel="sponsored">dropped a patch days ago</a> on February 1st. So, this may not be a fully fleshed-out or foolproof feature just yet.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
