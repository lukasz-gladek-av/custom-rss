            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300511/control-2-action-rpg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We already knew that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20832997/control-review-creators-thriller-ps4-xbox-pc">the supernatural thriller <em>Control</em></a> was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/11/23453049/control-2-sequel-remedy-entertainment">getting a sequel</a>, but now Remedy has provided some more details on the game. Well, one major detail: <em>Control 2</em> will be an action RPG, seemingly deviating from the action-adventure template set by the original.</p><p>The news came during <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/">an investors presentation</a>, in which the studio revealed <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1858851495493403094">a few other tidbits</a> about its franchises: <em>Alan Wake 2</em> has sold over 1.8 million copies, the “ultimate edition” of <em>Control </em>hits Mac on February 12th, and it will also be getting a free update of some kind next year that will unlock “previously released content.”</p><p>A large part of the presentation was devoted to Remedy’s ambitious plan to build out an interconnected universe, which will span not only game franchises like <em>Control</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24279410/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-expansion-review"><em>Alan Wake</em></a>, but also film and TV. Earlier this year <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/29/24231469/control-sequel-movie-tv-remedy-annapurna">the studio announced a partnership with Annapurna</a> to explore bringing its franchises to new mediums, and today creative director Sam Lake said that the process is still in its “very early steps.” Last month <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/17/24272812/fbc-firebreak-is-its-own-fully-formed-thing">Remedy also revealed <em>FBC: Firebreak</em></a>, its first multiplayer game, which is tied to its other games.</p><p>“<em>Alan Wake</em>, <em>Control</em>, and <em>Firebreak</em> are all set in the Remedy connected universe,” Lake explained during the presentation. “Now, there are many fictional universes out there of course. But in games, an original universe that contains multiple franchises is a unique concept.” Earlier in the presentation, Lake noted that “What we create at Remedy is special, and we must never lose that.”</p><p>As for how far along these games are, Remedy says that <em>Firebreak</em> is in “full production,” while <em>Control 2</em> is in “production readiness.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
