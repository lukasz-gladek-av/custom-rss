            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/664621/deltarune-nintendo-switch-2-launch-time<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The paid release of <em>Deltarune</em>, Toby Fox’s episodic <em>Undertale</em> spinoff, will be available for most people at the same time the Nintendo Switch 2 launches in Japan, Fox says in the <a href="https://toby.fangamer.com/newsletters/release-time/"><em>Deltarune</em> newsletter for May 2025</a>. <em>Deltarune’s</em> first two chapters, released in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18047410/undertale-spinoff-sequel-deltarune-toby-fox">2018</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22677626/toby-fox-undertale-sequel-deltarune-chapter-2-release-date-mac-pc">2021</a> respectively, were free, but this new release, which adds chapters 3 and 4, will be a paid version that costs $24.99. </p><p>How the release timing will work is a little confusing, but let me explain. For PS4, PS5, Steam, and the original Switch, <em>Deltarune</em> will launch on June 5th at 12AM in Japan, which translates to June 4th at 11AM ET / 8AM PT for people in the US.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 version of <em>Deltarune</em>, on the other hand, will launch at midnight local time in most regions on June 5th. This decision actually means that people in New Zealand or Australia who get a Switch 2 at midnight have a slight head start. “But, for convenience’s sake, we’re just going to ignore you guys and pretend that the game is not out… Meanwhile, don’t say anything about it please,” Fox says.</p><p>Future updates to <em>Deltarune</em> will be added for free, Fox said in a newsletter last month, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83-uYZHgQ6Y">Switch 2 version</a> will have a special room that takes advantage of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642493/nintendo-switch-mouse-controls-metroid-prime-4">console’s mouse controls</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>PS5 users can now buy games in the PlayStation Store using a new payment method: Apple Pay. You could use Apple Pay in the browser or via the mobile app <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/store/payment-methods-accepted-on-ps-store/#accepted">already</a>, but now the method joins other on-console options like using a saved credit or debit card, and PayPal.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/05/09/ps5-apple-pay/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a>, you may now see a new option for Apple Pay available at checkout. It’s using the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177851/apple-ios-18-pay-chrome-scanning-code-wwdc-2024">QR code-style method</a> that Apple introduced on iOS 18 last year, and also lets you buy things on third-party browsers like Chrome. The <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/store/ps-store-apple-pay-payment/#applepay">PlayStation support page for using Apple Pay</a> has more information on which regions this works in, which includes the US.</p><p>Once you select the game you want on your PS5, choose Apple Pay, then scan the code on your TV screen with your iPhone. iOS will then pull up a checkout screen that lets you confirm the transaction. And if you’re an Apple Card user, that means your PS5 purchases are good for 2 percent cash back as well. <em>9to5Mac</em> also says Apple Pay may come to PS4 consoles as well after a future software update.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
