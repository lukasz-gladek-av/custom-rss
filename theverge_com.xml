He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After using the original <em>Pokémon</em> theme song <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/785288/pokemon-theo-von-dhs-ice">in a montage of ICE raids</a>, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is using another popular video game franchise to promote itself on social media: <em>Halo</em>. This morning, the DHS posted an image featuring <em>Halo</em> characters, a Warthog vehicle from the games, and the text “DESTROY THE FLOOD” and a link to ICE’s recruitment website. The DHS captioned <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1982819431894901043">the post</a>, “finishing this fight.”</p><p>Like with its <em>Pokémon</em>-themed post, which was captioned, “Gotta Catch ‘Em All,” the DHS’s <em>Halo</em> post implicitly compares immigrants to creatures from video games — this time, the parasitic alien species called the Flood.</p><div><p>The DHS’s post was the culmination of a social media exchange between the Trump administration and video game retailer GameStop, based on a joke that Trump had overseen the <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1982587953676247375">end of the “console wars”</a> thanks to the announcement of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805174/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-xbox-ps5-release-date"><em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> remake</a> for PlayStation next year. GameStop, whose CEO and chairman Ryan Cohen has been <a href="https://x.com/ryancohen/status/1849974769338220754">a vocal supporter of Trump,</a> quoted the joke with a picture of Trump <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982619455797821810">shaking hands with <em>Halo</em> protagonist Master Chief.</a> The White House followed up with an image of Trump in <a href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1982638578913206632">a suit of armor similar to Master Chief’s,</a> and GameStop responded with its own <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982654845166428607">photoshopped Master Chief Trump</a>, adding a meme-ified version of Vice President JD Vance’s head swapped onto what looks to be the feminine anthropomorphic AI Cortana.</p></div><p>Microsoft declined to comment about the DHS’s post, and didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the White House’s and GameStop’s posts. The Pokémon Company International, in response to <em>Pokémon</em> being associated with Trump’s mass deportation campaign, previously said in a statement <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/pokemon-torches-dhs-over-gotta-catch-em-all-ice-raid-stunt/">to <em>The Daily Beast</em></a> that “our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content, and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property.”</p><p><em><strong>Correction, October 27th</strong>: The Pokémon Company International provided the statement to The Daily Beast, not Nintendo, as we originally stated.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/807514/trump-white-house-dhs-ice-halo-image-meme-gamestop-console-wars]]></content:encoded>
