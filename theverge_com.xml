He joined in 2018, and after a two-year stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Between increased <a href="https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">tariffs</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762410/sony-ps5-price-hike-raise-digital-pro">price hikes</a>, it’s not a great time to buy a PlayStation 5 console. That is, unless you head over to <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fsony-playstation-5-console---playstation-plus-premium-24-month-subscription-bundle%2F406472.html" rel="sponsored">GameStop</a>, which is selling the <strong>825GB PS5 with a disc drive in its original (thicker) design along with 24 months of PS Plus Premium</strong> included for just $579.99 (previously $749.99). Given that the <a href="https://sonyps.prf.hn/click/camref:1101l5nbBL/%5Bp_id:1011l394533%5D/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-consoles%2Fplaystation5-console-1-tb" rel="sponsored">slimmer 1TB disc-based model</a> is $549.99, this is a phenomenal deal that nets out to you paying just a little extra for two years of Sony’s top-tier online subscription (a $320 value).</p><p>PS Plus Premium costs $17.99 per month, or $160 per year, and it’s a great way to play more games without buying them individually. New games arrive every month (recent additions include the spooky <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake and <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>’s remake), and you can continue to play them so long as you maintain a subscription. Not only that, the service enables online multiplayer, and gives you access to a large roster of games, from current-gen titles and dating back to the PS1-era.</p><p>While the original version of the PlayStation 5 has been succeeded by the slimmer, slightly more power-efficient revision, the hardware differences as it pertains to any performance-related advantages the newer model has over the launch edition are nil. You can still add on an affordable PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSD to boost the storage space, you can customize it with snap-on shells, and it can run any PS5 game out there.</p><div><p id="some-other-verge-approved-deals"><h2>Some other Verge-approved deals</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>The <strong>last-gen Google Pixel Watch 3 in the 45mm Wi-Fi configuration</strong> is $100 off at <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D91268TH/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, resulting in its lowest price yet. You can grab this model for $199.99 in the matte black aluminum case (with obsidian band), the champagne gold aluminum model (with hazel band), or the polished silver aluminum option (with porcelain band). Whether you’re upgrading from a previous version of the Pixel Watch, or jumping right in with Google’s ecosystem, you’re picking a good smartwatch that’s $150 cheaper than the superb <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/795383/google-pixel-watch-4-review-android-smartwatch-gemini-wearable">Pixel Watch 4</a>. <em>Verge </em>reviewer Victoria Song praised the brighter screens, better battery life, and the smaller bezels of the entire Pixel Watch 3 line. She also singled out the 45mm model because “it wears small,” and because its larger size means that its 35-percent bigger battery (compared to the 41mm edition) lets it last longer. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24239115/google-pixel-watch-3-review-smartwatch-wear-os-wearable">Read our review.</a></span></li><li><span>It’s not common for <strong>Nintendo’s Joy-Con controllers</strong> for the Switch to get any sort of meaningful discount, but you can get a set of neon pink and green ones at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fjoy-con-l-r-wireless-controllers-for-nintendo-switch-neon-pink-neon-green%2FJ7GSL57SJ7" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> for $64.99 (was $89.99). These can slide onto a Nintendo Switch, of course, but they’re compatible wirelessly with a Switch 2 console, as well. If you want to recharge them via your Switch 2, you’ll need an extra accessory for that, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F2N1GPK8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Fastsnail’s $19.99 product</a> that can simultaneously charge any combination of four Joy-Con or Joy-Con 2.</span></li><li><span>Workout gear can get expensive, but good sweat-ready wireless earbuds don’t need to cost you dearly. <strong>Anker’s Soundcore Sport X20</strong> are down to their lowest price yet at <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-True-Wireless-Extendable-Cancelling-Waterproof/dp/B0CRT6HQ82/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, costing $55.99 (was $79.99, but the previous best was $64). These are built to be a ready-for-anything companion, with an IP68 rating that ensures that they’re waterproof, dustproof, and sweatproof. In terms of fit, these stand out compared to other similarly-priced options because of their rotatable and extendable ear hooks. Personally, I don’t trust earbuds to stay in my ears (my ear fin-equipped Pixel Buds Pro 2 struggle to stay put), but the hooks make them seem like a great, no-fuss option. Not only that, they offer active noise cancellation and 12 hours per charge (up to 48 hours if you refill them in the included charging case).</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/806949/ps5-ps-plus-premium-console-bundle-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
