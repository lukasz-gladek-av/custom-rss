In it, instead of a bald Agent 47, you play a youthful and immaculately coiffed James Bond — and that’s pretty much the biggest distinction between the two games. Watch the thirty minute stream<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/pwRpK8eoLLE?si=_fw8taB-FIX3ynmR"> here</a>.</p><p>As in <em>Hitman</em>, <em>First Light</em>’s gameplay demo featured a fancy party at a luxurious estate, lots of slow walking to blend in with the crowd, listening to ambient conversation for clues, and, of course, lots of fancy cars to drive and inevitably wreck. Basically, what IO showed of <em>First Light</em> makes the game look like <em>Hitman </em>with a fancy 007 skin. Which, honestly, probably suits a lot of players just fine.</p><p>With the success of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/18/23172898/tmnt-shredders-revenge-classic-arcade-game-interview">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredders Revenge</a> </em>and<em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610817/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a></em>, licensed games are making a big comeback. And while IO continues to update <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252511/hitman-3-review-io-interactive-accessible-storytelling-end-series">Hitman: World of Assassination</a></em> with new missions and fancy new targets, it’s been four years since the last full <em>Hitman</em> release. <em>007 First Light </em>seems like it’ll be a new way to scratch that spy thriller assassination itch and you won’t have to wait too long for it either. <em>007 First Light </em>launches on March 27th on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch 2, and PC.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770509/007-first-light-state-of-play-september-2025#comments">6<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/770509/007-first-light-state-of-play-september-2025]]></content:encoded>
