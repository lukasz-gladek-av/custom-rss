            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/644427/alienware-4k-oled-gaming-monitor-240hz-lego-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><strong>Alienware’s 27-inch 4K QD-OLED</strong>, the AW2725Q, hit shelves about a month ago. It was the first of several faster, better models to launch after being <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335564/alienware-27-inch-4k-240hz-oled-price-date">announced at CES 2025</a>, with a 240Hz refresh rate, VRR, and a high 166 pixels per inch display. In short, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/impressions/531783/alienware-qd-oled-monitor-27-4k-aw2725q-specs-impressions-buy">it rules</a>, so I’m tickled to find it already selling at a 17 percent discount at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F148HG5M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. Normally $899, it recently sank to its all-time best price of $749</p><p>If you sat out the first couple waves of OLED gaming monitor releases, you’ll find the tech has matured nicely. On top of Alienware’s 3-year warranty that protects against burn-in, the AW2725Q sports an anti-reflective coating that looks more glossy than other OLED monitors I’ve tested (not TV levels of glossy, but somewhere between matte and glossy).</p><p>Some more context on the value here: In March, Alienware <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/623428/dell-alienware-oled-monitor-aw2725d-price-release-date">announced</a> a 27-inch 1440p QD-OLED gaming monitor coming this summer for $549.99. The company acknowledged this price could change due to tariffs — even before the recent, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/business/643970/trade-war-consequences-crazy">stock market-crashing import taxes</a> were announced. That means it may not actually cost $549.99 when it comes out, so consider this monitor, with its higher resolution, higher refresh rate, and more features, a very good value for just $200 more.</p><div><p id="more-deals-and-discounts"><h2>More deals and discounts</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>The <strong>Lego Icons Atreides Royal Ornithopter set</strong> from the Dune films is down to its lowest price ever at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGXZS3J6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. A 20 percent discount may not seem like much (a final price of $131.95), but it’s the cheapest we’ve ever seen for this 1,369-piece kit. It includes the Ornithopter vehicle, plus eight mini figures, from Paul Atreides and other major and minor characters to “long Baron,” a name that I’ve lovingly given the extremely silly and tall Baron Harkonnen mini figure.</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Xbox gift cards</strong> are 10 percent off at <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=44583&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fmicrosoft%2Fp%2FN82E16832416743" rel="sponsored">Newegg</a>, so you can get $100 digital gift cards for $90. These gift cards can be used on anything available on the Xbox or Microsoft store, ranging from <em>Fortnite</em> in-game currency to snatching Game Pass, or renting a movie.</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>If you’re on the hunt for a not-too-expensive gaming laptop (and you aren’t the most discerning person when it comes to specs), this <strong>Asus TUF model</strong> sports a 16.1-inch 1080p screen with a 165Hz refresh rate. As for its internal hardware, it’s packed with the AMD Ryzen 7 7735HS, a Radeon RX7700S GPU, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 512GB SSD. Normally $1,099.99, it’s $699.99 through <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F196337518161" rel="sponsored">Best Buy’s eBay seller page</a>.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
