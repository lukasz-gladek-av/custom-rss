(For me, when I try to see the post, LinkedIn shows a message that says “this post cannot be displayed.”)</p><p>Amazon and Embracer didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. As of this writing, the <em>LOTR</em> game is <a href="https://www.amazongamestudios.com/en-us/games">still listed</a> on the Amazon Games website.</p><p>After the layoffs were announced, the developers of <em>New World: Aeternum</em>, an MMO Amazon developed in-house, said they would no longer be providing new content updates for the game, though its servers will stay live through 2026. Amazon will continue to support two MMOs that it publishes, <em>Throne and Liberty</em> and <em>Lost Ark</em>, company spokesperson Brittney Hefner told <em>The Verge</em> this week.</p><p>The planned <em>Lord of the Rings</em> game with Embracer, announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23723787/amazon-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">in 2023</a>, was Amazon’s second run at an MMO in the <em>LOTR</em> universe; the first MMO was revealed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/10/20688736/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-athlon-games-leyou-free-to-play-tolkien">in 2019</a> before being <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/17/22389533/amazon-canceled-lord-of-the-rings-game-tencent">canceled two years later</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/810383/amazon-lotr-mmo-embracer-canceled-layoffs]]></content:encoded>
