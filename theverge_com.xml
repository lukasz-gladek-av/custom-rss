            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/677317/zenimax-union-tentative-contract-cwa-microsoft<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The over 300 quality assurance workers of the ZeniMax Workers United-CWA union have reached a tentative contract agreement with Microsoft. It is the first contract agreement at Microsoft since the concerted effort to unionize the video game industry began roughly four years ago.</p><p>“This is a monumental victory for all current video game workers and for those that come after,” said Page Branson, a senior QA tester at ZeniMax, <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-reach-historic-tentative-contract-agreement-microsoft">in the press release announcing the agreement</a>. A ratification vote for the contract will take place in late June.</p><p>The union, organized by the Communications Workers of America (CWA), was formed in 2023 and was voluntarily recognized by Microsoft as a part of the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/6/23543005/microsoft-washington-post-ad-cwa-unions">labor neutrality agreement with the CWA</a>. In the two years since, the union and Microsoft engaged in contract negotiations that precipitated <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295556/video-game-developer-strike-zenimax-microsoft">a one-day strike</a> to protest return to office and outsourcing policies and, in April, a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640423/zenimax-union-cwa-strike-authorization-vote">strike authorization vote</a>.</p><p>The contract details offer up a glimpse of what workers across the industry are fighting for and what they can win. According to CWA’s press release, the contract guarantees wage increases — a big deal considering QA workers are some of the lowest-paid workers in the industry. The contract will also include protections against arbitrary dismissal, as well as crediting guidelines — another big deal, as there are numerous ways a person who worked on a video game <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-game-companies-use-credits-to-reward-or-punish-de-1840905129">can get left off its credits</a>. </p><p>While the industry’s organization efforts are ongoing, there’s been a surge in activity over the last four years. Workers at Raven Software, which was then a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard before its acquisition by Microsoft, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/21/22894964/activision-blizzard-raven-software-employees-create-game-workers-alliance-union">organized the first video game union at a AAA publisher in 2022</a>. That win kicked off a series of other high-profile unionization efforts across the industry but concentrated primarily within Microsoft — ostensibly to take advantage of the labor neutrality agreement that states that Microsoft will voluntarily recognize union efforts within the company. With ZeniMax workers finally winning a contract agreement at Microsoft, the industry has another first — one that will set a precedent for future negotiations.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/675764/polygon-guides-writers-big-friendly-guide-new-site<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A lot of <em>Polygon</em>’s staff was laid off following Vox Media’s sale of the publication to Valnet, but two of its former guides writers are launching their own guides-focused website: <em>Big Friendly Guide</em>, which you can find at <a href="https://bigfriendly.guide/">bigfriendly.guide</a>. Ryan Gilliam and Jeffrey Parkin founded and are co-owners of the site.</p><p>Guides make Gilliam “feel like I’m helping someone enjoy something that’s very important to me and I know is important to them,” he tells <em>The Verge</em>. “And so when I lost the opportunity to do that at my usual 9-to-5, I wanted to continue it.”</p><p>“I hate sounding immodest or bragging, but what Ryan and I got really good at was helping people play video games,” Parkin says. Their work on guides helps people have fun with games, he adds — and assists with things like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-guide/23728443/giant-white-stallion-horse-god-find-tame">getting a giant horse in <em>Zelda</em></a>.</p><p><em>Big Friendly Guide</em> will make most of its content available for free, and the guides themselves won’t be paywalled. But Gilliam and Parkin will also be opening a Patreon for the site as a way for people to support the work, which will also give people access to a Discord. There will be a weekly podcast that’s free for everyone and a monthly subscriber-only podcast where Gilliam and Parkin will discuss their coverage plans.</p><p>There will be ads on the site to start. “For now, at least, we’ll run ads to keep the lights on,” according to the site’s <a href="https://bigfriendly.guide/about-us/">About Us page</a>.) But the focus is more on building a community that trusts Gilliam and Parkin’s work and pays to support it. In addition to working on guides for games that interest them, Gilliam and Parkin want the community to make suggestions for guides that they can consider and respond to.</p><p>The release of <em>Big Friendly Guide</em> is just the latest outlet from <em>Polygon</em> staffers: former editor-in-chief Chris Plante launched <a href="https://postgame.substack.com/p/the-award-that-changes-the-lives">the <em>Post Games</em> podcast</a> and former curation editor Pete Volk launched <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/petevolk.bsky.social/post/3lootykftkk2v">the <em>PV Guide</em> newsletter</a>. The new outlets follow the rise of other indie gaming publications like <a href="https://aftermath.site/author/nicole-carpenter"><em>Aftermath</em></a> and <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/grow-a-garden-roblox-interview"><em>Game File</em></a>.</p><p>With <em>Big Friendly Guide</em>, Gilliam and Parkin have modest expectations. “We’re not looking to build a brand and sell it or anything,” Parkin says. “I don’t think either of us want to get particularly rich. We want to keep doing this. That’s really what it comes down to.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/677230/valorant-unreal-engine-5-replays-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Riot Games is planning to switch <em>Valorant</em>, its popular first-person tactical hero shooter, over to Unreal Engine 5 in July. The engine upgrade from Unreal Engine 4 is part of a number of new changes coming to the shooter over the coming months, including a replay system in September.</p><p><em>Valorant </em>has been running on Unreal Engine 4 since a beta of the game originally released in 2020, and Riot Games has been using Unreal 4 for more than 10 years to build the game. The upgrade to Unreal 5 will arrive with patch 11.02 at the end of July, and Riot is promising it shouldn’t disrupt gameplay.</p><p>The game’s overall look and feel should be similar, and Riot says the engine upgrade will improve framerate performance and make patch downloads faster in the future. It’ll be interesting to see what else this engine upgrade unlocks, particularly whether Riot will improve character models and animations in the future. <em>Valorant </em>players that log in while patch 11.02 is live will get a special gun buddy to commemorate the upgrade.</p><p>The second big upgrade coming to <em>Valorant </em>later this year is the long-requested replay system. It will arrive on PC first with patch 11.06 in September, followed by a release on console later this year. The replay system will let you analyze recently played competitive games at launch, and Riot is looking at adding more modes later.</p><p>The replay system should help players report cheating or bad player behavior in <em>Valorant</em>, and Riot is also adding multi-factor authentication to the game to help with smurfing in the competitive modes — where higher ranked players log into accounts to boost them. You’ll also soon be able to report accounts that are abusing rank or matchmaking.</p><p><em>Valorant</em>’s upcoming 11.0 patch later this month will also add a new map to the game, and it will be available in the competitive mode on day one. During the initial patch cycle of two weeks, rank rating (RR) losses on this new map will be cut by 50 percent while <em>Valorant </em>players get used to playing this new map.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
