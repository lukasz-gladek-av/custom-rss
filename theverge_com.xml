The movie once again stars Ben Schwartz as Sonic, Colleen  O’Shaughnessey and Idris Elba as his friends Tails and Knuckles, with Jim Carey returning as their nemesis Dr. Ivo Robotnik. <em>Sonic 3</em> will also feature the arrival of Keanu Reeves playing Sonic’s on-again off-again enemy-turned-friend Shadow The Hedgehog.</p><p>With <em>Sonic 3</em> anticipating tidy profits as North America prepares for the Christmas / New Year’s moviegoing season, developing a fourth movie makes sense. There are several <em>rogue </em>characters from the <em>Sonic</em> universe <em>aiming</em> for their <em>silver</em> screen debut. (See what I did there?) Neither<em> Variety</em> nor Paramount Pictures have confirmed any plot details or who might get their <em>Sonic </em>movie debut. We’ll probably get a hint though, in the post-credits for <em>Sonic 3</em>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/19/24325072/lenovo-legion-go-ces-event-valve-microsoft<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>“The future of gaming handhelds is coming to CES ‘25 and you have a front row seat!” the email in my inbox exclaims.</p><p>Let me translate: it looks like Lenovo just tacitly confirmed it will announce <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320477/lenovo-legion-go-s-steamos-handheld-gaming-pc-rumors">its first SteamOS handheld</a> in Las Vegas on or before January 7th, 2025. We’re expecting it to be the Steam button equipped Legion Go S that leaker Evan Blass <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320477/lenovo-legion-go-s-steamos-handheld-gaming-pc-rumors">revealed last week</a>.</p><p>Why do I say that? The January 7th event, titled “Lenovo Legion x AMD: The Future of Gaming Handhelds,” will feature a special guest: Valve SteamOS and Steam Deck co-designer Pierre-Loup Griffais. Lenovo and AMD are calling him Valve’s “Chief Design Architect” for purposes of this event. </p><p>(Most Valve employees are simply considered designers internally, since they fluidly switch between teams and tasks; I believe Griffais once told me he prefers the same, but it’s true he’s also been one of the few public faces of SteamOS and the Steam Deck. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/21/2964991/valves-handbook-for-new-employees-leak">It’s a fascinating company</a>.)</p><p>Griffais won’t be the only intriguing choice of panelist on stage: Jason Ronald, Microsoft VP of Xbox Gaming Devices and Ecosystem will also be in attendance. He's now being introduced as Microsoft’s “VP of Next Generation."</p><div><p>We exclusively shared with you last week that<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320607/lenovo-legion-go-8-leak-gamepad"> Lenovo will revamp its larger, seemingly Windows-based Legion Go with detachable controllers</a>, too. And we’re also expecting Lenovo to hedge its bets with a Windows version of the smaller Legion Go S based on those same leaks. It's a reasonable bet some, if not all of these devices will come <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/6/24237735/amd-z2-extreme-gaming-handheld-pc-chip">with AMD’s yet-to-be-detailed Z2 Extreme chips.</a></p></div><div><figcaption>A leaked image of Lenovo’s bigger Legion Go, now with seemingly more ergonomic grips and possibly an OLED panel.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image via <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks">Evan Blass</a></cite></p></div><p>Here’s the full description of the event: </p><div><blockquote><p>Join us for a cocktail reception hosted by Lenovo Legion and AMD gaming leaders, with special guests Valve and other gaming industry giants. We’ll be sharing our thoughts on what lies ahead in the gaming handheld space and showcasing our latest Lenovo Legion Go innovations advanced by AMD. Come to hear how Lenovo Legion and AMD Ryzen are making gaming more immersive for all and stay to experience the future of handheld gaming firsthand!</p></blockquote></div><p>We’re <em>not</em> currently expecting Microsoft to surprise with an Xbox handheld at the event, as gaming boss Phil Spencer has suggested that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295461/dont-expect-an-xbox-handheld-any-time-soon">might be a few years away</a>. But it’s possible that Microsoft and Lenovo will try to suggest that all handhelds are Xbox handhelds, like Microsoft does in its new “This is an Xbox” marketing campaign:</p><p>I’ll be attending, and I’ll let you know!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/19/24324936/xbox-elite-series-2-series-x-s-wireless-controller-astro-bot-ps5-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>With the holiday season in full effect, you can expect a fresh stream of Christmas noobs entering your multiplayer lobbies. If you’re on an Xbox or PC and looking to keep the pressure on during ruthless initiation rites, the <strong>Xbox Elite Series 2 Wireless Gaming Controller</strong> can help maximize your effectiveness. It’s usually a pricey spend at $179.99, but you can get the full kit with its extra back buttons, analog stick toppers, D-pads, and wireless charging dock for just $124 ($56 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SFKTLZM?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F5PX3XU5SUY6H">Walmart</a> right now, which is a new record low price. </p><p>For comparison’s sake, the Elite Series 2 Core includes none of those extras, save for the tool that lets you adjust the analog stick’s tension. The Core is appropriately cheaper as a result and starts around $94.99 ($45 off) at <a href="https://howl.link/8li1q4bsmj1v4">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-elite-core-wireless-controller-red%2F-%2FA-88533778">Target</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Elite-Wireless-Controller-Core-Controllers/dp/B0B789CGGQ?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> right now. While you can <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fcomplete-component-pack">buy the components separately for $59.99</a>, the two combined turn out to be more expensive than buying the full Elite Series 2 package. That said, it’s a viable way to get the full experience with the Core’s exclusive red, blue, and white color options.</p><p>The Elite Series 2 — usable on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows — offers the most customizability of any first-party pro-style controller and is still one of the most configurable options from any brand. In addition to hot-swappable D-pads and four removable back buttons, you can swap the analog stick tops and adjust their tension. The triggers support three different stop levels. You’ll also get extensive software-based button remapping through Xbox and Windows, but you can’t make changes on the controller itself. And the controller doesn’t use removable batteries like the official standard controllers, meaning you can’t swap in a fresh set if their capacity shrinks over time. But Microsoft says it’ll last up to 40 hours before you need to recharge, and you have convenient charging options between its USB-C cable and the included dock.</p><p><h5><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features">Read our Xbox Elite Series 2 review</a>.</h5></p><div><p>The Xbox Elite Series 2 is easily one of our favorite controllers at&nbsp;<em>The Verge</em>. It’s an improvement on the already excellent Elite controller, with deep customization, optional rear paddle buttons, a swappable D-pad, and analog sticks that allow you to tailor its layout to suit your play style.</p></div><p><h3>A few more deals</h3></p><div><ul><li>If the price of the Xbox Elite Series 2 is more than you want to pay for a fresh gamepad, the standard <strong>Xbox Series X/S Wireless Controller</strong> is also on sale at <a href="https://howl.link/2idmxf1dyvd5a">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x-s-wireless-controller-robot-white%2F-%2FA-80744785">Target</a> in white for $34.99 ($25 off), which is an all-time low price. It has no customization options outside of the remappable buttons that you can set up in Xbox and Windows, but it still offers Microsoft’s beloved ergonomics and the advantage of user-replaceable batteries — whether you go for a pair of AAs or an endless sea of rechargeable options.</li><li>If you’re partial to Roku’s incredibly easy user experience, the <strong>Roku Streaming Stick 4K</strong> can be a nice alternative to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23435393/apple-tv-4k-2022-third-gen-review-price-details">Apple TV 4K</a> or the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23882154/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-soundbar-announced">Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K</a> — and the $29.99 sale price ($20 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Streaming-Device-Vision-Controls/dp/B09BKCDXZC?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/fj8phdsqxie9l">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Froku-streaming-stick-4k-streaming-device-4k-hdr-dolby-vision-with-voice-remote-with-tv-controls%2F-%2FA-52709600">Target</a> is a good value. Compared to the older <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16587340/roku-streaming-stick-plus-2017-4k-hdr-review-price-relase">Streaming Stick Plus</a>, the 4K model offers a bit more speed for zipping around apps and now supports Dolby Vision to go along with HDR10 Plus. It doesn’t have Wi-Fi 6 or Dolby Atmos like the pricier <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24252484/roku-ultra-2024-features-specs-price">Roku Ultra</a>, but it still supports basic surround sound codecs. It also comes with a great voice remote that has a headphone jack and shortcuts to popular streaming apps. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review">Read our review</a>.</li><li><em><strong>Astro Bot</strong></em> for PlayStation 5 recently won game of the year at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24319637/the-game-awards-2024-trailers-annoucements">The Video Game Awards</a>, so we understand any sudden thirst you may have to play it. Thankfully, the physical copy is still discounted to its record low of $49.97 (about $10 off) at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAstro-Bot-PlayStation-5%2F6261168812">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/xoocciv9xc6uh">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fastro-bot---playstation-5%2F409781.html">GameStop</a> right now. We thought the platforming puzzle game had system-selling, game-of-the-year-worthy appeal well before the votes were tallied. That’s because of its charming new mascot and supporting cast, imaginative gameplay and aesthetic, and an increasingly rare and intangible sense of magic and joy that got so many of us hooked on gaming in the hobby’s earliest years. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year">Read our review</a>.</li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
