            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/680893/nintendo-switch-2-eshop-faster<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Ahead of the Nintendo Switch 2’s launch, Nintendo said that the eShop would be improved and run more smoothly on the new console. Based on our initial testing at <em>The Verge</em>, it’s immediately apparent that the Switch 2’s eShop is much better.</p><p>On the original Switch, the eShop can be extremely sluggish. Even just moving from one section to another can have a lag, and clicking into a game sometimes takes a bit to load before you can even go through the process of buying it. The delays and slow navigation make using the shop a huge pain; I personally often defaulted to buying digital games on Nintendo’s website because it was a better experience.</p><p>On the Switch 2, the eShop is way faster. It’s all much more snappy, with <em>much</em> less lag browsing through sections and loading up game pages. Just take a look at this video comparing jumping into the eShop on both consoles, captured by my colleague Tristan Cooper – it’s dramatically faster on the Switch 2:</p><p>And how about if you want to search <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664621/deltarune-nintendo-switch-2-launch-time">for <em>Deltarune</em></a>? Again, way quicker on the Switch 2.</p><p>“Thanks to the system’s performance capabilities, Nintendo eShop on Switch 2 has been improved and runs smoothly even when displaying a large number of games,” Switch 2 director Takuhiro Dohta said in an interview <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOop9Dwm1pWdSyk-2keK5d7TMj9CiX6O81ImmGVhH2dA6V1F2MHhE" rel="sponsored">published in April</a>. “We believe the act of finding the game you want to play is itself part of the game system experience.”</p><p>Right now, the eShop feels like one part of the Switch 2 experience that’s a huge upgrade. Hopefully, that will end up making it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/671658/nintendo-switch-indie-games-eshop-legacy">a better place to find great games</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
