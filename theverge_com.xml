Nintendo <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1917860173722603707">acknowledged the issue</a> and released another update, V20.0.1, this morning, which fixes the problem. But those experiencing the error code will need to perform a few extra steps to get their Switches updated and working again.</p><p>The <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525">release notes for the new V20.0.1 update</a> only address the Switch’s boot-up bug, so it’s not essential for anyone without problems installing V20.0.0. The release says: “Fixed an issue where Error Code: 2206-1015 sometimes occurred when restarting the system after updating to system version 20.0.0.”</p><p>The update needs to be <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/28135">applied while the Switch is in Maintenance Mode</a>, since the 2206-1015 error code prevents some Switch users from successfully booting their consoles and getting the update automatically or manually through the Switch’s System Settings menu. Nintendo has outlined the following steps:</p><div><ol><li><span>Ensure the console is powered off. <br>- If the console does not respond, hold down the POWER Button for twelve seconds to force it to shut down.</span></li><li><span>With the console powered off, hold down the volume up (+) and volume down (-) buttons, then press the POWER Button to turn the system on.<br>- Be sure to keep the volume buttons pressed down until the Maintenance Mode menu is displayed.</span></li><li><span>Once in Maintenance Mode, select Update System and follow the prompts to complete this process.<br>- If a Parental Control PIN has been set for the system, you will be prompted to enter it. The PIN will need to be reset if you’ve forgotten it.</span></li></ol></div><p>Contact Nintendo’s official support channels for additional assistance if you apply the V20.0.1 update using these steps but it doesn’t fix the issue, or if you’re seeing a different error code when the console starts up.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game had originally been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158510/gta-6-release-date-fall-2025">planned to release in fall 2025</a>, but Rockstar Games now says the team needs extra time “to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.”</p><p>In a message posted on the <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258aa538o412ok/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-coming-may-26-2026">Rockstar Games website</a>, the development team apologized for the delay:</p><div><blockquote><p>We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.</p><p>With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.</p><p>We look forward to sharing more information with you soon.</p></blockquote></div><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23988446/gta-vi-trailer-leaked-vice-city">first <em>GTA VI</em> trailer</a> was revealed in December 2023, and since then we’ve heard very little about the game aside from the narrowed down release date that’s now been pushed to next year. The next installment in the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> franchise will be set in Vice City, and feature the series’ first female protagonist — Lucia — with Bonnie and Clyde–inspired story elements.</p><p><em>GTA VI</em> is a highly anticipated title, and we might get some more details about the game’s delay during parent company Take-Two’s next financial results on May 15th. Take Two’s stock price dropped 8 percent in premarket trading on the NASDAQ this morning after the news of the delay.</p><p><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> is still massively popular 11 years after its launch, recently taking the number one spot on Twitch as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/655394/gta-5-most-watched-twitch-game-gta-vi">most watched game of 2024</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
