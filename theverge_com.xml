He joined in 2018, and after a two-year stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Razer is launching the Raiju V3 Pro, a $219.99 wireless controller made for the PlayStation 5 and PC. It’s an alternative to Sony’s $199.99 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23564531/sony-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-ps5-features-review">DualSense Edge</a>, which it shares many traits in common with, like adjustable trigger pull distances, swappable rear paddles, extra stick nubs, and a hard carrying case. Plus, it comes with a 2-meter-long USB-C cable that lodges snugly into its charging port to make it better suited for unpredictable tournament play.</p><p>The Raiju V3 Pro seems about as good as a third-party PS5 wireless controller can be, despite a few omissions. It lacks adaptive triggers and rumble. Also, Sony doesn’t allow Razer access to the DualSense Edge’s suite of software customization features on PS5, and it connects via a 2.4GHz USB-A dongle instead of pairing directly to the console.</p><p>However, the Raiju V3 Pro is the superior controller by one very important criterion (and a few others below, depending on taste): TMR joysticks. They are resistant to developing stick drift, and they draw less power from the battery when in use. By comparison, Sony’s high-end controller uses ALPS stick modules that are $20 each to replace when they inevitably suffer from drift after extended use. Add in the cost of two stick replacements, and the DualSense Edge costs more than Razer’s new controller.</p><p>The Raiju V3 Pro’s other design elements don’t necessarily make it a better choice over Sony’s, but they might tip the scale in Razer’s favor for you. Its bulky grips fill my hands better than the DualSense. I also like its eight-way directional pad that makes executing combos easier than with the four-way one on Sony’s gamepad. Its mecha-tactile face buttons are made from PBT, a material used in high-end keyboard keycaps, and I like the bouncy, clicky feel of the button switches. Razer’s tinker-friendly approach to its rear paddles is novel; if you don’t want to use the four rear customizable buttons, they can be swapped with a cap that almost seamlessly fills the gap.</p><p>There aren’t nearly as many high-end wireless controllers for the PS5 as there are for the Xbox, so Razer’s Raiju V3 Pro is a welcome competitor. You’ll be able to buy it… sometime. Razer spokesperson Janine Warner told <em>The Verge</em> a day before this story went live that the release is on hold, and that it isn’t available to purchase in the US, pending regulatory clearance. Razer didn’t respond to a question about what clearance it was awaiting.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/804365/razer-raiju-v3-pro-ps5-dualsense-edge-features-price]]></content:encoded>

By comparison, <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/93375/xbox-profits-revealed-in-new-ftc-leak/index.html">leaked documents</a> show that Xbox hit a 12 percent margin for the first nine months of the 2022 fiscal year, prior to these latest targets.</p><p>Cost-cutting is always a fairly obvious motivation for slashing jobs and raising the price of products or services, but Microsoft’s lofty profit targets would explain why its gaming division has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/697125/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-2025">been so extensively gutted</a>.
