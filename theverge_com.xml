            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/667211/persona-5-the-phantom-x-pc-mobile-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-webster">Andrew Webster</a> <span>is an entertainment editor covering streaming, virtual worlds, and every single Pokémon video game. Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s not the next mainline entry in the series, but Atlus did announced a new <em>Persona</em> game today. It’s called <em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em>, and it’s a spinoff that’s launching on both mobile and PC on June 26th.</p><p>As the name implies, <em>The Phantom X</em> is set in the same universe as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15098458/persona-5-review-ps4-ps3">2017’s <em>Persona 5</em></a>, and will feature a new main character leading a new band of Phantom Thieves. This story takes place in “a mysterious Tokyo where desires have been lost.” The structure of <em>The Phantom X</em> sounds a lot like traditional <em>Persona</em>, as players will experience normal high school life during the day, before heading off to explore dungeons at night. There’s also turn-based combat and a “synergy system” where players can form close ties with NPCs in the game.</p><p>There are also multiplayer elements, including guilds which allow “players to interact with one another in-game.” From the sounds of it, <em>The Phantom X</em> is an attempt to blend the single-player RPGs the franchise is known for with live-service mobile games designed to keep players coming back. It’s hard to say right now how well those two sides will gel together; it’s also not clear at the moment if the game will be free-to-play. Hopefully it still has curry.</p><p>Given it’s been nearly a decade since <em>Persona 5</em> launched, Atlus releasing another spinoff will likely be a disappointment to some fans expecting any sign of life from <em>Persona 6</em> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona">at least <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> turned out well</a>). Then again, <em>The Phantom X</em> at least looks the part, and might be a good way to fill in the time before the next major release.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Roblox is going to let creators sell physical items from their games. The company has been testing its tools to do so <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/roblox-shopify-sellers-metaverse-physical-product-purchases/726817/">since last year</a>, but today, <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/05/roblox-launches-shopify-integration-amp-licensing-program">it’s announcing</a> that it’s opening up its Commerce APIs to eligible Roblox creators. Shopify is the first “integrated partner” for the APIs, and if a creator or brand is a Shopify merchant, they can start selling physical goods inside their experiences.</p><p>You can see how it works in a video from Roblox. In one experience’s “premium shop,” there’s a merch section where you can browse things like hoodies or T-shirts. Click on the one you’re interested in and a page will pop up with additional details about the item and begin the checkout process.</p><p>Fenty Beauty is one brand that is already offering stuff to buy through an in-Roblox experience, including a shade of lip gloss that’s exclusively only in that experience. Hopefully experiences that incorporate shopping are more interesting than my <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23668846/decentraland-metaverse-fashion-week-2023">dreary time at Metaverse Fashion Week</a>.</p><p>Roblox is also launching an initiative that works the other way around. Through the company’s new Approved Merchandiser Program, you’ll be able to buy physical goods in the real world that give you digital items in experiences.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
