Netflix’s <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/2869704">“Interactive Specials” page</a> lists 24 titles, but only four will remain: <em>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</em>, <em>Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. the Reverend</em>, <em>Ranveer vs. Wild with Bear Grylls</em>, and <em>You vs. Wild.</em></p><p>The removal of the titles marks a disappointing conclusion to Netflix’s earliest efforts into interactive content. The company first launched the interactive titles in 2017 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/20/15834858/netflix-interactive-shows-puss-in-boots-buddy-thunderstruck">with <em>Puss in Book: Trapped in an Epic Tale</em></a>, and I remember being wowed (and horrified) by paths in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/2/18165182/black-mirror-bandersnatch-netflix-interactive-strategy-marketing"><em>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</em></a><em>.</em></p><div><p>In addition to specials based on franchises like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152973/netflix-carmen-sandiego-interactive-special-black-mirror-gaming"><em>Carmen Sandiego</em></a> and <em>Boss Baby,</em> Netflix also tried ideas like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/3/22960212/netflix-daily-series-trivia-quest">a daily trivia series</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/8/23446101/netflix-triviaverse-trivia-game-one-two-player">a trivia game you could play with a friend</a>. But the relatively few titles available suggests the format wasn’t much of a hit — <em>Puss in Book</em> has apparently <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pussinboots/comments/1bsb2mm/is_puss_in_book_trapped_in_an_epic_tale_lost/">been gone for a while</a>. </p></div><p>“The technology served its purpose, but is now limiting as we focus on technological efforts in other areas,” spokesperson Chrissy Kelleher says.</p><div><p>The removals also follow former <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24177141/netflixs-gaming-boss-is-moving-to-another-role-at-netflix-in-gaming">Netflix gaming boss Mike Verdu</a> — who <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mike-verdu-2a6113_new-role-at-netflix-vp-genai-for-games-activity-7259029850827423744-YMg4/">just announced</a> that he’s a VP of “GenAI for Games” at Netflix — telling <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/sea-of-thieves-playstation"><em>Game File’s </em>Stephen Totilo</a> that the company wasn’t building interactive titles anymore.</p></div><p>The delistings are yet another example of Netflix struggling to find its footing in gaming. While Netflix has a robust slate of mobile titles (that are increasingly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24171526/netflix-games-too-hot-too-handle-interactive-fiction">based on its own reality TV shows</a>), the company recently shut down its AAA game studio <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276700/netflix-gaming-studio-closure-blue">before it released a game</a>. And Netflix’s game streaming beta is still in testing despite expanding to the US <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23919517/netflix-game-streaming-beta-tvs-us">more than a year ago</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Update November 4th</strong>: Added Mike Verdu’s earlier confirmation that Netflix stopped making interactive content.</em></p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/3/24281754/rolls-royce-spectre-review-ev-price-specs-sound"><h2>Rolls-Royce Spectre review: the ultimate electric experience</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24287092/mario-and-luigi-brothership-review-nintendo-switch"><h2>Mario’s excellent run continues with Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership  on the Switch</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24285581/gm-software-baris-cetinok-apple-carplay-android-auto-google-cars-evs-decoder-podcast"><h2>GM software boss: we have ‘high conviction’ ditching CarPlay is the right path</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/3/24285425/chatgpt-search-mac-mini-pokemon-tcg-installer"><h2>The AI search engines are here —&nbsp;and getting better</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24287857/netflix-removing-interactive-titles-games"><h2>Netflix is removing nearly all of its interactive titles</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
