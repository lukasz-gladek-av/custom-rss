Epic Games announced today that it’s teaming up with Qualcomm to add Windows on Snapdragon support for Easy Anti-Cheat, which will let the game be compatible with those devices.</p><p>“Over the last year, the introduction of Windows 11 Arm-based laptops has transformed the PC landscape, and laptops with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Series processors represent a rapidly growing segment of the PC gaming market,” <a href="https://onlineservices.epicgames.com/en-US/news/windows-on-snapdragon-support-is-coming-to-epic-online-services-anti-cheat-and-fortnite">Epic says in a blog post</a>. “However, the majority of PC games today are compiled for x64, which doesn’t translate directly to the Windows on Snapdragon architecture. Due to the way anti-cheat software works with x64 features, additional tooling is required for compatibility with these devices.”</p><p>Epic says that “hundreds” of multiplayer games rely on Easy Anti-Cheat, including <em>Fortnite</em>, and that “battle-testing Windows on Snapdragon anti-cheat support with <em>Fortnite</em> will help ensure smooth implementations in other games.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/628323/google-play-games-android-mobile<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Ahead of the Game Developers Conference next week, Google is announcing that all mobile Android games will be available by default on Google Play Games on PC unless a developer opts out. The change could significantly boost the number of games on the platform, as previously, developers had to opt in.</p><p>Google Play Games on PC was originally launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891046/google-play-games-android-games-windows-pc-beta-launch">in beta</a> in 2022 as a way for people to play Android games on their PC, and Google has been slowly expanding its availability and building on the program since then.</p><p>As part of its announcements on Thursday, Google is also introducing a new “playability badge” for mobile games that are available on PC to highlight how well they run. An “optimized” badge means a game “meets all of our quality standards for a great gaming experience” and a “playable” badge means a game “meets the minimum requirements to play well on a PC,” writes Aurash Mahbod, VP and GM of Games on Google Play. (The system sounds a bit like Steam’s badges for Steam Deck compatibility.)</p><p>However, if a game has an “untested” badge, that means a user will only see it if they specifically search for it, Google’s Nia Carter tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Google is investing more in bringing PC games to Google Play Games on PC as well. There are already more than 50 native PC titles on the platform, Carter says, and later this year, Google plans to open up its native PC program to all native PC developers so they can bring over their games, according to Mahbod.</p><p>Google is making Google Play Games on PC more widely available, too; the company has offered a limited catalog of games on AMD laptops and desktops, but Google will now offer the full catalog on AMD laptops and desktops. In addition, Google is “partnering with PC OEMs to make Google Play Games accessible right from the start menu on new devices starting this year,” Mahbod says. Google is also rolling out multi-account and multi-instance support for Google Play Games on PC this month.</p><p>Google will make Google Play Games on PC generally available this year, according to Mahbod.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/628666/microsoft-xbox-copilot-for-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft is preparing to launch an AI-powered Copilot for Gaming soon that will guide Xbox players through games and act as an assistant to download and launch games. Copilot for Gaming, as Microsoft is branding it, will be available through the Xbox mobile app initially and is designed to work on a second screen as a companion or assistant.</p><p>Microsoft <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/13/new-copilot-for-gaming-save-time-help-get-good/">is positioning Copilot for Gaming</a> as a sidekick of sorts, one that will accompany you through games, offering up tips and guides and useful information about a game world. During a press briefing, Sonali Yadav, product manager for gaming AI, demonstrated several scenarios for what Copilot for Gaming could be used for. One involved a concept demo of Copilot assisting an <em>Overwatch 2</em> player by coaching them on the mistakes they made when trying to push without teammates.</p><p>In the <em>Overwatch 2</em> demo, Copilot could even recommend good hero picks to complement the rest of the team and tell you more about why you’d want to pair up particular characters, detailing their strengths and weaknesses. Another demo involved using Copilot with <em><em>Minecraft</em></em>, where you could ask Copilot questions about how to craft objects. Copilot can see your screen, so it can guide you and see exactly what you’re doing in a game. The demo also included the option to enable cheats in <em>Minecraft, </em>so Copilot could even tell you where certain crafting materials are located in the world.</p><p>The demos felt very concept in nature, and they won’t be available during the initial launch of Copilot for Gaming next month. Instead, Microsoft will test early versions of Copilot with Xbox Insiders through the Xbox mobile app in April, before eventually bringing Copilot to multiple devices.</p><p>Microsoft also has a slick marketing video for its Copilot for Gaming effort, but none of it looks real world to me, so it’s difficult to understand exactly what the company will deliver to testers in April. It looks like Microsoft has the vision for where it wants Copilot on an Xbox to be in the future, and it says it will iterate based on feedback. But right now, I’ll be interested to see how this launches in a more limited fashion on mobile devices.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
