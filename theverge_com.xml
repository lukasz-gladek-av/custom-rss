            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox chief Phil Spencer has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24175149/xbox-handheld-phil-spencer-interview-2024">dropping hints about an Xbox handheld</a> for months, but what about Windows handheld gaming PCs? Jason Ronald, Microsoft’s VP of “Next Generation,” tells <em>The Verge</em> that we should expect to see the Windows handheld gaming experience change within this calendar year. </p><p>Ronald was a roundtable panelist this evening at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/19/24325072/lenovo-legion-go-ces-event-valve-microsoft">an AMD and Lenovo event</a> titled “The Future of Gaming Handhelds,” which was mostly a coming-out party for Lenovo’s new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">Legion Go S</a>. But he did hint on stage that Microsoft plans to bring the Xbox experience to Windows PCs, rather than the other way around — and expanded on that considerably after we caught up with him later.</p><p>“We’ve been really innovating for a long time in the console space, and as we partner across the industry it’s really about how do we bring those innovations that we’ve incubated and developed in the console space and bring them to PC and bring them to the handheld gaming space,” said Ronald. </p><p>After we caught up with him after the event, he confirmed that Microsoft is looking at combining Xbox and Windows experiences together — and that we should see changes this very year, rather than needing to wait for an Xbox handheld <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295461/dont-expect-an-xbox-handheld-any-time-soon">that might still be years away.</a></p><div><figcaption><em>Microsoft’s Jason Ronald speaks at the Lenovo/AMD event, flanked by Valve SteamOS designer Pierre-Loup Griffais (left) and AMD chief gaming architect Frank Azor (middle right).</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>“I would say it’s bringing the best of Xbox and Windows together, because we have spent the last 20 years building a world-class operating system, but it’s really locked to the console,” says Ronald. “What we’re doing is we’re really focused on how do we bring those experiences for both players and developers to the broader Windows ecosystem.”</p><p>Right now, Windows sucks on handhelds, to put it rather bluntly, to the point that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">a community-created fork of Valve’s SteamOS experience</a> can be a far better way to pick up and play games. Ronald is clearly aware of the issues. “We’re focused on really simplifying that and making it much more like a console experience. Our goal is to put the player and their library at the center of the experience and not all the [Windows] work that you have to do today.”</p><p>Microsoft has done compact modes for Xbox apps on Windows that are focused on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219741/microsoft-windows-game-bar-xbox-handheld">improving the handheld experience</a>, but it’s a lot like putting lipstick on a pig instead of addressing the core experience. “I think we’ll have a lot more to share later this year,” teases Ronald. “I think it’s going to be a journey and I think you’ll see a lot of investments over time that you’re starting to see already, but we’ll have a lot more to share later this year.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Microsoft has made several Xbox apps more handheld-friendly over the past year.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>How Microsoft goes about this merging of Xbox and Windows will be key, but it doesn’t sound like the company is suddenly going to port a custom Xbox operating system to Windows. It sounds more like Microsoft wants to make Windows all up better at gaming with an Xbox experience on top so the pesky desktop, notifications, and legacy of Windows is hidden away.</p><p> “I think, at the end of the day, our goal is to make Windows great for gaming on any device,” says Ronald. “The reality is the Xbox operating system is built on top of Windows. So there’s a lot of infrastructure that we built in the console space that we can bring to the PC space and really deliver that premium gaming experience on any device.”</p><p>Specifically, Microsoft has to tackle a lot of the very basics of making Windows more friendly to controllers and getting that Xbox experience to really drive things instead of the taskbar, Start menu, and other elements. “There’s just certain things in Windows that were not designed for if you don’t have a keyboard and mouse, like thumbstick support or joypads and stuff like that,” Ronald admits. </p><p>“There’s fundamental interaction models that we’re working on to make sure that regardless of the operating system details it feels very natively like a gaming-centric device and a gaming-centric experience.”</p><p>Ronald says the goal is to put an Xbox experience at the center — “not the Windows desktop that you have today.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>SteamOS was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr">always supposed to be bigger</a> than Valve’s own Steam Deck, and 2025 is the year it finally expands. Not only will Lenovo ship <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">the first third-party SteamOS handheld</a> this May, Valve has now revealed it will let you install a working copy of SteamOS on <em>other </em>handhelds even sooner than that. </p><p>Pierre-Loup Griffais, one of the lead designers on the Steam Deck and SteamOS, tells me a beta for other handhelds “is slated to ship after March sometime,” and that you might discover the OS <em>just starts working properly</em> after that happens! </p><p>Griffais and his co-designer Lawrence Yang would not confirm which handhelds might just start working, though there are some obvious candidates: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">the company confirmed to us in August</a> that it had been adding support for the Asus ROG Ally’s controls. </p><p>Also, quite a few PC gamers have also discovered that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">Bazzite, a fork of Valve’s Steam Deck experience that I loved testing on an Ally X</a> and vastly preferred to Windows, also works wonderfully on the Lenovo Legion Go. There still aren’t that many handhelds out there at the end of the day, and I would think Valve would take advantage of work the Linux gaming community has already done on both.</p><p>Speaking of Bazzite, Valve seems to be flattered! “We have nothing against it,” says Yang. “It’s a great community project that delivers a lot of value to people that want a similar experience on devices right now,” says Griffais, adding later “In a lot of ways Bazzite is a good way to kind of get the latest and greatest of what we’ve been working on, and test it.” </p><p>But he says Bazzite isn’t yet in a state where a hardware manufacturer could preload it on a handheld, nor would Valve allow that. While users can freely download and install the SteamOS image onto their own devices, companies aren’t allowed to sell it or modify it, and must partner with Valve first.</p><p>There are some non-selfish reasons for that. Among other things, Griffais explains that the Lenovo Legion Go S will run the same SteamOS image as the Steam Deck itself, taking advantage of the same software updates and the same precached shaders that let games load and run more smoothly, just with added hardware compatibility tweaks. Valve wants to make sure SteamOS is a single platform, not a fragmented one.</p><p>“In general, we just want to make sure we have a good pathway to work together on things like firmware updates and you can get to things like the boot manager and the BIOS and things like that in a semi-standardized fashion, right?” says Griffais, regarding what Valve needs to see in a partnership that would officially ship SteamOS on other devices.</p><p>Valve isn’t currently partnered with any other companies beyond Lenovo to do that collaboration — Yang tells me the company is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337913/no-valve-isnt-working-with-gpd-to-bring-steamos-to-its-handheld"><em>not</em> working with GPD on official SteamOS support</a>, despite that manufacturer’s claim. </p><p>Valve’s also not promising that whichever Windows handheld you have will necessarily run SteamOS perfectly — in a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F593110%2Fview%2F529834914570306831">new blog post</a>, Valve only confirms that a beta will ship before Lenovo’s Legion Go S, that it “should improve the experience on other devices,” and that users “can download and test this themselves.”</p><p>As far as other form factors, like possible SteamOS living room boxes, Valve says you might have a good experience trying that. And partnerships are a possibility there too: “if someone wants to bring that to the market and preload SteamOS on it, we’d be happy to talk to them.”</p><p>Valve wouldn’t tell me anything about the rumors that it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/11/19/24300757/valve-steam-controller-2-roy-deckard-leak">developing its own Steam Controller 2, VR headset with wands</a>, and possibly its own living room box, but did tell me that we “might expect more Steam Input compatible controllers in the future.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
