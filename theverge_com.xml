            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/640287/heart-machine-patreon-gdc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Heart Machine, the studio behind games like <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em>, <em>Solar Ash</em>, and the upcoming platformer <em>Possessor(s)</em>, launched a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/HeartMachineHQ/home">Patreon</a> last December. Like many other developers, it has dealt with its share of struggles, including layoffs <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hyper-light-breaker-developer-heart-machine-confirms-layoffs">late last year</a>. With the many challenges in the gaming industry right now, the studio is experimenting with using Patreon as a source of revenue and to help build community.</p><p>“The Patreon’s there, really, to open up to the community and talk about certain things when it comes to game development,” Heart Machine founder Alx Preston told <em>The Verge</em> at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco last month. “I think there’s still a lot of distance between developers traditionally and the audience that consumes what they make — what we make — so finding ways to dig back in and have a conversation there is important.”</p><p>It could help on the money front, too. “Industry dynamics have changed a lot, so money is tough to come by in a lot of ways,” Preston said. “Whatever we can do to support ourselves and stay alive longer term is an important thing to turn to, as well.”</p><p>The indie games space has run into a fair share of challenges lately, including Annapurna Interactive’s team <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/9/12/24243317/annapurna-interactive-staff-reportedly-resigns">resigning</a> and Take-Two selling its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289932/take-two-private-division-publisher-sale">Private Division indie label</a> last year. While there have been some bright spots — including that the former Annapurna team has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338274/annapurna-interactive-new-company-take-two-private-division">taken over</a> Private Division’s discarded games — indie games still face some difficulties getting funding and succeeding in an increasingly crowded marketplace. Even former lifelines like Netflix have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview">pulled back on indie investing</a>.</p><p>While it’s not a replacement for proper funding — <em>Possessor(s) </em>is being published by Devolver Digital — the subscription is meant to be a potential way to augment the studio’s earnings. Patreon isn’t “our biggest portion of revenue or anything,” Preston said. (Heart Machine’s <a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/heartmachinehq/about">About page</a> on Patreon shows it has around 230 paid members out of about 700 total members.)</p><p>But the idea is to grow it over time. “If you keep engaging and keep doing more stuff there, it’s a different model than going to publishers for money all the time,” he said, adding that it’s “the experimental phase of figuring out what the fuck works these days.”</p><p>Heart Machine isn’t the only developer to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/creators/gaming">utilize Patreon</a> – <em>Caves of Qud</em> developer <a href="https://www.patreon.com/freeholdgames">Freehold Games</a> is another notable example — but it’s one of the most prominent that’s experimenting with the platform. “Since the old models are not enough, we have to adapt,” Preston said in Heart Machine’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTx8TGLPeKc">announcement about the Patreon</a>. “So we’re asking for support to help us continue to not just survive, but adapt and thrive.”</p><p>“We’ve always been big on talking directly to our audience,” he said. “We think this Patreon is an opportunity for us to do more on this front while also benefiting.”</p><p><em>Possessor(s)</em> is set to launch this year. The studio launched <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> in early access <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318562/hyper-light-breaker-finally-launches-in-early-access-on-january-14th-2025">in January</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
