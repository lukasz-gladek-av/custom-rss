            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312584/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-refunds<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Despite only officially launching the game in spring of this year, Ubisoft has <a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fxdefiant-our-message-to-players">already announced</a> that it’s ending development and sunsetting its free-to-play team-based shooter <em>XDefiant</em>. Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/27/22904775/ubisoft-hyper-scape-cancelled-battle-royale"><em>Hyper Scape</em></a> before it, <em>XDefiant</em> had high expectations, with Ubisoft touting more than 1 million players in its closed beta last year. Now, it will disappear quickly, as it’s no longer accepting new players as of today and is <a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fxdefiant-our-message-to-players">scheduled to shut off the servers</a> entirely next June.</p><p>Despite a delayed launch, Ubisoft said that <em>XDefiant </em>had reached more than 10 million players in its first two weeks and “outperformed expectations thanks to acquisition and strong average revenue per session day.” However, it couldn’t maintain that momentum, and by this fall, rumors of trouble surfaced, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a> reporting that concurrent player numbers across all platforms had fallen below 20,000.</p><p>Ubisoft states, “The game will remain available to all players who joined <em>XDefiant </em>before December 3rd, 2024. All functionalities, including progression, events, rewards, and achievements, will continue to be available until June 3rd, 2025.” The planned Season 3 content will still launch, and the company is refunding anyone who bought the Ultimate Founders Pack, as well as players who bought VC and DLC in the last month.</p><p>Like with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234909/sony-concord-ps5-shutdown-poor-sales-launch-pc"><em>Concord</em></a> developer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">Firewalk Studios</a>, this shutdown comes with job losses. According to Ubisoft, “difficult consequences” are leading to “the closing of our San Francisco and Osaka production studios and to the ramp down of our Sydney production site, with 143 people departing in San Francisco and 134 people likely to depart in Osaka and Sydney.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
