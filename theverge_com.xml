He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Baldur’s Gate 3’s</em> Patch 8, which brings changes like 12 new subclasses, crossplay, and a photo mode, launches on April 15th, developer Larian Studios announced <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/larianstudios.com/post/3lmkbxbr7cc2h">on Friday</a>.</p><p>The patch, set to be the game’s last major update, was originally announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24307746/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-cross-play-photo-mode">in November 2024</a>, so it’s been a long time coming (though Larian has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/598148/stress-test-the-new-baldurs-gate-3-patch">stress testing it</a> ahead of the official launch).</p><p>The 12 new subclasses mean that each of the game’s main classes — Bard, Barbarian, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Fighter, Monk, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer, Warlock and Wizard — will be getting an additional subclass. You can see the full list of new subclasses in <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1086940%2Fview%2F4461474037375172735" rel="sponsored">this November post from Larian</a>.</p><p>With crossplay, you’ll be able to play multiplayer with your friends no matter what platform they’re on. And the game’s photo mode will offer features like different lens settings, scene settings, and even stickers.</p><p>Larian will also be hosting a <a href="https://twitch.tv/larianstudios">Twitch stream</a> about Patch 8 on April 16th at 9AM ET.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/647361/doom-limited-run-games-collector-edition-cacodemon-handheld<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Will it run <em>Doom</em>? The question that has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/3/24286842/nintendo-alarmo-doom-hack-usb-custom-firmware-instructions">challenged tinkerers</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/12/15/13971784/doom-2-optimus-maximus-keyboard-working-hack">hardware hackers</a> for years has now come full circle. <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/products/doom-doom-ii-will-it-run-edition-switch-ps5-xbox-pc">Limited Run Games has announced a new collector’s edition</a> of the iconic first-person shooter that ships in a box that itself can play <em>Doom</em> on a built-in screen.</p></div><p>The <em>Doom</em> plus<em> Doom II</em> Will It Run Edition, available in Switch, Xbox, PS5, and PC versions, will be available for preorder starting on Friday, April 18th, 2025 at 10:00AM ET. It’s being limited to just 666 units, naturally, at a price of $666.66. When asked if the steep but fitting price tag would be affected by tariffs, Alex Verrey, an LRG spokesperson, told <em>The Verge</em> in an email that “I do not believe there are any plans at this time to change the pricing due to tariffs.”</p><p>Although a $29.99 Standard Edition and a $99.99 Big Box Edition will also be available, the Will It Run Edition includes an assortment of extra games, levels, gameplay upgrades, and add-ons that could justify the expensive collection for <em>Doom</em>’s biggest fans. But it’s the other accessories that will be its biggest selling point.</p><p>In addition to the <em>Doom</em>-playing box, the Will It Run Edition includes four hours of the game’s soundtrack on four cassette tapes (despite audio CDs existing long before the original <em>Doom</em> launched), a three-inch Cacodemon figurine that floats atop a magnetic base, and a pack of random trading cards. But the pièce de résistance is a <em>Doom</em>-playing handheld shaped like a Cacodemon with several of its teeth doubling as controller buttons. Let’s hope LRG decides to sell that on its own one day.</p><p>On the games side of things, the Will It Run Edition includes <em>Doom</em>, <em>Doom II</em>, <em>TNT: Evilution</em>, <em>The Plutonia Experiment</em>, <em>Master Levels for Doom II</em>, <em>No Rest for the Living</em>, <em>Sigil</em> and <em>Sigil II</em>, a new Deathmatch pack with 25 maps, and <em>Legacy of Rust</em> which was released just last year. The games also feature enhancements such as alternate soundtracks, upgraded visuals, modern controller support with gyroscopic aiming, new accessibility options, and eight new translations including Korean, simplified and traditional Chinese, Portuguese, and Polish.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
