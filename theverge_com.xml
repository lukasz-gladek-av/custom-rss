He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve is testing a low-power way to complete downloads on your Steam Deck without having to leave the handheld running with the screen on. As part of an update that’s currently on the Steam Deck’s Beta and Preview channels, the handheld can “complete all active downloads in a new display-off low-power mode before going to sleep,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1675200%2Fview%2F771930569635267984" rel="sponsored">Valve says</a>.</p><p>I’m glad this change is in the works; I download a lot of games and updates on my Steam Deck and I have often wished that I didn’t have to leave the display on while doing so. <em>The Verge</em> asked Valve about this two years ago when the Steam Deck OLED launched, and the company seemed to think Deck was good enough without it.</p><p>“We burn a substantial amount of power when you’re downloading,” hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat said at the time, suggesting to us that players might not want to accidentally leave a hot Steam Deck in their bag if they mistakenly think it’s asleep. Valve’s solution announced today seems to solve some of those concerns.</p><p>With the update installed, when you press the power button while your Deck is downloading something, you’ll see a new dialog that asks if you want to keep downloading but have the screen off. If you choose Continue, your Deck will enter the low-power mode. “While in this mode, if you press a button or move Steam Deck, a new status screen will be shown with download progress,” Valve says. “From here you can fully wake Steam Deck or let it continue downloading with the screen off.”</p><p>The feature is on by default when your Steam Deck is plugged in. You can also choose to enable it while running on battery in settings, though if your Steam Deck falls below 20 percent battery, your device will go into full sleep mode.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/813864/valve-steam-deck-screen-download-games-low-power-screen-off]]></content:encoded>

For the first time, the credit card-sized Arduboy now has a USB-C port for charging, syncing, and playing multiplayer games with a second device using an included USB-C cable, or any Thunderbolt 3 cable.</p></div><p>A Founder’s edition of the Arduboy FX-C with purple buttons is available now through the Arduboy online store for $99 and limited to 500 units, while a two-pack, limited to 100 units, is discounted to $178. Responding to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SBCGaming/comments/1om4iv2/arduboy_fxc_announced/">Reddit users commenting on the increased price</a> over the older $79 Arduboy FX, Bates says that $99 is “actually more than I want to charge but the tariff situation means this is the only way to stay in business.” But he also says a slightly cheaper Standard edition with green buttons will soon be available through Amazon with free shipping.</p><p>The Arduboy FX-C’s specs remain relatively basic with the same ATmega32u4 processor found on the <a href="https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-micro?srsltid=AfmBOoq0SnxAgtXlFTwcfPhhW6ggBcVhVRXNkJz9QT_IXRMkVv5hywEi">Arduino Micro</a>, a 128×64-pixel OLED screen that can only show white pixels – no grayscale or anti-aliasing – and six buttons. And while the Arduboy FX included enough storage to hold 200 preloaded games, the new FX-C expands that to <a href="https://community.arduboy.com/c/games/35">accommodate 300 titles</a>, making the open source handheld even more accessible for those who just want to use it to play games, and not dive into developing their own.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/813661/arduboy-fx-c-handheld-console-arduino-usb-c-multiplayer]]></content:encoded>
