            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/683635/retroid-pocket-dual-screen-add-on-nintendo-ds-touchscreen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21441254/nintendo-ds-3ds-discontinued-eulogy">Nintendo DS was a wildly successful console</a>, but emulating its unique dual screen design on modern handhelds is a challenge. You can try to squeeze both screens onto a single touchscreen, attempt to completely <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/18/23923136/ayaneo-flip-ds-kb-handheld-gaming-pc-nintendo-emulation">recreate the DS’ unique hardware</a>, or do what Retroid is doing and release a temporary clamp-on, secondary screen that’s compatible with its handhelds and other third-party devices.</p><p>The Retroid Dual Screen Add-on is <a href="https://www.goretroid.com/en-ca/products/retroid-dual-screen-add-on">currently available through the company’s online store</a> in black, purple (inspired by the GameCube), and translucent white color options for $69, but are currently sold out. That includes a version designed for Retroid’s own Pocket handhelds including the RP Mini, RP Mini V2, RP4 Pro, and RP5, and the version for third-party handhelds. As long as a device isn’t taller than 115mm and supports DisplayPort over USB-C it should be compatible, but Retroid specifically points out the Steam Deck is not.</p><p>Featuring a 5.5-inch AMOLED screen with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and dedicated brightness buttons on the side, the Dual Screen Add-on attaches to devices with an expanding clamp and can be positioned at three different angles using a “click-stop hinge.” However, the second screen can’t be folded flat against the handheld it’s attached to like with the DS.</p><p>The add-on features touchscreen functionality, which is supported through the DisplayPort protocol. If your handheld of choice is lacking touch capabilities, hanging the add-on off the bottom will let you play DS games that heavily relied on lower touchscreen interactions. But since Retroid’s Dual Screen Add-on is at its core just an external display for a handheld, what games you can play and how the screen will be utilized is left to the device’s operating system or the emulator you’re using.</p><p>The add-on weighs around 130 grams, thanks in part to it skipping a built-in battery. It’s powered directly by the device it’s connected to, but it does have its own USB-C port with pass-through charging capabilities so you can keep both the display and your handheld running without killing its battery.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Apple is launching a new app that acts as a central hub for the games and gaming features across its platforms. The new Apple Games app combines Apple Arcade, App Store game recommendations, your App Store game library, and your friends list into a single location. Apple calls it an “all-in-one destination for games and playing with friends.”</p><p>The new app will be available on iPhones, iPads, and Macs, starting with versions coming out this fall. In addition to collecting your games, you’ll also be able to view leaderboards for supported titles and complete “challenges” set by developers. Apple sees it as a way to create multiplayer experiences out of single-player titles.</p><p>On top of the new Apple Games app, Apple is also adding a Game Overlay feature to iPads and Macs, which lets players access Game Center features, friends lists, and gaming settings without leaving a game.</p><p>The news is the latest gaming-focused push by Apple. The company added Game Mode to Macs <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/26/23890599/apple-macos-sonoma-14-available-desktop-widgets-game-mode">with macOS Sonoma in 2023</a>, which optimizes your Mac for better gaming performance. It also brought Game Mode to iOS last year <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24175466/iphone-game-mode-performance-frame-rate-optimization-wwdc-2024">with iOS 18</a>. And Apple offers a Proton-like tool that can help <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/7/23752164/apple-mac-gaming-game-porting-toolkit-windows-games-macos">Windows games run on a Mac</a>. The company has made a big deal about the ray-tracing capabilities of chips in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237017/iphone-16-specs-features-price-release-date-apple">newer</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23879619/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-review">iPhones</a>. And, of course, it offers the Apple Arcade gaming subscription service.</p><p>Apple has worked to bring big, AAA games to its platforms, including Hideo Kojima’s <em>Death Stranding</em>, <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em>, and a bunch of <em>Resident Evil</em> games, including <em>Resident Evil 2</em>, <em>3</em>, <em>4</em>, <em>7</em>, and <em>Village</em>. However, some of these bigger titles reportedly haven’t sold <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/entertainment/resident-evil-2-assassins-creed-mirage-mobile-sales-are-struggling-2018873">very</a> <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/resident-evil-4-remake-surpasses-10m-unit-sales-in-record-breaking-time/">well</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
