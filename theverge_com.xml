            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337949/nvidia-ace-ai-npcs-pubg-ally-teammate<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia has spent the last two years showing off its digital “ACE” characters that can have in-game conversations with you using generative AI. But at CES 2025, the company is taking the ACE characters a step further by showing how they can be “autonomous game characters” — including, sometime this year, a teammate to help you get a chicken dinner in <em>PUBG</em>. </p><p>Nvidia says that ACE characters can use AI to “perceive, plan, and act like human players,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fnvidia-ace-autonomous-ai-companions-pubg-naraka-bladepoint%2F">per a blog post</a>. “Powered by generative AI, ACE will enable living, dynamic game worlds with companions that comprehend and support player goals, and enemies that adapt dynamically to player tactics.” The characters are powered by “small language models (SLMs)” that are “capable of planning at human-like frequencies required for realistic decision making” as well as “multi-modal SLMs for vision and audio that allow AI characters to hear audio cues and perceive their environment.”</p><p>As for how that will work in <em>PUBG</em>, you’ll be able to team up with the “<em>PUBG</em> Ally,” which Nvidia and <em>PUBG</em> publisher Krafton are calling the “world’s first Co-Playable Character (CPC).” The Ally will be able to “communicate using game-specific lingo, provide real-time strategic recommendations, find and share loot, drive vehicles, and fight other human players using the game’s extensive arsenal of weapons,” Nvidia says. </p><p>Basically, it sounds like an AI teammate you can talk with natural language who’s supposed to be as capable as a human. And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEKUSMqrbzQ">a video</a> shows the Ally indeed helping a player find specific loot, bringing over a vehicle, and attempting to flank opposing players. But the video is heavily edited and isn’t live, so I’m skeptical that the Ally will work as well as is being shown here.</p><p>AI characters built with ACE are coming to other games, too. <em>Naraka: Bladepoint Mobile PC Version</em> will get a “a local inference AI Teammate feature” in March 2025, while <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> on PC will get the feature “later in 2025,” according to Nvidia’s blog post. “AI Teammates powered by NVIDIA ACE can join your party, battling alongside you, finding you specific items that you need, swapping gear, offering suggestions on skills to unlock, and making plays that’ll help you achieve victory.”</p><p>Krafton’s upcoming life simulation game called <em>inZOI </em>will also get CPCs called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk9z1upOj3U">“Smart Zoi.”</a> And Nvidia says that ACE characters can be bosses, too, and they’ll be used for boss encounters in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8XeiZ4djKw&amp;t=2s">Wemade Next’s <em>MIR5</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The 2025 Scar 16 and 18 come with RGB lights all the way around the bottom of the chassis as well as a user-programmable LED dot-matrix display on the lid, as seen on other ROG devices <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24023549/asus-rog-phone-8-pro-ai-price-release-date-specs-features-gaming-smartphone">like Asus’ gaming phones</a>. </p><p>Beneath the flashy exterior, the Scar 16 and 18 can be maxed out with an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor and Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 GPU. It can also be configured with up to 64GB of DDR5-5600 RAM and a 2TB PCIe Gen4 SSD. The ROG Nebula HDR display comprises a 16:10 2.5K Mini LED panel with a peak brightness of 1,200 nits and a 240Hz refresh rate. There are two Thunderbolt 5 ports included, and the design allows for easy access to the bottom panel for component upgrades. </p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</p><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The Strix Scar 16 and 18 have all the cooling tech you’d expect from a gaming laptop of this caliber, including an end-to-end vapor chamber and sandwiched heatsink. Combined with the Conductonaut Extreme liquid metal treatment on the GPU and CPU, Asus claims that it can keep fan noise levels to a library-like 45dB, even during extended gaming sessions.</p><p>On top of all that, the ROG Strix Scar comes with the aforementioned light show. Asus calls it AniMe Vision, and you can customize it to display personalized animations and sync it with any other AniMe Vision devices you own. Download some prebaked artwork or cook up your own using <a href="https://rog.asus.com/content/anime-matrix-pixel-editor/">Asus’ pixel editor</a> — the choice is yours.</p><p>The ROG Strix Scar starts at $2,599; Asus says its new gaming laptops will begin shipping in February.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335012/asus-rog-flow-z13-gaming-tablet-amd-ryzen-max-plus-price-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asus has a new version of its Surface Pro-like gaming tablet for CES, and it’s making some sizable changes both inside and out. The Asus ROG Flow Z13 for 2025 is once again a slightly chunky, almost-half-inch-thick, 13-inch tablet with a built-in kickstand, magnetic keyboard cover, a bunch of ports, and a clear window on its rear with RGB lighting to show off its innards.</p><p>That fun glass window is now larger, with a direct view of the motherboard, but the biggest change for the ROG Flow Z13 is its switch to integrated graphics. That may seem like a step backward for a gaming-focused tablet since gamers covet dedicated GPUs, but Asus is outfitting it with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337025/amd-ryzen-ai-max-strix-halo-fire-range-9955hx3d">AMD’s powerful new “Strix Halo” processor</a>. The ROG Flow Z13 can be configured with the Ryzen AI Max 390 for $1,999.99 or the Ryzen AI Max Plus 395 for $2,199.99. The top-end model with the Max Plus 395 has 16 CPU cores and 40 graphics cores, while the base-model Ryzen AI Max Plus 390 (curse these names) has 12 CPU cores and 32 graphics cores. The Z13 utilizes a redesigned stainless steel vapor chamber for cooling these graphics-heavy chips, which are capable of 120W TDP. </p><p>All that power in the Z13 is responsible for driving a 13-inch, 2560 x 1600 touchscreen display with a speedy 180Hz refresh rate (up from 165Hz on the last-gen model), which you don’t often find in laptops and tablets of this size. For ports, it’s got two USB 4, one USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, HDMI 2.1, a microSD card slot capable of UHS-II speeds, and a 3.5mm combination headphone / mic jack. It’s also got a 5-megapixel front-facing webcam and 13-megapixel rear-facing camera — so you can flash your RGB as you awkwardly take tablet photos in public. It also has Wi-Fi 7.</p><p>The Z13 supports USB-C Power Delivery for charging, but that won’t be powerful enough to allow its full performance under load. Instead, it comes with a 200W power adapter that uses Asus’ proprietary and reversible slim power jack — like on its recent laptops.</p><p>Other quality-of-life improvements for the Z13 include a new detachable keyboard with larger keycaps and a more generously sized touchpad. And on its right side, beside the power button and volume rocker, is a new “ScreenXpert” button that summons a Command-Center-like widget that includes multiple-display window management controls, quick access to operating modes like Turbo mode or Silent mode, and other settings like muting your mic. It’s primarily there to help control things while in tablet mode since the keyboard contains shortcuts for most of these functions.</p><p>I got a quick glimpse of the new ROG Flow Z13 at a preview event, and Asus sent me a preproduction model right before CES to get a little bit of hands-on time. It’s what I’m writing this post on right now, and boy do I appreciate the updates to this keyboard cover. The 1.7mm key travel and bigger touchpad go a long way toward getting work done. While the Ryzen 395 chip has the potential to be power-hungry, the battery life on the Z13 shows some promise. Asus is only claiming 10 hours of battery life, and I did manage to get through a full eight-plus-hour workday of Chrome tabs, streaming music (though the speakers seem kind of bad at first listen), and writing across multiple virtual desktops the day before flying to CES — with pretty much no issues.</p><p>I definitely prefer a proper laptop to a tablet with a kickstand and keyboard cover, but being able to remove the keyboard deck for a little more flexibility and comfort when it’s time to fire up a game is pretty slick. I tried out a little <em>Helldivers 2 </em>on the Flow Z13, and it performed quite well, especially for a tablet. Set to the Z13’s native 2.5K resolution, in-game render scale on Ultra Quality, and texture details on medium, I saw 60fps or just slightly under, and it looked really nice. If I bumped it down from Ultra Quality to Quality scaling, it jumped up to an even smoother 80fps. This was, of course, while the tablet was plugged in and its fans were blasting on Turbo mode. Diving in again while unplugged dropped the Ultra Quality render scale performance down to the 45 to 50fps range since playing on battery limits you to Performance mode instead of Turbo.</p><p>This is preproduction hardware, but so far, it’s pretty impressive for integrated graphics. AMD’s new chip might have something special here for thin and light devices, but since it lacks Thunderbolt 5, that means the Flow Z13 can’t use the full GPU bandwidth of Asus’ new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/24100176">XG Mobile eGPU</a>. (Previous models could use the older XG Mobile via its proprietary connector.) But of course, that would make this somewhat portable PC gaming solution a little less portable, and the new XG Mobile costs about as much as the Flow Z13 itself.</p><p>But does a gaming tablet make much sense in 2025 when portable PC gaming is being so adequately served by the Steam Deck and a bunch of other dedicated handhelds? We’ll have to see how a production model of the ROG Flow Z13 fares when it launches sometime in February.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

Di Benedetto / The Verge</p></div><p><time datetime="2025-01-07T04:00:00.000Z"> <!-- -->Jan 7, 2025, 4:00 AM UTC</time></p><div><h2>Share this story</h2></div></div></div><div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Razer announced it’s overhauling the Razer Blade 16 inside and out. In addition to a new CPU and GPU, the Blade 16 is now thinner overall than the outgoing 2024 model and comes with a few tweaks to its audio system and keyboard. </p><p>The new Blade 16 comes with up to a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU and a “next-gen Nvidia<strong> </strong>GPU.” The company also bumped its speaker array from four to six speakers, while the display carries over the 240Hz OLED <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/4/24024217/razer-gaming-laptop-updates-blade-16-18-oled-4k-ces">introduced to the line last year</a>. This is the first time Razer has put an AMD processor in the Blade 16.</p><p>Razer says it’s packing all of that into a chassis that’s over 30 percent thinner than last year’s model at just 0.59 inches — or 14.9 millimeters — thick<strong> </strong>in the front and 0.69 inches (17.4mm) in the back, not including the feet. For reference, the 16-inch MacBook Pro M4 is 0.61 inches (15.5mm) thick, including feet. The new Razer Blade&nbsp;is also deeper than last year’s model, measuring 250.5mm front to back, versus 244mm for the 2024 Blade 16. Despite all of that, Razer says it increased the travel of its keyboard keys from 1mm to 1.5mm. And there’s now a Copilot key, of course.</p><p>That thinness may come at a cost: the new Blade 16 has a 90Wh battery that it says can charge to 80 percent in about 45 minutes. The fast charging may come in handy; the larger 95.2Wh battery in the Blade 16 we <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23588660/razer-blade-16-2023-review-specs-features-design">reviewed in 2023</a> already felt like it wasn’t up to the task. That review unit was also a hot laptop. Razer says it’s using a new thermal gel that covers more interior surface area than the 2023 model.</p><div><div><p><figcaption><em>The 2025 model (top) vs. the thicker 2024 model (bottom).</em></figcaption></p></div><div><figcaption><em>2024 (left) vs. 2025 (right).</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>The AMD chip it’s using might help things, though. When <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24324299/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-gaming-laptop-review-amd-strix-point">we tested an Asus ROG Zephyrus G16 with that Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU</a> against the same laptop with an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H, the AMD version ran for three hours longer in non-gaming tasks and put out slightly less heat, though Asus puts a much lower power draw cap on its gaming laptops than Razer does. Naturally, we won’t know how any of that affects the new Blade 16 until we have one in hand to test. </p><p>The 2025 Razer Blade 16 is due out in the first quarter of this year. Razer didn’t announce pricing, but you can bet it won’t be cheap.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->10</p><div><figcaption><em>The new Razer Blade 16.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Razer</cite></p></div></div></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/4/24307731/ces-2025-tvs-gaming-smart-home-wearables-news"><h2>CES 2025: all the news, gadgets, and surprises</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24325799/dell-pro-max-premium-plus-ces-laptop-pc-rebrand-announcement"><h2>Dell kills the XPS brand</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337396/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-5070-ti-5070-price-release-date"><h2>Nvidia announces next-gen RTX 5090 and 5080 GPUs</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337117/microsoft-bing-search-results-google-design-trick"><h2>Microsoft is using Bing to trick people into thinking they’re on Google</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336154/samsung-the-frame-pro-features-specs"><h2>Samsung announces The Frame Pro: could this be the perfect TV?</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></main><div><h2>More from this stream<!-- --> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/4/24307731/ces-2025-tvs-gaming-smart-home-wearables-news">CES 2025: all the news, gadgets, and surprises</a></h2><ul><li><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335238/msi-gaming-laptops-cyborg-stealth-raider-vector-nvidia-rtx-intel-amd-ces">MSI’s 2025 gaming laptops have the latest from Nvidia, Intel, and AMD — plus lots of RGB</a></h3><p><time datetime="2025-01-07T04:00:00.000Z"> <!-- -->Jan 7, 2025, 4:00 AM UTC</time></p></li><li><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335564/alienware-27-inch-4k-240hz-oled-price-date">Alienware’s 27-inch 4K 240Hz OLED monitor is only a couple months away</a></h3><p><time datetime="2025-01-07T04:00:00.000Z"> <!-- -->Jan 7, 2025, 4:00 AM UTC</time></p></li><li><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335027/msi-titan-18-dragon-edition-norse-myth-gaming-laptop-ces-price-specs">The Titan Dragon Edition is MSI’s latest all-out gaming laptop</a></h3><p><time datetime="2025-01-07T04:00:00.000Z"> <!-- -->Jan 7, 2025, 4:00 AM UTC</time></p></li><li><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24332341/alienware-area-51-16-18-rgb-laptop-price-specs-ces">Alienware’s new Area-51 laptops have light-up trackpads and fans</a></h3><p><time datetime="2025-01-07T04:00:00.000Z"> <!-- -->Jan 7, 2025, 4:00 AM UTC</time></p></li></ul><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/4/24307731/ces-2025-tvs-gaming-smart-home-wearables-news">See all <!-- -->177<!-- --> stories</a> </div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335320/hp-omen-32x-smart-gaming-monitor-g2-specs-ces-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HP is jumping into the smart monitor space with the Omen 32x, a gaming monitor that doubles as a streaming device running Google TV.&nbsp;It’ll ship this April for $749.99, the company announced at CES 2025.</p><p>The HP Omen 32x Smart Gaming Monitor has a 31.5-inch 4K IPS display with a 144Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, 400 nit peak brightness, and DisplayHDR 400 with Dolby Vision. The panel covers 95 percent of the Display P3 and 99 percent of the sRGB color gamuts, and it has support for G-Sync and FreeSync Premium. For video inputs, it has one DisplayPort 1.4 port and two HDMI 2.1 ports, plus a 65W USB-C Power Delivery port with alt mode support for DisplayPort. It also has two USB-A 2.0 ports for peripherals, 3.5mm for audio (plus four built-in 3W speakers), and even an ethernet jack.</p><p>The hardware specs don’t jump off the page compared to other gaming monitors in its class, but the Google TV integration sets it apart. You’ll find it familiar if you’ve used a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/6/24214471/google-chromecast-line-discontinued">Chromecast</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/6/24214055/google-tv-streamer-features-price-matter-thread">Google TV Streamer</a>, or select <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/1/23619895/sony-2023-tv-lineup-bravia-xr-features">TVs from Sony</a>, Hisense, and the like. It delivers recommendations based on your watch history, and you can use Google Assistant voice commands to search for specific content within its deep library of apps as it pulls options from all available sources. You can also cast content from supported mobile apps. Most other smart monitors, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/31/24020920/lg-myview-4k-smart-monitor-display-tv-webos">LG’s MyView line</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23735566/samsung-smart-monitor-2023-m80c-m70c-m50c-tv">Samsung M series</a>, use their own custom operating systems, and most of them are more focused on productivity than gaming.</p><p>The Omen 32x also has some unique tricks we haven’t seen before, such as native support for streaming your screen to four platforms — including Twitch, YouTube, and Instagram — simultaneously with no additional hardware. It can stream up to two webcam sources in addition to what’s on your screen. You can also mirror your Android-based smartphone to the display and use it in desktop mode within a multiview window while you’re gaming. HP even built in wireless KVM functionality, allowing you to operate everything using the same keyboard and mouse.</p><div><figcaption><em>HP’s 2025 G2 monitors, like the pictured Omen 34c G2, have a minimum 180Hz refresh rate.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: HP</cite></p></div><p>HP is also updating its mainstream G2 line of monitors for 2025, including the $479.99 Omen 34c G2, a 34-inch WQHD curved ultrawide (21:9) display with FreeSync Premium, DisplayHDR 400, and a 4,000:1 contrast ratio. We’re also getting new 27-inch 16:9 options in the 1080p Omen 27 G2 for $249.99 in May, the QHD Omen 27q G2 for $299.99 in April, and the QHD 27qs G2 for $449.99 in June. </p><p>All will benefit from factory color calibration for the first time, and the former three will support boosted refresh rates up to 180Hz. The 27qs G2, however, is distinguished as the only monitor in the G2 lineup with an IPS Black display and the first ever with a 280Hz refresh rate. IPS Black displays are said to offer higher contrast ratios (2,000:1 on the 27qs G2) and better color accuracy than ordinary IPS panels.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335238/msi-gaming-laptops-cyborg-stealth-raider-vector-nvidia-rtx-intel-amd-ces<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia’s launch of its new RTX 50-series graphics cards is a big moment for a gaming-focused company like MSI. The PC component maker is refreshing most of its laptop line with new Nvidia GPUs, revised designs, and of course, plenty of AI branding fluff. It’s also offering more CPU options from AMD across its dizzying array of models and configurations. But while there’s a plethora of choices here for gamers, they’re best if you’re partial to jumbo-sized laptops, since many of them are big and heavy 18-inchers.</p><p>Here’s the rundown of what MSI is offering for its gaming laptops in 2025, starting from the top. (MSI hasn’t sent us finalized pricing and availability, but we’ll update this post once we have it.)</p><p><h3>MSI Titan 18 HX AI</h3></p><div><figcaption><em>Even in the standard-edition version, the MSI Titan is an over-the-top laptop.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: MSI</cite></p></div><p>Toward the top of MSI’s lineup is the new Titan 18 HX AI — the standard one, not the ridiculous <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/24099068">Dragon Edition</a>.</p><p>MSI’s halo gaming laptop sports an 18-inch Mini LED screen with a resolution of 3840 x 2400 (16:10) and 120Hz refresh. It only comes with an Intel CPU option — specifically, the new Core Ultra 9 275HX — where many other new MSI notebooks now offer AMD alternatives. For the standard-edition Titan’s GPU, you can pick from Nvidia’s new RTX 5080 or flagship 5090. It can be outfitted with up to 96GB of DDR5 RAM and both Gen5 and Gen4 NVMe M.2 SSD slots (the Gen5 slot even has extra cooling by way of a dedicated heat pipe for maximum performance).</p><p>The laptop weighs in at 7.94 pounds and has a 99.9Wh battery inside it, which is the largest capacity allowed on a plane. For ports, it’s got two Thunderbolt 5 / USB-C, three USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, HDMI 2.1, gigabit ethernet, and an SD card slot.</p><p>As the Titan is the capital-F flagship of MSI’s lineup, it’s once again got a sky-high starting price of around $5,000.</p><p><h3>MSI Raider 18 HX AI</h3></p><p>But you’ll notice some similar specs are present in cheaper MSI laptops, like the new Raider 18 HX. </p><p>The Raider has always been one of MSI’s most powerful laptops, with some of its showiest RGB lighting. For 2025, the Raider has a similar Mini LED screen, GPU options, RAM, ports, battery, and storage with dedicated SSD cooling as the Titan. It looks a bit like the Titan, too, but without the light-up touchpad and an added RGB strip on its front instead. Unlike the Titan, the Raider offers configurations with either the Intel Ultra 9 275HX or AMD Ryzen 9 9955HX3D.</p><p><h3>MSI Vector A18 HX</h3></p><div><figcaption><em>The new MSI Vector. This is what MSI considers a more low-key design for its gaming laptops.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: MSI</cite></p></div><p>If excessive RGB isn’t your thing, the MSI Vector line (in 18-inch, 17-inch, and 16-inch versions) offers a <em>slightly</em> more subtle gray styling with no colorful lights to speak of outside of its per-key RGB keyboards.</p><p>The Vector A18 has an 18-inch 2560 x 1600 (16:10) 240Hz IPS display, the choice of RTX 5070 Ti / 5080 GPUs, AMD CPU configurations, 99.9Wh battery, and a plethora of ports like its pricier counterparts (but with slower Thunderbolt 4 instead of Thunderbolt 5). The Vector 16 HX AI and Vector 17 HX AI models may have slightly smaller screens, but they still support 2560 x 1600 resolution and 240Hz. Each of them has new Intel Arrow Lake CPU options, but the 17-inch has more configurations that go up to the RTX 5090 GPU. </p><p><h3>MSI Stealth 18 HX AI</h3></p><p>While many of the above laptops are thick and heavy, the Stealth line is one of MSI’s most popular due to its slightly smaller and thinner size for those who don’t want to carry around a cinder block of a notebook.</p><p>For 2025, MSI offers the Stealth in 16-inch and 18-inch configurations with GPUs ranging from the RTX 5070 Ti to the 5090. The 18-inch model also offers a 4K 120Hz screen or QHD 240Hz model as well as either an Intel Ultra 9 275HX or AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. The 16-inch Stealth only comes with the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 .</p><p><h3>MSI Cyborg A17 AI</h3></p><div><figcaption><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23774468/clear-transparent-tech-gadgets-news-announcements-products"><em>Seethrough tech</em></a><em>? I am so here for it. Regrettable decisions made in tattoo parlors? Nahh, bro. Nahh.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: MSI</cite></p></div><p>But if you want something cheaper and funkier, MSI’s Cyborg is back again with yet another take on its partially seethrough design.</p><p>The Cyborg 14 and 15 have designs that look like last year’s models, with their innards only visible on the sides and bottom, but the Cyborg 17 has a new chassis with a smoked translucent top deck, allowing you to look directly into it from above. Unfortunately, it’s also uglier than ever thanks to its weird mix of Venom symbiote-style webbing / tribal tattoo line art / whatever that design is. It has CPU options up to the Intel Core Ultra 7 240H or AMD Ryzen 7 260 and RTX 50-series GPUs.</p><p><h3>MSI Crosshair 18 HX AI and MSI Pulse</h3></p><p>Lastly, MSI is also updating its economy-class Crosshair and Pulse series gaming laptops, which top out at configurations with just the Nvidia RTX 5070. MSI says the Crosshair will be its cheapest 18-inch laptop.</p><p>With the jump to RTX 50-series GPUs, MSI is taking its usual shotgun approach and trying to hit all facets of gamers who prioritize specs. It’s also riding the AI train <em>hard</em>. In addition to adding “AI” to the name of most everything, even its latest Claw handheld, MSI’s laptops will ship with a new chatbot dedicated to controlling your computer. Considering some Windows settings are buried in legacy menu structures that still look like they’re from the XP era, the thought of asking your computer to adjust those settings for you sounds a teeny-tiny bit appealing. But I haven’t had a chance to test it yet, and I fear it won’t work as it should — because, let’s be honest, Windows gonna Windows.</p><p>If you didn’t like MSI’s giant spec-heavy laptops before, there’s a good chance its new offerings may not move the needle for you. But if Nvidia’s new GPUs are all they’re cracked up to be, perhaps MSI can impress with raw performance per dollar.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
