It’s the world’s first gamepad to use ultra-low latency Bluetooth, allowing it a sub-3ms response time, and the first accessory to launch under LG’s “Designed for LG Gaming Portal” program. But since it’s been developed in collaboration with LG, the Wolverine V3 BT can only achieve that ultra-low latency when used with compatible LG TVs running webOS 25. It works as a universal Bluetooth gamepad with any device supporting Bluetooth controllers, including other TVs, but it won’t get ultra-low latency when doing so.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>It looks a lot like a Wolverine V3 Pro, but with LG’s gaming logo on the power button and TV controls on the D-pad.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>As a TV-first controller, the new Wolverine V3 BT has some living room-friendly features like a built-in mic and TV controls on its D-pad. The new controller is similar to the standard Wolverine V3 Pro, but it lacks hair-trigger lockouts or extra shoulder buttons. Also, it’s got two customizable rear paddle buttons instead of the usual four. While some of that is a downgrade, this controller gets one big upgrade: TMR sticks. The Hall effect sticks on the Wolverine V3 Pro are already anti-drift, but the TMR ones of the V3 BT should be more precise and less power hungry.</p><p>Pricing and availability are not yet finalized for the Wolverine V3 BT.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

It features dual RGB light strips in the top corners, a pair of THX-certified speakers with spatial audio (which can act as the rear channels in 5.1 or 7.1 audio setups), and six haptic motor actuators in the cushions to barrage your back and posterior with <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Ftechnology%2Frazer-sensa" rel="sponsored">Razer’s Sensa</a> rumble.</p><p>Razer took some of these building blocks from previously released chair accessories. The <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-chairs-accessories%2Frazer-clio" rel="sponsored">Razer Clio</a> is a headrest with wireless THX spatial audio speakers. The <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-chairs-accessories%2Frazer-freyja" rel="sponsored">Freyja</a> is a haptics-filled seat cushion that can go on any chair, and it first debuted at CES 2024 in concept form as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031161/razers-project-esther-kicked-my-butt">Project Esther</a>. And Razer has done an RGB headrest before, with its illuminated logo on the <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-chairs-accessories%2Frazer-head-cushion-chroma" rel="sponsored">Head Cushion Chroma</a>.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>The Nerdiest Gaming Chair to Rule Them All. Go ahead, Razer, trademark that.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>I got to sit in the Project Madison chair for a brief demo at CES, and I can vouch for two of its three features being at least a little engaging: the speakers and haptics. Playing a quick round of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, I got a nice sense of immersion as I could hear around me without needing to wear headphones. And the different kinds of weapons and character abilities made for varying styles of rumble and haptic sensations in my back and tush.</p><p>But you can’t actually see the lighting while playing, unless you take your eyes off the screen and crane your neck. I had to take my colleague at their word that the chair was lighting up and matching the keyboard and mouse Chroma RGB. Perhaps it’s streamer bait, but at least your head doesn’t block the lights like with Razer’s asinine <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-chairs-accessories%2Frazer-head-cushion-chroma" rel="sponsored">RGB cushion</a>.</p><p>Razer isn’t disclosing a potential price range for Project Madison, but it would likely sit toward the top of its priciest offerings if it ever actually comes out. Company reps mentioned that last year’s heated and cooled <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24336722/razer-project-arielle-gaming-chair-heating-cooling-prototype-ces">Project Arielle</a> chair is not going to see a full release, and that’s due to the lofty price Razer would have to charge for it. That doesn’t bode well for Project Madison unless Razer diehards are really clamoring for a chair with all these features built in — but at least they’re features people actually have a history of adopting in modular form.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

            <title><![CDATA[Viture’s latest AR glasses are as competitive and pricey as ever]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/tech/855388/viture-beast-ar-smart-glasses-specs-price-hands-on</link>
            <guid>1398283</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Smart glasses company Viture had a busy 2025, releasing its solid Luma series of glasses and ensuring that its pro mobile dock is compatible with Nintendo’s Switch 2. Now it’s kicking off 2026 by debuting a new model at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/836627/ces-2026-news-gadgets-announcements">CES</a>, called The Beast, and it’s available to preorder now for $549 with shipping starting in February.</p><p>The price is high for a company known for undercutting Xreal’s glasses with most (but not all) of the same features. In some ways, the price hike is warranted; Viture has caught up with Xreal as it has three degrees of freedom support built-in, letting you anchor your screen in virtual space, or allowing the screen to smoothly follow your head movements. Previous models have required additional hardware or software.</p><p>The Beast’s 58-degree field of view is also impressive since it’s a six-degree improvement over Viture’s previous flagship model (Xreal 1S supports 52 degrees). If you want more than just three dimming options, which is what most smart glasses have offered, the electrochromic tint that The Beast uses offers <em>nine</em> levels of adjustment. This lets you see as much or as little of your surrounding environment as you desire. It also has an embedded camera that will unlock six degrees of freedom in some use cases in the future.</p><p>Depending on the person, those benefits might make The Beast’s $100 premium price worth it compared to the cheaper 1S. They are certainly nice additions, even if they’re not must-have features for the average user.</p><p>One unfortunate omission in The Beast is myopia adjustments. Previous Viture models have dials above each eye’s display to let you make minor tweaks to get a clearer image. Instead, The Beast comes in two sizes (regular and large), but you may need prescription lenses if you’re nearsighted. I, for one, am nearsighted, but I was still able to achieve clear results with some adjustments to the included nose pads.</p><p>If you’re deciding between The Beast and the 1S (or any other AR glasses), here are some specs and thoughts worth knowing: Both support up to 1200p resolution (though Viture says it’s coming after launch) and 120Hz refresh rate. They both have 2D-to-3D conversion features that aim to make content more immersive, though my first impression wasn’t positive with either set. The Beast weigh about 96 grams according to my kitchen scale, while the 1S weighs in at 86 grams (Viture told <em>The Verge</em> that this preproduction unit weighs about two grams more than the final production version). The weight difference is easy to notice, and tweaking the fit of The Beast was all but necessary with its included nose pads. The Xreal 1S’ weight distribution feels more comfortable.</p><p>Anecdotally, I’ve preferred how my games and movies look through Viture’s glasses, even though both brands claim to utilize Sony’s latest micro OLED screens. Text and details appear sharp on The Beast and 1S, though the contrast is richer with Viture’s model. If those who own Viture’s Luma Pro glasses were content with the field of view and not being able to easily anchor the video feed in virtual space, I’m not convinced that these are worth upgrading to. And while Xreal doesn’t have the upper hand on this model in a meaningful way spec-wise, the lower price and weight of the 1S will probably make it the more popular pick.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/855388/viture-beast-ar-smart-glasses-specs-price-hands-on]]></content:encoded>
