Over the course of the game, Kratos will “learn deadly skills using his spear and shield, as well as harness powerful divine artifacts known as the Gifts of Olympus to take on a wide array of foes.”</p><p>Sony’s Santa Monica Studio collaborated on the game with <a href="https://megacatstudios.com/?srsltid=AfmBOorSQLZyJTP_WL6SMIKok01L0dY35LHwwUBHRTwqZ4AetCFAMWTu">Mega Cat Studios</a>. It costs $29.99, with a Digital Deluxe version available for $39.99.</p><p>Sony also announced that it’s working on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_tq12WisX8">remake of the original <em>God of War</em> trilogy</a>, with TC Carson set to return as the voice of Kratos. However, the project is “still very early in development, so we ask for your patience as it will be a while before anything else can be shared,” according to Sony. “When we can come back with an update, we aim to make it a big one!”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/878375/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-trilogy-sony-playstation-ps5-release-date-trailer]]></content:encoded>
