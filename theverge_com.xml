            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334067/samsung-odyssey-g8-g6-3d-smart-monitor-m9-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just a few days after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/29/24331748/lg-ultragear-gx9-bendable-oled-5k2k-monitors-specs">LG announced</a> its CES 2025 lineup of monitors, Samsung is doing the same. The company just introduced several new models, and perhaps the most impressive among them is the Odyssey OLED G81SF. It’s a 27-inch 4K monitor with a maximum refresh rate of 240Hz, 0.03ms response time, a glare-free display, and rear-core lighting with 52 color options. Samsung is also including a number of burn-in protection measures to ensure that the Odyssey G81SF’s screen looks pristine for years to come. The G8 is likely to be using the latest and greatest OLED panel from Samsung Display.</p><p>Next up is the Odyssey OLED G60SF — also a 27-inch OLED monitor — with a QHD resolution and an impressive 500Hz refresh rate that Samsung says effectively “eliminates lag and motion blur for ultra-smooth gameplay during critical moments.”</p><p>In 2025, Samsung is also finally shipping the Odyssey 3D monitor it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031774/play-vr-games-without-a-vr-headset">first teased at least year’s CES</a>. It lets you experience 3D visuals <em>without</em> any special glasses by using a lenticular lens on the front panel. “Eye tracking monitors the movement of both eyes using a built-in stereo camera, while view mapping continuously adjusts the image to enhance depth perception,” Samsung said in its press release. The Odyssey 3D only comes in a 27-inch 4K size; the larger 37-inch display <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24225133/samsung-odyssey-3d-gaming-monitor-glasses-free-announcement">mentioned last year</a> has apparently been scrapped. The company says it offers “a rapid 1ms gray-to-gray response time, and a 165Hz refresh rate.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Samsung’s Smart Monitor series is making the switch to OLED.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Samsung</cite></p></div><p>That does it for the gaming-focused monitors, but Samsung is also announcing two others that are more focused on everyday productivity. The SmartMonitor series is finally going OLED with the new Smart Monitor M9. And this year, Samsung is throwing in a ton of AI capabilities including AI Picture Optimizer. Like on its TVs, this feature “analyzes input signals to determine the type of content being viewed — such as gaming, video, or productivity applications — and automatically adjust the display settings for the best visual experience.” This also works for gaming and can detect the genre of what you’re playing.</p><p>AI Upscaling Pro can make lower-res content look crisper at the M9’s 4K resolution, and the monitor has a maximum refresh rate of 165Hz. That’s a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23180741/samsung-m8-smart-monitor-review-32-inch-4k-smart-tv-usb-c-hdr">significant upgrade from the M8</a>, which topped out at 60Hz. Samsung says moving to OLED also allows for a new “ultra-slim” design for the Smart Monitor M9 that should take up considerably less desk space.</p><p>The last monitor being announced (at least for today) is the only non-OLED model of the bunch. The new 37-inch ViewFinity S8 has a 16:9 aspect ratio, a built-in KVM switch, 90W USB-C passthrough charging, and covers 99 percent of the sRGB color gamut. Peak brightness for this 4K display tops out at 350 nits, which should be perfectly suitable for anything you’ll be doing at a desk.</p><p>Pricing and release dates are still to come, but <em>The Verge</em> will be in Las Vegas for CES 2025 in a matter of days. So you won’t have to wait much longer for some first-hand impressions of Samsung’s new monitors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334049/asus-samsung-msi-27-inch-4k-oled-240hz-monitors<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>27-inch 4K OLED 240Hz monitors seem to be like buses: you wait ages for one and then three turn up at once. Asus, Samsung, and MSI are all announcing the industry’s next-generation QD-OLED gaming monitors that offer the benefits of 4K OLED 240Hz panels at the smaller 27-inch size instead of 32 inches.</p><p>All three appear to be using the same fourth generation QD-OLED panel from Samsung Display, which Asus says offers “a longer lifespan over previous-gen OLEDs.” Both the <a href="https://rog.asus.com/monitors/27-to-31-5-inches/rog-swift-oled-pg27ucdm/">Asus ROG Swift OLED PG27UCDM</a> and the <a href="https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MPG-272URX-QD-OLED">MSI MPG 272URX QD-OLED</a> (who names these things?) include DisplayPort 2.1a (UHBR20), which offers 80Gbps of bandwidth to support 4K at 240Hz without the need for Display Stream Compression (DSC). <a href="https://news.samsung.com/kr/%ec%82%bc%ec%84%b1%ec%a0%84%ec%9e%90-ces-2025%ec%84%9c-%eb%aa%a8%eb%8b%88%ed%84%b0-%ec%8b%a0%eb%aa%a8%eb%8d%b8-5%ec%a2%85-%ea%b3%b5%ea%b0%9c?utm_source=nr_twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">Samsung’s press release</a> about its Odyssey OLED G8 (G81SF) doesn’t mention DisplayPort 2.1a compatibility, but it’s reasonable to assume it’s part of the spec list.</p><div><figcaption><em>Asus’ latest OLED monitor has a 26.5-inch viewable display.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Asus</cite></p></div><div><figcaption><em>Samsung’s Odyssey G8 now comes in a 27-inch OLED 4K 240Hz variant.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Samsung</cite></p></div><p>MSI and Asus’ models both support DisplayHDR True Black 400, and Asus also supports Dolby Vision HDR. Both MSI and Asus are offering a three-year warranty that includes burn-in protection, but Samsung hasn’t confirmed its warranty situation for its latest G8 model. Samsung also hasn’t fully detailed the specs of its latest G8 OLED model, but it’s reasonable to assume it will support DisplayHDR True Black 400 at the minimum.</p><p>Interestingly, Asus’ model only has a 26.5-inch viewable display, but both MSI and Samsung are marketing their monitors as 27-inch ones. With all three offering the 0.03ms response times of OLED, 240Hz refresh rates, and above 160PPI for improved text clarity, the choice will really come down to design, features, and pricing. Unfortunately, Samsung, Asus, and MSI haven’t announced release dates or pricing yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
