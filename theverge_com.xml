After announcing a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">50 percent price increase to Game Pass Ultimate</a> last week, Microsoft now says this price increase will only currently affect new purchases and not existing subscribers in markets like Austria, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Korea, Poland, and India.</p><p>“At this time, these increases will only affect new purchases and will not affect your current subscription for the market in which you reside, as long as you are on an auto-recurring plan,” explains Microsoft in an email that was sent to some Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers overnight. “Should you choose to cancel your plan and repurchase, you will be charged at the new current rate.”</p><p><em>The Verge</em> has verified that the email is genuine and from Microsoft.</p><p>The change in these countries is likely related to local regulations on subscription price changes, and it means in Ireland existing subscribers with auto-renew enabled will still be charged at the €17.99 monthly rate, instead of the new €26.99 pricing. Microsoft notes in its email that existing subscribers in these markets will be notified “at least 60 days in advance” of price changes, meaning the changes won’t go into effect for at least two more months.</p><p>The halt in price increases in select markets is a change to what Microsoft announced last week. “This updated pricing will go into effect on October 1st for new subscribers, and then at the next billing cycle, likely to be November 4th, for current subscribers,” said Dustin Blackwell, director of gaming and platform communications at Microsoft, in a briefing with <em>The Verge</em> last week.</p><p>The price hikes still appear to be in place for existing subscribers in the UK and US, though. I’ve reached out to Microsoft to comment on the price hike changes, and we’ll update you accordingly.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/794032/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-changes-countries]]></content:encoded>
