Creators can already use generative AI tools to create things like textures and audio, and Meta will bring an AI assistant to the editor later this year to help creators with development. In a demo I saw at Connect 2025, a developer had a conversation with an AI chatbot to request changes like a new environment and tweaks to the personality of an AI-driven NPC.</p><p>Powering Meta’s new metaverse environments is the Horizon Engine, which “powers better graphics, faster performance, and more advanced” VR worlds, including “much greater concurrency,” according to Meta.</p><p><em>Horizon Worlds</em> hasn’t caught on broadly, even though it’s expanded from VR <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/25/23887494/meta-horizon-worlds-web-mobile-vr-super-rumble">to mobile</a>.
