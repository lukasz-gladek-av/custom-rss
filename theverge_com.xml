Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Those little <em>Among Us</em> beans are being transported to a new dimension<em>.</em> Developer Innersloth has announced a new game called <em>Among Us 3D</em>, which is exactly what it sounds like: the hit multiplayer deduction game, but played in a three-dimensional world from a first-person perspective.</p><p>If that sounds familiar, it’s because that’s what <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/11/23392699/among-us-vr-meta-quest-2-release-date">the VR version of the game was when it launched in 2022</a>. <em>3D</em> will make that experience playable without the need for a headset. With the launch of <em>Among Us 3D</em>, the VR version will be rebranded, and the new release will unite players across both PC and VR through cross-play.</p><p>The studio says that this “will allow Steam PC users to join cross-platform lobbies with VR players on Meta Quest, Steam VR, PlayStation VR 2, and PICO.”</p><p>It’s not clear yet when the 3D game will be launching, but the studio says that it’s coming soon on Steam. A demo will be available as part of Steam Next Fest on Monday. And while the original 2D version of <em>Among Us</em> will still exist, there will be no cross-play between it and the first-person edition.</p><p>As part of the announcement, Innersloth also revealed a new in-game currency called “stardust,” which will be used to buy cosmetics in <em>Among Us 3D</em>. The studio specified that the currency won’t be used for purchasing any actual game modes or features. Here’s the full roadmap for what has been announced so far:</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
