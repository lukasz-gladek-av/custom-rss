On Wednesday, Nintendo announced, of all things, the “Alarmo” alarm clock. But in classic Nintendo fashion, the clock has some playful tricks.</p><p>The clock responds to your movements, which you can use to snooze your alarm with motion. Its faces feature Nintendo characters from franchises like <em>Super Mario</em> and <em>Zelda</em>, and you can set the alarm to wake you up with music from those franchises. The Alarmo can also track how much you move in your sleep.</p><p>The Alarmo — officially, the “Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo” — is available to purchase in “early access” for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers and at the Nintendo NY store. We’ve actually already picked one up, and we’ve published some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24266272/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock-hands-on">initial impressions and a bunch of photos</a>.</p><p>Here’s all of our coverage of Nintendo’s Alarmo clock.</p></section><div><div><h2>Highlights</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266353/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock#dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTE5NjY=">Nintendo’s original alarm clock prototypes were a lot less playful</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266353/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock#dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTI3OTA=">Nintendo is making an alarm clock so you can wake up to Zelda and Super Mario sounds</a></li></ul></div><section id="updates-section"><ul><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTQyNzU=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24266272/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock-hands-on">A closer look at Nintendo’s adorable Alarmo clock</a></h2><div><p>Look, I’m a sucker for instant gratification. It’s often one of my favorite things about living in New York City. This morning, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265984/nintendo-alarmo-alarm-clock-date-price">Nintendo announced its $99 Alarmo clock</a>, and when the company’s store in Rockefeller Center opened a couple hours later, I walked in and picked one up. Did I feel a little iffy about paying $108.91 after tax for a plastic alarm clock? You bet. But fortunately, in my field, this counts as a work expense. (Technically, this product is called Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo — but no one is ever going to refer to it that way. It’s Alarmo.)</p><p><em>The Verge</em>’s senior entertainment editor Andrew Webster will have a full review of Alarmo coming up, but I wanted to check it out for myself. Mostly, I was curious about the audio quality. If the speaker in this relatively tiny clock sounds tinny or shrill, that would ruin the whole concept for me.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24266272/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock-hands-on">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Now anyone can buy an Alarmo.</p><p>Nintendo’s motion-sensing (and <em>Doom</em>-playing, with some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/3/24286842/nintendo-alarmo-doom-hack-usb-custom-firmware-instructions">unsanctioned modification</a>) alarm clock is now available for anyone in the US to buy from its online store “while supplies last,” the company <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1890491214639645040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1890491214639645040%7Ctwgr%5E6aaf9cb3f67b6ae3103de2b26e2a29621a11952d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.engadget.com%2Fhome%2Fsmart-home%2Fanyone-in-the-us-can-now-buy-nintendos-alarmo-clock-from-the-online-store-171945008.html">announced yesterday</a>.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTkwNQ==" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342984/nintendo-alarmo-wide-release-date">Nintendo’s Alarmo will be available for everyone starting in March</a></h2><div><p><cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p>Another day, another announcement from Nintendo that isn’t <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/11/24341043/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-details-leaks">the next Switch</a>. Today the company revealed that its alarm clock, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24266272/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock-hands-on">Alarmo</a>, will be available at select retailers starting this March.

Today’s news opens that up to the larger public. The motion-controlled device lets users turn it off simply by getting up, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">though in my experience</a>, that functionality wasn’t much use if you share a bed. It also includes a number of sounds and themes based on Nintendo properties, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318663/tcxmn">including <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> through a recent update.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342984/nintendo-alarmo-wide-release-date">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6OTcwMw==" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/3/24286842/nintendo-alarmo-doom-hack-usb-custom-firmware-instructions">Can Nintendo’s Alarmo run Doom?

The device is called Alarmo, and it “responds to your movements,” which means you can snooze it with a gesture or stop it by actually getting out of bed.
