He joined in 2018, and after a stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Steam Autumn Sale starts next Monday, but Valve dropped an early treat in the form of a rare <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamdeck" rel="sponsored">Steam Deck LCD discount</a>. The 256GB model that normally sells for $399.99 is $319.20 through October 6th at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. I, for one, thank Valve for dropping this deal now instead of when the servers inevitably hiccup at the start of the game sale.</p><p>For anyone out there deciding between the Steam Deck LCD, the pricier OLED, and perhaps other handhelds, it’s tough to beat the value of this discounted model. The Deck will be four years old in February, but it’s still a contender when it comes to good, reliable performance in PC games, especially considering how power-efficient it is. Another perk: it runs SteamOS, not Windows 11.</p><p>Also, game compatibility across Steam is generally great (more and more developers are building games with the Steam Deck’s specs in mind ahead of launch), and Valve has patched the Steam Deck frequently throughout the years with new features. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review">It didn’t start out great</a>, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">it eventually got there</a>.</p><p>Sure, the $549 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> boasts some nice perks that some will be willing to pay extra for, like a bigger battery, a 90Hz refresh rate OLED, faster Wi-Fi 6E. But at just over $200 less, you’re getting a pretty similar gaming experience in the Steam Deck LCD.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->319</span></p><div><p>The Steam Deck is a portable handheld console you can use to play PC games.</p></div></div><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/782737/the-steam-deck-lcd-is-20-percent-off-through-october-6th#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/782737/the-steam-deck-lcd-is-20-percent-off-through-october-6th]]></content:encoded>
