It’s also bigger than the OG Switch. But, like, <em>how much</em> bigger?</p><p>Okay, sure, we can check <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch%2Ftech-specs" rel="sponsored">the</a> <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ftech-specs" rel="sponsored">specs</a> and see that the Switch 2 is half an inch (12.7mm) taller and 1.2 inches (30.48mm) wider than the original — and it’s 0.22 pounds (99.79 grams) heavier. But don’t just bark numbers at me! Nah, man, get that nerd math out of here. </p><p>What about vibes-wise? How much bigger does it <em>feel</em>?</p><p>We already know the Switch 2 is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682075/verge-staffers-react-nintendo-switch-2#:~:text=Only%20one%20color%20option%3F">a whole lot less colorful</a> and fun-looking than the original, and it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682075/verge-staffers-react-nintendo-switch-2#:~:text=Krales%20/%20The%20Verge-,Ergonomics,-The%20original%20Switch">definitely not any more comfortable to use</a>, either. So how does it compare to the more lively-looking Switches that came before it? And how about other boring black boxes that have brought us years of joyous games? Well, to show you, I got my Switch 2 out along with its direct progenitors and some of its other ilk from the world of video games, and I took a bunch of pictures.</p><div><p id="nintendo-switch-2-vs-switch-oled-vs-original-switch"><h2><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 vs. Switch OLED vs. original Switch</strong></h2></p></div><p>First up, the most obvious comparison: the Switch 2, its Joy-Con 2 controllers, and its new dock versus its last-gen counterparts. Any Switch may seem compact compared to various PC handhelds flooding the market these days, especially a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339992/acer-nitro-blaze-11-gaming-handheld-steam-deck-size-comparison">surfboard-like one</a> that still hasn’t come out yet, but seeing the Switch 2 next to an original launch-day Switch from 2017 makes me wonder how we ever got on with that dainty original. The OLED edition may not have been any more powerful, but its slightly larger screen did make a huge difference. And now, the Switch 2 is even bigger than that. Despite not being all that comfortable in handheld mode, this feels like the <em>right</em> size for a Switch.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->20</strong><span><figcaption><em>The Switch 2 flanked by the original launch Switch (right) and Switch OLED (left).</em></figcaption></span></p></section><div><p id="nintendo-switch-2-vs-other-handhelds"><h2><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 vs. other handhelds</strong></h2></p></div><p>The Switch 2’s new stature may be a marked improvement, but Valve’s Steam Deck was bigger and comfier right out of the gate.

So how does the Switch 2 compare to the PlayStation 2?</p><p>You’re also wondering <em>why</em> compare the Switch 2 to the PS2? Well, why not? </p><p>But, for good measure, I’ve also put the new Nintendo console up against the PS3, PS4, PS5, Xbox 360, Xbox Series X, and GameCube.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->15</strong><span><figcaption><em>Switch 2 vs. PlayStation 2 (vertical).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I feel like a broken record, but I’ve been writing for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24123318/microsoft-next-xbox-pc-future">more than a year</a> that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/612105/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-platform-changes-notepad">next Xbox console</a> will be more <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339889/microsoft-xbox-handheld-windows-operating-system-changes-notepad">PC-like</a>. Now, I think Microsoft just teased its next-gen Xbox plans while announcing its partnership with Asus to bring <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">two Xbox Ally handhelds</a> to the market later this year.</p><p>The Xbox Ally handhelds run Windows, but the Xbox team has worked with Windows engineers to boot these PC handhelds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices?preview=true&amp;vm_preview=fa9278b54dcc70a82977039c0c8c6fb8">into a full-screen Xbox UI</a>. The Windows desktop doesn’t even fully load, and you use the Xbox app UI as a launcher to get to all your games (even Steam titles) and apps like Discord.</p><p>While the combination of Windows and Xbox here is intriguing, it’s the way that Microsoft is positioning these devices that really caught my attention. “This is an Xbox,” said Microsoft during the reveal, clearly expanding its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296420/microsoft-this-is-an-xbox-marketing-campaign-xbox-everywhere">marketing push</a> beyond a single console to every screen and device.</p><p>It all felt like a true Xbox handheld reveal. There was even an 11-minute-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOKm9dDOSC8">behind-the-scenes video</a> on the Xbox Ally handhelds, filmed in a similar style to Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1dRgWpGePs">“Project Scorpio” Xbox One X reveal</a> from nearly nine years ago. “This is a breakthrough moment for Xbox,” <strong>Carl Ledbetter</strong>, a 30-year Microsoft design veteran, says in the video. Ledbetter helped design the original IntelliMouse, the Xbox 360 Slim, the Xbox One X, and plenty of other Microsoft devices. When Ledbetter is involved, you know it’s more than just a simple partner project with Asus.</p><p>“For the first time, a player is going to be able to hold the power of the Xbox experience in their hand, and take it with them anywhere they want to go,” says Xbox president <strong>Sarah Bond</strong>, in the same video. Microsoft thinks of the Xbox Ally handhelds as Xbox consoles with the freedom of Windows, and I think the next-gen Xbox is going to look very similar as a result.</p><p>Microsoft’s own Xbox handheld <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-xboxs-handheld-pembrooke-has-been-sidelined-for-now-as-microsoft-doubles-down-on-windows-11-pc-gaming-handheld-optimization">was reportedly</a> “sidelined” recently, and I’ve heard from insiders that it’s essentially canceled as the company focuses on Xbox’s new software platform. I still think we’ll see next-gen Xbox hardware from Microsoft, but I also strongly believe we’ll see multiple devices from PC makers like Asus that will also be considered next-gen Xbox consoles.</p><p>That’s because the next-gen Xbox platform is being built in the open, with devices like the ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X. These handhelds seem like a market test for where Microsoft goes next with the combination of Windows and Xbox, and the company’s goal to turn any screen into an Xbox.</p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO <strong>Phil Spencer</strong> made it clear in an <a href="https://youtu.be/mw26FdfkUDM">Xbox podcast</a> earlier this week that the Windows and Xbox teams are working more closely than ever. He also revealed this is to make the PC gaming experience more console-like:</p><div><blockquote><p><em>This is the tightest collaboration I’ve seen between the gaming organization and the Windows team in my three decades at the company. For 25 years, almost, we’ve been working on a console experience where you turn it on and it works and your games are there, and how do we bring that to the Windows ecosystem so you get the freedom of Windows to use the storefronts and the apps you want to use, but it feels like a device that’s purpose-built.</em></p></blockquote></div><p>There are plenty of technical challenges on the Windows side to fix, but these new Xbox Ally handheld devices also demonstrate a challenge for Microsoft: it’s about to sell an “Xbox handheld” that won’t run most Xbox console games natively. I’ve seen plenty of hands-on YouTube videos claiming this is a true “Xbox handheld,” but very few make it clear that it’s actually only natively running PC games.</p><p>Microsoft’s Xbox Play Anywhere effort lets you buy an Xbox game and get the PC version, but only a small amount of Xbox games and publishers are currently part of this. This isn’t an issue for Microsoft’s own first-party Xbox games, as they’ve been publishing to PC for years now, but upcoming games like <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> won’t run on these Xbox handhelds. You’ll have to stream <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> instead, until the PC version, which hasn’t been announced yet, is released.</p><p>I think most consumers won’t even realize this is the case as Microsoft is already heavily marketing these handhelds as Xboxes. Xbox fans were going wild <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLEflHcy8bU">during a watch party</a>, but as soon as the ROG logo appeared the room got a lot more subdued. This highlights Microsoft’s brand challenges here and why Xbox fans are cautious when it comes to the complexity of a PC and the future of their game library. Either way, the real benefit of Microsoft’s approach is access to Steam PC games and even PlayStation PC titles on “Xbox handhelds,” so Microsoft should lean into that selling point initially.</p><p>Over the long term, I think Microsoft will eventually solve this challenge through emulation. Bond created a new team focused on game preservation and forward compatibility in early 2024, but there are technical and licensing hurdles to overcome before original Xbox, Xbox 360, and modern Xbox games can run emulated on a PC.</p><p>Until Microsoft is ready with emulation, it’s filling the gaps with Xbox Play Anywhere and Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming instead. Microsoft’s Xbox app on PC will simply show your recently played games, and then you can just play them — whether it’s natively or streaming through the cloud. Microsoft has already done all the important work for cloud saves, so this makes the experience a lot more seamless.</p><p>All of this work is moving in a direction that Microsoft keeps talking about: choice. Instead of buying one Xbox console from Microsoft, what if you could buy Xbox consoles from lots of PC makers without ever having to see the complexity of Windows?</p><p>Microsoft is going to change the next generation of game consoles if it can pull this off. The company is already opening up its Xbox PC app to list Steam games, so having the ability to run <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633478/microsoft-xbox-steam-games-support-ui">Steam games on next-gen Xbox</a> consoles doesn’t feel all that far-fetched anymore. </p><p>I don’t think Microsoft is doing a bunch of Windows and Xbox work just to have this software running on handhelds. I think this work will give Microsoft the ability to control the console-like experience and UI on a variety of hardware, in a way where it can upsell Game Pass, its own Xbox PC games, and more. Microsoft is already in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/15/24221036/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming-valve-steamos">handheld gaming PC race</a> against Valve and SteamOS, but that’s a smaller battle in the war to define the next generation of video game consoles. </p><p>As I’ve written plenty of times before, the key to this next-gen Xbox platform will be Microsoft’s execution. It has everything it needs to make this approach a success, but Microsoft’s focus on gaming on Windows has been disastrous in the past. With the Windows and Xbox teams now working together more closely than ever before, it’s make or break time for a new Xbox platform that looks like it’s going to extend far beyond the confines of a handheld PC.</p><div><p id="the-pad"><h2>The pad:</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>You can now try Microsoft’s new Start menu for Windows 11. </strong>Microsoft is now allowing Windows 11 testers to try out a new, larger Start menu that includes a scrollable interface, new views, and more customization.

Microsoft has also made the Start menu larger based on the screen size of your device or monitor. I’d still like to see a bigger overhaul to the Start menu, but having two new category and grid views certainly helps.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft is moving its Build conference out of Seattle for 2026. </strong>Microsoft isn’t planning to host its Build developer conference in its home city of Seattle next year. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684313/microsoft-build-conference-2026-location">The conference is being relocated</a>, and Microsoft isn’t saying where it will host Build next, after holding it in Seattle since 2017. One report suggests that the move out of Seattle could have been related to attendee experiences in downtown Seattle. An email is making the rounds locally in Seattle that claims Build attendees had “cited the general uncleanliness of the streets, visible drug use, and the presence of unhoused individuals.”</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft Edge is getting an AI-powered browser history that works with typos. </strong>Microsoft has started testing a new feature for its Edge browser that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684195/microsoft-edge-ai-browser-history-search-feature">adds an AI-powered search to browsing history</a>. This new “enhanced search” feature lets you find websites in your browser history even if you use a phrase, synonym, or even a typo that’s similar to the site you actually want to find. This feature is opt-in and uses an on-device model to train on browsing history data “which never leaves your device and is never sent to Microsoft.” This seems like less of a privacy risk than Microsoft’s Recall feature, and you don’t have to worry about snapshots of your screen being stored in a local database, either.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft and Asus’ two new Xbox Ally handhelds are coming later this year</strong>. We don’t have pricing for either device yet, but we do have specs for the new Xbox Ally handhelds.

Some games were making Windows BSOD, but Microsoft notes that its June update wasn’t available for PCs with Easy Anti-Cheat installed, so only a small number of people will have installed the update and then installed an incompatible game afterward. Either way, it’s all fixed now with an additional update.</span></li><li><span><strong>Did Microsoft just tease a Halo CE remaster? </strong>Regular Notepad readers will know I teased a <em>Halo CE</em> remaster <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172684/microsoft-xbox-showcase-2024">last year</a>, and Xbox chief Phil Spencer appears to have confirmed that it’s on the way. At the end of the Xbox Games Showcase, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682493/did-microsoft-just-tease-a-halo-ce-remaster">Spencer casually revealed</a> that “the next <em>Forza</em>” is coming next year, along with “the return of a classic that’s been with us since the beginning.” <em>Halo CE</em> was the launch title for the original Xbox, which turns 25 years old in 2026.</span></li><li><span><strong>Gears of War: E-Day is coming in 2026</strong>.
