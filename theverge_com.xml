            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/663307/delta-emulator-ios-apple-app-store-patreon-signup<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Following companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661719/amazon-app-ios-apple-iphone-ipad-kindle-buy-books">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660084/spotify-app-iphone-apple-update-external-payment-links">Spotify</a>, the Delta emulator is the latest iOS app to take advantage of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">last month’s ruling</a> by Epic Games v. Apple judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. Although it has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661032/apple-epic-games-app-store-antitrust-ninth-circuit">appealed the decision</a>, Apple has complied with the ruling that it can no longer restrict developers from directing users to alternate payment options or collect a 27 percent commission on purchases made outside of apps. As a result, the Delta emulator — which can play games from retro consoles like the N64, NES, Game Boy, and Sega Genesis through emulation — has been updated to make it easier to join its Patreon. This lets users unlock additional features from right within the app without <a href="https://x.com/altstoreio/status/1920175446844715277">Apple’s intimidating scare screens</a> or inflated pricing.</p><p>“Delta’s latest update with our revised Patreon sign-up flow has been approved! We can now freely mention our Patreon without giving Apple 27% of donations,” Delta developer Riley Testut <a href="https://mastodon.social/@rileytestut/114467929471303098">announced on Mastodon</a> yesterday. When opening the app’s settings, users are now prompted to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/rileyshane">join the developers’ Patreon</a> to “Unlock exclusive app icons and receive early access to new features by donating.” Pressing a join button opens a web page within the app where users can select different membership tiers which include features like access to beta versions of the app, or the developers’ private Discord.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/17/24323220/delta-emulator-ios-apple-triple-price-patreon-membership">previous Delta update</a> released last December allowed users to sign up for Patreon-exclusive membership perks directly through its iOS app following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/16/24040881/apple-outside-payments-app-store-policies-iphone-ipad">updates to Apple’s App Store policies in early 2024</a>. But as a result of Apple’s decision to take a 27 percent cut from developers directing users to an outside payment platform, Delta’s $3, $5, and $10 Patreon memberships instead cost $10, $15, and $30, respectively, through its iOS app.</p><p>That purchase option – with the increased prices – is still available in Delta, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/deltas-game-emulator-becomes-a-patreon-supported-app-after-us-app-store-policy-changes/">according to <em>TechCrunch</em></a>, but is made less obvious through an Alternate Payment Methods menu in the app’s settings.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/8/24291232/nintendo-pocketpair-palworld-lawsuit-patents">ongoing lawsuit between Nintendo and <em>Palworld</em> developer Pocketpair</a> has forced the studio to make some changes to its <em>Pokémon</em>-like game. In <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20250508">a new blog post</a>, Pocketpair explained that a patch in November removed certain gameplay features, and that an upcoming update will cull even more. “We have had to make certain compromises in order to avoid disruptions to the development and distribution of <em>Palworld</em>,” the studio says.</p><p>This started with a patch on November 30th, which most notably removed the ability to summon creatures by throwing a “Pal Sphere,” which is reminiscent of summoning pokémon with a Poké Ball. The studio adds that other changes were made, without specifying what they were.</p><div><p>“As many have speculated, these changes were indeed a result of the ongoing litigation.”</p></div><p>“As many have speculated, these changes were indeed a result of the ongoing litigation,” Pocketpair explains. “Everyone here at Pocketpair was disappointed that this adjustment had to be made, and we fully understand that many players feel the same frustration. Unfortunately, as the alternative would have led to an even greater deterioration of the gameplay experience for players, it was determined that this change was necessary.”</p><p>More changes are coming, as well. Pocketpair says that the upcoming patch v0.5.5 will change how gliding works, as “gliding will be performed using a glider rather than with Pals.”</p><div><p>Nintendo first filed its patent infringement lawsuit <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248602/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-pocketpair-patent-infringement-lawsuit">in September of last year</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248957/pocketpair-pokemon-patent-infrigement-lawsuit">Pocketpair initially said that</a> “we are unaware of the specific patents we are accused of infringing upon, and we have not been notified of such details.” However, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/8/24291232/nintendo-pocketpair-palworld-lawsuit-patents">soon after the exact patents at the heart of the lawsuit were revealed</a>, and they covered elements like riding characters and throwing balls in a field.</p></div><p>Despite the forced changes, Pocketpair says that “we remain committed to developing <em>Palworld</em> and delivering exciting new content to our fans.” Nintendo, meanwhile, is set to release the next major <em>Pokémon</em> game with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618705/pokemon-legends-z-a-chikorita-tepig-totodile-battles">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a></em> later this year.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
