The games will launch in 2027 and are exclusive for the Nintendo Switch 2. Nintendo also shared a trailer showcasing a new trio of starter pokémon — Browt, Pombon, and Gecua — and a number of different environments you’ll be able to explore as you play through the games.</p><p>In addition to establishing that <em>Wind </em>and <em>Waves</em> takes place in an island setting, the trailer really highlights how much more detailed and complex the games’ environments are compared to past titles like <em>Scarlet </em>/ <em>Violet </em>and <em>Legends: Z-A. </em>It seems like you’ll be able to explore dense jungles, caves full of magma, and beneath the ocean all while encountering wild pokémon. In a press release, <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Pokemon-Continues-30th-Celebrations-with-the-Unveiling-of-Pokemon-Wind">Nintendo</a> said that <em>Wind </em>and <em>Waves </em>will be open-world games, and the company also noted that Brazilian Portuguese will officially be supported as a selectable language.</p><p>2027 is still a ways out from now, but <em>Winds </em>and <em>Waves</em>’ definitely seems like it’s going to be worth the wait. And with <em>Pokopia </em>about to drop next week, there’s going to be plenty to keep <em>Pokémon </em>fans busy in the meantime.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTE="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Charles Pulliam-Moore</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/885321/pokemon-winds-and-waves-trailer-browt-pombom-gecua]]></content:encoded>
