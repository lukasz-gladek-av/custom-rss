            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/668349/fortnite-star-wars-james-earl-jones-vader-ai-voice<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/charles-pulliam-moore">Charles Pulliam-Moore</a> <span>is a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>When <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661237/epic-games-fortnite-apple-us-ios-app-store-eu-account">Fortnite</a> </em>players meet Darth Vader in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659347/fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle-season-battle-pass">the game’s ongoing <em>Star Wars </em>event</a>, they will be able to speak with the Sith Lord directly, and he’s going to respond with a voice that sounds exactly like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/19/5323642/james-earl-jones-doesnt-pay-much-attention-to-his-voice">James Earl Jones</a>.</p></div><p>Though Darth Vader has previously appeared as an NPC (and a battle pass skin) in <em>Fortnite</em>, Epic Games announced today that the character’s latest outing will be a bit different thanks to the use of AI. After finding and defeating Vader on the map, players can recruit him onto their teams and speak directly with him using <em>Fortnite</em>’s in-game audio chat functionality. And Vader will respond in an AI recreation of James Earl Jones’ iconic voice whose answers vary depending on what players.</p><p>Per a FAQ about the interactive feature, Epic says that Vader’s answers will be based on audio recordings of player’s voices that are sent directly to Gemini. Player audio and transcriptions of their voices will not be stored, though Epic will have access to transcriptions of Vader’s responses for instances in which players report what the character says. The company also says that it will “not use any of your interactions with Darth Vader to train AI models.” Additionally, players under the age of 13 or their country’s age of digital consent will need parental permission to use the feature.</p><p>The note about reporting Vader’s responses implies that the AI-voiced character might be able to say inappropriate things Epic, Disney, and Lucasfilm wouldn’t approve of. And, as Twitch streamer Loserfruit demonstrated earlier today, that seems to be very much the case.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/this-will-be-a-day-long-remembered-speak-with-darth-vader-in-fortnite">a statement</a> about the feature, Epic explained that Vader’s voice was created using <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/603821/google-gemini-flash-2-0-ai-app">Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23864878/ai-voice-clones-podcastle-elevenlabs-personal-voice">ElevenLabs</a>’ Flash v2.5 models. The studio also said Vader “wouldn’t be nearly as sinister” without Jones’ performance, and thanked Jones’ estate for signing off on the collaboration. Jones’ family echoed Epic’s sentiments, and said that the late actor “always wanted fans of all ages to continue to experience” <em>Star Wars</em>’ with his voice in it.</p><p>“We hope that this collaboration with Fortnite will allow both longtime fans of Darth Vader and newer generations to share in the enjoyment of this iconic character,” the family said.</p><div><p>Before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24240301/james-earl-jones-darth-vader-voice-died">his death last September</a>, Jones signed off on a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/24/23370097/darth-vader-james-earl-jones-obi-wan-kenobi-star-wars-ai-disney-lucasfilm">deal with AI startup Respeecher</a> that gave the company the rights to recreate his voice for Disney Plus’ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/27/23144221/obi-wan-kenobi-review-disney-plus"><em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em></a> series. The deal was just one example of Disney and Lucasfilm’s desire to keep the <em>Star Wars </em>films and series running with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22914062/the-book-of-boba-fett-star-wars-luke-skywalker-aging-cgi">digital recreations of its original cast</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/667921/capcom-fighting-collection-2-review-xbox-switch-steam-ps4<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>At this point, there are more than enough ways to play <em>Street Fighter II</em>. But <em>Project Justice</em> and <em>Plasma Sword</em>? Well, those are something entirely different, and much harder to find. And Capcom has made the smart decision to continue to make some of its more obscure fighters the focal point of its growing library of retro collections.</p><p>While it’s called <em>Capcom Fighting Collection 2</em>, the latest release is actually the third in the series from Capcom. The first, in 2022, focused on 2D games like <em>Darkstalkers</em>, <em>Cyberbots</em>, and, yes, <em>SFII</em>. That was followed by the long-awaited collection of <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> releases. The latest collection isn’t quite as focused, but instead covers eight Capcom fighters released between 1998 and 2004, spanning arcades and consoles like the Dreamcast.</p><p>Mostly these games are divided into two categories. There are a bunch of 2D crossover releases that mash up characters from different franchises. That includes two <em>SNK vs. Capcom </em>games —<em> Millennium Fight 2000 Pro</em> and <em>Mark of the Millennium 2001</em> — along with <em>Capcom Fighting Evolution</em>, which brought together characters from <em>Street Fighter</em>, <em>Darkstalkers</em>, and <em>Red Earth</em>. If nothing else, <em>Fighting Evolution</em> is notable for being a game where Ryu can fight a dinosaur.</p><p>Rounding out this half is <em>Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper</em>, which isn’t a crossover, but <em>is</em> an excellent 2D fighter. In fact, all of these are. They’re slick and polished, filled with incredible animation and character designs, and lots of interesting mechanics based around teams and power-ups. These are games that largely came out as interest in 2D fighters seemed to be dwindling, and Capcom was throwing everything it could at keeping the genre appealing. Because of this, they’re some of the most over-the-top examples of a fighting game.</p><p>Perhaps more interesting, though, is the quartet of 3D fighters included in the collection, which were all early attempts at exploring the genre in a new dimension. They’re all pretty different because of it. <em>Power Stone</em> and its sequel were particularly ambitious, with their large, interactive levels that players could run around, collecting items and power-ups as they fought. The other two are somewhat more straightforward but with their own twists: <em>Plasma Sword: Nightmare of Bilstein</em> is built around weapons-based combat, while<em> Project Justice </em>puts you in control of various fighting teams as you punch your way through a surprisingly deep storyline about rival schools.</p><p>These games haven’t aged as well as their 2D counterparts. The controls can be a little fiddly, and the action is often slower, with floaty physics. But they still stand up, even to someone like me who never played them originally. More importantly, though, they’re finally available for a wide audience to play. Despite being a cult classic, the most recent port of <em>Power Stone</em> came out on the PlayStation Portable in 2006. This collection is long overdue for most of these games.</p><p>Aside from the games themselves, which are available in both their English and Japanese incarnations, <em>Capcom Fighting Collection 2</em> has the usual assortment of add-ons, like online support, a music player, and a collection of associated art. It’s not as robust as, say, a Digital Eclipse release like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24291537/tetris-forever-review-ps5-switch-pc-xbox"><em>Tetris Forever</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23451349/atari-50-review-xbox-playstation-switch-steam"><em>Atari 50</em></a>. But Capcom’s new collection nails the important thing: it’s eight classic games that all play great, showcase an interesting evolution of the genre, and are finally available for modern players.</p><p><sub>Capcom Fighting Collection 2<em> is available now on the Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
