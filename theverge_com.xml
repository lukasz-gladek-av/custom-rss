It’s been nearly eight years since <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, and now we know what that team has been up to, as Nintendo has officially revealed that the developers of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642699/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-preview-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></em> are the same team that made<em> Odyssey</em>.</p><p>Nintendo has a good track record of retaining and training up talent. Developers that worked on early entries in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/31/23663707/kirby-interview-gdc-2023-kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo"><em>Kirby</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24112724/super-mario-bros-wonder-interview-nintendo-switch"><em>Mario</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24115898/tears-of-the-kingdom-physics-gameplay-design-gdc-2024"><em>Zelda</em></a> franchises have stuck around to work on or lead the development of subsequent titles. The result has been relative consistency across Nintendo first-party titles, which has allowed the company to weather the last two years a bit better than its competitors. <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> was one of the top five bestselling games for the original Switch, so <em>Bananza</em> is in more than capable hands.</p><p>According to <em>The Verge</em>’s Cameron Faulkner, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is its own game with a unique identity. But <em>Odyssey</em>’s development team has added a bit of Mario’s 3D platforming DNA to Donkey Kong’s first 3D platformer since <em>Donkey Kong 64</em>. And while the mystery of <em>Bananza</em>’s developer has been solved, a new one has taken its place: will there also be a 3D <em>Mario </em>game coming soon to the Switch 2, or is it just <em>Bananza</em> for now?</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/695726/donkey-kong-bananza-developers-super-mario-odyssey]]></content:encoded>
