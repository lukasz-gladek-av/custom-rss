            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/629162/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>There are a lot of “simulator” games out there that gamify everything from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/31/23148156/euro-truck-simulator-heart-of-russia-dlc-cancelled-ukraine-invasion">driving your own big rig</a> to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mitchwallace/2024/12/21/nostalgia-sim-inkonbini-looks-like-retail-shenmue/">running your own Japanese convenience store</a>. Some of them hit, like the one about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/1/5569950/goat-simulator-review">being a goat</a> which is on its third iteration. And some of them <em>hit</em> like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21254550/powerwash-simulator-game-pc-demo-clean-house">PowerWash Simulator</a> </em>which is getting a sequel slated for release later this year.</p></div><p><em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> will feature a new campaign with new locations and jobs to expand your power washing empire. To further drive home the fact this game is wish fulfillment for aspiring home owners, <em>PWS2</em> will also add a home base you can customize with furniture and other cosmetics. But more than anything, I’m excited by the prospect of the new split-screen co-op mode.</p><p>I played <em>PowerWash Simulator</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/powerwash-simulator-is-why-i-shouldnt-be-a-homeowner-1846801530">waaay back in 2021</a> when there was just the demo. I found myself utterly delighted by how the simplistic idea of methodically cleaning grime off a surface with a destructive power tool lit up my brain. Since its release in 2022, the game has exploded in complexity and content with crossover content packs that approach <em>Fortnite</em> levels of wacky metaverse shenanigans. There’s a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/06/29/powerwash-simulator-dives-into-bikini-bottom/"><em>SpongeBob</em> pack</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/18/23561389/why-is-lara-crofts-mansion-so-damn-dirty-i-must-know">a <em>Tomb Raider</em> pack</a>, and even a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/23601203/final-fantasy-7-powerwash-simulator-dlc-corporate-environmental-disasters"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em> pack</a> that lets you valiantly attempt to clean up the perpetually dirty streets of Midgar.</p><p>The developers at FuturLab tapped into something unique, and made <em>PowerWash Simulator </em>standout amidst a veritable ocean of simulator games and it seems like <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> is primed to do the same. It launches this year on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
