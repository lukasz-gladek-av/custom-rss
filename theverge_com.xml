            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/614519/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-sets">Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering</a> </em>set is here, and there’s never been a more perfect assemblage of <em>Magic</em> cards. The set features cards taken from every mainline <em>Final Fantasy</em> title, including the two MMOs, so there’s something for every generation of <em>Final Fantasy</em> lovers. And while <em>Magic</em> has featured other video game crossovers in the past (hello, <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> and<em> Fallout</em>!), with the way this set is constructed, from card mechanics to art, you can tell this one is a developer favorite, sure to appeal to the massive chunk of people who love both games. </p><p>But what if you don’t inhabit the center circle in the Venn diagram of<em> Magic</em> and <em>Final Fantasy </em>lovers but are still interested in experiencing this set for yourself? <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> is an intimidating game, even if you’re a seasoned player like myself. There are so many ways you can play, both in person and online, that it can be overwhelming to figure out the best way to jump in. So here’s a few tips and tricks to playing the <em>Final Fantasy</em> <em>Magic</em> set. </p><p>Be warned, though: this is the best-selling set in<em> Magic</em>’s 30-plus-year history, and you will pay for the pleasure of this experience — if you can find the product to pay for it at all. </p><p><strong>How to play: physical edition</strong></p><p>Over the years, the designers at <em>Magic</em> developer Wizards of the Coast have realized it can be intimidating as hell for a new player looking to start their planeswalking journey. To help these new players along, <em>Magic</em> developers have created a line of products called Starter Kits. Each is a set of two 60-card decks featuring cards specifically designed for new players and an instruction booklet that goes over the game’s basic rules and cadence of play. Keep one deck for yourself, give one to a friend, and learn as you play together. For <em>MTG x FF</em>, the starter kit features two decks themed around <em>Final Fantasy</em>’s greatest rivalry: <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/final-fantasy-starter-kit-decklists">Sephiroth vs. Cloud</a>.</p><p>These decks are a decent introductory course to <em>Magic</em>. Cloud’s is themed around equipment cards (think the Buster Sword or the Ultima Weapon), which are essentially weapons you can attach to your creatures to pump up their damage and hit hard. Sephiroth’s deck is all about him. Kill creatures (yours and your opponent’s) to make him as big as possible. I played both decks against the set’s designers and managed to beat them both, a monumental feat for any <em>Magic</em> player. However, if you want to play them for yourself, the Starter Kit is currently sold out on Amazon, so your best bet to find one is to hit up your local card shop (known in the community as your LCS) to see if it has any in stock. Wizards’ website does feature <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/">a handy store locator</a> if you don’t know where your nearest LCS is. </p><p>There are also <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/final-fantasy-commander-decklists">four Commander decks</a> you can buy and play, with each one <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/614519/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-sets">themed around a specific title in the series</a>. Commander is the most popular format of <em>Magic</em>, but the rules are slightly different from standard play, and matches can often include more than one opponent. The <em>Final Fantasy</em> Commander decks are beginner-friendly but expensive, running anywhere from $80 to $130 when Commander decks in other sets are much cheaper.</p><p><strong>How to play: online edition</strong></p><p>If you don’t have any friends you can beg, bribe, or beat into playing <em>Magic</em> with you, there is another, far easier option: the game’s online version, <em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em>. <em>Arena</em> is the best way to experience the <em>Final Fantasy</em> set as there’s no worry about stock, it’s relatively cheaper, and there are so many different ways to play that in-person playing simply does not accommodate. Once you’ve made your account and downloaded the game, you can play through the game’s tutorial, which I recommend to get your bearings. Not only does it explain how to play, but the color challenges also give you a feel for the playstyles of <em>Magic</em>’s five different colors.</p><div><div><p id="choosing-your-slice-of-the-color-pie"><h2>Choosing your slice of the color pie</h2></p></div><p>Think of colors and color combos as characters in your favorite hero shooter. Each has different abilities and favors a specific style of play. Blue and white center on going over your opponents’ heads with flying creatures, while mono green (my favorite and the best way to play) favors big, stompy creatures that run over your opponents’ defenses. The <em>Final Fantasy</em> set makes it easy to find a color or combo that works for you.</p></div><p>If you want to get straight into the <em>Final Fantas</em>y set, you can simply skip the tutorial to unlock all of <em>Arena</em>’s many game modes and features, and it’ll still be there to try if you ever need to go back. </p><p>Once you’re ready, you have a number of options available. You can get right into the thick of things and start playing the game’s constructed modes. If you’ve never played <em>Magic</em> before, do not do this. It is expensive, costing a lot of resources your account will not have unless you buy them in the game’s cash shop, and it is hard. Making decks is difficult; even I don’t like it that much compared to playing decks preassembled for me.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>Some of my favorite cards from this set. </em></figcaption> <cite>Image: Wizards of the Coast</cite></span></p></section><p>Your best, most economical option is to play Jumpstart mode. In Jumpstart all the hard work of making a viable deck is done for you. You are presented with a number of archetypes: Bold, Mage, Chocobos, Equipment, and more. You can pick two of them based on nothing more than vibes and personal preference, and the game will automatically create a deck using those two archetypes. Then you play your deck against other Jumpstart decks and rack up the wins or the valuable experience that comes with losing.</p><p>The great thing about Jumpstart is that it’s cheap — a new account grants you enough currency to try the mode three times — and the cards you pick are yours to keep. Do it enough times and you’ll eventually have enough cards to tool around with making your own decks to try out in the game’s friendly mode, Quick Start. I’ve enjoyed all the different Jumpstart decks I’ve made, but if you really wanna have some fun, pick chocobos whenever you get the chance. They’re creatures that get stronger whenever you play a land card (think of land like the gas that powers your deck’s engine) and have incredible synergy with other card types, leading to a deck that <em>will</em> overwhelm your opponent.</p><p>Also, they’re chocobos! What could be more <em>Final Fantasy</em> than chocobos?</p><p>If you are a <em>Final Fantasy </em>fan, I cannot stress enough how much fun its <em>Magic </em>set is. And if you’re intimidated by <em>Magic</em>’s difficulty, don’t be. There are so many beginner-friendly ways to play, and there are so many beginners trying this set out for the first time, that you’ll be in good company. Plus, I’ve found the community is always happy to help newcomers. When I played at an in-person event, my first opponent had never picked up the game before. Over the course of our match I taught him everything I knew as best I could, and before the end, he beat me. Badly. I’ve never had more fun.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/690509/how-to-play-final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-set]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I wouldn’t have preordered a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a> just for myself. The price is high, there’s no new <em>Smash Bros. </em>or <em>Metroid Prime</em> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640231/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-2-enhanced-edition-beyond">yet</a>), and I’ve got a perfectly good original Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck that keep me plenty busy. At first, I could only justify the $450 because I write about gaming tech for <em>The Verge.</em></p><p>But two weeks in, I can <em>almost </em>justify the cost one additional way: the Switch 2 is turning out to be an upgrade for my whole family. </p><p>I’m not primarily talking about hand-me-downs, though yes, you could absolutely hand your original Switch down to a kid while basking in the glory of the Switch 2’s larger, faster screen. Mom and dad always get the best seats in the house, right? </p><p>But no: I’m talking about how Nintendo’s new features are helping me share the delight of gaming with my 8-year-old kid like never before.</p><p>We bought my daughter a Switch Lite last Christmas, with <em>Animal Crossing</em> and <em>Let’s Go Pikachu</em>, and that’s pretty much all she played. All other gaming monopolized the living room TV, where she and her younger sister often clash over what to watch next. </p><p>But two weeks ago, my eldest suddenly realized that we could now magically beam any of my old purchased digital games from my Switch 2 to her Switch Lite, lending them out like a library for two weeks at a time. While I played <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> for the Switch 2, she practiced her skills in my old copy of <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>; soon, I’ll play the gruesome <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> while she tries <em>Stardew Valley</em>. And in both cases, I don’t need to worry whether she’ll lose a cartridge. </p><p>Then we found GameShare, a feature that lets a Switch 2 beam its entire screen and controls to a second Switch, giving a second person their own screen and control for a selection of multiplayer games. We began playing <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> as daughter and dad, alternating between who controlled Mario and who controlled his sentient flying hat, Cappy. </p><p>Since each of us effectively had our own portable TV, she didn’t shove her head between me and the screen like she sometimes does when we’re reading bedtime books. And since neither of us was monopolizing the TV, the younger kid got to keep on watching her YouTube videos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C__Vzcq2lDc">intricately animated stop-motion Lego food factories</a>. </p><p>When it was time for me to fly across the country last week, my eldest begged me to let her keep playing <em>Mario</em> <em>Odyssey</em> while I was gone. Virtual game cards came through once again: five quick taps, and a game download magically appeared on her Switch. </p><p>She <em>did</em> have to start the game from scratch, since I couldn’t find a way to sync a save game between two different consoles with two different Nintendo accounts… but it turns out that was her plan all along. Apparently 8-year-olds enjoy repetition much more than us adults!</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m still a fan of physical media, and I especially worry that Nintendo will pull the rug out from under our digital purchases <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/26/23657431/wii-u-nintendo-3ds-eshops-shut-down">given its track record</a> of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306470/the-switch-eshop-has-a-closure-date-in-china">closing eShops</a>. I think Nintendo could do a lot more to make the Switch and Switch 2 better for parents, too. </p><p>For one, I wish the company hadn’t arbitrarily locked its webcam-enabled GameChat to the new Nintendo Switch 2, as I would have loved to play <em>Mario Kart</em> with my daughter during my business trip. The original Switch and Switch Lite might not have the horsepower for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/video/685229/nintendo-switch-2-gamechat-c-button-mario-kart">simultaneous four-player screen sharing and video chat like the Switch 2</a>, but surely they have enough for the webcams alone? It’s also awkward that there’s still no obvious way to merge the save games from the offline “kid” profile on my original Switch to my daughter’s Nintendo account.</p><p>But most of all, I fear the two-screens-for-one-game GameShare may not get the attention or adoption it deserves. It’s such a clever way of repurposing cloud gaming technology, but the initial list of GameShare-compatible games is vanishingly short and doesn’t yet include obvious wins like <em>Mario Kart World</em> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em></a>, the newest mainline entry in the series and one that’s great to play with kids. </p><p>It’s been nearly 25 years since <em>Mario Kart: Super Circuit</em> for the Game Boy Advance let you hook up four portable consoles to play limited multiplayer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kxJfaR5guE&amp;list=PL9exeo9gYxCaRwVKrU5yS6Zqrf9c15I_R&amp;index=5">even if only a single person had a copy of the game</a>. <em>Mario Kart DS</em> did the same thing 20 years ago over Wi-Fi, again offering single cartridge multiplayer, with “DS Download Play.” But it required conscious effort from game developers to create new single cart mulitplayer modes for their GBA and DS titles, and not every deserving game had one. GameShare shouldn’t have that problem: since it’s just streaming a screen and controller inputs, it should theoretically work on <em>any</em> game you’d play on a single screen today. And yet for some reason, Nintendo hasn’t turned it on for many games at once.</p><p>If Nintendo can make GameShare standard for the Switch’s many fabulous third-party couch games, like <em>Overcooked 2</em>, <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em>, and <em>Lego Star Wars</em>, while enabling its own titles, like <em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em>, <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>, <em>Donkey Kong Country</em>, and <em>Luigi’s Mansion 3</em>, it could make the Switch 2 an easier choice for parents who want to play together with their kids. </p><p>And that would play right into Nintendo’s end goal for the past seven years. As Mario and Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto laid out <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2018/180210e.pdf">in 2018</a>: “Our ultimate ambition is for a Nintendo Switch to be owned not just by every family, but by every single person.” Personally, I now have a Switch 2, a Switch, and a Switch Lite in our house. We are almost Nintendo’s dream family.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/690224/nintendo-switch-2-parenting-gameshare]]></content:encoded>
