The requirement will be in effect for all users starting in early January.</p><p>Roblox has come under significant scrutiny over child safety on the platform, with multiple states <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760162/roblox-louisiana-lawsuit-child-predators-safety">filing</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/793711/another-state-is-suing-roblox">lawsuits</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/816549/texas-roblox-lawsuit-child-safety">this year</a> against the company. The plan to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770305/roblox-esrb-age-ratings-iarc-age-estimation">require age estimation for chats</a> is just one of several safety-related announcements the company has made in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760805/roblox-sexual-content-lawsuit-age-verification">recent</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641167/roblox-parental-controls-block-friends-experiences">months</a>.</p><p>Beginning in the first week of December, Roblox will require users in some markets, including Australia, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, to go through the age estimation process to be able to chat with others. In early January, the requirement will expand to other countries where you’re able to use Roblox’s chat.</p><p>After going through the age estimation process, Roblox will assign users into groups: Under 9, 9–12, 13–15, 16–17, 18–20, and 21 plus. Users will only be able to talk to users in their same group “and similar age groups as appropriate,” Roblox VP Rajiv Bhatia said in a briefing.</p><p>In its newsroom post, Roblox gives a couple examples of how these groups work and who they let people chat with:</p><div><blockquote><p><strong>Elisa (estimated age 12): </strong>Elisa has access to chat with users aged 15 or younger in Experience chat. All users 16 or older are prevented from initiating or engaging in chat with her.</p><p><strong>Marcus (estimated age 18): </strong>Marcus has access to chat with users aged 16 or older and could add a younger sibling as a Trusted Connection, as long as they are 13 or older.</p></blockquote></div><p>The images and video used for Roblox’s age verification checks are processed by Persona, and Roblox says the images and video are deleted immediately after they are processed.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/822718/roblox-age-estimation-verification-chat-rollout]]></content:encoded>
