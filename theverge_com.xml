            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295556/video-game-developer-strike-zenimax-microsoft<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The members of ZeniMax Workers United-CWA, one of the largest video game unions in the United States, have gone on strike. The action involves workers in ZeniMax offices in Texas and Maryland, who do quality assurance work for games including<em> Fallout</em> and <em>Elder Scrolls</em>. Workers are striking over claims that ZeniMax leadership has failed to address employee issues regarding remote work and outsourcing. </p><p>“Today, we are on strike,” <a href="https://x.com/ZeniMaxWorkers/status/1856714377992278336">ZeniMax Workers United posted on X</a>. “We are not afraid to do what’s necessary to make sure that Microsoft meets us at the bargaining table over key issues like remote work options and outsourcing.”</p><div><p>ZeniMax Workers United is made up of approximately 300 quality assurance testers. When the union <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/3/23537455/microsoft-has-formally-recognized-the-zenimax-union">was formally recognized in January 2023</a>, it became parent company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/5/23495139/microsoft-union-zenimax-bethesda-cwa">Microsoft’s first union</a> and, at the time, was the largest video game union in the United States. Just a few months later in March, that title was eclipsed by the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094602/activision-blizzard-qa-workers-unionizing-microsoft">600 members of Activision Quality Assurance United</a>, another union under Microsoft’s corporate umbrella.</p></div><p>Remote work policies seem to be a major sticking point for Microsoft’s video game unions. In the immediate outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic, many video game companies instituted flexible work-from-home policies that they’ve <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24290345/return-to-office-mandates-amazon-productivity-remote-work-hybrid-decoder-podcast">recently begun rolling back</a>. In October of this year, Activision Quality Assurance United held a rally outside their offices in Texas, California, and Minnesota <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/cwa-members-activision-qa-rally-remote-work-options">to protest Microsoft’s restrictive return-to-office polic</a>y that, according to workers, failed to accommodate workers with medical issues or doctor recommendations. The Communications Workers of America (CWA), the organizing committee that supports ZeniMax Workers United along with multiple video game unions in the US, has also filed an unfair labor complaint with the National Labor Relations Board over contracting out work without notifying the union.</p><p>There have been several video game-related strikes in the US in recent year. In 2021, workers at Raven Software — a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard before its eventual acquisition by Microsoft — participated in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820549/activision-blizzard-raven-software-layoffs-walkout-call-of-duty">a walkout</a> that turned into a five-week strike after several employee contracts were not renewed. After that strike, workers at Raven Software <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/21/22894964/activision-blizzard-raven-software-employees-create-game-workers-alliance-union">organized and won one of the first video game unions at a AAA game publisher</a> in the country.</p><p>In July of this year, voice actors and motion performers covered under SAG-AFTRA’s interactive media agreement <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24206357/video-game-performer-strike-sag-aftra">went on strike</a> to protest <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24213808/video-game-voice-actor-strike-sag-aftra">worker protections regarding AI</a>. While SAG-AFTRA and the video game companies that make up the interactive media agreement bargaining committee <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24270821/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-resume-negotiations">have returned to the negotiation table</a>, the strike continues. </p><p>ZeniMax Workers United strike will not last as long as SAG-AFTRA’s or Raven Software’s, with workers striking today until 6PM ET. In a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, Microsoft spokesperson Becca Dougherty wrote, “We respect our employees’ rights to express their point of view as they have done today. We will continue to listen and&nbsp;address their concerns at the bargaining table.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sony’s flagship wireless headset is discounted to $129.99 ($20 off) at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-PULSE-Elite-Wireless-Headset%2F5113175920">Walmart</a> right now as part of its early Black Friday sale. Although the discount doesn’t appear massive, that still represents the lowest price we’ve seen so far.</p><p>The Pulse Elite launched in late 2023 alongside a slate of other mid-cycle PlayStation 5 accessories, including the $199.99 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23957860/sony-pulse-explore-playstation-earbuds-impressions">Pulse Explore earbuds</a> and the once-elusive <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24012547/sony-playstation-portal-handheld-remote-player-ps5-chiaki-review">PlayStation Portal</a> handheld companion.</p><div><p>Sony’s PlayStation Pulse Elite is an over-ear headset with a retractable boom mic. It’s designed to filter out background noise, deliver low latency and lossless audio, and work with the PlayStation Portal or the PlayStation 5, PC, and Mac via the PlayStation Link USB adapter. </p></div><p>While many third-party wireless headsets support 3D Audio (PlayStation’s take on simulated spatial audio), Pulse Elite supports what Sony considers the ideal acoustics and tuning to get the most from your games. Sony also uses planar magnetic drivers, which are usually reserved for studio-grade monitors. They’re said to offer a more accurate soundstage with less distortion compared to the dynamic neodymium drivers used in most consumer-oriented headphones and headsets.</p><p>Besides its decidedly PlayStation, almost alien design, the headset notably supports Sony’s low latency lossless wireless audio codec. That feature requires the included PlayStation Link dongle, which works with the PS5, PlayStation Portal, Windows PCs, and Macs. It also has Bluetooth, so you can use it with your mobile devices and simultaneously hear from both sources. The retractable voice-isolating boom microphone enables game chat and voice calling in either scenario. </p><p>Whether you’re already a PS5 owner or looking to take your first jump into the deep end of the PlayStation pool with the newly released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">PS5 Pro</a>, it may be worth a shot if you don’t already have a viable headset.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
