            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/26/24279276/survival-horror-silent-hill-2-fear-the-spotlight<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>More than most genres, survival horror feels rooted in time. It started with the methodical <em>Resident Evil</em> on the original PlayStation and is defined in part by limitation — a slow pace, grimy visuals, and scant resources to help amplify the scares. Many of those elements stemmed from the early, awkward days of 3D gaming, whether it was <em>Resident Evil</em>’s clunky controls, which made zombie chases more terrifying, or <em>Silent Hill</em>’s fog, which lent an iconic atmosphere while also letting the developers <a href="https://www.polygon.com/playstation/24196061/silent-hill-crash-bandicoot-tech-limitations">get around technical limitations of the time</a>.</p><p>And a few decades later, developers are still finding ways to bring the most important elements of those games — namely, the mood and scares — to modern horror without feeling dated.</p><p>The most obvious way to do this is keeping the style and tone of classic survival horror while updating the gameplay to make it more approachable. The most recent example of this is <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>, the first release from horror movie studio Blumhouse’s new gaming label. Much like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24153478/crow-country-review-steam-ps5-xbox"><em>Crow Country</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23428239/signalis-review-ps4-xbox-switch-pc"><em>Signalis</em></a>, it’s a game that looks like it was ripped right out of 1998; the visuals are blocky, the textures low-res. It gives the experience a grimy feel, which is just the right note for horror.</p><div><figcaption><em>Fear the Spotlight.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Blumhouse Games</cite></p></div><p><em>Fear the Spotlight</em> — developed by the two-person team at Cozy Game Pals — starts out simple enough, with two friends breaking into their high school to perform a seance in the library. But, of course, things go bad, and they get pulled into a nightmare realm that connects both to their own pasts and a dark mystery the school has been hiding for decades. It’s part coming-of-age story, part romance, and part true crime. But it’s all rendered in the crunchy style of PlayStation-era horror, which lends it an uneasy edge.</p><p>The game also lets you really focus on the story by streamlining the gameplay. There’s <em>a lot</em> of puzzle-solving; much like in early <em>Resident Evil</em> games, you’ll be fixing all kinds of complex mechanical problems and dealing with arcane statues and locks. But there’s almost no actual combat. Instead, you have little choice but to run and hide when the terrifying monsters appear. Some of the scariest moments of the game have you huddled under a desk, waiting for the creatures — which have deadly spotlights for faces — to pass.</p><p>In some ways, removing combat makes the game even scarier since you have no way to fight back. These moments in <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> reminded me a bit of stowing away in a locker in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/3/6897307/alien-isolation-review"><em>Alien: Isolation</em></a>, hoping the xenomorph couldn’t see me. The hazy, dirty visuals only amplify this feeling, as it’s often difficult to get a clear view of what’s ahead of you.</p><div><figcaption><em>Silent Hill 2.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Konami</cite></p></div><p>On the other side of the spectrum is the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24168204/silent-hill-2-remake-trailer-date-ps5-steam">recent remake of <em>Silent Hill 2</em></a>. Instead of creating a brand-new survival horror experience with modern sensibilities, it’s an attempt to take one of the genre’s most influential titles — a particularly idiosyncratic one at that — and reimagine it as a big-budget release in 2024. That has pros and cons. Like the remakes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/22/18192773/resident-evil-2-review-ps4-xbox-pc">classic <em>Resident</em></a><em> </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199382/resident-evil-3-remake-review-ps4-xbox-pc-2-capcom"><em>Evil</em> games</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23567481/dead-space-remake-ea-motive-ps5-xbox-pc-review">the original <em>Dead Space</em></a>, <em>Silent Hill 2</em> looks and plays like a modern release. The visuals are crisp and detailed, instead of hazy and disorienting. And it controls like a well-tuned third-person action game. It’s immensely satisfying to swing a bat, whether you’re smashing in windows or fending off a living mannequin.</p><p>There’s a shift in tone. The modern <em>Silent Hill 2</em> is still scary. The level of realism makes the squirming enemies and cramped hotel hallways feel incredibly unsettling, and there’s a level of immersion that can be panic-inducing. But now it plays and feels like a lot of other games and is, for lack of a better word, a lot cleaner than the original. It’s no longer as weird and distinct. It reminds me a bit of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16978294/shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-remaster-ps4-review">the 2018 remake of <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em></a>: a cover song that doesn’t replace the original but provides a different way of looking at it, one that’s welcoming for newcomers. (If only Konami made the original <em>Silent Hill 2</em> more accessible.)</p><p>The point is, these games show there is still plenty of room to do interesting things with survival horror. And they do it in a way that both connected to the genre’s history without being stifled by it. More importantly: they find new ways to scare.</p><p><small><em>Fear the Spotlight</em> and <em>Silent Hill 2</em> are both available now.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24279410/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-expansion-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>After a year, Finnish studio Remedy Entertainment has opened the gates to a mysterious location in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc">the 2023 third-person horror hit <em>Alan Wake 2</em></a>, known as <em>The Lake House</em>. In this short DLC, released just in time for Halloween, players step into the shoes of Kiran Estevez, the long-suffering agent of the mysterious Federal Bureau of Control we meet in the main game, who allies with <em>Alan Wake 2’s</em> protagonists, Alan Wake and Saga Anderson. Set before the events of <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, <em>The Lake House</em> sees Kiran recounting a horrifying event at the titular location to Saga, yet the plot is almost firmly removed from the main game itself.</p><p>This is both a boon and a curse, depending on what you were looking for. But as a bridge to the continuation of Remedy’s grand connected universe narrative — which also includes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20832997/control-review-creators-thriller-ps4-xbox-pc">the supernatural thriller <em>Control</em></a> — it’s ideal. Instead of waving goodbye to Alan and Saga, Remedy is extending a hand to take us on its next weird journey.</p><p>Kiran is investigating a research station, where FBC researchers, doctors Jules and Diana Marmont and their teams, are looking into the effects of Cauldron Lake. In Remedy’s lore, there is a connection between the power of creating “art” and the power of otherworldly forces to misuse such gifts.</p><p>The Marmonts are experimenting on a painter, Rudolf Lane, who some might remember from the main game. Lane’s creativity has a tendency to illustrate — and possibly create — the future, much as Alan’s writing did. (God forbid those two ever make a comic book together.)&nbsp;I won’t spoil what the Marmonts did, save to say they were monsters long before any otherworldly forces came into the frame. Regardless, the Lake House is suddenly cut off and unresponsive to FBC HQ, resulting in Kiran investigating with a small team.&nbsp;</p><div><p><cite>Image: Remedy Entertainment</cite></p></div><p>Remedy has been playing with a connected universe since <em>Control</em>, and the Lake House is a firm bridge backward and forward to that story. Of course, being an <em>Alan Wake</em> DLC, players can expect the solid third-person survival horror of the main game.&nbsp;</p><p>The Lake House, as a setting, is as unnerving as most of the spaces in A<em>lan Wake 2</em>. However, there’s more of a focus on the brutalist and office-space aesthetics from <em>Control</em>, without the outside or natural environments that dominated about half of the main game. In the eerily quiet office spaces, there are visual wonders like looping hallways and rooms of infinite typewriters, which have been programmed to “write” like Alan Wake.&nbsp;</p><p>That last quirk appears to be a clear jab by Remedy’s writers at AI slop, with a page of Alan’s real writing saying, “The art was not art. Just content for the experiment.” Indeed, the whole thesis of <em>The Lake House</em> is the misuse of art for the acquisition of some end product, rather than relishing in the beauty art can create. This is all the more obvious when you figure out who the villain is and who has created the new terrifying humanoid paint beasts that slither out of the walls. Remedy is not subtle in its disdain for the corporatization of creativity, the reconfiguration of art into a harvest field of bland capitalistic fervor. There’s no love lost and much hate gained in the <em>Lake House</em>’s story, outlining the interaction between artistic freedom and corporate control: a golden hand wrapped around imagination’s throat.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Remedy Entertainment</cite></p></div><p>To say too much about this already short game would spoil it, so I won’t go into detail about the clever set pieces that would feel right at home in <em>Control</em>. Let’s just say, light switches and motels make a welcome return, as does a familiar and powerful character.&nbsp;</p><p>Kiran, unfortunately, does not mechanically demonstrate any prowess fighting otherworldly beings, despite her years as an FBC agent. She plays no different to Saga or Alan Wake, once again using a flashlight to whittle down enemies’ shadowy armor before unloading a satisfying number of bullets into their bodies. There is also only one new enemy type: the aforementioned long-limbed painting creatures who can only be destroyed with a new weapon Kiran discovers late in the story.&nbsp;</p><p>I would’ve liked some new ability or mechanic that demonstrates her years of experience in dealing with the weird. Instead, this is relegated to her interactions with the odd object / entity, being able to quickly control her fear, and knowing how to deal with recurring “items” <em>Control</em> veterans like myself know all too well.&nbsp;</p><p>Much of the joy of the Lake House is discovering what occurred and experiencing the few floors for yourself. The DLC takes about two hours to complete. But in that short span of time, it made for not only a satisfying send-off of one of my favorite recent games but also a bridge back into the world of <em>Control</em>.</p><p>All signs seem to indicate Remedy will be taking the grand plot of this connected universe to an almost apocalyptic level. We can probably expect to see plenty of returning characters, including Kiran herself, as Remedy steers us through its creepy weird lake of stories.</p><p><small>The Lake House<em> expansion for </em>Alan Wake 2<em> is available now.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
