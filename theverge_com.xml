Not only did it pull in a record $57 billion in revenue — and roughly $4,000 of pure profit per second — it grew its data center business by $10 billion in a single quarter alone. It reported a record $51.2 billion from that data center business, a 66 percent increase over last year.</p><p>A lot of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/812455/ai-industry-earnings-bubble-fomo-hype">eyes are on Nvidia’s data center revenue</a> right now as a bellwether for the “AI bubble” as a whole. Nvidia doesn’t seem to expect its data center growth to slow down despite fears of that bubble popping — its Q4 outlook is a whopping $65 billion, which would require it to grow quarterly revenue by another $8 billion in just three more months.</p><p>Nvidia <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-third-quarter-fiscal-2026">CEO Jensen Huang says</a> the company’s selling every AI server chip it can make: “Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out.” Nvidia adds that its <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/2026/Q326/Q3FY26-CFO-Commentary.pdf">Blackwell Ultra chip is driving the bulk of that</a>: “Blackwell Ultra is now our leading architecture across all customer categories while our prior Blackwell architecture saw continued strong demand.”</p><p>Additionally, gaming revenue is up 30 percent year-over-year, a good sign for Nvidia’s Blackwell gaming chips, which got off to a bit of a rocky start with some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/672637/nvidia-rtx-5060-review-meddling-gamersnexus-wake-up-call">mixed reviews of the RTX 50-series GPUs</a> earlier this year.</p><p>During today’s investor call, Huang seemed confident when concerns about an “AI bubble” were raised, saying, “There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different.” He went on to recap many of the same claims Nvidia has been making for years about how AI will change everything, and added that AI has “reached a tipping point,” saying, “The transition to agentic and physical AI will be revolutionary.”</p><p><strong><em>Update, November 19th: </em></strong><em>Added</em><em> comments from Nvidia’s investor call.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/824111/nvidia-q3-2026-earnings-data-center-revenue]]></content:encoded>
