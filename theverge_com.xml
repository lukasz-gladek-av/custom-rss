            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Ziff Davis-owned IGN Entertainment has laid off staff, including eight members of the IGN Creators Guild. Those cuts represent 12 percent of the bargaining unit. The layoffs are the latest shift in the turbulent gaming media landscape. Earlier this year, <em>Verge</em> parent company Vox Media <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659575/polygon-vox-media-sold-valnet-gamerant">sold <em>Polygon</em></a> to <em>GameRant</em> owner Valnet, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664747/giant-bomb-independent-gaming-site-employee-owned"><em>Giant Bomb</em> went independent</a>, and <em>Game Informer</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/635915/game-informer-return-gunzilla-games">returned</a> after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24212016/game-informer-shutting-down-layoffs-gamestop">being shut down by GameStop</a>. Last week, Ziff Davis also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/715220/ziff-davis-creators-guild-cnet-layoffs">laid off staff at CNET</a>.</p><p>Laid off IGN staffers include <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lawoftd.bsky.social/post/3lvm53wqnck27">former senior features editor Matt Kim</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oswinstark.bsky.social/post/3lvm4tif6ms2f">video editor Chelsea Miller</a>, but no single department was primarily targeted by the cuts, Rebekah Valentine, IGN senior reporter and co-chair of the guild, tells <em>The Verge</em>. “It was largely single individuals from different departments.”</p><p>“The company has told us that the reason for this layoff stems from a Ziff Davis-mandate to cut costs despite several quarters in a row of year-over-year revenue increases, to which IGN Entertainment responded by coming for our members’ jobs,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ignunion.bsky.social/post/3lvm4rhup5k2a">the guild says</a>. “This is perplexing to us, as we are told again and again that IGN Entertainment has had a tremendously successful year thus far thanks to their hard work.”</p><p>An employee in the engineering department was also laid off, Hunter Paniagua, a representative of the Pacific Media Workers Guild, which represents the IGN Creators Guild, tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Ziff Davis didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Last year, across all of Ziff Davis, the company employed approximately 3,800 people, <a href="https://s205.q4cdn.com/689425761/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/5ea843d6-d06a-41b1-bac0-4bb45df94888.pdf">according to an SEC filing</a>.</p><p>Last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/21/24161718/ign-gamer-network-acquisition">IGN acquired</a> the website portfolio of Gamer Network, which includes publications like <em>Eurogamer,</em> <em>Gamesindustry.biz</em>, and <em>Rock Paper Shotgun</em>. Terms of that deal weren’t disclosed at the time.</p><p>“The company has not responded to the union’s questions about whether its budget for future acquisitions is being reconsidered as a cost-saving measure alongside these other apparently necessary personnel cuts,” the IGN Creators Guild says.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/718692/ign-entertainment-layoffs-creators-guild-ziff-davis]]></content:encoded>

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve founder Gabe Newell is setting out on a new adventure — and it doesn’t involve <em>Half-Life 3</em>. Instead, Newell is acquiring Oceanco, the yacht-building company that’s creating his <a href="https://luxurylaunches.com/transport/gabe-newell-upcoming-superyacht-09012025.php">$400 million super ship</a>, as reported <a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/boat-pro/news/oceanco-yacht-builder-sold-to-gabe-newell">earlier by <em>Boat International</em></a>.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.oceancoyacht.com/new-chapter-gabe-newell/">a post about the change</a>, Oceanco says Newell’s interest in the brand comes from a “lifelong fascination with the sea” and “a deep respect for the people who live and work on it.” Oceanco is based in the Netherlands, and it has changed leadership a few times since its founding in 1987, with private investor Mohammed Al Barwani <a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/yacht-market-intelligence/brokerage-sales-news/superyacht-builder-oceanco-under-new-ownership--4673">helming the company</a> for the past 15 years before Newell came along.</p><p>Along with Newell’s 364-foot-long superyacht, Oceanco developed Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ <a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/news/jeff-bezos-koru-yacht-best-pics">$500 million sailing yacht, Koru</a>, which stretches 417 feet long. It’s also behind <a href="https://www.superyachtfan.com/yacht/kaos/">the Kaos sailing superyacht</a> owned by Walmart heir Nancy Walton Laurie, as well as <a href="https://www.superyachtfan.com/yacht/bravo-eugenia/">the Bravo Eugenia</a>, owned by Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.</p><p>Newell has a growing fleet of yachts as well, including the <a href="https://luxurylaunches.com/transport/gabe-newell-tranquility-superyacht-to-be-upgraded.php">Oceanco-built Draak</a> (formerly called the Tranquility) and <a href="https://luxurylaunches.com/transport/gabe-newell-rocinante-superyacht-10092024.php">the Rocinante superyacht</a>, built by German yacht-maker Lürssen.</p><p>As for what Newell plans to do now that he’s the head of a big superyacht builder, Oceanco puts it pretty simply: “His first decision? Leave the team alone. Seriously. Oceanco has vision and integrity, and a culture that actually works. Gabe doesn’t want to fix it, he wants to fuel it.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/718639/gabe-newell-valve-superyacht-oceanco]]></content:encoded>
