The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646977/bungie-marathon-release-date-september-alpha-test-details">slick-looking shooter</a> from the makers of <em>Halo </em>and <em>Destiny</em> was originally set to release in September, but will now <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon-releases-march-5-2026-new-trailer-and-more">launch on March 5th</a>. Bungie will launch <em>Marathon </em>on Xbox Series S / X, PS5, and PC, priced at $39.99.</p><p>Bungie initially <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688479/bungie-marathon-delay-sony">delayed <em>Marathon</em> in June</a> last year following plenty of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688479/bungie-marathon-delay-sony">alpha test feedback</a>. The studio recently held playtests that included new features like proximity chat and an option to solo queue into games.</p><p><em>Marathon </em>is set in a sci-fi universe in 2850, where players take on the role of a Runner to scavenge what’s left behind. As a Runner, you fight in a crew of up to three players across a variety of zones and points of interest. <em>Marathon</em> is a PvPvE environment, so players will be fighting creatures on planets as well as other players. If you die during a run, you’ll drop your gear. But if you survive, your loot moves with you to future runs so you get more powerful gear and level up.</p><p>Bungie’s delay to Marathon means it is now launching months after <em>ARC Raiders</em>, an extraction shooter from the makers of <em>The Finals</em> that has consistently been in the top five most-played games on Steam since its launch in late October. Bungie had originally planned to launch <em>Marathon </em>ahead of <em>ARC Raiders</em>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/864146/bungie-marathon-release-date-march-5th-price]]></content:encoded>
