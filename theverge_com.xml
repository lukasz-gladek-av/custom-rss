            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/682491/final-fantasy-16-xbox-stealthdrop-final-fantasy-7-remake<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>You can play the latest entry in the <em>Final Fantasy </em>series, <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/08/final-fantasy-16-xbox-games-showcase/">on Xbox right now</a>. Shadow dropped during today’s Xbox Games Showcase, players will be able to experience <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/23/23180709/final-fantasy-16-eikons-naoki-yoshida-interview"><em>FFXVI</em>’s slick-ass kaiju monster battles</a>, incredible voice acting, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23767669/final-fantasy-xvi-review-ps5">ho-hum story</a> (because, hey, you can’t expect Square Enix to be perfect at everything). In addition to the base game, players will also get access to <em>FFXVI</em>’s two story DLCs <em>The Rising Tide</em> and <em>Echoes of the Fallen</em> which adds more story and a new Eikon (the game’s version of summons) Leviathan.</p><p>But that’s not all as the partnership between Xbox and Square Enix continues apace. Last year, Xbox brought the critically acclaimed MMORPG <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> to the system. Later it was rumored, due to Square Enix’s stated desire to expand their games beyond the PlayStation ecosystem, that it would bring the <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> remake project to Xbox as well. That rumor has been proven true. The absurdly titled <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em>, which is the first entry in the <em>FF7</em> reimagination project combined with the Yuffie-centric DLC, is coming to Xbox this winter.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
