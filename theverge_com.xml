            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/662200/elden-ring-movie-nexus-point-news-be-careful<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>On Tuesday, a publication called <em>Nexus Point News</em> published a headline for what looked to be a major piece of entertainment news: “EXCLUSIVE: Alex Garland Set To Direct ‘Elden Ring’ Film For A24.” The article claimed that <em>Elden Ring</em> “is expected to be Garland’s next film” and that shooting is expected to start in 2026.</p><p>But don’t get your hopes up: soon after the article was published, <em>Nexus Point News</em> pulled it, and the publication won’t say why. How this article made the rounds is an interesting case study in the way news travels on the internet.</p><p>We first saw the <em>Nexus Point News</em> article from a Wario64 post on X. Generally, Wario64 is a great account to follow to see breaking news in video games almost as soon as it happens. And the account is quite popular, with more than 1 million followers on X. But none of us at <em>The Verge</em> had ever heard of <em>Nexus Point News</em>, let alone recognized it as a place that reliably breaks entertainment news, so something didn’t seem right.</p><p>(Another recent <em>Nexus Point News</em> “exclusive” includes a potential cast member “being eyed” <a href="https://www.nexuspointnews.com/post/exclusive-dacre-montgomery-is-being-eyed-to-join-star-wars-starfighter">for one of the male leads</a> of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/651695/star-wars-starfighter-date-ryan-gosling"><em>Star Wars: Starfighter</em></a>, but the article includes an update that says “a LucasFilm spokesperson has denied this reporting.”)</p><p>So I messaged Wario64, asking why he reposted it. He said that the person who posted a thread on the gaming forum ResetEra claimed the site was reliable and that “I guess I’m sharing cause I too think it’s absurd lol.”</p><p>That thread appears to be <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/alex-garland-set-to-direct-%E2%80%98elden-ring%E2%80%99-film-for-a24.1182474/">this one</a>, where the poster says, in a reply to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/alex-garland-set-to-direct-%E2%80%98elden-ring%E2%80%99-film-for-a24.1182474/#post-139592964">somebody asking</a> “bro what the fuck is this source lmaooo,” <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/alex-garland-set-to-direct-%E2%80%98elden-ring%E2%80%99-film-for-a24.1182474/#post-139593192">that</a> “Nexus point news is pretty reliable, they are breaking more and more news before the traditional trades.”</p><p>Soon after, I refreshed the <em>Nexus Point News</em> story and saw that it had been taken down. I told Wario64 that we were looking into the story on our end and about its removal. Soon after, Wario64 posted <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1919831651968024694">about the removal</a> and deleted the original tweet.</p><p>Then, I emailed <em>Nexus Point News’</em> press line to see if somebody could say what was going on. Demet Koc, the publication’s editor-in-chief, replied two minutes later but declined to comment.</p><p>A24’s Sophia Shin also declined to comment on the record.</p><p>The possibility of an <em>Elden Ring </em>adaptation seems likely. FromSoftware said in early 2022 that it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/16/22981060/fromsoftware-elden-ring-franchise-intellectual-properties-future-expansion">hoped to</a> expand the franchise “beyond the realm of games.” George R.R. Martin, who provided <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22643950/elden-ring-preview-fromsoftware-george-rr-martin">the “mythos”</a> for the world of <em>Elden Ring</em>, hinted <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/1/24189979/george-r-r-martin-on-a-potential-elden-ring-adaptation">last year</a> that some kind of adaptation might be in the works. And FromSoftware is about to release <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a>, a multiplayer-focused spinoff, so announcing a film around now would make some sense. But for the moment, there’s nothing official about an <em>Elden Ring</em> movie.</p><p>A ResetEra admin locked the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/alex-garland-set-to-direct-%E2%80%98elden-ring%E2%80%99-film-for-a24.1182474/page-2#post-139593882">thread</a> about the article and another one. “For a site no one’s heard of, they sure have a lot of exclusives,” <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexus-point-news-alex-garland-set-to-direct-%E2%80%98elden-ring%E2%80%99-film-for-a24.1182531/#post-139593768">the admin said</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/662128/minecraft-vr-mixed-reality-support-bedrock-update-1-21-80<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Minecraft’s</em> official support for virtual reality and mixed reality devices is over. Mojang announced last year that Minecraft would stop supporting VR headsets after March 2025, and per today’s <em>Minecraft: Bedrock Edition</em> 1.21.80 Update <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-bedrock-edition-1-21-80">patch notes</a>, that support has been removed, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2773555/minecraft-officially-kills-support-for-vr.html">as reported by <em>PCWorld</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>When Mojang announced the end of support for VR <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278397/minecraft-virtual-reality-support-end-2025">in October</a>, it said that you’ll still get updates on your PC, you’ll still be able to play without a VR / MR device, and that you’ll be able to continue building worlds or use any Marketplace purchases. At the time, Mojang’s reasoning for removing support <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-21-40-bedrock-changelog">was that</a> “our ability to support VR / MR devices has come to an end.”</p><p>However, there are still ways to play <em>Minecraft</em> on a VR headset, if you’d like. If you have the Java version of the game for PC, you can use a mod like <a href="https://www.vivecraft.org/">Vivecraft</a>, which works on many VR platforms, or <a href="https://questcraft.org/">QuestCraft</a>, a port specific to Meta Quest headsets.</p><p>Still, I’m a little sad to see official VR support ending for <em>Minecraft</em>, especially if you, like me, can remember the incredibly impressive <em>Minecraft</em> demo for HoloLens from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/21/7868363/minecraft-hololens-microsoft-freecell">way back in the day</a>. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
