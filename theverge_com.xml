            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Valve won’t talk <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818313/valve-has-no-news-about-a-steam-deck-2">about a Steam Deck 2</a>. It probably wants to keep the attention on its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">just-announced living room console</a>, comfy new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">controller</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">Arm-based headset</a> instead. But now that the company is preparing to sell an Arm headset, one that can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818672/valve-android-apps-steam-frame">even run Android apps</a>, there’s an obvious question. Is Arm a one-off experiment for Valve, or might it power future SteamOS hardware?</p></div><p>Valve software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais makes it sound like the sky’s the limit. I don’t want to oversell what he said — he was excited about the <em>potential</em>, not any specific devices, and you’ll see that in more context when we publish the interview later this week.</p><p>But when I ask whether he thinks there’ll be other SteamOS devices with Arm chips, he says the answer is yes, and that he’s excited about it.</p><p>“I think that it paves the way for a bunch of different, maybe ultraportables, maybe more powerful laptops being Arm-based,” he begins. “Handhelds, there’s a lot of potential for Arm, of course, and one might see desktop chips as well at some point in the Arm world.” I immediately think about how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678000/nvidia-arm-gaming-laptop-mediatek-alienware">Nvidia reportedly has an Arm-powered gaming laptop coming</a>, and how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/785068/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-x2-elite-and-extreme-for-windows-pcs#:~:text=Razer%E2%80%99s%20Min%2DLiang%20Tan">Razer showed up</a> at Qualcomm’s last coming-out party for laptop chips.</p><p>“We’ll keep greasing the wheels, so to speak, so that SteamOS can work on a wider variety of Arm devices, but also so that the catalog becomes more reliable there in terms of compatibility and performance,” says Griffais.</p><div><div><p id="got-any-burning-questions-about-valves-new-hardware"><h2>Got any burning questions about Valve’s new hardware?</h2></p></div><div><blockquote><p>We’re holding a subscriber-exclusive AMA today, November 12th, at 3PM ET.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve has just announced the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">Steam Frame</a>, its new VR headset that can play games streamed directly from your PC using a dedicated streaming stick <em>and</em> run Windows games locally thanks to an Arm chip in the headset itself. At the same time, Valve is also moving on from its previous VR headset, the Valve Index, which it’s “no longer manufacturing,” designer Lawrence Yang tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>The Index, a high-end headset that had to be tethered to your PC to work and used external “lighthouse” base stations for tracking, was released in 2019. In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19102584/valve-index-steamvr-headset-review-shipping-today">her review</a>, my colleague Adi Robertson praised its visuals and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/28/18639084/valve-index-steamvr-headset-knuckles-controllers-preview">its controllers</a>, though dinged it for its $999 cost.</p><p>But corded headsets have also fallen out of favor since then. Meta has sold <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/28/23619730/meta-vr-oculus-ar-glasses-smartwatch-plans">tens of millions</a> of its standalone Quest VR headsets that can play games without a PC connection and track your position without extra base stations. Even more expensive headsets like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/807963/apple-vision-pro-m5-review-specs-release-date">Apple Vision Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/802299/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-price-release-date">Samsung’s Galaxy XR</a> have taken the standalone approach.</p><p>The Frame isn’t exactly a sequel to the Index. But it does improve upon the older headset with some of its specs; the Index’s LCD screens have 1440 x 1600 per-eye resolution, while the Frame offers 2160 x 2160 per eye, for example. If you like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/28/18639084/valve-index-steamvr-headset-knuckles-controllers-preview">Index’s “Knuckles” controllers</a> and how you can strap them right onto your hand, you’ll be able to buy optional straps for the Frame’s controllers so you can do the same thing.</p><p>And Valve is extremely confident in the Frame’s 6GHz wireless streaming adapter as a replacement for a physical cord. In our brief demos at Valve HQ, the streaming worked extremely well.</p><p>This may be the end for Valve’s lighthouse base stations, which were actually first released in 2016 with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/5/11358618/htc-vive-vr-review">the HTC Vive</a>. If you’ve got lighthouse base stations set up in your home already, don’t expect to use them with the Frame anytime soon, if ever.</p><p>“With Steam Frame, we’re not working on lighthouse support for it,” Yang says. Instead of sweeping a room with lasers like the lighthouses, the Frame currently uses four monochrome cameras and IR illuminators to determine its position in 3D space, though it also has a modular accessory port that could support additional cameras.</p><div><div><p id="got-any-burning-questions-about-valves-new-hardware"><h2>Got any burning questions about Valve’s new hardware?</h2></p></div><div><blockquote><p>We’re holding a subscriber-exclusive AMA today, November 12th, at 3PM ET.

(He also says Valve currently has no plans to offer the TMR joysticks as a drop-in module for the original Deck.)</p><div><div><p id="got-any-burning-questions-about-valves-new-hardware"><h2>Got any burning questions about Valve’s new hardware?</h2></p></div><div><blockquote><p>We’re holding a subscriber-exclusive AMA today, November 12th, at 3PM ET.

Since 2022, Griffais <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499215/valve-steam-deck-interview-late-2022">has consistently</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884863/valve-steam-deck-2-refresh-upgrade-cpu-2025">told us</a> that Valve wants to see a significant leap in performance and efficiency before it takes the plunge. “We really do want to wait for a generational leap in compute without sacrificing battery life before we ship the real second generation of Steam Deck,” is how Valve’s Lawrence Yang concisely <a href="https://www.reviews.org/au/games/valve-steam-deck-australia-interview/">reiterated it to <em>Reviews.org</em></a> in 2024.</p><p>The question now is: Will Valve find that leap in performance and efficiency from x86? Because while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview#:~:text=But%20Coomer%20did%20light%20up">Valve initially thought</a> its standalone VR headset might run on the existing Steam Deck’s chip, the company just announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">the Steam Frame</a> with an Arm processor instead — using emulation to let it play some Windows games locally on the headset. Griffais tells me he thinks Arm has “a lot of potential” in future handhelds someday.</p><p>Valve tells us the Frame has a lower performance target than the nearly four-year-old Steam Deck, so it would need a far more potent Arm chip to power such a handheld. Qualcomm, in particular, has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631005/qualcomm-snapdragon-g3-gen-3-onexsugar-handheld-ayaneo-pocket">working on Arm chips for handhelds</a>, though, and one of its customers for the latest was even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/711116/onexsugar-sugar-1-hands-on-preview-transforming-dual-screen#:~:text=%E2%80%9Cvery%20interesting%E2%80%9D%20to%20discuss%20a%20potential%20SteamOS%20handheld.">interested in discussing a possible SteamOS handheld</a> with Valve.</p><p>It’s also possible Valve already found its next Steam Deck chip in AMD’s future roadmaps — like it did with the original Steam Deck — and is simply waiting for it to arrive.</p><div><p>None of that necessarily means you should expect <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818313/valve-has-no-news-about-a-steam-deck-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an Arm-based Steam Deck 2 just yet</a>, though.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/818313/valve-has-no-news-about-a-steam-deck-2]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-steam-frame-is-a-surprising-new-twist-on-vr.1351609/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve is about to launch a new virtual reality headset, and with it, a comprehensive new approach to what a VR device should be. Most VR headsets I’ve tried have ended up collecting dust after the novelty wore off, and I thought I had sworn off VR for good. But after trying Valve’s new headset for myself at the company’s headquarters, I was nearly ready to put down my credit card before I walked out the door.</p><p>The new headset is called the Steam Frame, and it’s trying to do several things at once. It’s a standalone VR headset with a smartphone-caliber Arm chip inside that lets you play flat-screen Windows games locally off the onboard storage or a microSD card. But the Frame’s arguably bigger trick is that it can <em>stream</em> games directly to the headset, bypassing your unreliable home Wi-Fi by using a short-range, high-bandwidth wireless dongle that plugs into your gaming PC. And its new controllers are packed with all the buttons and inputs you need for both flat-screen games <em>and</em> VR games.</p><p>The pitch: Either locally or over streaming, you can play every game in your Steam library on this lightweight headset, no cord required. I think Valve may be on to something.</p><p>As I explored an industrial level in <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>, jumping from floor to floor and blasting headcrabs, I couldn’t tell at all that the game was being streamed to me from a nearby PC. I felt like I was playing it through a hardwired connection or natively on the headset itself.</p><p>The dongle, which comes in the box with the headset, streams your games over 6GHz spectrum — that’s its only job. It means that the experience has “low latency, high bandwidth, and lots of robustness,” Valve hardware engineer Jeremy Selan tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>When you’re streaming, to make what you’re looking at appear sharp and with low latency, the Frame uses a technique Valve calls “foveated streaming.”</p><p>You might be familiar with foveated <em>rendering</em>, which, in VR, enhances what’s directly in front of your eyes and lowers the resolution in your peripheral vision to optimize the performance of a headset. With foveated <em>streaming</em>, the Frame instead uses its two eye-tracking cameras to make it easier to sling compressed images from your PC. “Anywhere the user is looking, we spend as many bits as possible to give them a very high-fidelity, super-high-quality representation of where they’re looking, and we’ve borrowed those bits from everywhere else in the image,” Selan says.</p><p>It’s “always on and always active,” so game developers don’t have to do anything to make it work. The headset checks the position of your eyes more than 80 times a second.</p><p>At one point, Valve staffers entered a special command that placed a square in front of wherever my eyes were focused. While it was on, I couldn’t tell that the bits around the square were lower-fidelity, and as I whipped my eyes all over the virtual room, the square kept up without any discernible lag.</p><p>It was extremely impressive, and it means that, depending on your PC, the Frame could let you play high-end VR games on a light headset. The Frame weighs 440 grams with the headset and battery strap, roughly half as much as the approximately 809-gram Valve Index, which, unlike the Frame, also needed to be physically wired to a PC. Valve’s headset is also lighter than the 560-gram PSVR 2 and the 515-gram Meta Quest 3.</p><p>It’s nice to wear right out of the box, too, with an especially plush and silky face cushion and well-balanced counterweight thanks to the battery being placed on the back of the head strap. The strap also contains speakers — two per side, Valve says, spaced apart so they can cancel out their own vibrations before they affect the headset’s positioning sensors.</p><p>The comfort might come at the cost of performance, though. While it might seem like a Steam Deck for your face, the Frame won’t hit Steam Deck-levels of performance and battery when you’re playing on its own lightweight Arm system.</p><p>The Frame runs SteamOS on a last-generation phone chip, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and it has to recompile Windows x86 game code on the fly using an emulator, named Fex, to let titles run on Arm. (Valve is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/818672/valve-android-apps-steam-frame">welcoming Android games into Steam</a> so you can play on the Frame, too — and you’ll be able to sideload APKs as well, the company <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWUxObt1efQ">confirmed to <em>Gamers Nexus</em></a>.) And at 21.6 watt-hours, the Frame’s battery is about half the capacity of an original Steam Deck, though you can plug any sufficiently powerful USB-C battery (45W) into the headset to extend its life. Valve is working to make streaming battery life “as efficient as possible,” Selan says, though playing six hours of <em>Hades II</em> over streaming would be “unlikely.”</p><p>In one demo, I played the standard x86 version of <em>Hades II</em> installed on the Frame on a big, 2D virtual theater screen, and I noticed a couple small gameplay stutters I never see on my Steam Deck or my Nintendo Switch 2. In a later demo of <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, I noticed more stutters right away — and to my surprise, a Valve employee brought them up proactively, calling them “hitches.”</p><p>According to Valve hardware engineer Gabe Rowe, the company plans to let you download preconverted versions of the code when you start up a game to help get rid of those hitches, similar to how the Steam Deck downloads precompiled shaders for many games before you even launch them.</p><p>Right now, the performance in those games felt a little worrying, and I didn’t get to try anything that might tax the headset even further. However, Selan told us after our visit that the choppiness we saw was actually a bug and that Valve expects performance and stability to improve leading up to and after launch.</p><p>Valve is also planning a Steam Frame Verified program, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22947274/steam-deck-verified-playable-compatibility-games-feature">the Steam Deck Verified program</a> that adds green checkmark on the Steam store pages of games that play well on the Steam Deck with no modifications, so you can know which games run well locally.</p><p>But playing games locally isn’t the main point of the device — it’s mostly designed for streaming.</p><p>“Steam Frame is a wireless streaming headset, first and foremost,” designer Lawrence Yang tells <em>The Verge</em>. “That is what we’ve optimized a lot of things and a lot of decisions around, not only for hardware, but also in terms of software.”</p><p>Assuming Valve gets the issues worked out, the Frame could be a decent place to locally play lower-end games. Most of the time, it seems like you’re going to want to stream your games from a PC to the headset instead.</p><p>Regardless of how you boot up your games on the Frame, its two new included controllers should give you everything you need to actually play them. Between the controllers, you have access to two drift-resistant TMR joysticks, a D-pad, four face buttons, two bumpers, and two shoulder triggers, all of which should serve you well for flat-screen games. For more immersive VR games, the controllers also have two triggers on the grips and enough sensors to enable five-finger capacitive sensing. The controllers run off of AA batteries, and Valve says they can get up to 40 hours of battery life. (The headset supports Valve’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">new Steam Controller</a>, too.)</p><p>Valve isn’t sharing a price for the Frame yet. The company plans to reveal that in early 2026, and it’s only telling us that it’s targeting a price that’s less than an Index — Valve’s previous headset, which cost $999. But there are other hints that Valve’s new headset won’t be as expensive as competitors.</p><p>While the Frame does have pancake lenses with an up-to-110-degree field of view and LCD screens with a 2160 x 2160 per eye resolution, that’s no longer class-leading. The Frame offers monochrome passthrough, but Apple’s and Samsung’s expensive headsets have more impressive micro-OLED displays and <em>color</em> passthrough, which can help with more immersive mixed reality experiences. Even the $299.99 Meta Quest 3S has color passthrough and outward IR illuminators so it can track in dark rooms.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>A Steam Frame prototype with a clear case. Valve isn’t selling this version, unfortunately.</em></figcaption> <cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The Frame’s four outward-facing monochrome cameras and IR illuminator seem to provide excellent tracking, though in a brief demo, the black-and-white passthrough view wasn’t useful for much except getting a general idea of my surroundings. Rowe says sticking with monochrome passthrough was an intentional choice because color passthrough would have added to the Frame’s price. “The core focus of the device is the gaming,” Rowe says.</p><p>For those who want color passthrough and other changes to the headset, Valve has made its headset modular, including a dedicated expansion port in the nose piece designed to support extra cameras. The expansion port offers 2.5Gbps of bandwidth via MIPI and one lane of PCIe data.</p><div><div><p id="got-any-burning-questions-about-valves-new-hardware"><h2>Got any burning questions about Valve’s new hardware?</h2></p></div><div><blockquote><p>We’re holding a subscriber-exclusive AMA today, November 12th, at 3PM ET. Drop your questions <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818113/valve-steam-frame-machine-controller-vr-headset-pc-ask-us-anything-ama">here</a> and we’ll do our best to answer them.</p></blockquote></div></div><p>The entire core compute module is modular as well. While Valve has nothing to announce right now, Selan suggests that people might want to have things like a hot-swappable battery, a battery in a different location, or different styles of audio, and says it’s “very easy to imagine” that with the Frame’s modular design, “we would be able to accommodate those different needs in the future.”</p><p>Valve plans to share specs and external CAD files so that people can make accessories for the port and alternate head straps. There will also be a partner program for companies that want to sell official accessories.</p><p>But right now, that modularity is just a footnote about the Frame. This device, at least from what we’ve seen, is much more a flexible vehicle to play your existing library of Steam games.</p><p>I said at the top of this piece that I was <em>nearly</em> ready to put down my credit card for the Steam Frame. I’m still not sure if I’d prefer kicking back at home with <em>Hades II</em> on the Frame’s screen instead of on my Steam Deck or on a TV. But the Frame seems like a winning combination of ingredients that just make it a nice place to play Steam games — <em>and</em> it won’t require a physical tether. That might be enough to make it my first VR headset that doesn’t just gather dust.</p><p><em><strong>Update, November 12th</strong>: Added confirmation from </em>Gamers Nexus<em> that you’ll be able to sideload Android APKs.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on]]></content:encoded>
