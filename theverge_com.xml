OhSnap, the company behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262221/this-40-magnetic-phone-grip-does-what-popsockets-cant-and-its-on-sale">the excellent magnetic PopSocket alternatives I showed you in October</a>, is now officially turning his design into the coolest looking gamepad attachment I’ve ever seen for a phone: </p></div><p>It’s no taller or wider than an iPhone, so it should slide into a pocket. It’s got a MagSafe pattern of magnets to attach it to your magnetic ring device. You don’t have to remove it to use your phone like a phone, because the whole gamepad retracts underneath<em>,</em> a little like the slide-out keyboard phones (or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452167/sony-xperia-play-2-playstation-phone-prototype-concept-leaked-images">PlayStation Phones</a>) of old — and now, it’s mounted on a spring-loaded arm that pops out at the push of a button and also slightly angles your device towards your face.</p><div><figcaption><em>The OhSnap Mcon’s hinge in action.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Video by Josh King / OhSnap</cite></p></div><p>OhSnap even found room for a pair of Nintendo Switch-esque analog sticks, with drift-resistant Hall effect sensors, and pair of fold-out grips so you can (theoretically) hold it more like a full-size gamepad. The sticks are clickable buttons, and it’s got a full set of shoulder buttons and triggers as well.</p><div><figcaption><em>An illustration with the grips unfolded.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: OhSnap</cite></p></div><p>Two months ago, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">Retro Game Corps</a> came away <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3969hkkFSE">impressed with a prototype</a>, and it seems King has been <em>very</em> busy since then. As he explains <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIgugX2gODE">on YouTube</a>, he initially tried to start his own company around the gamepad, even attracted a few investors, manufactured some boards and was working toward injection molding, before he started running out of money and reached out to OhSnap about a partnership.  </p><p>Speaking of money, we don’t have any idea how much it’ll cost, particularly at retail — OhSnap is planning to launch a Kickstarter on January 2nd to raise funds. <a href="https://ohsnap.com/pages/mcon-signup-page">It’s taking signups here for now</a>.</p><p>I should be getting my own hands on a prototype next month at CES 2025 in Las Vegas, and I’ll let you know how it feels. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
