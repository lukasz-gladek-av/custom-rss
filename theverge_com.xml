Limit one per person.</p><p>“Invites will begin rolling out next week,” writes Nvidia.

The statement follows a <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/02/this-cartridge-is-a-tiny-time-bomb-limited-run-accused-of-selling-carts-which-can-damage-your-nes"><em>Time Extension</em> report</a> about the games.</p><p>In a statement <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:zfac4c44fukmi4vawiprnjbt/post/3liimbs5vmc2j?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.timeextension.com%252Fnews%252F2025%252F02%252Fthis-cartridge-is-a-tiny-time-bomb-limited-run-accused-of-selling-carts-which-can-damage-your-nes">emailed to customers</a>, Limited Run says those two games weren’t manufactured by its “regular” manufacturing partner. “Due to an issue with voltage regulation, there is a small chance that prolonged use of these titles could result in damage to either the cartridge or the console hardware,” Limited Run says.</p><p>The company is stopping further shipments of the games to customers so that it can re-manufacture them itself “via our trusted manufacturing partner,” according to the statement. Anyone who has already received the games will be sent “a newly manufactured version of their title automatically,” Limited Run says. The company does not recommend using the older version of the games.</p><p>Customers can ask for a refund if they want by contacting customer service. The two games currently aren’t for sale.</p><p>Limited Run says the manufacturer that produced <em>Rugrats</em> and <em>Piopow</em> “has only worked on a very small handful” of Limited Run titles, and the company is “going through our back catalogue of NES titles manufactured by this supplier and testing for possible issues.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286964/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4">originally launched on the PS4 in 2020</a> and has already received an update for those playing on the PS5. It’s not like Ellie, Joel, and Abby need much of an update for modern audiences. But while the slightly enhanced graphics — which include native 4K support and improved frame rates — are nice, they’re not really the reason to play <em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em>. Instead, it’s all of the <em>other</em> stuff that turns this into an excellent special edition of the game.</p><p>Some of the additions are relatively small. There’s a guitar mode where you can, well, play guitar as much as you want. Using the PlayStation controller’s touchpad to swipe guitar strings was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21318499/the-last-of-us-part-2-guitar-learn-how-to-play">one of the highlights of the original release</a>, and it’s nice to be able to mess around with it freely. I’m sure we’ll see some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6_TtIqnOsY">very cool videos</a> of people rocking out soon. You can also unlock outfits to wear while playing the main game, which is silly but fun. I’m 10 hours deep into a New Game Plus run, and Ellie has been wearing a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima"><em>Death Stranding</em></a> T-shirt the entire time (even though that game couldn’t exist in <em>TLOU</em>’s timeline).</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035730/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-review-ps5">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjE2MDE2" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/616016/the-last-of-us-season-2-date-hbo">The Last of Us season 2 finally has a premiere date</a></h2></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTM4NzM=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/26/24255066/the-last-of-us-tlou-season-two-teaser-trailer">The Last of Us’ new season 2 trailer puts Joel and Ellie through the wringer</a></h2><div><p>Warner Bros.

In <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/06/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-count-season-4-roadmap-1235945923/">an interview with <em>Deadline</em></a>, co-creator Craig Mazin explained that the story of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035730/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-review-ps5"><em>The Last of Us Part II</em></a> will take at least two, and possibly three, seasons to fully cover. And as a result, the show’s second season will be a few episodes shorter than the first.</p><p>“The story material that we got from <em>Part II</em> of the game is way more than the story material that was in the first game, so part of what we had to do from the start was figure out how to tell that story across seasons,” Mazin explained. “When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the natural breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes.” (Season 1 clocked in at nine episodes, for comparison.)</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/5/24172396/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-count-hbo">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Mr. Wright goes to (the) Washington (Liberation Front).</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>A first look at The Last of Us season 2.</p><p>We may have to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/6/23991040/the-last-of-us-season-two-hbo-max-house-of-dragon-euphoria-streaming">wait until next year</a> to return to the post-apocalyptic show, but HBO has released these images to hold us over.
