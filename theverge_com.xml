            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Samsung is breaking new ground <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-unveils-new-odyssey-gaming-monitor-lineup-world-first-6k-3d-ultra-high-resolution-displays/">with its 2026 lineup of gaming monitors</a>, with the Odyssey 3D G90XH becoming the first to feature a 6K display with “glasses-free 3D.” The new monitor comes with a 32-inch IPS panel, offering real-time eye-tracking that “adjusts depth and perspective” based on your position, along with a speedy 165Hz refresh rate that you can boost to 330Hz with a Dual Mode feature that switches to 3K.</p><p>The 2026 Odyssey 3D is an upgrade to the display <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/635554/samsung-odyssey-3d-monitor-pricing-preorder">Samsung revealed during CES last year</a>, which comes with a smaller 27-inch display and a lower 4K resolution. We’ve seen a few other 6K monitors from <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/finally-asus-6k-rival-to-pro-display-xdr-will-debut-within-weeks-and-will-cost-a-fraction-of-its-apple-rival">Asus</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/3/23537262/dell-6k-monitor-apple-4k-webcam-ces">Dell</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/788916/lg-ultrafine-32u990a-32-inch-6k-monitor-thunderbolt-5-preorder">LG</a>, though they don’t come with the Odyssey’s 3D effects or a focus on gaming. For now, select games like <em>Stellar Blade</em>, <em>Lies of P:</em> <em>Overture</em>, and <em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em> are optimized specifically for the Odyssey 3D, but <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xp8lx6slrzb813?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US">several other titles</a> still support its 3D effects, including <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, <em>Palworld</em>, and <em>Silent Hill 2</em>.</p><p>A 6K 3D display isn’t the only notable upgrade coming to Samsung’s lineup; the company is launching the Odyssey G6 G60H, which it says is the “world’s first” 1,040Hz gaming monitor. The 27-inch monitor only supports this ultra-fast refresh rate in HD, while its native 1440p resolution still offers speeds up to a very fast 600Hz. It’s also compatible with AMD FreeSync Premium and NVIDIA G-Sync.</p><p>Samsung has also revealed three new Odyssey G8 monitors, with the 32-inch G80HS offering a 6K resolution with refresh rates up to 165Hz (or 330Hz refresh rate at 3K), as well as a 27-inch 5K G80HF model with speeds up to 180Hz (or 360Hz at 1440p). There’s an Odyssey G8 with a 4K OLED display, too, featuring an up to 240Hz refresh rate, 300-nit brightness, and True Black 500 certification for deeper blacks. All three models support AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and NVIDIA G-Sync.</p><p>Samsung hasn’t yet revealed the pricing or release date of any of these models, but the Odyssey 3D is bound to be a bit pricey, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/635554/samsung-odyssey-3d-monitor-pricing-preorder">given the $2,000 price tag attached</a> to Samsung’s 4K 3D screen.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/849850/samsung-odyssey-gaming-monitors-6k-3d-ces-2026]]></content:encoded>
