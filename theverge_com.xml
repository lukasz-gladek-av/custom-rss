He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Prepare your best clown makeup: Team Cherry, the developers of <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, will be making a “special announcement” about the game on Thursday at 10:30AM ET. The announcement will be shown on Team Cherry’s YouTube channel, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGeJwsUP9c">premiere link is already live</a>.</p><div><p>It’s been a very long wait for solid <em>Silksong</em> news, so much so that the waiting <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hollow-knight-silksong-fans-in-clown-makeup">spawned a clown meme</a>. A <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/12/22175400/hollow-knight-silksong-sequel-xbox-game-pass-trailer">release window announcement</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/9/23717855/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed">subsequent delay</a> didn’t help things. But Nintendo shared proof-of-life for <em>Silksong</em> earlier this year when it snuck <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610766/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-trailer">a vague “2025” release date</a> into its big Switch 2 Direct presentation.</p></div><div><p>And as of late, there have been a lot of hints that some big <em>Silksong</em> news is imminent: the game will be shown at both <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/756538/silksong-will-also-at-nintendos-gamescom-booth">Nintendo</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/714490/xbox-gamescom-silksong-playable-demo-xbox-ally-handheld">Xbox’s</a> Gamescom booths this week, and on Monday, Gamescom Opening Night Live host Geoff Keighley tweeted a picture of himself <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1957492830374650018">wearing a clown nose</a>. However, the game’s release date won’t be announced during <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/761027/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-geoff-keighley-how-to-watch">Tuesday’s Opening Night Live show</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwr4xi2x5c2g">according to <em>Bloomberg’s</em> Jason Schreier</a>.</p></div><p>I’m unrealistically hoping that <em>Silksong</em> releases on Thursday. I’m on vacation next week, which would give me a perfect excuse to dive into the game. But if the release date is a little bit after, no biggie — maybe I’ll get lost in the original <em>Hollow Knight</em> one more time.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/761451/hollow-knight-silksong-special-announcement-youtube]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span id="follow-author-standard_article_details-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></p> <p><span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Razer has announced that one of its most popular PC gaming peripherals from a Pokémon collaboration that was <a href="https://gamerant.com/razer-gengar-headset-catch-limited-release-china/">exclusive to China</a> will soon be available in the US. The Gengar Edition of the Razer Kraken Kitty V2 headphones, which trade cute cat ears for the Pokémon’s purple spikes, are <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fcollabs%2Fpokemon-gengar" rel="sponsored">now available through the company’s online store</a> for $139.99 in regions including the US, Canada, Australia, and Europe.</p><p>The functionality of the Gengar Edition is identical to the standard Kraken Kitty V2 headphones, which feature a Razer HyperClear cardioid mic on a boom that minimizes background noises, 40mm drivers, and virtual 7.1 surround sound capabilities. You don’t have to worry about battery life because while the Kraken Kitty V2 is available in a Bluetooth version, the Gengar Edition is wired only.</p><p>Razer already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/709193/razer-pokemon-pc-gaming-accessories-keyboard-mouse-headset">expanded its Pokémon collaboration to the US last month</a>, but with a limited lineup of reskinned PC gaming peripherals featuring Bulbasaur, Charmander, Pikachu, and Squirtle that felt somewhat lacking and uninspired. The Gengar Edition headphones feel like Razer is swinging harder for the fences and includes fun accents like an illustration of the Ghost / Poison type Pokémon on the earcup liners and a silhouette of the character on the outside that gets illuminated by Razer’s Chroma RGB lighting.</p><div><p>There are <a href="https://www.pocketmonsters.net/forum/thread/12421">other Gengar accessories from Razer</a>, including a mousepad and keyboard, but they remain exclusive to China.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/761044/razer-pokemon-kraken-kitty-v2-wired-headphones-gengar-edition-us-availability]]></content:encoded>
