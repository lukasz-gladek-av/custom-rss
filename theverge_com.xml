            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Hideo Kojima first announced he was teaming up with Xbox for a new game in 2022, before a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23993035/hideo-kojima-od-xbox">teaser revealed</a> the <em>OD </em>name and some cast last year. We’re now getting a better look at exactly what <em>OD </em>is, in a new three-minute teaser trailer that holds true to Kojima’s promise that the game will be unique and immersive.</p><p>The trailer begins with Sophia Lillis’ character opening a red door, and then lighting candles — some of which look like <em>Death Stranding</em> babies. With rain pouring down outside and mysterious knocking sounds, it’s clear <em>OD</em> will very much lean into horror for its gameplay as Lillis’ character shakes in fear.</p><p>The trailer also shows off some of the early Unreal Engine work that Kojima Productions is undertaking for <em>OD</em>, alongside Microsoft’s assistance. Xbox chief Phil Spencer confirmed on stage at Kojima Productions’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8uF8VQVT7I">10th Anniversary livestream</a> that development of the game is “well underway,” and that Microsoft is helping with the visuals and technical work.</p><p>“<em>OD </em>is bold, it’s unique, and it’s unmistakably from this studio,“ says Spencer. ”We’re deeply supporting the production, it’s our technical work on Unreal that we’re doing with the team, both with the flashy [elements] you see on the screen, but also a lot of the behind the scenes work.”</p><p><em>OD</em> is billed as something of a cross between a game and a movie, with a promise of exploring concepts that test “your fear threshold.” Unreal Engine will drive the experience of <em>OD</em>, instead of the Sony-owned Decima engine that powers both <em>Death Stranding</em> titles. Kojima had high praise for Unreal Engine at the 10th anniversary event, saying “the technology is one step higher than <em>Death Stranding 2</em>.”</p><p>While we know Jordan Peele is somehow involved in <em>OD</em>, Kojima did note today that the filmmaker is working on another part of the overall <em>OD</em> experience. That might be why the game is subtitled <em>OD Knock</em>, to differentiate it from whatever Peele is working on.</p><p>We still don’t know exactly when <em>OD </em>will arrive, despite promises that development is well underway. “Kojima is innovating in gameplay, story, and player engagement,” says Spencer. “We’re collaborating closely, and we’re very excited for what’s next.”</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/783409/od-kojima-xbox-game-trailer#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/783409/od-kojima-xbox-game-trailer]]></content:encoded>

Deepen your relationships with the island residents and Pals through daily conversation and gift-giving, and you may discover unexpected, special stories unfolding.” You’ll also have to defend your farm from “some nasty Pals that come to wreak havoc.” <em>Palfarm</em> will support multiplayer so you can play with your friends, too.</p><p>Pocketpair hasn’t provided a release date or saying what platforms the game will come to yet. But <em>Palfarm</em> continues Pocketpair’s efforts to branch out from the main <em>Palworld</em> game, which include <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640147/palworld-pubg-dating-sims">a <em>Palworld</em> dating simulator</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350273/pocketpair-palworld-indie-publishing-label-surgent-studios">an indie publishing label</a>.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782945/palworld-palfarm-farming-spinoff#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/782945/palworld-palfarm-farming-spinoff]]></content:encoded>
