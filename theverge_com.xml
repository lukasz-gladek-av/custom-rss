Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>GOG is splitting from CD Projekt, the game company that launched the preservation-focused PC gaming marketplace in 2008. In <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fblog%2Fgog-is-getting-acquired-by-its-original-co-founder-what-it-means-for-you%2F" rel="sponsored">an update on Monday</a>, GOG announced that its co-founder, Michał Kiciński, <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cd-projekt-co-founder-michal-kicinski-acquires-gog-from-cd-projekt/">has acquired</a> the digital storefront and its online gaming platform <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/6/5785858/gog-galaxy-takes-on-steam-with-drm-free-games-and-optional-community">GOG Galaxy</a> from CD Projekt — which he also co-founded — for $25.2 million.</p><p>The acquisition isn’t changing anything about GOG’s mission to keep games DRM-free, according to the announcement that says it’s “more central to GOG than ever:”</p><div><blockquote><p>GOG has always been built on strong values and clear principles. When Marcin Iwiński and Michał Kiciński first came up with the idea for GOG in 2007, the vision was simple: bring classic games back to players, and make sure that once you buy a game, it truly belongs to you, forever. In a market increasingly defined by mandatory clients and closed ecosystems, that philosophy feels more relevant than ever.</p><p>This new chapter is about doubling down on that vision. We want to do more to preserve the classics of the past, celebrate standout games of today, and help shape the classics of tomorrow, including new games with real retro spirit.</p></blockquote></div><p>It also won’t change GOG’s relationship with its former parent company, CD Projekt, which will keep selling existing games, like <em>The Witcher</em> series and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, along with upcoming titles, on the marketplace:</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/850832/gog-cd-projekt-acquisition-steam]]></content:encoded>

Like the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/3/24191794/gb-operator-game-boy-camera-webcam-epilogue-nintendo">GB Operator</a> that debuted in early 2021, the SN Operator is a standalone USB cartridge slot that lets you play and archive old Nintendo console games on PCs, Macs, or handhelds like the Steam Deck using their original carts. But where the GB Operator was built for Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and GBA games, the SN Operator instead supports any Super Nintendo and Super Famicom game.</p><p>Preorders for the SN Operator will open at 12PM ET on December 30th for $59.99. That’s $10 more expensive than the smaller <a href="https://www.epilogue.co/product/gb-operator">GB Operator</a>, which will remain available too. The hardware is expected to ship in April 2026.</p><p>The cartridge slot connects to computers or handhelds over USB and works alongside Epilogue’s accompanying <a href="https://www.epilogue.co/downloads">Playback</a> app. The app features a built-in SNES emulator for playing your original cartridges, but you can use other emulators if you already have one you prefer. Games that relied on accessories like Nintendo’s Super NES Mouse or the Super Scope are also compatible with Playback and will use your computer mouse instead of those peripherals.</p><p>On top of new console support, the SN Operator includes another function that should appeal to retro gaming fans with large collections of aging and degrading cartridges. The Playback app can authenticate cartridges so you know for sure if that rare title you found at a flea market is real or a bootleg. It can also create digital copies of your cartridges including their save game data so you can archive your collection and keep on playing where you originally left off, even if your original cartridges stop working. The SN Operator will work with any cartridge that can be played in Nintendo’s original hardware, including bootlegs you accidentally purchased. But Epilogue does specify you should only back up cartridges you own — so no using this to borrow and copy a giant collection from a friend.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/850793/epilogue-sn-operator-super-nintendo-snes-cartridge-slot-backup-emulator]]></content:encoded>
