Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A survival horror classic is getting a new life on PC — and it might be the first of many. PC games shop GOG announced the release of <em>Dino Crisis</em> and its sequel, which are both available starting today. Alongside the launch, the service also announced a new tool called “dreamlist,” with the goal of letting players vote on which old games that want to see hit the service next.</p><p>For the uninitiated, <em>Dino Crisis</em> is essentially <em>Resident Evil</em> with dinosaurs. That’s not an insult: the first game was directed by original <em>Resident Evil </em>director Shinji Mikami, so the two series have a lot in common. <em>Dino Crisis</em> features the same methodical, survival horror gameplay but with faster (and occasionally much bigger) enemies to contend with. GOG says the new port supports Windows 10 / 11 and includes updates like support for “~4K resolution” and modern gamepads. The two games can be purchased individually on GOG or as a bundle.</p><p>As for the dreamlist, GOG describes it as an enhanced version of its existing wishlist feature:</p><div><blockquote><p>It’s a place where your memories meet action. You tell us what matters, and we work to make it happen. Each vote is a spark that inspires publishers to act. With the brand new design, it’s easier than ever to champion your favorites and make sure your voice is heard — because we believe that together we can keep the classics alive.</p></blockquote></div><p>It’s a notable development given how inaccessible most classic games are; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/14/23792586/classic-game-preservation-video-game-history-foundation-esa">a 2023 report from the Video Game History Foundation</a> claimed that 87 percent of games released before 2010 are “critically endangered.” Today’s news follows <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295683/gog-preservation-program-pc-game-drm">the launch of GOG’s preservation program last year</a>, which aims to keep classic games playable and accessible, even if they’re no longer maintained by their original developer or publisher.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
