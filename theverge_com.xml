As stated in the email, which you can see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Arcade1Up/comments/1pjy92j/megathread_arcade1up_is_shutting_down/">on Reddit</a>:</p><div><blockquote><p>Arcade1Up is closing operations. For the majority of us, our last day is this coming Friday.</p><p>I cannot speak to the future of the brand, it is not my place to share what might be next and whom will be in charge of it.</p><p>I do not know the plans for the arcade systems or the Infinity Tables. I believe they will continue to operate as they currently do, but I do not know for certain.</p></blockquote></div><p>At the time, I tried contacting Arcade1Up for comment, but didn’t hear back.</p><p>On Tuesday, however, Arcade1Up and Basic Fun posted <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/arcade1up_activity-7406801866891632640-erfc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAIV1iYBHi7OPybalzIKilWBO4bTY5vJb8c">their statement</a> about the deal:</p><div><blockquote><p>We want to address a few questions we’ve seen circulating about the Arcade1Up product lines.</p><p>Basic Fun! has acquired select assets of Arcade1Up and intends to support, to the best of our ability, the home arcade category and existing Arcade1Up products currently in the market.</p><p>This asset acquisition reflects our ongoing commitment to expanding our presence in the home arcade space, supporting current Arcade1up titles and products alongside our own existing arcade offerings.</p><p>We’ll have more to share in the new year and look forward to continuing to serve the arcade fan community. Game on!</p></blockquote></div><p>Arcade1Up and Basic Fun didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment asking for additional clarification about the deal and planned support for Arcade1Up products.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/846034/arcade1up-basic-fun-dead-home-arcade]]></content:encoded>
