            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/630176/ashly-burch-sony-ai-horizon-aloy-tech-demo-sag-aftra-strike<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Ashly Burch, the award-winning voice and performance actor behind <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>’s Aloy — one of the most prominent characters on PlayStation today — has some news and some very strong thoughts about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626695/sony-playstation-ai-characters-aloy-horizon-forbidden-west-prototype">the leaked Sony experiment that saw her character voiced and performed by AI technology</a> instead of her or any other human being.</p></div><p>The video, originally shared with <em>The Verge</em> by a tipster and later pulled off YouTube by a copyright enforcement company that counts Sony PlayStation as a client, was of an internal prototype — not necessarily something that’s in production for actual games. Burch says <em>Horizon</em> developer Guerilla proactively confirmed to her that it is <em>not</em> actively in development. Nor did it use her voice or facial data, Guerilla claimed. </p><p>But Burch says having seen the demo, she is worried, and not just about her own career. “I feel worried about this art form,” she says. You can watch her video immediately below, or scroll down for a transcript. </p><p>The transcript:</p><div><blockquote><p>Hi. Let’s talk about AI Aloy. I saw the tech demo earlier this week. Guerilla reached out to me to let me know that the demo didn’t reflect anything that was actively in development. They didn’t use any of my performance for the demo, so none of my facial or voice data. And Guerilla owns Aloy as a character.</p><p>So all that said, I feel worried. And not worried about Guerilla specifically or <em>Horizon</em> or my performance or my career specifically, even. I feel worried about this art form. Game performance as an art form.</p><p>We are currently on strike. SAG-AFTRA is on strike against video games because of AI. Because this technology exists, because we know that game companies want to use it, we’re asking for protections.</p><p>So currently what we’re fighting for is that you have to get our consent before you make an AI version of us in any form. You have to compensate us fairly and you have to tell us how you’re using this AI double.</p><p>And I feel worried not because the technology exists. Not even because game companies want to use it. Because of course they do. They always want to use technological advancements.</p><p>I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone’s performance attached to it. That does have someone’s voice or face or movement. And the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse.</p><p>They wouldn’t have any protections. Any way to fight back. And that possibility… it makes me so sad. It hurts my heart. It scares me.</p><p>I love this industry and this art form so much and I want there to be a new generation of actors. I want there to be so many more incredible game performances.</p><p>I want to be able to continue, to do this job, and if we don’t win, then that future is really compromised.</p></blockquote></div><p>In a slightly longer TikTok version of the video, which we’ve embedded above to replace the original Instagram copy, Burch adds that “I’m genuinely not trying to put any game company specifically on blast, certainly not Guerilla. The technology isn’t the problem. Game companies wanting to use the technology is not the problem. The problem is we’re currently on strike, and the bargaining group will not agree to give us common sense protections.”</p><p>It’s unusual for performers who have such a close relationship with game companies to speak out like this, but we’re also in an unusual moment: as she points out, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24213808/video-game-voice-actor-strike-sag-aftra">video game actors are on strike right now, specifically because of AI</a><em>, </em>and the very idea that a company like Sony is explicitly building and demonstrating ways to potentially replace actors like Burch is exactly what the striking workers fear.</p><p>In addition to starring in <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, Burch has had minor roles in other Sony games including <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> and <em>Spider-Man</em>, but is otherwise best known for playing Chloe Price in the <em>Life Is Strange</em> games, Tiny Tina in <em>Borderlands</em>, and from the live-action D&amp;D roleplaying series <em>Critical Role</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21177373/ashly-burch-interview-mythic-quest">Apple TV Plus’s <em>Mythic Quest</em></a>, where she also serves as a writer.</p><p><em><strong>Update, March 14th:</strong></em> <em>Swapped Instagram video for Burch’s longer uncut TikTok video and added its additional context.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/629949/star-wars-hunters-offline-october<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>So soon after <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24211078/spectre-divide-preview-mountaintop-fps-game">Specter Divide</a></em>, a multiplayer shooter developed by Mountaintop Studios, announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628698/spectre-divide-mountaintop-studios-shutting-down">its pending shut down</a> which will take its studio with it, is yet another live-service game going offline. Today, <em>Star Wars: Hunters</em> developer Zynga announced <a href="https://starwarshunters.com/news/sunset-on-vespaara/">the game will be sunset on October 1st</a>.</p><p><em>Hunters</em> is a class-based arena shooter featuring original characters (or at least they <em>seem</em> original, who knows with folks named Babu Frik running around) from throughout the <em>Star Wars</em> universe. It had a soft launch in select countries in 2021, but didn’t get a global launch on mobile and the Nintendo Switch until June 2024. This means that the game officially lived a scant 16 months before it inevitably goes offline. That short time though is downright luxurious considering <em>Specter Divide</em> lasted roughly six months before it will shut down sometime in the next 30 days.</p><p>The developers do have some parting gifts for players before the galaxy winks out on <em>Star Wars: Hunters</em>, though. The current season will be extended an additional three weeks and the game will still release a new hero April 15th. Then the developers will keep the ranked leaderboards running until the game shuts down in October.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
