The free-to-play mobile game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/28/24308337/so-long-campers">shut down on November 28th</a> after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/22/16691618/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-review-iphone-android-nintendo">launching seven years ago</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/22/24225944/nintendo-animal-crossing-pocket-camp-mobile-ending-date">Nintendo had plans to launch a new version</a> that would allow players to transfer their campgrounds to a new app that cuts out the microtransactions but requires a one-time paid fee. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24281659/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-complete-mobile-launch-date-introductory-price">Originally slated to launch on December 3rd</a>, the paid app — called <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete</em> — is available now on both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-c/id6547834967">iOS</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.nintendo.zasa">Android</a>, for a launch price of $9.99.</p></div><p>The new version is largely the same as the original, and will still feature seasonal events and all of the other content from the base game. The biggest changes are the welcome removal of microtransactions and the ability to play offline. But the paid app also introduces a number of gameplay additions, including a new location where you can hang out with K.K. Slider, and the option to import custom designs from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch">the Switch game <em>New Horizons</em></a> into <em>Pocket Camp Complete</em>. Here’s how it works:</p><p>While you can start up a fresh game if you haven’t played before, <em>Complete</em> seems largely designed so that existing players won’t lose all of their campground progress for good, making it an interesting solution for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/1/23330632/free-to-play-gacha-games-closures-dragalia-lost-kingdom-hearts">an ongoing problem with mobile and live service games</a>. Unfortunately, at launch the game seems to be having issues with save transfers, which Nintendo has acknowledged. “The issue may be occurring due to a high number of users attempting to use this service,” <a href="https://x.com/Pocket_Camp/status/1863524631493382480">the company says</a>. If you’re having issues, you can check out the support page <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/15997/kw/nintendo%20account#s3q4">right here</a>. Players have until June 2nd, 2025 to transfer saves.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
