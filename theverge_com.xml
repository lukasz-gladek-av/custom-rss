Previously, the Xbox could only support up to 16TB of space on a single USB-connected drive.</p><p>With the new update, Xbox systems can now partition hard disks larger than 16TB into segments to use the full physical storage space. A single 24TB hard disk can now be formatted into multiple partitions (the largest still being 16TB) so you can archive more games, apps, and media than ever — if that’s something you’ve wanted to do.</p><p>However, if you have already been using a hard disk greater than 16TB with Xbox, the company says you’ll need to erase it first to take full advantage:</p><div><blockquote><p>Drives greater than 16TB that have already been formatted will be unaffected by this change and would need to be reformatted to take advantage of the updated support for larger drives.</p></blockquote></div><p>Although you still can’t play current generation games directly off an external drive, it can be useful to back up all of your installs anyway, or games made for older systems. You won’t need to redownload entire titles such as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283801/comcast-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-large-downloads">the 300GB-plus <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></a> using an internet connection when you feel like playing it again after a hiatus, unless they need an equally-sizable update.</p><p>Xbox is also releasing an update that enables new network quality indicators for cloud gaming sessions to tell you if your connection is slow and affecting your gameplay. They will appear in red bubbles on the upper right side of the screen, telling you what is happening, such as packet loss or increased ping, which can help you troubleshoot your connection.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349728/gdc-state-of-the-industry-survey-2025-results<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One in 10 game developers lost their job in 2024. That’s according to the results of the annual <a href="https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-2025-state-game-industry-devs-weigh-layoffs-ai-and-more">Game Developers Conference state of the video game survey</a>. The survey sampled over 3,000 developers and covered a number of topics including industry layoffs and what kind of games developers are working on.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/8/24065868/a-dark-shadow-falls-across-the-gaming-industry">Prolific layoffs</a> have <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24177290/video-game-industry-layoffs-studio-closures-record">ravaged the industry</a> over the last two years making the question of their impact on developers one of the most important in the survey. In addition to 10 percent of developers losing their jobs, 41 percent of respondents said they had been impacted by layoffs in some way, either by being laid off directly or seeing coworkers or colleagues in other departments let go. The survey also noted that the number of people impacted is potentially much higher because of the students and graduates who reported having a difficult time simply getting a job in the industry at all.</p><p>When asked what reason companies gave for layoffs, 22 percent said restructuring while 18 said declining revenue. 19 percent gave no reason at all. Developers, though, have their own ideas about why layoffs keep happening. In an analysis of responses to what developers think the reason behind layoffs is, the majority were general statements about the industry’s over-expansion during the pandemic. Companies acquired workers and studios in hopes of meeting a level of demand for games that dried up as covid restrictions loosened. However, some developers believe the reason for layoffs is much simpler. Companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283812/microsoft-q1-2025-earnings-revenue-profits-windows-xbox-gaming-surface">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215155/sony-sees-strong-gaming-growth-despite-weaker-ps5-sales">Sony</a> still reported growing revenues despite multiple rounds of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/31/24210476/bungie-to-layoff-220-employees-new-project">layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24151047/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-microsoft">studio</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">closures</a>. It’s no surprise then that 13 percent of respondents attributed layoffs to corporate greed.</p><p>In addition to layoffs, the last few years have also seen the failure of a number of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234909/sony-concord-ps5-shutdown-poor-sales-launch-pc">high-profile, big-budget, live-service games</a>. While there has been some success in that area with new games like <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, it’s generally tough to launch a live-service game that can compete with the overbearing likes of <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Roblox</em>, and <em>Call of Duty</em>. 2024 was also the year that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348727/balatro-5-million-copies-the-game-awards"><em>Balatro</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24162572/animal-well-platforming-difficulty-bigmode"><em>Animal Well</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year"><em>Astro Bot</em></a> dominated headlines and award lists suggesting a greater appetite for those kinds of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23589879/hi-fi-rush-making-of-interview-xbox">smaller-scoped, single-player experiences. </a>It’s interesting, and perhaps concerning then, that according to the survey, over 30 percent of AAA developers are working on a live-service game.</p><p>When it asked developers their thoughts on live-service games the survey answered, “One of the biggest issues mentioned was market oversaturation, with many developers noting how tough it is to break through and build a sustainable player base.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
