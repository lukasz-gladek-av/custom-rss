Now, the software giant is getting close to testing the free streaming option with Xbox Insiders.</p><p>Over the weekend, Microsoft updated its Xbox app with loading screens for Xbox Cloud Gaming that mention “1 hour of ad-supported playtime per session.” That lines up with Microsoft’s internal testing, which has been limited to one-hour sessions, with up to five hours free per month.</p><p>Sources told me in October that internal testing includes around two minutes of preroll ads before a game is available to stream for free through Xbox Cloud Gaming. The free ad-supported version of Xbox Cloud Gaming will include the ability to stream some games you own, as well as trying out eligible <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/tag/free-play-days/">Free Play Days</a> titles over a weekend. You’ll also be able to stream <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/672037/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-activision-retro-classics">Xbox Retro Classics</a> games with preroll ads.</p><p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/806606/microsoft-officially-confirms-its-testing-a-free-ad-supported-version-of-xbox-cloud-gaming">officially confirmed</a> it was testing the ad-supported service just weeks after my report, and I’m now expecting it to be officially announced and in public testing in the coming weeks.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/864261/xbox-cloud-gaming-free-ads-testing]]></content:encoded>
