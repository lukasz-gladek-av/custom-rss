            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/635435/discord-ui-refresh-dark-mode-new-overlay<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Discord is finally updating the themes on its desktop app to include a full dark mode that’s ideal for OLED monitors. The new Onyx dark mode is part of a number of UI <a href="https://discord.com/blog/player-release-q12025">updates to the Discord desktop app</a> that make it closely match the mobile version of the app, alongside a much-improved overlay.</p><p>The Onyx dark mode is also joined by a Dark theme in the Discord desktop app, so there are now four options in total for free users. Discord has made the channel list resizable, improvements to overall spacing throughout the app, and there’s a new bar in the call interface that makes it easier to see if you have your microphone enabled and if your camera is on or off.</p><p>Discord has also tweaked the colors and illustrations throughout its desktop app as part of this refresh. “All of these updates are meant to enhance legibility, reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed by visual noise, and maintain consistency across desktop and mobile devices,” says Peter Sellis, senior vice president of product at Discord.</p><p>While the UI improvements are immediately obvious, Discord has also added a new game overlay to its desktop app that no longer hits your frame rates. “Previously, the Overlay worked best by ’“hooking’” itself directly into your game’s window, sacrificing game performance in the process,“ explains Sellis. ”This new version of the Overlay delivers a snappier, faster experience, focused around what you care about most.“</p><p>Discord has implemented individual widgets in its overlay, much like Microsoft’s Xbox Game Bar or the separate sections of Steam’s overlay. You can now watch Discord streams directly inside this overlay, so they can float above the game you’re playing. All of these new widgets can also be placed wherever you want them on a screen, and this updated overlay should also work with a lot more games and not be picked up by anti-cheat engines.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
