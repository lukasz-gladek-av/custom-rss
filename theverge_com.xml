The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/27/15958176/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus-gameplay-preview-nazi-punching"><em>Wolfenstein</em></a> studio released a nearly 15-minute-long video, which seems to give a very good idea of what to expect in the full release. That includes plenty of cryptic puzzle solving inside of ancient ruins, and lots of using a whip in both combat and traversal.</p><p>While the exploration is obviously at the heart of the game, the new video makes it look like there will be quite a bit of variety to the combat as well. The hand-to-hand brawling looks a bit like a boxing game, but you can combine it with the whip to pull enemies towards you like Scorpion in <em>Mortal Kombat</em>. And there are plenty of other fun details, like an excellent adventure journal and an old-school camera that can take photos and provide puzzle hints. If nothing else, it should fill that <em>Tomb Raider</em> or <em>Uncharted</em> shaped hole in your gaming time.</p><div><p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle </em>is arguably Xbox’s biggest release of the year, following other notable first-party games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24161514/hellblade-2-review-xbox-pc"><em>Hellblade II</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24262053/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-review"><em>Starfield</em>’s <em>Shattered Space</em> expansion</a>, and the upcoming<em> </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248947/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-cloud-release-date"><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em></a><em>. </em>While it’s coming to Xbox and PC this year (it’ll be on Game Pass day one), <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224284/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date"><em>the Great Circle</em> will also be launching on the PS5 in the spring of 2025</a>.</p></div></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24293395/mattel-wicked-doll-porn-website-url-misprint-error"><h2>Mattel accidentally linked a porn site on Wicked doll packaging</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/8/24291530/dji-neo-vertical-video-faster-tracking"><h2>DJI just added the two most requested features to its $199 Neo drone</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/10/24291418/stardew-valley-mario-luigi-brothership-heretic-installer"><h2>Chill games for a chill weekend</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289937/nyt-tech-workers-strike-games-wordle"><h2>NYT tech workers are making their own games while on strike</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24291281/mobvoi-home-walking-pad-review-treadmills-fitness"><h2>I got a desk treadmill to relieve stress — instead, it stressed me out</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
