The new chips improve on the 9800X3D, which is widely considered as the best gaming CPU. The new ones feature 16 Zen 5 cores and second-generation 3D V-Cache technology that could help those looking to do more productivity work, such as photo editing or CAD.</p><p>The higher end Ryzen 9 9950X3D costs $699 and features 16 cores and 32 threads. Its base clock speed is 4.3 GHz, with up to 5.7 GHz on boost. The chip also features 144MB cache and a TDP of 170W. </p><p><a href="https://x.com/JackMHuynh/status/1898025088349241589">In a post on X</a>, AMD’s SVP &amp; GM of Computing &amp; Graphics Jack Huynh claimed that the new chip will be “the world’s best” for both gaming and content creation. The chip could also be used for workstation-level systems, which adds competitive heat on Intel’s Core Ultra 9 285K. However, AMD’s new entry version 9900X3D offering costs $599 compared to Intel’s at $589.</p><p>AMD’s Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D will be available to order starting on March 12th. The chips come just a week after the company launched its next generation, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/624423/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review-benchmarks-price">highly competitive GPUs</a>: the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/625931/nintendo-switch-2-fcc-nfc-wi-fi-6-usb<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">is already official</a>, but there’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24344718/nintendo-switch-2-specs-date-price-launch-games-mario-kart">a <em>lot</em> we still don’t know</a> — like, will Nintendo’s new handheld support the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/24/15041136/nintendo-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-amiibo-collectibles">NFC-equipped Amiibo figurines</a> that can wirelessly unlock content in games?</p></div><p>Today, it seems likely they will, because filings at the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) reveal the console will support NFC. They even specify that the RFID feature will be located in the right Joy-Con, just like it was in the original Switch.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is apparently designated the BEE-001, the company’s radio equipment test filings reveal, where “BEE” is Nintendo’s designator for the Switch 2 family of products, with “001” the main console, “014” the right Joy-Con, and “012” the left one.</p><p>Nintendo’s followed this pattern for decades; “DMG” was the original Game Boy, “DOL” was the GameCube, “RVL” was the Wii, and “HAC” was the original Nintendo Switch, as just a few examples.</p><p>You’ll also be able to charge the Nintendo Switch 2 from either its bottom USB-C port or its new top USB-C port, the filings reveal. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">Nintendo’s announcement tease</a> confirmed the Switch would have an extra USB-C port up top, but I think this is the first real confirmation of charging from both.</p><p>If you were hoping for faster Wi-Fi in your Switch 2, that’s pretty likely as well: the filings show it will support Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) networks with up to 80MHz of bandwidth, up from Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) on the original Switch. However, it doesn’t seem to have Wi-Fi 7 or Wi-Fi 6E, and it’s only crossed the FCC with tests for 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks, not the faster / shorter-range 6GHz band.</p><p>Just in case you have any doubts this might be some other <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/23/24251736/nintendo-mmwave-device-24ghz-fcc-filing">mystery Nintendo product</a> instead of a Switch, diagrams at the FCC show it being tested with and without attached controllers and with and without a dock:</p><p>It’s unclear from these tests whether the Nintendo Switch 2 has faster charging speed or more power when docked.</p><p>The original Switch shipped with an unusual adapter that charged at up to 15V and 2.6A. FCC filings show the Switch 2 is still rated for a maximum of 15V but also mention an AC adapter that goes up to 20V. Both or either of those could be USB-C PD, but we can’t properly guess at charging speed (in watts) without knowing the amperage.</p><p>We still don’t know exactly when the Switch 2 will be released, but Nintendo has said it’s coming sometime this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
