The game “has not met our expectations with mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences,” <a href="https://x.com/WarzoneMobile/status/1923470814357385447">according to a post on X</a>. The company will be pulling the game from the App Store and Google Play after Sunday, May 18th.</p><p>Players who have installed the game before Monday, May 19th will “still have access to the game with continued cross-progression of shared inventories using existing content, and servers with matchmaking for online play,” Activision says.</p><p>However, there will be no new seasonal content or gameplay updates, social features across platforms will not be available, and you won’t be able to buy content with real-world currency, <a href="https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-service-changes">Activision says on a support page</a>.

The improvements vary per game, but they include things like optimizing visuals for the Switch 2’s larger screen, better frame rates, HDR support, and GameShare support.</p><p>The full list of games getting free updates is below, and you can see the specific updates <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ftransfer-guide%2Fgames-with-free-updates%2F" rel="sponsored">on Nintendo’s website</a>. The updates will all be available on June 5th, the same day the Switch 2 launches:</p><div><ul><li><span><em>ARMS</em></span></li><li><span><em>Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain</em></span></li><li><span><em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em></span></li><li><span><em>Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics</em></span></li><li><span><em>Game Builder Garage</em></span></li><li><span><em>New Super Mario Bros.

But if you’re looking to revisit some older Switch games on the Switch 2, even the smaller improvements could feel welcome — especially for games like <em>Pokémon Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em> and the <em>Link’s Awakening</em> remake that sometimes struggled on the original Switch hardware.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The latest change to the homescreen section of the Xbox dashboard will be available to Xbox Insiders this week, alongside options to hide system apps, choose the number of apps and games listed, and modify the size of the tiled UI.</p><p>You’ll soon be able to pin up to three of your recently played games or apps to the homescreen. “These pins will stay near the front of the list as you launch other things, giving you quick access to your go-to titles,” <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/16/xbox-insiders-get-new-ways-to-personalize-home/">explains Eden Marie</a>, principal software engineering lead for Xbox experiences.</p><p>If you don’t want to see system apps listed on the homescreen, you’ll be able to disable these to focus solely on games and apps. If you really want to take customization a step further, you’ll also soon be able to reduce the number of visible tiles in the recently played games and apps list. Microsoft says it’s “refining this setting” and it’ll be available to Xbox Insiders soon.</p><p>Microsoft is making these Xbox Home interface changes because fans have requested more customizability. “We’ve heard from many of you that Home should feel more like your space,” says Marie. “Whether it’s surfacing your favorite games, hiding what you don’t use, or simply making Home feel less crowded, this update is a direct response to that feedback.”</p><p>Microsoft previously tested a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/26/23808139/microsoft-new-xbox-home-ui-available-now-download">big overhaul of the Xbox Home UI</a> in 2022, before shipping it broadly to Xbox owners in 2023. The software maker made more room for backgrounds, quick access to games, the store, and settings as part of the UI overhaul.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
