There’s likely going to be a lot of news from the show; the company’s Unreal Engine is used as part of making many of the world’s biggest video games and entertainment, and <em>Fortnite</em> is still a huge game that’s getting new experiences all the time thanks to the Unreal Editor for Fortnite.</p><p>At the show, Epic will be hosting its annual State of Unreal keynote, which will begin at 9:30AM ET on June 3rd. The company hasn’t said much about what will be announced, but it’s promising that it will “share what’s next for Unreal Engine and the Epic ecosystem.”</p><p>The show also follows the major ruling in <em>Epic Games v. Apple</em> that blew up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">Apple’s control of the App Store</a>, and it seems likely that Epic CEO Tim Sweeney might have something to say about it.</p><p>Here’s our coverage from the event.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6Njc4NDYz" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678463/unreal-engine-5-witcher-4-tech-demo">Epic showed off Unreal Engine 5 with an impressive Witcher 4 tech demo</a></h2><div><p>An ongoing tradition at Epic’s big keynotes is a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273832/epic-unreal-engine-demo-troll-rebirth-ray-tracing-gdc-2019">gorgeous</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21256079/epic-unreal-engine-5-playstation-5-demo-next-gen-graphics-release-date">tech demo </a>that shows off what its game engine is capable of. For this year’s State of Unreal, the company turned to <em>The Witcher</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> developer CD Projekt Red. This new demo a beautiful glimpse at its fantasy world, filled with blood, fire, and monsters — and more importantly, a new horse.</p><p>The demo was built using Unreal Engine 5.6, and shows new protagonist Ciri exploring some forested lands and a marketplace known as Valdrest. Epic says the demo is designed in part to show off how the latest iteration can handle both bustling scenes and foliage in an open-world setting. It also shows how much horse technology has improved since <em>The Witcher 3</em>. Epic says that the demo is running on a base model PS5 at 60 frames per second, with raytracing enabled, and the presentation included a live demonstration, with the developers playing the game on stage.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678463/unreal-engine-5-witcher-4-tech-demo">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>A Ciri-ously good start.</p><p>Things kicked off with a beautiful tech demo for <em>The Witcher 4</em>.
