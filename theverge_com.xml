He joined The Verge in 2021 after several years covering news at Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/716856/epic-v-google-win-in-appeals-court">an appeals court victory on Thursday</a>, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1950968220833423451">tweeted</a> that “the Epic Games Store for Android will be coming to the Google Play Store.” This is despite Google’s plan to appeal the Ninth Circuit panel’s decision, which declined to overturn a 2023 jury verdict that Google’s app store and payment system had become illegal monopolies.</p><div><p>There’s no detail yet on timing, but it would make accessing <em>Fortnite </em>and other Epic-distributed games much simpler on Android devices, without relying on sideloading or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319206/epic-games-store-preinstall-telefonica-samsung-uk-europe-latin-america">making deals with phone manufacturers</a> to preload the store. On iPhone and iPad, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/mobile">the mobile version of the Epic Games Store</a> is still only available in the European Union, but Android users could sideload it from the web <a href="http://This is despite Google’s plan to appeal today’s ruling, which declined to overturn a 2023 jury verdict that Google’s app store policies and payment system were illegal monopolies.">since the apps launched last fall</a>.</p></div><p>Epic may not be the only company to put a rival app store inside of Google’s Play Store in the near future. The Ninth Circuit appears to have lifted a stay on the entire permanent injunction that Epic won against Google’s app store monopolies, and that injunction would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores">force Google to crack open Android for other third-party stores</a> as well. “The stay is lifted,” Epic spokesperson Cat McCormack confirms to <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>The Epic Games Store on Android maintains your persistent status in games across platforms, and earlier this year, the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633579/fr">brought its weekly free games program</a> to the mobile stores, too. It also has other Epic games, like <em>Fall Guys</em> and <em>Rocket League Sideswipe</em>.</p><p>In a statement provided to <em>The Verge</em>, Google’s global head of regulatory affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland said, “This decision will significantly harm user safety, limit choice, and undermine the innovation that has always been central to the Android ecosystem. Our top priority remains protecting our users, developers and partners, and maintaining a secure platform as we continue our appeal.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Mzc1"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Richard Lawler</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/716914/fortnite-epic-games-store-android-google-play]]></content:encoded>
