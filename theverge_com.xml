Instead of using triangles to model hair, Nvidia will use spheres to improve Harrison Ford’s virtual hair in the <em>Indiana Jones</em> game.</p><p>RTX Hair is designed to improve lighting and shadows, all while maintaining performance in the game and not taking up too much extra memory. It also makes Ford’s hair look fuller and more realistic, and will be available as an update to the real-time path tracing mode in <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>.</p><p>The RTX Hair improvements use new hardware capabilities in RTX 50-series GPUs, as Nvidia added hardware acceleration of ray tracing for hair and fur and support for the linear swept sphere (LSS) primitive. <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/render-path-traced-hair-in-real-time-with-nvidia-geforce-rtx-50-series-gpus/">Nvidia says</a> LSS is a “big step toward rendering high-quality digital humans in real time.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/760479/nvidia-rtx-hair-indiana-jones-game]]></content:encoded>

Nvidia has been gradually improving its new app over the past 18 months since its release, and it’s getting closer to fully migrating all the legacy control panel options.</p><p>This week’s Nvidia app update will include anisotropic filtering, anti-aliasing, and ambient occlusion options, meaning you won’t have to navigate to Nvidia’s older control panel app to improve classic games. The setup tool for Nvidia Surround will also be part of the Nvidia app now.</p><p>You also won’t have to configure DLSS override features on a per game basis anymore, as Nvidia is now adding a global option. You can set your DLSS preferences across all override supported games, and Nvidia’s overlay will also show which DLSS settings are active if you toggle this option on.</p><p>Nvidia is also bringing its <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fnvidia-app-update-dlss-overrides-and-more%2F%23nvidia-smooth-motion&amp;xcust=__vg0818awD__602963__________________google.com" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored" target="_blank">new Smooth Motion feature</a>, which was previously exclusive to RTX 50-series GPUs, to all RTX 40-series owners. It’s a driver-based AI model that enables smoother gameplay for games that don’t support DLSS Frame Generation. Smooth Motion can be applied to games running with DLSS Super Resolution, at native resolution, or even titles with other upscaling technologies. Nvidia says it will typically double “the perceived frame rate.”</p><p>If you’re a fan of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/635155/nvidia-g-assist-ai-assistant-available-download">Nvidia’s G-Assist AI assistant</a>, Nvidia is changing the AI model behind the scenes so it will use 40 percent less memory. The smaller footprint won’t affect performance either, as it’s designed to respond even faster to queries.</p><p>These latest Nvidia app changes will arrive on August 19th for beta users at 9AM PT / 12PM ET, followed by a general release next week.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/760488/nvidia-app-dlss-override-control-panel-features]]></content:encoded>

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia’s GeForce Now is getting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760219/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-5080-cloud-gaming">a big upgrade next month</a> — and it’s also part of an intriguing new experiment. Nvidia, Discord, and Epic Games have teamed up for an early test of instant game demos for Discord servers, which could theoretically let you immediately try a game without buying it, downloading it, or signing up for an account.</p><div><p>Sound familiar? That’s probably because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993828/sony-playstation-now-cloud-gaming-gaikai-onlive-google-stadia-25th-anniversary#:~:text=one%20that%20would%20let%20you%20instantly%20try%20any%20game%20before%20you%20buy%20it">instantly try-before-you-buy was the original vision for Gaikai</a>, one of the first cloud gaming services, and Google’s Stadia cloud gaming service <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/1/17924492/google-project-stream-game-assassins-creed-odyssey-free-testing">also</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747836/google-stadia-cloud-gaming-free-trial-30-minutes">tried it</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/10/23163089/capcom-resident-evil-village-demo-browser-google-stadia">many times</a> by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/15/22978719/google-stadia-cloud-gaming-free-trial">letting you</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738550/arkham-knight-google-stadia-att">demo games</a> in a web browser or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/11/23301875/google-search-results-launch-stadia-geforce-now-xcloud-luna-cloud-gaming">even in Google search</a>. Now, Nvidia will be showing off the idea at Gamescom this week by letting people try <em>Fortnite</em> from within Discord.</p></div><p>“You can simply click a button that says ‘try a game’ and then connect your Epic Games account and immediately jump in and and join the action, and you’ll be playing <em>Fortnite</em> in seconds without any downloads or installs,” says Nvidia product marketing director Andrew Fear.</p><p>Here’s a screenshot of what it might look like, from <a href="https://youtu.be/fuJFzmVmm-c?si=RPRl8aHoFiQmYLMb&amp;t=1128">an Nvidia video</a>, which also shows the <em>Fortnite</em> demo is currently limited to a 30-minute free trial:</p><p>It doesn’t sound <em>completely</em> frictionless if you still need an Epic Games account to play, and it’s not clear if Nvidia, Epic and Discord will offer the demo outside of Gamescom just yet. Nvidia is calling it a “technology announcement” rather than a confirmed feature, one that’ll hopefully see game publishers and developers reach out if they’re interested in potentially adding it to their games.</p><p>After Sony bought Gaikai in 2012, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993828/sony-playstation-now-cloud-gaming-gaikai-onlive-google-stadia-25th-anniversary#:~:text=he%20presented%20a%20vision%20of%20a%20PlayStation%20Network%20like%20we%E2%80%99d%20never%20seen%20before%2C%20one%20that%20would%20let%20you%20instantly%20try%20any%20game%20before%20you%20buy%20it.">it initially suggested</a> it would offer instant try-before-you-buy game demos on the PlayStation 4 too, but that never happened.
