As ever with Google, it feels like a lot of <em>stuff </em>without necessarily a coherent plan behind it. But if you look closely enough, and start to put some of the pieces together, the combination of those announcements might add up to something like Google’s vision for the future of everything.</p><p>On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a><em> </em>(our last Tuesday episode of the year), <em>The Verge</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/kylie-robison">Kylie Robison</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/victoria-song">Victoria Song</a> join the show to do some Google puzzling. They describe their experiences with all of Google’s new projects and experiments, and explain why Google thinks XR could be the killer app for AI&nbsp;—&nbsp;and vice versa. </p><p>After that, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/christopher-grant">Chris Grant</a>, group publisher for <em>The Verge </em>and <em>Polygon</em>, joins to talk about the two biggest 2025 stories in gaming: the impending launches of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23987993/gta-6-news-trailers-rockstar-games"><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></a><em> </em>and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. He explains why <em>GTA </em>is such an important and enduring gaming franchise, why he’s confident the Switch 2 won’t be like the Wii U, and why the whole gaming world is waiting for these two things so intently.</p><p>Finally, we answer a question from the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!), with some help from <em>The Verge’s </em>publisher <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/helen-havlak">Helen Havlak</a>. Helen mentioned last week that she uses Figma to manage her garden, and let’s just say you all had some follow-up questions about that. So Helen came back to explain her whole system.</p><p>If you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started, beginning with Google:</p><p>And in games:</p><p>Also, here is some screenshot inspo of Helen’s Figma garden in all its to-scale glory.</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/16/24322358/iris2-starlink-rival-europe-date-cost"><h2>Europe’s Starlink competitor is go</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/16/24322665/chatgpt-search-engine-rolling-out-free-users"><h2>ChatGPT’s AI search engine is rolling out to everyone</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/16/24322614/google-whisk-ai-generator-remix-pictures-plug-in"><h2>Google’s Whisk AI generator will ‘remix’ the pictures you plug in</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch"><h2>The Nintendo Switch 2, as described by Dbrand</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/16/24322628/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-live-ai-translation-shazam"><h2>Meta rolls out live AI, translations, and Shazam to its smart glasses</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
