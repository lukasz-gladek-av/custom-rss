            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/664363/despelote-review-ps5-xbox-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>For a kid with an obsession, it’s impossible to think about anything else. When I was really into skateboarding, every piece of architecture was filled with a potential for tricks that I could never actually pull off. When I was on a quest to complete <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> on my own, any piece of paper became a sketch of a new level.</p><p>For eight-year-old Julián in the new game <em>Despelote</em>, that obsession is soccer, and it becomes the backdrop for a sweet, and short, slice-of-life drama about passion and memory.</p><p><em>Despelote</em> is set in Quito in 2001, just as Ecuador is on the verge of qualifying for the men’s World Cup for the first time in its history. The story follows Julián through the qualifying stages, as he goes about his life — or tries to, at least. There’s a lot going on at the time, as the country is still dealing with the effects of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998%E2%80%931999_Ecuador_economic_crisis">an economic crisis</a>. Soccer becomes something of a relief valve, a hopeful story to follow during difficult times.</p><p>The game plays out from a first-person perspective and takes place across several days, during each of which Ecuador has an important match. The scenes are small but surprisingly open, often forcing young Julián – and also the player – to decide where to focus. He might be playing a 16-bit soccer game while his mom tries to lecture him, or staring out the window idly watching people kick a ball around while he’s supposed to be listening to a lesson.</p><p>Sometimes he has a goal to complete, like getting home in time for dinner or keeping an eye on his little sister in the park. But there’s always a distraction. And it’s almost always a soccer ball. Most of the time, Julián has a ball at his feet, either kicking it around with friends, or by himself while everyone else parties. When there isn’t a ball, he makes do, kicking around anything from a glass bottle to a copy of <em>Shrek</em> on DVD.</p><p>There’s a real specificity to <em>Despelote</em> in terms of its place and time, but it also evokes a very universal feeling of being a kid. Those choices between what Julián wants to do and what he is supposed to do are tough, and often his mom will let him have it when he messes up. At one point, while playing hide-and-seek, I lost his sister, and became petrified of the reaction I’d get if I didn’t find her in time. There are also moments where control is pulled away from you, and Julián’s mom will drag him by the hand wherever he’s supposed to be.</p><p>The interactivity of these moments really puts you in Julián’s shoes, and there were key scenes that brought me back to my own childhood. (Especially having a younger sibling distract you while you’re playing a video game.) It’s all rendered with dreamy, oversaturated backdrops and comic book-like characters. It feels like you’re in a memory, which is amplified by adult Julián — the game was developed by designer Julián Cordero and animator and musician Sebastián Valbuena — setting the scene through narration at the beginning of each chapter.</p><p>All the while, tension is building as Ecuador inches closer to qualification. (At most points in the game you can find your way to a TV to check the score in the current match.) It all culminates in a beautiful fourth-wall-breaking moment that puts this autobiographical story into a larger perspective.</p><p><em>Despelote </em>only lasts around two hours, and most of that time is spent kicking a ball around. And yet it manages to capture so many feelings of childhood and the all-consuming infatuations that come with being a kid.</p><p><sub>Despelote <em>is available now on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, with a Switch version also in the works.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/664621/deltarune-nintendo-switch-2-launch-time<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The paid release of <em>Deltarune</em>, Toby Fox’s episodic <em>Undertale</em> spinoff, will be available for most people at the same time the Nintendo Switch 2 launches in Japan, Fox says in the <a href="https://toby.fangamer.com/newsletters/release-time/"><em>Deltarune</em> newsletter for May 2025</a>. <em>Deltarune’s</em> first two chapters, released in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18047410/undertale-spinoff-sequel-deltarune-toby-fox">2018</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22677626/toby-fox-undertale-sequel-deltarune-chapter-2-release-date-mac-pc">2021</a> respectively, were free, but this new release, which adds chapters 3 and 4, will be a paid version that costs $24.99. </p><p>How the release timing will work is a little confusing, but let me explain. For PS4, PS5, Steam, and the original Switch, <em>Deltarune</em> will launch on June 5th at 12AM in Japan, which translates to June 4th at 11AM ET / 8AM PT for people in the US.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 version of <em>Deltarune</em>, on the other hand, will launch at midnight local time in most regions on June 5th. This decision actually means that people in New Zealand or Australia who get a Switch 2 at midnight have a slight head start. “But, for convenience’s sake, we’re just going to ignore you guys and pretend that the game is not out… Meanwhile, don’t say anything about it please,” Fox says.</p><p>Future updates to <em>Deltarune</em> will be added for free, Fox said in a newsletter last month, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83-uYZHgQ6Y">Switch 2 version</a> will have a special room that takes advantage of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642493/nintendo-switch-mouse-controls-metroid-prime-4">console’s mouse controls</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>PS5 users can now buy games in the PlayStation Store using a new payment method: Apple Pay. You could use Apple Pay in the browser or via the mobile app <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/store/payment-methods-accepted-on-ps-store/#accepted">already</a>, but now the method joins other on-console options like using a saved credit or debit card, and PayPal.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/05/09/ps5-apple-pay/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a>, you may now see a new option for Apple Pay available at checkout. It’s using the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177851/apple-ios-18-pay-chrome-scanning-code-wwdc-2024">QR code-style method</a> that Apple introduced on iOS 18 last year, and also lets you buy things on third-party browsers like Chrome. The <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/store/ps-store-apple-pay-payment/#applepay">PlayStation support page for using Apple Pay</a> has more information on which regions this works in, which includes the US.</p><p>Once you select the game you want on your PS5, choose Apple Pay, then scan the code on your TV screen with your iPhone. iOS will then pull up a checkout screen that lets you confirm the transaction. And if you’re an Apple Card user, that means your PS5 purchases are good for 2 percent cash back as well. <em>9to5Mac</em> also says Apple Pay may come to PS4 consoles as well after a future software update.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
