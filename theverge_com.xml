He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In a recent update to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Fhow-to-buy%2F" rel="sponsored">its website</a> about its direct sales program for the Switch 2, Nintendo says that due to “the very high demand” for the console, “delivery by June 5 is not guaranteed” and that “your invitation email may arrive after the Nintendo Switch 2 launch.”</p><p>Nintendo has already said that the initial invitations for eligible registrations on its My Nintendo Store website would go out on May 8th. The requirements to be eligible are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641559/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gameplay-requirements">quite strict</a>, seemingly to thwart scalpers.</p><p>But now, as it did <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/654213/nintendo-switch-2-demand-japan-preorders-sales">for Japan yesterday</a>, the company is signaling that US demand for consoles through its own store is quite high. If you were banking on getting a Switch 2 through the platform, you might want to be prepared to potentially wait.</p><p>In its update, Nintendo suggests visiting “our participating retail partners,” but the preorders that have happened so far, which kicked off at 12AM ET on Thursday at Best Buy, Target, and Walmart, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/654571/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-issues-problems">have been messy</a>.</p><p>Ahead of those preorders, the list of retail partners on Nintendo’s website included Best Buy, Target, Walmart, and GameStop. As I write this, only GameStop, which opens online preorders at 11AM ET on Thursday, has a logo on the page.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/654571/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-issues-problems<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo’s delayed Switch 2 preorders finally kicked off in the US at 12AM ET on Thursday at Best Buy, Target, and Walmart, and almost immediately, there were some big problems. After nearly an hour of frustration, many of us here at <em>The Verge</em> secured preorders, but it seems like preorders are out of stock at the retailers.</p><p>Target seemed to open first, but trying to order was rough. Many of us were able to get to the checkout screen, but ran into issues from there that stopped a purchase, like being asked to update our addresses over or Target losing our payment details. Some users online who did appear to get Target orders also reported that <a href="https://x.com/zkahn/status/1915259239704199191">they were canceled</a>. Although stock appeared to float in and out after preorders were live, Target now says both the console and the bundle with <em>Mario Kart World</em> are out of stock.</p><p>Walmart’s website, for me for a while, had a vague queue. “This deal is almost gone,” according to the page. But eventually, many of us at <em>The Verge</em> (including me!) were able to snag our Switch 2 preorders from the retailer. Like with Target, Walmart eventually showed a handful of the consoles and bundles in stock here and there before they both sold out.</p><p>Best Buy, which promised to launch preorders at 12AM ET, showed a gray “coming soon” button on the Switch 2 and <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle pack for about 30 minutes. As of 12:31AM ET, I was in a line for the bundle, but Best Buy kicked me out of it shortly before 2AM ET and said that the bundle was out of stock. Although I wasn’t able to buy one from Best Buy, I saw many reports online of success there.</p><p>Nintendo originally announced that preorders would go live in the US on April 9th ahead of a June 5th launch for the console, but the company delayed the preorders <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">over tariff concerns</a> without sharing a date for when they would kick off.</p><p>The preorder problems follow Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa issuing a supply warning in Japan <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/654213/nintendo-switch-2-demand-japan-preorders-sales">on Wednesday</a>. Nintendo also announced this week that invitations to its direct sales in the US <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/655159/my-nintendo-store-switch-2-invites">might not be available</a> to everyone ahead of launch.</p><p>Last week, Nintendo finally announced that preorders would start <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643616/nintendo-switch-2-us-preorders-date">on April 24th</a> and that the price would still start at $449.99 in the US. Accessories got price hikes. Preorders started earlier this month in some other territories, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-uk-1">including the UK</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There’s no telling whether we can expect more price hikes down the line, either, meaning if you do manage to preorder a Switch 2 and want to pick up a second controller or another accessory to go with it, now might be the time to act.</p><div><p id="where-to-preorder-controllers"><h2>Where to preorder controllers</h2></p></div><div><p id="nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller</h3></p></div><p>The removable Joy-Cons are great for portable and wireless play, but their small, curveless design can feel cramped during longer sessions if you have larger hands.
