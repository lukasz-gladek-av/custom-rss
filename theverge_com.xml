The news comes in the aftermath of a disappointing launch for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/689333/fbc-firebreak-review-xbox-ps5-steam"><em>FBC: Firebreak</em></a>, the Finnish studio’s first foray into multiplayer gaming. Virtala will be replaced on an interim basis by Markus Mäki, Remedy’s chief product officer and one of the studio’s co-founders. The studios says it will “initiate a search process for a new CEO immediately.”</p><p>Virtala took over the role back in 2016, and was a key figure behind Remedy’s transformation over the past decade, as it shifted from a work-for-hire studio to one that developed multiple projects simultaneously and owned and published its own games. This period was highlighted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20832997/control-review-creators-thriller-ps4-xbox-pc">the launch of <em>Control</em> in 2019</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc">the long-awaited sequel to <em>Alan Wake</em> in 2023</a>.</p><div><p><em>Firebreak</em> was meant to be a major part of this transformation, a self-published spinoff of <em>Control</em> that was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/665752/fbc-firebreak-preview-interview-remedy-control-ps5-xbox">an attempt to marry the studio’s worldbuilding and storytelling with a live-service co-op shooter</a>. However, the combination didn’t win over players and, despite launching <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/784967/remedy-fbc-firebreak-update">a major update in September</a>, two weeks ago <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=b4d23a32-03e7-49e5-bbc3-93ec062699a5">Remedy issued a profit warning</a> due to “weak sales” of <em>Firebreak</em>.</p></div><p>Part of the impetus behind Remedy’s shift to a multi-project studio — in addition to <em>Firebreak</em>, it’s also currently developing <em>Control 2</em>, remasters of <em>Max Payne</em>, and a mystery game — was to help it deal with potential flops like <em>Firebreak</em>, though Virtala told me ahead of the game’s launch that, even still, each release was still significant for the independent studio. “Every single game is highly important for us,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/691964/remedy-entertainment-profile-alan-wake-control-fbc-firebreak">Virtala told <em>The Verge</em></a>. “There is no question that we are not fully insulated. But we are less dependent on any single game than we used to be.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/804372/remedy-ceo-resigns-fbc-firebreak-control]]></content:encoded>
