            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When I was 16 years old, I wrote my first fanfiction. It was a crossover fic where the cast from <em>Queer Eye for the Straight Guy</em> gave the anime dog demon Inuyasha a makeover. It was stupid and poorly written, and yet, to this very day, I remember it fondly. This is exactly what it’s like playing <em>Super Robot Wars Y</em> — an exceedingly silly, nonsensical plot featuring characters that have no business speaking to each other all, stitched together by tactical robot action. It rules.</p><p><em>Super Robot Wars Y</em> was released on Nintendo Switch 2 and Steam on August 29th. For this blog, I played the demo that covers the game’s first chapter with progress carrying over to the full game. It is the latest entry in a series of robot strategy games that spans back to the NES days, but this recent game is only one of a handful of English releases. <em>Super Robot Wars</em> takes all the robots from your favorite mecha series — <em>Getter Robo</em>, <em>Mazinger</em> <em>Z</em>, <em>Gundam</em>, and more — and mashes them together in a big ol’ strategy RPG toybox.</p><p>That’s excellent for the Universal Century-loving, Knightmare Frame-driving girlies such as myself, but absolute hell on studios who have to navigate <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2016/02/18/super-robot-wars-og-the-moon-dwellers-will-be-getting-an-english-localized-release/">complex licensing agreements</a> with anime distributors and production companies once you get outside Japan.</p><p>It’s only been through the dedication of fan translators that <em>Super Robot Wars</em> has maintained a robust English-speaking fandom. And it’s apparently big enough that Bandai Namco has decided it’s worth it to give these games worldwide releases, starting with <em>Super Robot Wars 30</em> in 2021 and now <em>Super Robot Wars Y</em>.</p><p>This game is, to use the technical term, goofy as shit. You play as an original character, a mecha-piloting soldier sent to protect a young girl who’s found herself in charge of a giant city that’s also a floating battleship. (If you’re familiar with the original <em>Mobile Suit Gundam</em>’s White Base, it’s that but with a city on it.) From there, it gets really silly. The utterly charming thing about <em>Super Robot Wars Y</em> is it makes an earnest, full-throated attempt to incorporate every component series’ plot and most important moments into a singular coherent story.</p><p>When Domon Kasshu (<em>Mobile Fighter G Gundam</em>) shows up, everyone gushes over him because he’s the pilot who won the 13th Gundam Fight. They also gush over him because he’s the guy who gave the most “romantic love confession ever,” and if you’ve watched <em>G Gundam,</em> you’ll know what they’re talking about. And if you don’t, the game includes a robust encyclopedia of characters, organizations, and events to get you up to speed. But I’ve found I don’t care when I don’t know someone or something.</p><div><p>This game is, to use the technical term, goofy as shit.</p></div><p>In one fight where I was overwhelmed by mecha-kaiju, four teenagers with attitude climbed into four different mechs that then fused into one. Did I know those kids or care about them? No. Why? Because their giant mech — which I’m told is called a Dynazenon — transformed <em>again</em> into a giant, flame-spouting mecha dragon. Who cares about teenagers when you’ve got giant robot dragons?</p><p>Characters with similar motivations and goals are gathered on one side of the conflict and their opponents on the other, leading to legendary team-ups that were once only possible eight pages deep into an AO3 fanfic search. I cannot express how much the sentence “Lelouch vi Britannia mounted an all-out assault on Char Aznable” breaks my brain in half. But I can definitively say it was also the moment I bought all the way into this game.</p><p>The other reason I’m sold is the combat. I’ve been searching for a tactical action RPG. The last couple I’ve played, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23557639/fire-emblem-engage-nintendo-switch-review"><em>Fire Emblem Engage</em></a> and <em>Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp</em>, left me cold with a bland story and uninteresting combat, respectively.</p><p><em>Super Robot Wars Y</em> has adequately scratched my itch. It works like any other tactical RPG: send units out on missions to destroy enemy mechs on a gridded battlefield. Each pilot has a suite of abilities you can swap out and improve, the same way you can upgrade mechs by changing out their parts and enhancing them.</p><p>Since this was a demo of the game’s first chapter, combat was relatively simplistic. But I can see that the upgrade systems offer depth to explore beyond that. You also get abilities called “spirits” that grant you temporary stat bonuses or let you dodge attacks, and support characters who also grant temporary combat boons, so you can build your team to your liking. There’s also something called the “Sacred Tri-Directional Galaxy Memory,” which is basically a skill tree that rewards picking a dedicated path with massive, team-wide bonuses.</p><p>There’s a part of me that wanted to caveat all the praise I have for <em>Super Robot Wars Y</em> with “as childish as it sounds,” but that’s not really fair. Even from the little bit I’ve played, the enjoyment I get out of <em>Super Robot Wars Y</em> is real, and not strictly because the combat scratched an itch or the batshit story provided a rousing good time. It reminds me of the fun I had writing fanfiction as a kid, and I hope, as the game goes on, that feeling continues.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/773191/super-robot-wars-y-impressions-demo-nintendo-switch-2#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/773191/super-robot-wars-y-impressions-demo-nintendo-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Herdling</em> is a slow game about herding fuzzy animals through a vibrant natural world. That may not sound particularly exciting, but I found it to be a perfect game to unwind with after a stressful day.</p><p>In <em>Herdling</em>, you play as a kid who makes friends with and shepherds large fluffy creatures called Calicorns, which kind of look like a mix of a sheep and a woolly mammoth. The Calicorns are <em>adorable</em>, with cute snorts and head shakes that make them feel like real animals. You’ll even get opportunities to play fetch, and yes, you can pet the Calicorns. You can also name your furry friends, and the game even suggests ideas, which is why my flock have charming names like “Dilruba” (in my head, I called him “Dil”), “Fardar,” and “Toe.”</p><p>You guide the herd with a magical stick. With the push of a trigger, you’ll see a small bright spot ahead of you that the herd will follow. The Calicorns generally do a good job staying grouped up and following your directions, so much of the game is walking behind them and guiding them through scenic locales like a forest and a mountain range. When you direct the herd to walk over rare spots of colorful flowers, the Calicorns essentially get a boost you can use to activate a stampede, which is useful for running across open landscapes or climbing up slippery slopes.</p><p>Most of the time, walking with the herd is quite peaceful. I regularly found my eyes wandering away from the path to take in the game’s scenery as the Calicorns ambled toward where I wanted them to go. The ambient, <em>Breath of the Wild</em>-like soundtrack helps create the calming atmosphere. It all made <em>Herdling</em> great to unwind with after a hectic day in real life.</p><p>But there are some more tense moments too, like when you have to avoid the attention of some giant birds or keep your Calicorns from wandering onto thin ice. These moments require patience so that you can thoughtfully get the herd through trouble, and I was always relieved when I got my Calicorns out of stressful spots. (If you don’t want to worry about putting your Calicorns in danger, the game has a setting to make them immortal.)</p><p>If reading all of this makes <em>Herdling</em> sound a little bit like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/13/22972989/journey-10-year-anniversary-multiplayer-jenova-chen-austin-wintory">indie classic <em>Journey</em></a> but with furry animals, well, it kind of is. There are <em>a lot</em> of similar beats between the two games. That’s not a bad thing, though; the varied locations and tones made <em>Journey</em> memorable even though it’s a short game. There are similarly some standout moments in <em>Herdling</em>, and I had really bonded with my Calicorn crew by the end of our three-hour adventure together. I thought that was just the right length, but maybe I’ll boot up my save down the line to go on another nice walk with Dil and flock — or just to play fetch again.</p><p><sup>Herdling</sup><em><sup> is available now on Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</sup></em></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/764810/herdling-panic-review-pc-switch-playstation-xbox#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/764810/herdling-panic-review-pc-switch-playstation-xbox]]></content:encoded>
