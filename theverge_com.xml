In December, <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/pcf-organizational-update/">a notice from the company</a> stated it would suspend production on a project codenamed Victoria and reduce the team working on Bifrost. In today’s announcement, Wojciechowski wrote that cancellations were due to an unspecified publisher’s failure to present necessary publishing agreements, and a “lack of communication” regarding whether or not the publisher wants to continue with development. </p><p>The statement also attributed the cancellations to issues with the publisher’s cash flow stating it, “showed a lack of prospects for securing organizational resources and funds necessary to continue the production.” And the name of the publisher? It isn’t exactly a mystery. In the developer’s statement from December, People Can Fly named its collaborator on Project Gemini as Square Enix.People Can Fly — which was acquired by Epic Games in 2012 before going independent again in 2015 — will continue development on Xbox’s next <em>Gears of War</em> title, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172052/gears-6-xbox-summer-game-fest-trailer"><em>Gears of War: E-Day</em></a>, as a partner studio working with The Coalition.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/678000/nvidia-arm-gaming-laptop-mediatek-alienware<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/emma-roth">Emma Roth</a> <span>is a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia’s Arm-based PC chip could make its debut in Alienware’s laptops later this year or in early 2026, according to a report from the <a href="https://money.udn.com/money/story/5612/8778234">Taiwanese publication <em>United Daily News</em></a>. The chipmaking giant is reportedly working with MediaTek to develop an accelerated processing unit (APU) that combines an Arm-powered CPU with Nvidia’s Blackwell GPU architecture.</p><p>Nvidia is already popular in traditional gaming laptops using Intel or AMD chips, but an Arm CPU entry may well improve the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24215905/microsoft-windows-on-arm-gaming-laptops-notepad">Windows on Arm gaming situation</a>. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X chips have to run games emulated using Microsoft’s Prism software, and game compatibility and performance is severely limited on Qualcomm’s GPUs right now. </p><p>We first heard rumors about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/23/23929240/nvidia-amd-cpu-arm-pc-chips-2025-release-rumors">Nvidia’s Arm-based chip in 2023</a>, which could serve as yet another competitor to Intel’s chips and the Arm processors built by Qualcomm. Last week, <a href="https://youtu.be/6tASUo7UqNw?si=d8LoV-9bkP2JQ0V0&amp;t=2330">a video from YouTuber Moore’s Law is Dead</a> showed off what appears to be a leaked image of Nvidia’s rumored APU, with sources suggesting it could run between 80W and 120W. </p><p>In January, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during an investor’s presentation that the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338939/nvidia-jensen-huang-hints-arm-desktop-cpu">has “plans” for the Arm-based CPU</a> installed inside Digits, its personal AI supercomputer, <em>Reuters</em> reported at the time. Dell CEO Michael Dell also hinted at the possibility of launching an AI PC with Nvidia, as he replied, “come back next year” when asked about Nvidia’s presence in the AI PC market <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/dell-and-nvidia-ceos-hint-nvidia-ai-pc-chip-may-arrive-next-year">during an interview in 2024</a>.</p><p>Nvidia isn’t the only company that could challenge Qualcomm’s dominance in the Arm-based CPU space. MediaTek is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/mediatek-designs-arm-based-chip-microsofts-ai-laptops-say-sources-2024-06-11/">also rumored to be working on an Arm chip</a> of its own, while recent reports also <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-is-allegedly-working-on-arm-based-sound-wave-apus-for-microsofts-surface-laptops-next-year">suggest AMD is developing</a> an Arm-based chip for Microsoft Surface laptops.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
