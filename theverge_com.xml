            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/675241/apple-game-center-app-replace-rac7-sneaky-sasquatch-acquisition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Apple plans to announce an app focused on video games for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV at its Worldwide Developer Conference next week, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-27/apple-to-debut-dedicated-gaming-app-within-days-of-switch-2-s-arrival?srnd=homepage-americas">according to <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. The app will let you launch games you’ve installed on your devices and serve as a hub for things like achievements and leaderboards.</p><p>Apple is expected to launch its gaming app alongside the next version of iOS this September, <em>Bloomberg</em> reports. It will apparently replace Apple’s Game Center, feature editorial content, and let you access games also available on the App Store. A <em>9to5Mac</em> report <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/10/22/apple-new-app-store-like-app-games/">from last year</a> described the app as working similarly to the Xbox app for iPhone. </p><p>A Mac version of the new app will let users “tap into games downloaded outside of the App Store,” <em>Bloomberg</em> says.</p><p><em>Bloomberg</em>’s report follows news that Apple bought its first gaming studio. The company confirmed to <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/apple-acquires-rac7-sneaky-sasquatch/"><em>Digital Trends</em></a> that it acquired RAC7, the two-person studio behind <em>Sneaky Sasquatch</em>, one of the first games released on its Apple Arcade games subscription service. RAC7 won’t be folding into any other teams at the company, but will instead continue to operate as a game studio all its own, according to <em>Digital Trends.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tcgplayer-workers-form-ebay-first-union-095615128.html">workers at TCGplayer unionized</a> under the Communications Workers of America (CWA) in 2023, which later filed unfair labor charges that accused eBay of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/31/23813935/ebay-tcgplayer-union-labor-unfair-complaints-cwa">refusing to acknowledge the union</a>, failing to provide relevant information related to collective bargaining, and <a href="https://cwad1.org/news/cwa-files-unfair-labor-practice-after-ebay-owned-tcgplayer-illegally-fires">“surveilling” pro-union employees</a>, among other alleged union-busting tactics.</p></div><p>TCGplayer and eBay also canceled their meeting to finalize the union’s first contract just days before eBay revealed that it’s closing the Syracuse location.</p><p>The CWA <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/cwa-statement-ebays-syracuse-closure-announcement">has since filed another unfair labor practice</a> charge with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), accusing eBay of “terminating the employment” of workers to avoid bargaining. On Monday, <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/ebay-escalates-intimidation-union-members-after-closure-announcement">the CWA claimed that eBay</a> hired security guards at TCGplayer’s Syracuse authentication center that have “created an oppressive atmosphere by physically and verbally harassing employees.”</p><p>“TCGplayer is closing its Syracuse Authentication Center to consolidate operations within an eBay logistics center in Kentucky,” eBay spokesperson Maddy Martinez said in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “We recognize the near-term impact it will have on our employees, their families and the Syracuse community, and we are dedicated to taking care of our people during this transition.”</p><p>“Deploying security guards to stalk us immediately after letting us know that we would all be losing our jobs is psychological warfare,” Zach Freeman, an eBay worker and TCGunion-CWA Local 1123 member said in a press release. “By unleashing this brutal surveillance and intimidation campaign, TCGplayer and eBay are doing everything in their power to punish us for exercising our federally-protected rights to organize.”</p><p><em><strong>Update, May 27th: </strong>Added a statement from eBay.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
