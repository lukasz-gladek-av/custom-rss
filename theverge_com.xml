Whether they’re <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16151292/undertale-playstation-4-vita-release">pushing the boundaries of the medium</a> and or offering <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">a creative spin on classic ideas</a>, indie games can be just as interesting as big-budget epics.</p><p>Sometimes, though, indie games can fly under the radar. But we here at <em>The Verge</em> love seeking out hidden gems, so we want to use this space to share some of our favorite smaller games that we’re checking out so that you might find something new, or potentially your next obsession.</p><p>We’ll be highlighting interesting games you may not have heard of and sharing a little bit about why you should play them. This list will be updated pretty frequently, too — so check back often to see some new recommendations.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NTk1Njc2" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/25/24351112/lok-digital-review-word-game-iphone-android-steam">Lok Digital is a surreal puzzle game full of made-up words</a></h2><div><p>At a glance, <a href="https://lok-digital.com/"><em>Lok Digital</em></a> seems like another cute and clever word game, a perfect distraction to keep on your phone for idle moments. But look closer, and it’s clear something just isn’t right. Yes, it’s a game about creating words to fill out a puzzle board. Except those words aren’t actually real — and they all have special powers. Think of it like an alien take on Scrabble. It takes a while to wrap your head around, but <em>Lok</em>’s surreal setup makes for an excellent brain-scratching puzzler.</p><p>There is actually a story of sorts here. <em>Lok</em> takes place in a black-and-white fantasy realm, and your goal is to help little worm-like creatures progress through each level. The stages are grids of squares, and your goal is to turn each one black. (I have no idea how this helps the creatures move, but just stay with me here.) You turn them black by placing letters to spell out words. Completed words will black out squares, and certain words also have the ability to black out even more.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/25/24351112/lok-digital-review-word-game-iphone-android-steam">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NzMx" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/18/24344598/antonblast-review">Antonblast is an out-of-control platformer with its heart in the ’90s</a></h2><div><p><em>Antonblast</em> is kind of like playing a zany Saturday morning cartoon. It’s brash, maximalist, and often, you’ll feel like you don’t actually understand what’s happening. Somehow, that chaos gels into something that actually makes sense — and, at times, is even calming.</p><p><em>Antonblast</em> just launched in 2024, but it looks like a long-lost side-scrolling platformer from the 16-bit era of the SNES or Sega Genesis. That’s not just due to the fantastic pixel art. There are fun touches like delightfully ’90s-era character designs and Mode 7-like effects, such as your character splatting against the screen when you die, that really make it feel like a missing classic of the era.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/18/24344598/antonblast-review">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NzQz" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24339211/skate-city-new-york-review-apple-arcade">The best mobile skateboarding game now has a New York sequel</a></h2><div><p>For me, skateboarding has always been about getting into a flow state. Much like playing <em>Tetris</em>, I’m at my best when I’m skating almost subconsciously, not thinking and acting in the moment. It’s not an easy zone to get into, and music has always been my shortcut. So the greatest compliment I can give to <em>Skate City: New York</em> is that I’ve spent the past week fine-tuning the perfect playlist, all so that I can also perfect my runs in the game.</p><p><em>New York </em>is a sequel to the original <em>Skate City</em>; both are available through Apple Arcade, though the first game was eventually ported to consoles as well. It comes from Snowman, the studio behind the <em>Alto </em>series, and the shift to New York is a lot like the move from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/19/8064545/altos-adventure-iphone-ipad-snowboarding-game"><em>Alto’s Adventure</em></a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/21/17035830/altos-odyssey-sequel-iphone-game-ios-adventure-snowboarding"><em>Alto’s Odyssey</em></a>. It’s not an entirely new experience but, rather, one that changes the setting and adds some seemingly small — but very impactful — tweaks.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24339211/skate-city-new-york-review-apple-arcade">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li></ul></section></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
