            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/17/24323220/delta-emulator-ios-apple-triple-price-patreon-membership<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Delta gaming emulator is now providing a link to sign up for <a href="https://www.patreon.com/rileyshane">Patreon-exclusive membership perks</a> directly within the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24132984/delta-free-emulator-nintendo-gba-n64-iphone-app-store-us">iOS app in Apple’s US App Store</a>. Developer Riley Testut is heavily encouraging users to click that external link by tripling the price you’d otherwise pay to Apple for In-App Purchase versions of those same Patreon tiers.&nbsp;Testut calls it the “do not buy sale.”</p><p>The update both embraces and protests <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/16/24040881/apple-outside-payments-app-store-policies-iphone-ipad">the External Purchase Link Entitlement</a> that Apple introduced in January, which allows developers to link to outside payment platforms in exchange for giving Apple a slightly reduced 27 percent cut of sales. The App Store policy change was made following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/16/24039983/supreme-court-epic-apple-antitrust-case-rejected">rulings in the Epic vs Apple lawsuit</a> that found Apple had acted anticompetitively by preventing developers from telling users about payment methods that bypassed its own payment system.</p><div><figcaption><em>Clicking this link within the Delta app settings will take you to the Patreon page to sign up directly.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Delta</cite></p></div><p>Testut says Delta is likely the first app to use the entitlement. The $3, $5, and $10 monthly memberships on Patreon — which provide additional benefits like iPad and SEGA Genesis support, and private Discord access depending on the subscription tier — are listed in the iOS app at $10, $15, and $30, respectively.</p><p>“We <em>really</em> don’t want people to use in-app purchase,” Testut told <em>The Verge</em>. “We’ve been using Patreon for years, and it allows us to do things Apple’s IAP system can’t — such as issuing refunds and handling customer support — making it much more convenient for creators like us.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
