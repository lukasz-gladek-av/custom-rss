            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Intel and AMD have split the Windows laptop market for years, but the x86 players may be getting outnumbered. It’s not just Apple MacBooks and MediaTek-based Chromebooks using Arm chips anymore. There are finally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/862985/asus-zenbook-a16-snapdragon-x2-ces-early-testing-hands-on">competent Qualcomm Snapdragon laptops</a> running Windows, and — as soon as this spring — Nvidia will finally power Windows consumer laptops with Arm chips all by itself.</p><p>They won’t have an Nvidia graphics chip next to an Intel CPU, but rather an Nvidia N1 system-on-chip at the helm — and overnight, a Lenovo leak revealed that the company has built six laptops on the upcoming N1 and N1X processors, including a 15-inch gaming machine.</p><p>Dataminer Huang514613 posted the product names to X, which also include 14 and 16-inch models of the Ideapad Slim 5, two variants of the 15-inch Yoga Pro 7, and a Yoga 9 transforming 2-in-1.</p><p>You don’t need to take Huang’s word for it alone: <a href="https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht517560-legion-space">this update page</a> for the company’s Legion Space control software still shows the existence of a “Legion 7 15N1X11” gaming laptop, where the “N1X” refers to Nvidia’s gaming SoC.</p><p>And just by using Google, I found a publicly indexed web portal where Lenovo has listings for password-protected “Nvidia N1x Portal Prod” and Nvidia N1x Portal Test” websites, too:</p><div><p>Lenovo may be the world’s biggest laptop maker, but it isn’t the only one prepping such laptops. Dell was tipped to launch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678000/nvidia-arm-gaming-laptop-mediatek-alienware">an Alienware gaming laptop by early 2026</a> as well, and it <a href="https://x.com/Olrak29_/status/2010609089563467907/photo/1">may have been prepping a Dell Premium</a> laptop (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/851047/dell-xps-14-16-13-laptops-brand-return-ces-2026">now XPS</a>) with Nvidia N1X as well. That’s already eight different Nvidia laptops that might be coming.</p></div><p>Three days ago, <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20260120PD216/nvidia-notebooks-launch-arm-windows-2026.html"><em>Digitimes</em> reported</a> that we should expect Nvidia to launch its N1 and N1X laptop platform this spring, with more devices available this summer, after <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250721PD208/mediatek-nvidia-ai-pc-launch-2026.html">a previous delay</a> — and that the company already has N2 and N2X chips on the roadmap for late 2027.</p><p>While we don’t truly know how much power the N1 and N1X have, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-n1x-soc-leaks-with-the-same-number-of-cuda-cores-as-an-rtx-5070-n1x-specs-align-with-the-gb10-superchip">a Geekbench leak</a> (which has to be taken with a grain of salt; fake specs have been planted there before) suggested the N1X variant may have as many CUDA cores as a desktop RTX 5070 graphics card and 20 CPU cores, like Nvidia’s GB10 “Superchip” in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/798775/nvidia-spark-personal-ai-supercomputer">DGX Spark</a> mini-PC. I’m comfortable sharing that because Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-ceo-confirms-n1-chip-is-actually-gb10-superchip-used-in-dgx-spark">all but confirmed the N1 and GB10</a> are two halves of the same coin.</p><div><p>Nvidia’s Arm PC chips have been a <em>long</em> time coming, but the company has powered consumer devices with Arm before. Every Nintendo Switch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/20/13346004/nintendo-took-the-guts-from-the-nvidia-shield-for-its-new-console">carries an Nvidia Tegra chip</a>, and that Tegra line <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/8/4603612/what-is-the-nvidia-tegra-tab">previously powered tablets</a> up to and including the original <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/23/3540550/microsoft-surface-review">Microsoft Surface RT</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/31/4573596/nvidia-shield-review">Nvidia’s one-off Shield handheld</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935215/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review-streaming-stick-dolby-vision-4k-price-specs-features">Shield TV</a> set-top-boxes. These ones are built in collaboration with MediaTek, though.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/867056/leak-nvidia-n1-n1x-laptops-lenovo-dell]]></content:encoded>
