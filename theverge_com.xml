Originally $99, the set is just $64.99 at <a href="http://amazon.com/dp/B0D54JZTHY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fapple-airtag-4-pack-silver%2FJJGCQ8XFQH" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirTag-4-Pack%2F5395277557%2F6%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D501107745824%26wl4%3Dpla-394283752452%26wl5%3D9032935%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D8175035%26wl11%3Dlocal%26wl12%3D5395277557%26veh%3Dsem_LIA%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds%26gad_source%3D1%26gad_campaignid%3D12420145346%26gbraid%3D0AAAAADmfBIo6-B__5pHc4EA7I7AmFHdlA%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjwrc7GBhCfARIsAHGcW5VOHMiGj55p-TqoT4k5oU4soWmYrdCbNL2ckyngZy2eAYqQOdsW42kaAvGREALw_wcB" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a> ahead of Prime Big Deal Days. It’s nearly matching the best deal yet (missing the mark by a mere 50 cents), and the four-pack hasn’t been this affordable since July. AirTags are a great companion for iPhone users, and they allow for accurate, reliable tracking of your belongings. You can slide one into your purse, luggage, or gaming handheld case to keep tabs on their location. They features a built-in speaker, plus a user-replaceable battery.</p><p>The AirTag is equipped with an ultra wideband chip that makes locating it simple via the Find My network. In most cases, the iPhone it’s associated with should provide precise directions to recovering it, in case you lose track of it.</p><div><p id="other-deals-youll-dig"><h2>Other deals you’ll dig</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>The <strong>Playdate</strong> is a funky gaming handheld. In case you haven’t heard of it before, it’s a tiny gadget that operates with two buttons, a D-pad, and a crank. Yep, a crank, much like you’d find on a fishing pole. It’s a design choice that has led to an eclectic catalog of games, most of which you won’t find anywhere else. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/789734/game-consoles-too-expensive">Consoles are expensive right now</a>, and this one’s no exception. However, Panic (maker of Playdate and publisher of several games) is hosting a <a href="https://play.date/shop/fall-bundle/">fall bundle</a> that includes two Playdate consoles and two covers for $449. It’s a discount of $77 — they’re typically $249 each, including the cover. We’ve been extensively following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23733264/panic-playdate-handheld-gameboy-season-one-two">the rollout of Playdate games here</a>.</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>In case you’ve been wanting to increase the storage size of your Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally on the cheap, you can do just that at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1835939-REG%2Fcrucial_ct2000p310ssd2_p310_2tb_pcie_gen4.html" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H Photo</a> with its deal on <strong>Crucial’s 2TB 2230-sized SSD</strong>. Originally $239.99, it’s down to $121.99 for a limited time. While some newer gaming handhelds (including the Asus ROG Xbox Ally) can utilize the full-size M2 2280 SSDs, this is a great, inexpensive options for ones that can only accommodate the tinier size.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/792702/logitech-mx-master-4-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
