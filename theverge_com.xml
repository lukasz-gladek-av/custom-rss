The upgraded game will arrive on January 15th, 2026, offering 4K visuals on TV, mouse controls, and an in-game megaphone that uses the Switch 2’s built-in microphone. It will cost $64.99 but will also be available as an upgrade pack for $4.99 if you already have the game for the first-gen Switch.</p><p>When the enhanced title launches, you’ll be able to use the mouse controls on the right Joy-Con 2 controller to decorate indoors, create custom designs, and write bulletin board messages, while the megaphone will allow you to locate villagers by calling their name. Additionally, <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> will also offer support for online gameplay with up to 12 other Switch 2 players, as well as the ability to use a webcam.</p><p>There’s a free <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> upgrade coming to all Switch and Switch 2 players on January 15th, too. That includes access to a new resort hotel owned by Kapp’n’s family, as well as a feature from the mole that we love to hate, Resetti, who will offer a “reset service” to clean your island.</p><p>Some other additions include a home storage upgrade option that lets you keep up to 9,000 items — including trees, shrubs, and flowers — and new Nintendo-themed items that you can collect in-game. Switch Online players can also design and save up to three islands when playing with friends, and play select Nintendo titles in-game when interacting with Nintendo console items.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/809975/animal-crossing-new-horizons-is-getting-a-big-switch-2-upgrade-in-january]]></content:encoded>
