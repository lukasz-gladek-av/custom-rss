            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/10/24318367/valve-refurbished-steam-deck-oled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Steam Deck OLED, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">the best version of Valve’s gaming handheld</a> with additional battery life, a slight increase to performance, and an eye-popping screen, can now be purchased refurbished for $110 less than it costs brand-new. </p><p>Valve has just begun <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsale%2Fsteamdeckrefurbished%2F">selling certified refurbished Steam Deck OLED models</a> starting at $439 in the US, UK, Canada, and EU. That buys you the 512GB model with a glossy screen, while the 1TB anti-glare model can be had for $519 — less than the $549 you’d pay to get even the 512GB model brand-new. (The 1TB model normally costs $649.) </p><p>Like my colleague Jay Peters just told me in Verge Slack, “$439 is a steal for the OLED.” Valve doesn’t currently have stock of refurbished LCD models, though they can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/19/24135233/value-steam-deck-deal-sale">be as cheap as $279</a>.</p><p>Like Valve’s refurbished versions of the original LCD model, which has a slightly smaller and slower screen, Valve says it gives each unit “an extensive examination involving over 100 tests at one of Valve’s facilities,” including a battery health check, and Valve says they’ll “meet or even exceed the performance standards” of brand-new units. They each come with a carrying case, refurbished power supply, and one-year warranty — but they may have “minor cosmetic blemishes.”</p><p>Valve introduced the Steam Deck OLED in November 2023, and a year later, it’s still one of the very best ways to play PC games on the go. No other handheld has surpassed its ease of use, though <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">the Asus ROG Ally X</a> did finally meet or beat it in battery life while offering better performance. </p><p>While lots of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579493/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc">other Windows handhelds</a> are on the way, and maybe even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr">some other intriguing hardware from Valve</a>, the company’s been pretty clear it won’t release a new Steam Deck soon — not till newer chips let it offer a big leap in performance without sacrificing battery life. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
