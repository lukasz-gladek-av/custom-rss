However, few of them are quite as innovative as last year’s <strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282953/turtle-beach-may-have-a-better-way-to-swap-your-controllers-analog-sticks-for-more-buttons">Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot</a></strong>, which is now on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DJTJDN73/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fturtle-beach-stealth-pivot-wireless-smart-pc-gaming-controller-with-rotating-modules-black%2FJXK5HFZJF7%2Fsku%2F6606997" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> for an all-time low of $99.99 ($40 off).</p></div><p>The defining feature of the Stealth Pivot doesn’t lie with its drift-free Hall effects sticks or its built-in social notifications — though, those are nice additions. The controller’s main selling factor is a pair of rotating modules, which, when depressed and swiveled, turn an otherwise traditional button and thumbstick layout into one better fit for tackling retro titles and fighting games. You also get a set of programmable back buttons, adjustable trigger stops for a more customized feel, a 3.5mm jack, and the ability to save up to five distinct profiles on the fly.</p><p>As for compatibility, the Stealth Pivot works wirelessly with PC using the included 2.4GHz wireless transmitter, or via Bluetooth, which also lets you connect it to mobile devices and select smart TVs. Battery life is limited to about 20 hours per charge, though you can also use it with Xbox consoles via a wired connection, making it even more versatile.</p><div><p id="more-ways-to-save-today"><h2>More ways to save today</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24205955/lego-nintendo-super-mario-yoshi-snes-gaming-sdcc">Lego’s Mario and Yoshi set</a></strong> is currently on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CYM2V9FS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-super-mario-super-mario-world-mario-38-yoshi-nintendo-figure-71438%2F-%2FA-90573772%2F" rel="sponsored">Target</a> for a $103.99 ($26 off), matching its best price to date. The 15-inch, 1,215-piece kit looks to be a pretty faithful recreation of the 16-bit sprites used in <em>Super Mario World</em>, which, with the help of a hand crank, move to replicate Yoshi’s original running animation. It’s pretty clever, even if the 2D creation will spend most of the time on your shelf with its various mechanisms hidden from view.</span></li><li><span><strong>Bose’s Ultra Open Earbuds</strong>, which are a somewhat hard sell at $299, are a lot more appealing now that they’re on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Immersive-Wireless-OpenAudio-Awareness/dp/B0CPFV77W4/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fbose-ultra-open-ear-true-wireless-open-earbuds-black%2FJ7C5V6T3CX%2Fsku%2F6568949%2F" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> for an all-time low of $199.99. The unique open-style earbuds leverage the company’s OpenAudio technology to direct sound toward your ears while keeping your canals unobstructed, allowing them to deftly blend music with your daily life. They’re extremely comfortable and easy to control, too, though the trade-off for total awareness means you’re going to be giving up some of that low-end oomph in the process. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24073019/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review">Read our review</a>.</span></li><li><span>If you’re a Pixel phone owner who prioritizes their phone above all else, <strong>Google’s Pixel Flex Fast Charger</strong> is now available from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FGNHN2HX/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle-pixel-flex-dual-port-67-w-usb-c-wall-charger%2F" rel="sponsored">Verizon</a> for $35.99 ($24 off), its lowest price to date. The 67W wall charger is outfitted with two USB-C ports; however, unlike rival chargers, Google’s first-party oblong offering can prioritize Pixel phones when charging two devices simultaneously, ensuring your phone is topped off before other electronics.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzA1"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandon Widder</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/881030/turtle-beach-stealth-pivot-controller-lego-mario-yoshi-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
