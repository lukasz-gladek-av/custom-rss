In fact, it seems <a href="https://valm.qq.com/act/a20250312preregister/?e_code=547223">pre-registration for a playtest of <em>Valorant Mobile</em></a> is already open to Chinese players, <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2025/04/valorant-mobile-pre-registration-is-now-open-in-china">spotted <em>Esports Insider</em></a>. </p></div><p>Riot Games first said it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22458279/valorant-mobile-spinoff-riot-games">creating a mobile version of <em>Valorant</em> in 2021</a>, and the previously PC-only game launched on Xbox Series X / S and PS5 consoles <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24211812/valorant-console-launch-xbox-series-s-x-ps5-download">last August</a>. Chinese studio LightSpeed is handling development, but there’s no indication of when <em>Valorant Mobile </em>will get a release in other countries as the post only says it’s “starting in China and taking it from there.” According to <em>Esports Insider</em>, the company has already done some playtesting in the country, and those who register for the new test can earn exclusive player cards via in-game missions. The outlet links to two unlisted videos, including a trailer for the game.</p><p>The announcement follows a trend of big-name shooters like <em>Call of Duty</em> getting mobile releases that stretches back a few years. LightSpeed also developed mobile versions of <em>PUBG </em>and <em>Apex Legends</em>, the latter of which shut down in 2023.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
