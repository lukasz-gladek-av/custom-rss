Bubble Season starts April 29th and will include a new area, new activities, and, of course, new (and returning) outfits. But the biggest addition is one that fans have been asking for since launch: co-op. Check out the trailer above.</p><p>In the new season you’ll be able to have dress-up adventures with a friend in two player co-op mode. You can travel the world of<em> Infinity Nikki </em>together, solving special co-op mode puzzle games and participating in escort missions. Players will also prove they’re the most stylish one in the group chat with a fashion runway and new interactions that players can use in all the photos they’re going to take. </p><p>Like every new <em>Infinity Nikki</em> season, there will be special outfits to collect – though none of them inspire in me the kind of fanaticism that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619372/infinity-nikki-eerie-season-event-march-2025">the cowgirl outfit</a> from two seasons ago did. (Which I did get without spending any money. Hooray!) For the first time though, <em>IN</em> is also bringing back outfits from previous seasons for players who missed out on them and for newbies to build up their wardrobe quickly. </p><div><p>Speaking of wardrobe,<em> Infinity Nikk</em>i is catching up to the MMO girlies by implementing a new dye system. In Bubble Season, players will be able to use dyes to change the color of their outfits the same way one can in <em>World of Warcraft</em> and <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>. No word on exactly how dyes will work or if they will be yet more things to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/605811/infinity-nikki-gacha-mechanics">spend your precious currency on</a>. But I am interested in the potential of getting new colors for my clothes without the hassle of the current system, which involves the expensive and time consuming process of collecting duplicate outfits.</p><p>Bubble Season starts April 29th and if you’re one of the folks waiting for the game to come to PC, the Steam version of<em> Infinity Nikki </em>launches that day too.</p></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/656169/wd-black-c50-xbox-storage-card-m4-macbook-air-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Maybe, like me, you bought the Xbox Series S with 512GB of storage and realized, after installing <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6,</em> that you don’t have much (or any) space left for any other games. And maybe, like me, you had to hunt for another drive so you could install other games to play.</p><p>If you’re still in that boat, you might want to consider Western Digital’s 2TB WD_Black NVMe solid state drive. It’s currently on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DK74LG91/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon for an all-time low of $179.99</a> ($50 off), or about 22 percent off the standard price, and will provide you with plenty of additional storage to work with. To put the price in perspective, it’s only $30 more than the 1TB version, which isn’t on sale. WD is also one of two manufacturers I’m aware of that make these easy plug-in cards — the other is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/5/23712516/xbox-expansion-cards-seagate-price-cut-deal-sale">Seagate</a>.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->180</span></p><div><p>Western Digital’s storage expansion cards for Xbox Series X / S consoles are speedy, plug-and-play cards that match the performance of the consoles’ onboard SSDs. They offer a slightly lower-cost alternative to Seagate’s expansion cards, which were the only game in town for years.</p></div></div><p>There’s no fiddling around with screws or anything to get it to work, either. Just pop it into the back of your Xbox Series S / X, and bam, you’re good to go. Plug and play at its finest, baby.</p><p>But let’s pivot to another good deal real quick.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZD9S5GC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1883962-REG%2Fapple_mw123ll_a_13_macbook_air_m4.html%2FkZa17940ZSRrfIj%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjw5azABhD1ARIsAA0WFUGYcUxik6ZHlmds-QlwCWAQgyNHflK_dp8WpOc1Xjs6EEW8YhjAkFcaArdXEALw_wcB" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H Photo</a> are also selling Apple’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/627186/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-15-inch-2025-laptop-review">brand-new M4 MacBook Air</a>, which just launched in March, starting at $899 (its best price to date). That’s $100 off Apple’s starting price of $999, which itself is already $100 cheaper than the entry-level price of the M3 model last year.</p><p>And, with the M4, you get 256GB of starting storage instead of 128GB, which is probably fine for most folks who don’t need a lot of local storage. Like me, for example. I’m using an M2 MacBook Air for work, and I only have 82GB used.</p><p>The latest M4 model also has a better 12-megapixel Center Stage camera that will follow your face around while you’re on camera (better said: it’ll keep you in frame) and 16GB of RAM. The design is unchanged from last year, which means you’re still getting just a MagSafe charger and two USB-C ports. But the update to M4 allows you to add two external monitors while also leaving the display open, for a total of three running screens. Good for multitasking.</p><p>It’s a MacBook Air. It’s the best MacBook for most people. You really can’t go wrong here.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
