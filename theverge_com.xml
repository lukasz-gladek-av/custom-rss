You’ll also get a new shield that lets you run into projectiles that you can absorb as energy and then throw back toward your enemies.</p><p>Housemarque is also introducing an unlockable “Second Chance” ability that lets you come back to life after you die, which could be useful for what looks to be a very difficult game. There are other new permanent-progression systems added to the game, too.</p><p><em>Saros</em> was initially announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/611627/sony-playstation-5-ps5-saros-housemarquestudio-housemarque">earlier this year</a>, and at the time, Sony only provided a 2026 release date.
