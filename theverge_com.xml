            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister">Sean Hollister</a> <span>is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Yesterday, I mentioned how GPD is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/713576/gpd-win-5-ryzen-ai-max-395-strix-halo-tease">teasing the most potent handheld yet made</a> — a GPD Win 5 that will house the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chip, with AMD’s most powerful integrated graphics yet, inside a PlayStation Vita-shaped machine.</p><p>If you’ve been wondering how that huge chip could even fit, handheld expert Cary “The Phawx” Golumb <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udFaxaVvtQs">now has the answer</a>: the 7-inch handheld will apparently have no internal battery taking up space. The Win 5 is designed to either be plugged into the wall, with a gaming laptop sized 180-watt charger providing the juice — or powered by a big 80 watt-hour external battery “backpack” that will (only? additionally?) be sold separately.</p><p>We can see the full spec sheet for the new Win 5 in the Phawx’s video, and as he notes, GPD had to make its Win 5 larger than the Win 4<em> even before</em> you add that backpack battery.</p><p>While the Win 4 is a compact 6-inch handheld with a 45 watt-hour pack, the Win 5 with its 7-inch screen will be narrower but thicker than the Asus ROG Ally X handheld — which is an apt comparison, considering that handheld similarly pairs a 7-inch screen with an 80 watt-hour battery pack.</p><p>Here, though, the battery will add extra girth: it’s roughly 4 inches (110mm) wide and tall, and 0.7 inches (18mm) deep; it’s not clear how it attaches yet, as GPD has only shared the one dark video of the Win 5 filmed from the front, but the spec sheet mentions a “Battery to Host Dedicated Connector<strong>” </strong>as an accessory, so it might require plugging in a cable.</p><p>If you’re curious what the handheld’s controls might look like in better light, I tried brightening it up:</p><p>Other intriguing things we can see in the full spec sheet include:</p><div><ul><li><span>A 120Hz variable refresh rate screen, where the Win 4 was limited to 60Hz</span></li><li><span>Two configs: AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 (16C/32T/ Radeon 8060S) or AI Max 385 (8C/16T/ Radeon 8050S)</span></li><li><span>32, 64, or even the full 128GB of unified memory AMD offers for these chips</span></li><li><span>USB-4 with 100W PD charging and 8K/60 DP output</span></li><li><span>Two fans and four heat pipes for cooling</span></li><li><span>An optional HDMI and USB dock with a “battery charging slot,” presumably for the external battery</span></li><li><span>No mention of any integrated keyboard, whereas previous Win devices had a hidden keyboard underneath a sliding screen</span></li></ul></div><p>You can peruse the whole sheet at your leisure in the Phawx’s video or the screenshots we took from Phawx (with his permission) below. Be sure to tap a couple of times to make them large enough for full reading.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/714294/gpd-win-5-strix-halo-specs-revealed]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/brandt-ranj">Brandt Ranj</a> <span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/brandt-ranj">Brandt Ranj</a> is a commerce reporter for <em>The Verge </em>writing about the best deals and gadgets. He previously wrote for <em>Business Insider, Rolling Stone, </em><em>Futurism, </em>and <em>Popular Science.</em></span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Perhaps we’ve been thinking the same thing, you and I. That there won’t be a long-standing drought of Nintendo Switch 2 availability after all. The console has been easy to buy online from several retailers this week, including <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fswitch-2-system-nintendo-switch-2%2F6614313.p%3F" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-2-console%2F-%2FA-94693225" rel="sponsored">Target</a>, and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-2-System%2F15949610846%3F" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-2-System/dp/B0F3GWXLTS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, which didn’t sell the Switch 2 at launch, is currently selling it by invitation only.</p><p>The console’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/654571/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-issues-problems">messy preorder process</a> and spotty launch availability made it feel a little like late 2020 all over again, when the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Nvidia RTX 30-series GPUs launched in extremely limited quantities due to component shortages. However, Nintendo appears to have adjusted the right dials to boost production quickly enough to meet US demand. The company reportedly delayed the Switch 2’s planned late-2024 launch to build up stock, according to <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUF196OV0Z10C24A2000000/"><em>Nikkei</em></a> (translated by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switch-2-is-targeting-march-2025-and-was-delayed-to-avoid-shortages-new-report-claims/"><em>VGC</em></a>). If that’s true, that decision seems to have paid off for customers.</p><p>The increased flow of consoles seemed to coincide with the launch of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></em>, Nintendo’s latest Switch 2 exclusive. By then, the Switch 2 had already set sales records, becoming the fastest selling game hardware in US history, according to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37i6gok2k">details from marketing firm Circana</a>. Nintendo sold <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712362/nintendo-switch-2-june-2025-sales">1.6 million units</a> within its first month in the US alone (it sold <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">a record 3.5 million consoles</a> globally in its first four days). That’s impressive, considering how much skepticism there was about whether <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/650982/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-price-fair">its high $449.99 price</a> ($499.99 if you want a bundle with <em>Mario Kart World</em>) would turn away would-be buyers<em>.</em></p><p>If stock were still tough to come by, we’d be anticipating some kind of update on the matter during Nintendo’s upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/schedule/index.html">August 1st earning’s call</a>. But, thankfully, people across the country can now just buy one online without stressing about it.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandt Ranj</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/713828/nintendo-switch-in-stock-best-buy-amazon-target-walmart]]></content:encoded>
