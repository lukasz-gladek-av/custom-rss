            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo’s first-party <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> can’t be beaten when it comes to its breadth of features and comfort. But at $89.99, let’s be real, it’s way too expensive for most people. Thankfully, a controller I’ve been testing recently, which is nearly as good despite lacking a 3.5mm audio jack, is currently on sale for $40 less. The <strong>EasySMX S10</strong>, as it’s called, is available for $50.39 from <a href="https://www.easysmx.com/products/easysmx-s10-gaming-controller-for-switch-2-tmr-sticks-hd-rumble-motion-control">EasySMX</a> with code <strong>GETS10</strong>.</p><p>The S10 is comfortable to use for long gaming sessions, and it has features that aren’t commonly built into third-party gamepads, including amiibo support and rumble that feels like it’s in the same ballpark as Nintendo’s HD rumble. It can also remotely wake the Nintendo Switch 2, not just the original Switch, from standby.</p><p>The S10 would be easier to recommend than Nintendo’s Switch 2 Pro Controller even if they were the same price, since EasySMX’s model features accurate, power-efficient TMR joysticks, plus some satisfyingly clicky buttons and triggers (note: these are divisive, you might not like them as much as I do). But at $40 less, you don’t need to feel bad about getting this instead of Nintendo’s official gamepad. Take that leftover money and treat yourself to something nice instead.</p><p>If you’re an Android user looking for an unobtrusive Bluetooth tracker for your wallet, Ugreen just launched the <strong>FineTrack Slim Smart G</strong>. It’s just 1.7mm thick (approximately the thickness of two credit cards), letting it to sit next to your other cards without sticking out, and its built-in battery can last for up to five years. For its launch, Ugreen has knocked $2 off the $25.99 tracker, dropping it to $23.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-FineTrack-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Ultra-Slim/dp/B0FBWBDB1Q/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>.</p><p>The downside is that it can’t be charged, so you’ll need to dispose of it and buy a new tracker once those five years are up. That stinks, but its specs mean it should provide a pretty good five years of service. It features a built-in 80db alarm to help you find it via Google’s Find Hub network, after all, along with IP68 protection against dust and water. Just keep in mind that, if it’s submerged, you won’t be able to track it.</p><p>Now through October 5th, OnePlus has a few back-to-college deals up its sleeve that everyone can enjoy, whether you’re a student or not. The one that caught my eye is the 43mm <strong>OnePlus Watch 3</strong>, which is available for $269.99 ($30 off) from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FDK2QHGH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://onepluscom.pxf.io/c/482924/916678/12532?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fus%2Fbuy-oneplus-watch-3-43mm" rel="sponsored">OnePlus</a> (with coupon code <strong>HARVEST</strong>). The Wear OS 5-equipped smartwatch has gone on sale before, but after a nearly month-long period when it wasn’t discounted, it’s returned to its second-best price to date.</p><p>If you’re shopping for an Android watch, we recommend including OnePlus’ latest wearable on your shortlist. Outside of Samsung’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/715171/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review-smartwatch-wearos-antioxidant-gemini">recent Galaxy Watch 8 series</a>, the OnePlus Watch 3 is one of the newest models available. It offers a better value than its predecessor, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24132998/one-plus-watch-2-review-smartwatches-wearables">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, with updated software, a rotating crown, an enhanced GPS antenna, and a suite of new health features.</p><div><p id="other-deals-we-loved-from-this-week"><h2>Other deals we loved from this week</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Nintendo’s tappable <strong>amiibos</strong> are an expensive hobby, as most figures for the Switch and Switch 2 usually cost between $15 and $40 each. However, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fpmid%3D30583%26ranSiteID%3Dy9ozrjBcgg8-njoLbLY2R42D6nlyOmcg0Q" rel="sponsored">GameStop</a> recently did collectors and trinket enjoyers a favor by slashing prices on a handful of models, which start at just $5.99 a pop. Not just that, some of the newer ones that debuted alongside the Switch 2 (including ones from <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> series and <em>Street Fighter 6</em>) are down to $15.99 at <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fpmid%3D30584" rel="sponsored">GameStop</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=amiibo&amp;rh=p_n_deal_type%3A23566065011&amp;dc&amp;crid=220URFJ8W3DBG&amp;qid=1758548483&amp;rnid=23566063011&amp;sprefix=amiibo%2Caps%2C124&amp;ref=sr_nr_p_n_deal_type_1&amp;ds=v1%3A%2Bg%2BMR7wxIGaD3Vs3%2FhljWFmfTc%2BhMQqdAdiXGyIg5Mc&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> — over half off their original price.</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>We highlighted the Prime-exclusive deal on <strong>Kindle Unlimited</strong> last weekend, but it’s worth sharing again in case you missed it. If you sign into your Prime account ahead of Amazon’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/783008/amazon-october-prime-day-sale-best-early-deals-2025">October Prime Day event</a>, which starts on October 7th, you’ll be able to sign up for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku/ref=2025?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">a free three-month trial</a> of Kindle Unlimited. After your free trial period ends, you’ll be charged $11.99 a month unless you cancel the service. Kindle Unlimited is filled with many, many titles you can read for no extra charge, so if you’re a voracious reader, this is a fabulous deal that costs nothing to redeem.</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>If you’re a PC gamer with a taste for spooky games, you might have already dipped into several titles from Remedy Entertainment’s catalog, including <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc">Alan Wake 2</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20832997/control-review-creators-thriller-ps4-xbox-pc">Control</a></em>, and others. But if you haven’t yet tried them, there’s an affordable way to go all-in, as <strong><a href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/482924/2091208/25796?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fremedy-games-30th-anniversary-bundle" rel="sponsored">Humble is offering a nine-game bundle</a></strong> for just $27. Getting <em>Alan Wake 2</em> (redeemable via the Epic Games Store) at that price would be a steal on its own, but you also get <em>Control Ultimate Edition</em>, <em>Quantum Break</em>, <em>Alan Wake Remastered</em>, <em>Max Payne</em>, <em>Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne</em>, and more. The step-up tier of the bundle also includes a 25 percent off coupon for <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/689333/fbc-firebreak-review-xbox-ps5-steam">FBC: Firebreak</a></em>, Remedy’s cooperative first-person shooter set in the <em>Control </em>universe.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/786564/nintendo-switch-2-easysmx-controller-oneplus-watch-3-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
