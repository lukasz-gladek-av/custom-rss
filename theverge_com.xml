He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Epic Games is making some big changes to its store to provide an enticing alternative to Apple’s in-app purchases for developers. The company is announcing the changes less than a day after a major court ruling that mandates that Apple can’t collect fees on purchases made outside of apps or restrict how they point to off-platform payments, meaning that more developers may choose to direct users to other payment options.</p><p>Beginning in June, Epic says that for any payments processed via the Epic Games Store, developers will pay a zero percent revenue share – meaning developers themselves will keep all of their revenue – “on their first $1,000,000 in revenue per app per year,” <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/new-epic-games-store-webshops-and-revenue-share-update">according to a blog post</a>. After that, Epic’s typical 88 / 12 percent revenue share will kick in. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction">Apple</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars">Google</a> offer a lowered commission rate on sales below $1 million, too, but only to 15 percent versus Epic’s zero. </p><p>Also beginning in June, Epic will launch a new feature that lets developers launch Epic Games Store-hosted “webshops.” These webshops “can offer players out-of-app purchases as a more cost-effective alternative to in-app purchases, where Apple, Google, and others charge exorbitant fees,” Epic says.</p><p>To incentivize buying things from webshops, Epic says that player spending will accrue 5 percent Epic Rewards “on all their purchases.” <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/features/epic-rewards">Epic Rewards</a> can be applied to future purchases from Epic’s store.</p><div><p>Shortly after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">ruling last night</a>, CEO Tim Sweeney also announced that Epic plans to bring <em>Fortnite</em> back to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659271/fortnite-ios-apple-app-store-us-return">US iOS App Store next week</a>. Apple kicked the game off the App Store <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments">in 2020</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/659575/polygon-vox-media-sold-valnet-gamerant<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Polygon</em>, <em>The Verge’s</em> sister site dedicated to gaming and entertainment, has been sold by Vox Media to Valnet, a company that owns brands like <em>ScreenRant</em>, <em>GameRant</em>, and <em>Android Police</em>. Some <em>Polygon</em> staffers will continue with the publication under its new owner, while others have been laid off, according to posts online and an internal message sent to Vox Media employees.</p><p>Valnet owns more than 27 different brands that cover areas like entertainment, gaming, sports, and travel. A recent report <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/valnet-labor-lawsuit-hassan-youssef-digital-media-sweat-shop/">from <em>TheWrap</em></a> includes one former contributor to a site under Valnet’s purview describing conditions as “almost sweatshop-level.”</p><p>“Perfectly aligned with Valnet’s long-term growth strategy, <em>Polygon</em> will now integrate Valnet’s Gaming Portfolio, which includes industry-leading publications such as <em>Game Rant</em>, <em>TheGamer</em>, <em>Fextralife</em>, <em>OpenCritic</em>, <em>DualShockers</em>, and <em>HardcoreGamer</em>,” <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250501630767/en/Valnet-Acquires-Premium-Gaming-Publication-Polygon-from-Vox-Media">the company said in a press release</a>. “This addition follows Valnet’s recent acquisition of <em>FextraLife</em> earlier this year, further strengthening its position in the gaming media landscape. With Valnet’s proven operational excellence, <em>Polygon</em> is poised to reach new editorial heights through focused investment and innovation.”</p><p>Vox Media CEO Jim Bankoff said in a statement that “this transaction will enable us to focus our energies and investment resources in other priority areas of growth across our portfolio of iconic digital publications and audio / video programming, while enabling Valnet to grow their leadership and authority in the gaming information category.” In his message to staff, Bankoff also cited the current “uncertain economic outlook” and broader changes in the gaming industry as contributing reasons to the sale.</p><p>“I’m no longer with Polygon,” says former <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plante.bsky.social/post/3lo4mn4noqc26">editor-in-chief Chris Plante</a>. “If you’re hiring, please consider the many talented writers and editors now on the market. Every one of them deserves a spot on your staff. I won’t be talking more about the sale because I wasn’t involved.”</p><p>We’ve collected additional posts from some affected staffers below.</p><p><em><strong>Update, May 1st</strong>: Added posts from more Polygon staffers.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
