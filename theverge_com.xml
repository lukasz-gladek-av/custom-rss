            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24290671/sega-classic-games-delisted<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega is planning to delist a lot of its classic games from digital storefronts as of December 6th at 11:59PM PT.</p><p>Steam will be affected the most, losing 62 titles including <em>Crazy Taxi</em>, <em>Dr. Robotnik’s Mean Bean Machine</em>, <em>Jet Set Radio, NiGHTS into Dreams, </em>and<em> Sonic 3D Blast.</em> Sega is pulling 12 titles from the Xbox store. The Nintendo eShop and the PlayStation Store will “just” lose <em>SEGA Genesis Classics — </em>but that title includes more than 50 old Genesis games, so it still means a lot will be unavailable. You can see the full lists of what’s getting pulled on <a href="https://support.sega.com/hc/en-us/articles/29776767664145-SEGA-Classics-FAQ#h_01JBWBD2TRQDGP79RFEAY1YVBZ">a Sega support page</a>.</p><p>Any games that you have purchased will still be available to download and play after they’re delisted from the storefronts, so if you’ve had your eye on any of them, you might want to buy them before they’re gone.</p><p>The delistings are happening ahead of Sega’s planned reboots for <em>Jet Set Radio</em>,&nbsp;<em>Shinobi</em>, <em>Golden Axe</em>,&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi</em>, but those revivals aren’t expected <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2023/12/7/23992993/sega-is-bringing-back-some-classics">anytime soon</a>. And it wouldn’t be the first time Sega has delisted games ahead of releasing them in a different form: the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/26/23043398/sega-pulls-classic-sonic-the-hedgehog-games-digital-stores-origins">pulled the vast majority of classic <em>Sonic</em> games</a> from digital stores&nbsp;before it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/20/23033583/sonic-origins-sega-hedgehog-ps5-xbox">launched <em>Sonic Origins</em></a>.</p><p>Hopefully, the games getting removed in December will be available to buy again at some point down the line — keeping video game classics alive <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23850347/video-game-preservation">is already hard enough</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
