The <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250925.html">company says</a> the game is a spinoff of the series and “introduces a new style of battles featuring role-playing and social deduction.”</p><p>The company’s description of the game indicates that <em>Shadows</em> will have <em>Among Us</em>-like elements of treachery:</p><div><blockquote><p>One of the three allies participating in each battle is secretly a treacherous disciple of shadow. Players choose to take on the role of either a disciple of light, aiming to find their way through the labyrinth, or a disciple of shadow.</p><p>After the initial battle, players vote to determine who they believe is the treacherous disciple of shadow. The outcome of the vote affects whether the next battle is more favorable or more challenging. Whether the disciples of light can correctly discover the traitor—or the disciple of shadow can successfully deceive the others—holds the key to how the next battle unfolds.</p></blockquote></div><p>Nintendo says <em>Fire Emblem Shadows</em> is available for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fire-emblem-shadows/id6746113513">iOS</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.nintendo.zaha" rel="sponsored">Android</a>, and while it’s a free-to-play app, it will have optional in-app purchases.</p><p>The company’s other mobile take on <em>Fire Emblem</em>, the gacha-style <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/3/14498896/fire-emblem-heroes-review-android-iphone"><em>Fire Emblem Heroes</em></a>, quickly turned into a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/30/16226118/nintendo-fire-emblem-heroes-interview-iphone-android">big</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21112029/nintendo-mobile-games-revenue-fire-emblem-heroes-mario-run-android-ios">lucrative</a> hit after its 2017 release, and the game still receives regular updates and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JH4D2dJAq3M">new heroes</a>.

He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Podcaster Theo Von and The Pokémon Company probably don’t have a lot in common. But one thing they can apparently agree on is that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) should probably stop using them to promote deportation campaigns.</p><p>The DHS posted a <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1970251208322621530">montage of ICE raids</a> to X on Monday accompanied by the original <em>Pokémon</em> theme song and the caption “Gotta Catch ‘Em All.” The clip also features images from the anime and text overlays using a sort of Temu version of the <em>Pokémon</em> font. A day later, the agency posted a video featuring a viral clip of Theo Von where he stares into the camera and says “<a href="https://x.com/vvsrak/status/1881803443691749635">heard you got deported, dude… bye</a>,” then tacked on stats about how many people had been deported so far under President Donald Trump.</p><p>Both The Pokémon Company and Theo Von objected to DHS using them to promote ICE raids. <a href="https://x.com/theovon/status/1970692062090797341">Von quickly took to X</a>, saying, “Yooo DHS i didnt approve to be used in this. I know you know my address so send a check. And please take this down and please keep me out of your ‘banger’ deportation videos.”</p><p>The statement from The Pokémon Company was, unsurprisingly, a little more diplomatic. “Our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content, and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property,” the company told the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/pokemon-torches-dhs-over-gotta-catch-em-all-ice-raid-stunt/"><em>Daily Beast</em></a>. Fans have taken to social media to <a href="https://x.com/pokeBALLZdeep/status/1970573026711269397">urge</a> The Pokémon Company and Nintendo to <a href="https://x.com/ProXFirefly6/status/1970878963951219005">sue</a>, but at least one legal expert sees that as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/784312/pokemon-lawyers-wont-sue-dhs-for-that-video-former-legal-head-predicts">unlikely</a> — despite the companies’ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248602/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-pocketpair-patent-infringement-lawsuit">notoriously</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">litigious</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660815/nintendo-lawsuit-genki-switch-2-accessories">nature</a>. The Pokémon Company’s ex-legal chief Don McGowan told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-want-pokmon-to-sue-after-department-of-homeland-security-video-uses-ash-ketchum-to-promote-ice-but-the-companys-former-legal-boss-says-he-wouldnt-touch-this"><em>IGN</em></a> that “This will blow over in a couple of days and they’ll be happy to let it.”</p><p>The post featuring Theo Von has since been <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/theo-von-dhs-deportation-video-down.html?utm_source=flipboard.com&amp;utm_medium=social_acct&amp;utm_campaign=feed-part">removed</a>, suggesting that DHS is perhaps a little wary of angering the podcaster’s fan base. The <em>Pokémon </em>clip remains, however, and the Customs and Border Patrol X account even <a href="https://x.com/CBP/status/1970280164442714348">replied</a> with a GIF of Detective Pikachu under the caption “Border Patrol’s newest recruit.”</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/785288/pokemon-theo-von-dhs-ice#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjA5MzU0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Terrence O'Brien</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/785288/pokemon-theo-von-dhs-ice]]></content:encoded>

The studio released a new trailer showing some of the surprisingly bloody superhero gameplay at Sony’s most-recent State of Play showcase. There’s no date yet, but the game — which is called simply <em>Wolverine</em> — is expected to launch on the PS5 in the fall of 2026.</p><p>The game was first announced in 2021 with a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/09/marvels-spider-man-2-and-marvels-wolverine-revealed/">brief cinematic trailer</a>. At the time, Insomniac was pretty vague on the details of the game, but today’s trailer included the following synopsis:</p><div><blockquote><p>Become a living weapon. As he searches for answers about his past, Wolverine will do whatever it takes — unleashing brutal claw combat, violent rage, and relentless determination — to cut through the mystery of the man he used to be.</p></blockquote></div><div><p>In-development footage of the game started making the rounds as part of a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/19/24007570/insomniac-games-hack-wolverine-x-men-ryhsida">massive Insomniac Games leak in 2023</a>.</p></div><p>The game has been particularly anticipated after Insomniac released a trio of excellent Spider-Man games, most recently with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23915605/spider-man-2-review-ps5">Spider-Man 2</a></em> on the PS5 in 2023.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/611201/sony-playstation-5-ps5-wolverine-gameplay-trailer#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/611201/sony-playstation-5-ps5-wolverine-gameplay-trailer]]></content:encoded>
