            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Now that the Switch 2 is out, and the console’s biggest exclusives — <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></em> — are delighting fans, it’s time to see what else this thing can do. Nintendo’s hosting its next Direct presentation on Thursday July 31st bright and early at 9 AM ET. You can watch the direct on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/gZoLrfLcIVg">here</a> and, of course, in the Nintendo Today app.</p><p>According to Nintendo, the 25-minute presentation will be a partner showcase, focusing on third-party titles for the Switch and Switch 2. (Sorry, y’all are gonna have to wait a little longer for more news on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/630255/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-trailer"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a>.)</p><p>A handful of older games are finding new life (and new audiences) on the Switch 2 like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and I expect there will be many more announcements of studios bringing their backlogs to the console. And for new games, <em>Silksong</em>, the long, <em>long</em> awaited sequel to Team Cherry’s <em>Hollow Knight</em> might <em>finally</em> get to see the light of day.</p><p>Last month, rumors from prominent insiders and leakers swirled that a Direct would be announced for the end of the month. They also speculated about what games would be shown which included a<em> Persona 3 Reload</em> port and, of all things, a new <em>Animal Crossing</em>. But we’ll find out for sure what Nintendo will give us next when the presentation airs tomorrow at 9 AM.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/715733/nintendo-direct-annoucement-july-2025-switch-2]]></content:encoded>
