            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/8/24291165/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-stock-sold-out<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>AMD launched its latest <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24288948/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-review-cpu-processor-benchmark-test">Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a> to glowing reviews this week, but if you’re looking to buy one then you might have to wait for more stock. The 9800X3D is currently sold out <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=44583&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Famd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-ryzen-7-9000-series-granite-ridge-zen-5-socket-am5-processor%2Fp%2FN82E16819113877">at Newegg</a> and <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-8-core-16-thread-3-8-ghz-5-2-ghz-max-boost-socket-am5-unlocked-desktop-processor-silver/6606318.p?skuId=6606318">Best Buy</a>, with the majority of <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/687907/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-granite-ridge-am5-470ghz-8-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included">Micro Center</a> locations also sold out of AMD’s best gaming processor.</p><p>The situation is similar across Europe, too. In Germany most retailers have <a href="https://x.com/3DCenter_org/status/1854705891209363749">run out of stock</a>, with new shipments not expected to arrive until later this month. In the UK <a href="https://www.scan.co.uk/products/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-am5-zen-5-8-core-16-thread-47ghz-52ghz-turbo-104mb-cache-pcie-50-120w-cpu">Scan</a> is accepting preorders for the 9800X3D, but stock won’t arrive until November 29th. <a href="https://www.overclockers.co.uk/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-eight-core-5.20ghz-socket-am5-processor-retail-pro-amd-03517.html">Overclockers</a> in the UK says its stock is currently held at UK customs and that its first and second shipments are allocated and sold out. It’s not expecting another shipment until December.</p><p>AMD computing and graphics boss Jack Huynh shared <a href="https://x.com/JackMHuynh/status/1854633605785424306">photos on X</a> of people lining up for the 9800X3D at retailers, while AMD CEO Lisa Su <a href="https://x.com/LisaSu/status/1854588860203745312">has been signing</a> some of the CPUs for “some special partners.” Naturally, scalpers are trying to take advantage of the low stock situation with some 9800X3D <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_nkw%3D9800X3D%26_sacat%3D0%26_sop%3D15">listings on eBay</a> asking as much as $999 instead of the $479 retail price of the CPU.</p><p>While there’s bound to be some pent-up demand for the 9800X3D after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220250/amd-zen-5-cpu-reviews-ryzen-9-9950x">disappointment of Zen 5 desktop CPUs</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278407/intel-ultra-9-285k-benchmarks-performance-hands-on">Intel’s Core Ultra 9 285K</a>, it’s clear AMD doesn’t have enough stock of this new CPU for its launch period. The 9800X3D launch timing came as a surprise,  arriving less than three months after AMD introduced its first Zen 5 desktop CPUs in August. AMD didn’t introduce its Zen 4 X3D parts until five months after the Ryzen 9 7950X was first released in September 2022, with the 7800X3D arriving nearly seven months later.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
