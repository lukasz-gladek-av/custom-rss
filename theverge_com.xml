That puts the audio near your ears while you’re wearing it, and in my brief time trying the device at Valve’s headquarters recently, I thought the sound was just fine. But the choice to have those dual drivers also helps reduce audio vibrations, which helps the headset with tracking while you’re playing games in VR, Valve hardware engineer Jeremy Selan tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>The Frame, like many other VR headsets, uses outward-facing cameras built into the main part of the headset for tracking. However, audio with good bass “induces vibrations into the headset,” which can affect that tracking, according to Selan. But on the Frame’s included head strap, the dual drivers per side are “mounted opposite to each other,” which creates “vibration cancellation inherent in the design.” That allows for “better tracking, even with good audio,” Selan says.</p><div><div><p id="we-answered-your-burning-questions-about-valves-new-hardware"><h2>We answered your burning questions about Valve’s new hardware.</h2></p></div><div><blockquote><p>We hosted a subscriber-exclusive AMA about the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller, and you can check out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818113/valve-steam-frame-machine-controller-vr-headset-pc-ask-us-anything-ama">our responses here</a>.</p></blockquote></div></div><p>Pretty cool! The headset is modular, too, so theoretically, you might be able to use other head straps with other audio solutions later.

It’s called foveated streaming, and it means the headset requests a higher-quality image for the content that’s right in front of your eyes while lowering the resolution of your peripheral vision to reduce bandwidth and processing demands.</p><p>The headset relies on a couple pieces of hardware to make that happen. The first is a dedicated wireless streaming adapter that sends games from a PC to the headset. The second is a pair of eye-tracking cameras inside the headset that follow where you’re looking. If you’re familiar with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/22/12260430/nvidia-foveated-rendering-vr-graphics-smi-eye-tracking-siggraph">foveated rendering</a>, which headsets like Apple’s Vision Pro deploy for on-device processing, it’s a similar idea.</p><p>Valve tells <em>The Verge</em> that foveated streaming won’t be exclusive to the Frame. While it’s currently optimized for the Steam Frame, foveated streaming can work with “any headset that supports eye tracking” and that is “compatible with our Steam Link streaming app,” according to hardware engineer Jeremy Selan.</p><div><div><p id="we-answered-your-burning-questions-about-valves-new-hardware"><h2>We answered your burning questions about Valve’s new hardware.</h2></p></div><div><blockquote><p>We hosted a subscriber-exclusive AMA about the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller, and you can check out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818113/valve-steam-frame-machine-controller-vr-headset-pc-ask-us-anything-ama">our responses here</a>.</p></blockquote></div></div><p>I’ve seen foveated streaming in action myself, and it’s extremely impressive. While playing <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> on a Steam Frame streamed from a nearby PC with that dedicated 6GHz wireless streaming adapter, I honestly couldn’t tell that the game wasn’t running locally on the headset. While Valve hasn’t specified when foveated streaming might be available on other headsets or which might be able to use it, I’m glad to hear that owners of other VR headsets will be able to use the feature to play their games.</p><p>It doesn’t sound like Valve has plans for other VR headsets to be able to take advantage of the wireless adapter, though. “Supporting the wireless adapter is more difficult without lower-level OS support, as we have with SteamOS,” Selan says.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/817993/valve-vr-steam-frame-foveated-streaming-rendering-link]]></content:encoded>
