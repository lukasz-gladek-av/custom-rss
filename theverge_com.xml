The game has the same premise as the original PC title, where you’re tasked with expanding your empire as historic leaders from across the globe.</p><p>But the Apple Arcade version offers touch controls, along with mouse and controller support on macOS and iOS, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sid-meiers-civilization-vii/id6744373452">according to its App Store listing</a>. There are some limitations, though, as <em>Civilization VII Arcade Edition</em> won’t support multiplayer at launch, and also won’t receive any of the downloadable content you’d get on PC and other platforms. You can also only choose large and huge map sizes on devices with more than 8GB of RAM.</p><p>Along with the addition of <em>Civilization VII</em>, Apple Arcade is adding <em>Retrocade</em> to its library, which offers access to classic titles like <em>Asteroids</em>, <em>Bubble Bobble</em>, <em>Centipede</em>, and <em>Galaga</em> on the Apple Vision Pro, iPhone, and iPad. You’ll also find the rhythm game <em>Felicity’s Door</em> and the puzzle game <em>I Love Hue Too+</em> on the Apple Arcade on February 5th as well.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/861816/civilization-vii-apple-arcade-launch]]></content:encoded>
