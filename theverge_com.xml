            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Hytale</em>, the highly anticipated <em>Minecraft</em>-like adventure game that’s been in development for a decade, is nearly here. After developer Hypixel Studios was acquired by Riot Games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21223667/riot-games-league-of-legends-hypixel-studios-minecraft-hytale">in 2020</a>, shut down by Riot <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/691791/riot-games-hypixel-studios-hytale-closure">in June 2025</a>, and went independent <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved">a few months later</a>, the team is launching <em>Hytale</em> in early access on January 13th.</p><p>And if you jump in at launch, you can expect updates for years to come — which could be reassuring if you felt burned by other ambitious but quickly shuttered games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/604179/multiversus-final-season-shutdown"><em>MultiVersus</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios"><em>Concord</em></a>. “We have officially secured the next two years of development costs through pre-purchases,” <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010691717637222614">according to</a> Hypixel cofounder Simon Collins-Laflamme, who has also made a “personal commitment” of 10 years to the project.</p><p>“<em>Hytale</em> blends the freedom of a sandbox with the momentum of an RPG: explore a procedurally generated world full of dungeons, secrets, and a variety of creatures, then shape it block by block,” <a href="https://hytale.com/game">according to Hypixel</a>. “Our Early Access release focuses on polished core systems - exploration, responsive combat, and robust building - alongside creator‑first tools for making your own content, crafting minigames, and running community servers.”</p><p>The initial launch will be “true early access,” Collins-Laflamme <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-early-access-january-13-2026">said in November</a>, “meaning it’s still very much unfinished and will be buggy for a while, but you have my and the team’s commitment to make <em>Hytale</em> the game we’ve always wanted it to be.”</p><p>Hypixel expects “over 1 million players” on <em>Hytale’s</em> early access release day, <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010458001455640636">Collins-Laflamme says</a>. It will be <a href="https://store.hytale.com/#system-requirements">available on</a> PC, Mac, and Linux <a href="https://store.hytale.com/">starting at</a> $19.99. Hypixel is planning on a console release of the game “at a later stage,” and there won’t be a mobile version during early access, <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-s-1st-faq">according to an FAQ</a>.</p><p>Riot’s shutdown of Hypixel followed layoffs <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/22/24047568/riot-games-league-of-legends-forge-runeterra-layoffs">in 2024</a>. At the time, the company announced it would be “refocusing on fewer, high-impact projects to move us toward a more sustainable future,” which included stopping work on new games through its indie publishing label, Riot Forge.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/860687/hytale-early-access-launch-release-date-riot-games-hypixel-studios]]></content:encoded>
