            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>What if <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">Valve’s Steam Machine</a> were a 3.8-liter tower instead of a 3.8-liter cube, with a desktop-grade Nvidia RTX 5060 GPU instead of an AMD RX 7600 — plus a more powerful CPU and many faster ports? Well, it’d cost you nearly $1,500 and be called <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.minisforum.com%2Fproducts%2Fminisforum-g1-pro%3Fvariant%3D47325699408117" rel="sponsored">the Minisforum AtomMan G1 Pro</a>.</p><p>Minisforum is one of the only companies shipping such powerful discrete GPUs in mini-PCs, and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-pcs/minisforum-atomman-g7-pt-mini-pc-review/">its earlier AtomMan G7 PT</a> is the closest thing anyone’s sold to Valve’s own spec. But the new G1 Pro might be a better competitor now it’s got an integrated power supply (like Valve) and even beefier components.</p><p>The most surprising feature is a full but lilliputian desktop graphics card — look how cute it is in the render below! — that fits into the top of the chassis. (Minisforum doesn’t claim it’s upgradable, just FYI, but does boast that it offers the full 145W of power you’d get in other desktop 5060 cards.)</p><p>And, in “Beast Mode,” Minisforum says it can drive the AMD Ryzen 9 8945HX CPU at 100W while that GPU stays at 145W. You also get not one but <em>two</em> M.2 2280 slots for NVMe SSD storage, two SO-DIMM slots for up to 96GB of DDR5 RAM, and <em>five</em> display outputs (2x DP2.1, 1x DP 1.4, and 2x HDMI 2.1) for up to four displays at once.</p><p>It’s on sale now with 32GB and 1TB for $1,440, shipping mid January — which is honestly starting to look like a decent deal now that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/828337/ram-memory-shortage-crunch-market-prices-central-micro-center">RAM prices are out of control.</a> There’s also a bring-your-own-RAM-and-storage barebones version for $1,040, though it’s not available to order yet.</p><p>Valve still isn’t talking price yet, but I’d hope it’s more affordable than this one. Even so, Valve says it put a lot of work into cooling, noise, and wireless connectivity, and Linux drivers are still more mature on the AMD GPU side of things if you’re <a href="http://Tempted to try installing Bazzite on this thing!">considering a Bazzite</a> or SteamOS install. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/828620/linux-benchmarks-bazzite-gamersnexus">GamersNexus’ new video</a> does include Linux benchmarks for desktop RTX 5060, maybe check those out?</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/831106/minisforum-g1-pro-mini-pc-price-release-date]]></content:encoded>

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The skyrocketing price of RAM is trickling down to custom PC makers, including CyberPowerPC and Maingear. On Wednesday, CyberPowerPC <a href="https://x.com/CYBERPOWERPC/status/1993126805658911041?s=20">announced that it plans</a> to adjust the pricing across all of its systems on December 7th, as <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/cyberpowerpc-is-latest-system-builder-to-hike-prices-over-soaring-dram">reported earlier by <em>PCMag</em></a>.</p><p>“Recently, global memory (RAM) prices have surged by 500% and SSD prices have risen by 100%,” CyberPowerPC says in a statement posted on X. “This has had a direct impact on the cost of building gaming PCs since 10/1/25.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Maingear is trying to stave off price increases for as long as it can. “I anticipate that the prices will continue to rise and then we will eventually have to increase our lead times as stock and allocation becomes constrained, but we are in constant communication with our vendors and will delay these increases for as long as we possibly can,” Maingear CEO Wallace Santos <a href="https://wccftech.com/dont-wait-on-pc-upgrades-as-maingear-ceo-warns-memory-shortages-will-deepen/">tells <em>Wccftech</em></a>.</p><p>The price of RAM has fluctuated greatly over the past month as AI companies buy up more RAM and data storage for their sprawling data centers. Some physical stores have resorted to pricing the components at market prices, not unlike how seafood restaurants sell the catch-of-the-day. <a href="https://x.com/CYBERPOWERPC/status/1993431465150046577?s=20">CyberPowerPC </a>predicts that the “price increases will be temporary,” and will go back down “when market conditions change.”</p><p>Maingear CEO Wallace Santos <a href="https://wccftech.com/dont-wait-on-pc-upgrades-as-maingear-ceo-warns-memory-shortages-will-deepen/">tells <em>Wccftech</em></a> that customers might want to start “shopping now” if they need a memory or storage upgrade. Though this may seem like another way to boost sales for Black Friday, Santos appears to be genuinely warning of an increased shortage, and says the PCs he’s selling this Black Friday have been “sheltered from these price increases.”</p><p>Skytech Gaming, another company that specializes in prebuilt and custom PCs, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/officialskytechgaming">said in a post on Facebook</a> that it’s “getting hit with RAM price increases too,” though it’s unclear whether these changes are impacting the prices listed on its website yet.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/831032/cyberpowerpc-maingear-ram-price-increases-pc-gaming]]></content:encoded>
