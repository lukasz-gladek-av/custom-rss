The past four releases in the series have been <em>Modern Warfare II</em> (2022), <em>Modern Warfare III</em> (2023), <em>Black Ops 6</em> (2024), and <em>Black Ops 7</em> (2025), but moving forward, Activision wants to offer “an absolutely unique experience each and every year,” <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team">according to a blog post</a>.</p><p><em>Black Ops 7</em> came out in November to mixed reviews, and in Europe, the game had a “disappointing launch,” <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-drops-to"><em>The Game Business</em> reports</a>. Ahead of the game’s release, Treyarch Senior Director of Production Yale Miller <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-7-devs-admit-theyre-worried-about-series-fatigue-after-back-to-back-games-3255551/">told <em>CharlieIntel</em></a> that he was worried about <em>Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Black Ops 7</em> being seen as too similar.</p><p>“We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental,” Activision says. “While we aren’t sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right.” The post also notes that “the future of <em>Call of Duty</em> is very strong and we believe our best days are ahead of us given the depth and talent of our development teams” and that the “next era” of <em>Call of Duty</em> will “deliver precisely on what you want along with some surprises that push the Franchise and the genre forward.”</p><p>This year, <em>Call of Duty</em> is also facing competition from EA’s <em>Battlefield 6</em>, which sold <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/800922/battlefield-6-is-off-to-a-good-start">more than 7 million copies</a> in its first three days of launch and is already being <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/825171/battlefield-6-had-a-big-launch-month">touted by EA as</a> the “best selling shooter game of the year,” and Arc Raiders, which has <a href="https://pdf.irpocket.com/C3659/lAG8/RG5i/c5pp.pdf">sold more than 4 million copies</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/841290/activision-call-of-duty-modern-warefare-black-ops-back-to-back]]></content:encoded>
