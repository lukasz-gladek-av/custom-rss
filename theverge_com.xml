The protector in question is a pre-production sample of the Jsaux Obsidian AR screen protector, which is coming in October for $21.99.</p><p>The company claims it’s better than standard screen protectors because it features a similar physical vapor deposition (PVD) coating found in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22981744/apple-studio-display-5k-monitor-webcam-speakers-review">Apple Studio Display</a>. It’s supposed to reduce glare while retaining a glossy appearance — an ideal combination for gamers, since you can’t always choose where you’ll play games.</p><p>In reality, this pre-production screen protector boasts minor improvements that are easy to miss. Obsidian AR <em>slightly </em>reduces the intensity of reflections hitting the screen that could otherwise distract me during gameplay. However, I noticed these differences in photos more than I did while actively using the Switch 2.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><figcaption>Without a screen protector installed.</figcaption></span></p></section><p>One thing I did have the misfortune to notice as I played my Switch 2 with the screen protector equipped was the roach in my ceiling. That little sucker has probably been dead for a while and I only just noticed. In defense of Jsaux’s claims, it makes the bold LED tube illuminating the trapped roach a little dimmer and tougher to pick out, but not nearly enough to wipe this encounter from my memory.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><figcaption>Without the screen protector installed.</figcaption></span></p></section><p>I won’t go as far as to say that the Obsidian AR isn’t worth your money, having only tried an early version. Everyone’s tolerance for glare is different, but I’m skeptical that the differences are worth paying for compared to cheaper alternatives. To reiterate, just one of these protectors will cost $21.99 while you can get a three-pack of good-enough tempered glass protectors for under $10.</p><p><em>Photography by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</em></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/770667/i-tried-jsauxs-new-anti-glare-switch-2-screen-protector-and-it-revealed-a-glaring-bug#comments">3<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/770667/i-tried-jsauxs-new-anti-glare-switch-2-screen-protector-and-it-revealed-a-glaring-bug]]></content:encoded>
