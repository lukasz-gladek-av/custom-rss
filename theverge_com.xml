While I didn’t get to test playing <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> that way, based on comments Valve gave to other publications, it seems like Valve is optimistic that it might be able to make the game run well when played standalone.</p><p>“<em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> is a great experience when streamed from a PC to Steam Frame, and we are looking into making it a good standalone experience as well,” <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2025/11/valve-looking-into-a-steam-frame-half-life-alyx-standalone-experience">Valve told <em>Digital Foundry</em></a>. And <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/valve-steam-frame-hands-on-impressions/">according to <em>UploadVR</em></a>, “Valve representatives think they can get <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> running performant in standalone, but they’re not promising it yet and it’s clear there’s still a lot for them to do.”</p><p>Fingers crossed Valve finds a way to make it happen. I’ve actually never played <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>, and if I get a Steam Frame, I’d definitely want to try playing it standalone.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/820503/valve-half-life-alyx-steam-frame-standalone-vr]]></content:encoded>
