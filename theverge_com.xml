            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you plug the world’s best-reviewed webcams into the Nintendo Switch 2 today, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682008/which-webcams-work-with-nintendo-switch-2">they won’t work, while many comparatively ancient webcams do</a>. Why? That’s been a mystery for the nearly three weeks since the handheld launched. Now, two companies say they’ve figured it out and are pledging to update the firmware on their cameras.</p><p>Here’s a possibly oversimplified answer: today’s more powerful webcams advertise many different modes that they support to any device you connect via USB — but <em>that’s a problem</em> because the Nintendo Switch 2 appears to be choosing modes it can’t properly play.</p><p>In the case of Elgato, which will update its non-working Facecam MK.2 and Facecam Neo, the solve was adding an additional low-resolution 480p mode, <a href="https://x.com/JFest/status/1937966174429712886">with Elgato general manager Julian Fest speculating</a> that the Switch can only reliably support “very low resolution” cameras in order to put <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TZZ1akN8V8">multiple facecams on screen</a>.</p><p>But low resolution by itself isn’t the answer — as you’d probably expect, given that Nintendo’s own official Switch 2 camera is a 1080p camera that genuinely broadcasts a 1080p mode (we checked), and given it’s far from the only 1080p or higher camera that works with Nintendo’s new Switch.</p><p>Accessory company Ugreen tells <em>The Verge</em> that the technical details of making a camera work with the console are far more nuanced than resolution, or frame rate, or whether you have the enhanced bandwidth of USB 3 or the far slower USB 2.</p><p>Nor is it enough for the camera to support a single compatible UVC (USB Video Class) mode. Instead, Ugreen spokesperson Gabrielle Wang explains by email, the camera needs to <em>avoid</em> advertising modes or protocols that the Switch might not recognize, or that it might attempt to use but fail, after you plug it into the console.</p><p>Ugreen says three different conditions <em>all simultaneously </em>need to be met for a camera to work with the Switch 2:</p><div><ul><li><span>“The camera must not use the HID protocol.”</span></li><li><span>“The camera must be configured for Isochronous transfer mode.” (<a href="https://www.regami.solutions/post/isochronous-isoc-vs-bulk-choosing-right-transfer-mode-usb-cameras">As opposed to Bulk</a>, which can be more resource intensive.)</span></li><li><span>“The USB endpoint descriptors must not include unsupported low frame rate settings (below 30 fps).” More on that one in a sec.</span></li></ul></div><p>Unfortunately, you’re not likely to find any of those “specs” on a camera’s box or in its marketing materials, but but they are things you can check with a connected PC and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/usbview">a tool like USBView</a> — and in so doing, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZXg6qfvBkS5nhfzY6-ABoEp1RraYqh6s2VvPpLfByi4/edit?tab=t.8dlf1ievxdr9">we can see</a> the camera incompatibility situation is more nuanced than a single factor.</p><p>Elgato’s Facecam MK.2, for instance, already advertises isochronous modes to connected devices as far as I can tell, and it doesn’t advertise an HID interface. In fact, it appears to already offer a 480p mode as well.</p><p>But Elgato’s camera may have broken Ugreen’s third theoretical rule — it tells connected devices like the Switch 2 that it’s capable of running as low as 5 fps at a variety of different resolutions, according to the USB Device Descriptors I’ve viewed. Ugreen says that the Switch 2 may prioritize lower settings, “but if the camera hardware cannot actually output at such low frame rates, it will cause a failure.”</p><p>It wouldn’t be surprising if Ugreen had an easier time figuring this out: though none of Elgato’s webcams worked with the Switch 2 at launch, Ugreen had the benefit of discovering that some of its models did, while others did not.</p><p>Ugreen says its CM826 / 55512, CM797 / 45644, and CM825 / 75330 cameras will have updates by the end of June, while the CM678 / 15728, CM778 / 35626, CM717 / 25442, CM825 / 55721, and CM831 / 65381 already work.</p><p>But I wonder if this should solely be the responsibility of camera companies — PCs, for example, don’t generally have this same trouble picking from a webcam’s list of supported video modes. Perhaps Nintendo will address the webcam compatibility situation, globally, with an update of its own.</p><p>Nintendo didn’t have a comment for our story.</p><div><p><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andru-marino">Andru Marino</a> contributed to this story.</em></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/693182/nintendo-switch-2-webcam-mystery-1080p-480p-uvc-iso-bulk-ugreen-elgato]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Dbrand will send replacement Killswitch Joy-Con Grips for the Switch 2 to buyers after admitting it had a “spectacularly terrible response” to complaints that the controllers could detach from the console if held a certain way while the grips were on. The company is currently working on tweaks to the grips as well.</p><p>A few days ago, some owners of the case noticed that the Switch 2 Joy-Con controllers could pop off if you had the case and grips on <em>and</em> held the console primarily by a Joy-Con. This <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lgav3g/i_love_my_killswitch_2_buttttttt/">short video</a> helps illustrate the issue.</p><p>On Sunday, Dbrand posted a more than 4,000-word response <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/">on Reddit</a> titled “Killswitch Joy-Con Detachment Update” where it said that “nobody routinely holds their Switch 2 like this.” Dbrand argued that the detachment only happened when all three of the following conditions were met:</p><div><blockquote><p>You are specifically holding onto the console from only the Joy-Cons, in such a way that your fingers are making no supportive contact with the main console, <strong>and</strong></p><p>you are holding the Switch 2 with only one hand, <strong>and</strong></p><p>your Switch 2 is held more parallel to the ground than not.</p></blockquote></div><p>Part of the issue is that the Killswitch case’s Joy-Con grips wrap around the inner part of the Joy-Con, creating a small lip. “By adding those lips, particularly the ones on the interior face of the Joy-Cons, we filled the ‘air gap’ between the Joy-Cons and the Main Case,” Dbrand said. This means that it’s easier for the Joy-Con to create leverage against the main tablet part of the console so that detachment can occur “when held under a very specific set of conditions.”</p><p>In some “particularly severe instances of detachment” highlighted on Reddit by Dbrand, the company also believed the Joy-Con grips had “an inner attachment lip that’s <em>a hair thicker</em> than desired.” Dbrand said that it had adjusted its tolerance guidelines for mass production to “filter out any Joy-Cons that cross that ‘lip is 0.12mm too thick’ threshold.”</p><p>For users who were worried that they were having issues, Dbrand asked them to reach out to support and “describe the regular use scenario that is resulting in detachment” and the company would get them replacement grips in July.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</cite></p></div><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/mz7c2yd/">More</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/mz7z9l8/">than</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/mz9czxr/">one</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/mz7lxrw/">commenter</a> pointed out that Dbrand’s post echoed Steve Jobs and Apple’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/06/25/iphone.problems.response/index.html">famous response</a> to iPhone 4 antenna issues caused by a way people could hold their phones. And yesterday, Dbrand published a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1ljlhwy/joycon_detachment_update_part_2_were_fixing_it/">new post</a> where it said it would “try out a new communication strategy where we both say fewer words and devote less of them to blaming you” and offered to send everyone, “whether or not you’re experiencing this issue,” a replacement set of Joy-Con Grips.</p><p>“As easy as it is to boil our original post down to <em>‘you’re holding it wrong</em>,’ what we’re sober to now is the point that <em>you should be allowed to hold it however the fuck you want, without detachment occurring</em>,” Dbrand said. “We get it. Please continue dunking on us for the next six to eight months for reincarnating Steve Jobs.”</p><p>Dbrand is working on two new versions of the grips: one with “an even <em>thinner retaining</em> lip compared to the ‘good’ stock we’ve already shipped” and one with a new retaining lip design that the company says “fully resolves the detachment issue.” However, that second option won’t be ready for a “mass production trial” until July 10th, and “at that point,” Dbrand will be able to tell if it will be using the first or second options for replacements.</p><p>Dbrand says to expect its next update on July 10th.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/693121/dbrand-switch-2-killswitch-joy-con-case-replacement-detachment]]></content:encoded>
