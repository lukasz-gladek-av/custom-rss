            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/667948/maze-mice-pc-early-access-small-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There have been a lot of <em>big</em> games this year that have felt all-consuming, like <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> or <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. <em>Maze Mice</em> offers something different: a small, pick-up-and-play experience that takes a bunch of ideas from some classics and adds a clever twist.</p><p>The game, from <em>Luck Be a Landlord</em> developer TrampolineTales, mixes elements of <em>Pac-Man</em>, <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, and even the classic <em>Snake</em>. As an adorable, pixelated mouse, you zip around a maze to get blue experience gems that are guarded by cats. When you pass by the cats, they’ll wake up and start chasing you, sometimes creating a hilariously long line of felines. (Cute ghost cats will also appear and inconveniently float right into your path.) All the action takes place on one screen, so it’s easy to see where everything is at any given time.</p><p>When you get enough gems, you can pick from a selection of three power-ups. The upgrades are often a little silly, like knitting needles that fly through the air to attack the cats pursuing you, but as with <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, it’s fun to experiment with different abilities to create interesting builds.</p><p><em>Maze Mice</em>’s most interesting feature is that time only moves when you move, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/25/11110138/superhot-review-video-game-pc-mac-linux">like in <em>Superhot</em></a>. When you inch forward, the enemy cats inch forward right behind you, but when you’re not moving, they’re frozen, too. Your abilities are all on cooldowns, and the time on those cooldowns also only advances when you move forward. It all means that instead of the growing sense of being overwhelmed that you might get while dodging ghosts in <em>Pac-Man</em> or fighting hordes of monsters in <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, <em>Maze Mice</em> gives you time to sit and think about where you want to go next — even if you have 10 cats on your tail.</p><p>I really like how it all works. You’re still dealing with lots of enemies, but instead of the anxiety of having to fend them off in real time like in other games, it’s all much much more laid-back. The charming atmosphere and catchy music help make the experience feel more welcoming than stressful, too.</p><p>After runs, you’ll unlock new upgrades and characters for future runs based on your score. I’m a big fan of a mine weapon that blows up when I get the cats following me to walk over it. And my favorite character so far is a mouse named Jazz with sunglasses and a saxophone — who starts with a saxophone weapon. Such a cool little guy!</p><p><em>Maze Mice</em> is in early access, so it should get more content down the line. It seems like there’s a generous amount to play with already; TrampolineTales launched the game this month <a href="https://blog.trampolinetales.com/a-really-big-change-to-maze-mices-release-its-a-good-thing/">with 30 characters and 63 upgrades</a>, meaning there’s a lot to dig into. But the thing I love most about it is that I can play for a few minutes after an hourlong <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> level and feel like I actually accomplished something – even when those pesky cats eventually catch up to me. </p><p><em><sub>Mace Maze is available now in early access on PC.</sub></em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/667900/doom-the-dark-ages-clair-obscur-expedition-33-parry-season<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you like games with parrying, there are two great new ways to get your fix: <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> and <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. These very different games — one is a fast-paced first-person shooter, the other a turn-based fantasy RPG — approach the mechanic in very different ways.</p><p>Let’s start with <em>Doom</em>. One of the big new additions to the game is a giant shield for the Doom Slayer, and you can use it to block projectiles or enemy attacks. The game helpfully signals anything that you can parry in a bright neon green that’s easy to see as you’re rushing around and destroying hordes of demons.</p><p>When a green projectile gets within range or an enemy does a green attack, you can press the parry button at the right time to deflect the danger with a huge reverberation of your shield and an action-movie-like moment of slow motion. Like most of modern <em>Doom</em>’s action, it all looks, feels, and sounds very satisfying. But parries are also critical for fights, as they can open up an opportunity to hit the enemy with a punch or a few shots from whatever monstrous gun you’re wielding.</p><div><p>Stay keen for something green</p></div><p>In intense battles, I’m always hunting for green glints to find things to parry to potentially gain an advantage. When an enemy shoots a spread of bullets with some green interspersed, I’ll even run <em>toward</em> the danger to get in a good deflection. Some weapon upgrades have perks tied to parries, too, giving you many incentives to stay keen for something green.</p><p><em>Doom</em>, very helpfully, has a setting that lets you change the timing for the parry window whenever you want. I have no shame in admitting that I’ve occasionally made the parry window as wide as the game allows; yes, it lowers the difficulty, but I like parrying every chance I can.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Kepler Interactive</cite></p></div><p><em>Expedition 33</em>’s parrying system is just as thrilling and impactful, but shifts from fast-paced action to turn-based battles. When it’s an enemy’s turn in a battle, they’ll often wind up their giant swords, axes, or fists for flashy, multistep attack combos, and you can parry each hit if you time things right.</p><p>Every successful parry regains one AP, which you’ll spend during your turn to use skills. More powerful skills typically have higher AP costs, so the more blows you parry, the better equipped you’ll be on your next turn. Parry all of an enemy’s attacks on their turn and you’ll do a counter (which also has an action-movie-like slow-motion effect) that can be a very helpful way to chip away at a health bar.</p><p>That’s not easy, though: <em>Expedition 33</em>’s gives you a <em>very</em> tight window to press the parry button in time to block a hit, and if you miss the window, you’ll take some damage. Missing multiple parries on a single turn might drain your health bar from full to empty, and given how tricky the game’s enemies can get with staggering their hits or faking you out, that will probably happen often.</p><p>The game lets you dodge enemy attacks, which has a much wider timing window, but you don’t gain AP and you won’t get a chance to counter. I found myself leaning toward parries far more than dodges: despite the risks, landing a successful series of parries, especially in a high-stakes battle, was usually worth the trial and error because of how cool it looked and how much it helped in a fight.</p><p>I do wish <em>Expedition 33</em> had a setting to adjust the parrying windows just slightly (and if you’re on PC, there’s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/clairobscurexpedition33/mods/28">a mod that can help with that</a>). But I also get why the timing is so tough: the rewards are high, but so are the costs.</p><p>Parrying can be a divisive mechanic, especially when it’s challenging. That’s why people bounce off of games like <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em> and <em>Nine Sols</em>. But <em>Doom</em> and <em>Expedition 33</em> both offer new and interesting takes on the idea that show just how rewarding a good parry can be.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
