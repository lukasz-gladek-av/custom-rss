He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you’ve dreaded entering the eShop for most of the original Switch’s life because of how slow it is, well, Nintendo knows and won’t make that mistake again. The Switch 2 will have a faster-performing eShop channel “even when displaying a large number of games,” Takuhiro Dohta, Nintendo’s senior director for entertainment planning and development, said in an <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Ask the Developer</em> interview</a>.</p><p>Dohta said the Switch 2’s eShop speed improvements are “thanks to the system’s performance capabilities,” which, of course, is a significant jump from the original system’s aging software that increasingly struggled in both menu and games over the years. “We believe the act of finding the game you want to play is itself part of the game system experience,” Dohta said.</p><p>Additionally, the eShop will have a new “Game Finds for You” feature that, as explained by producer for entertainment planning and development Kouichi Kawamoto, will let you “quickly see screenshots and watch introduction videos” for various games so you don’t have to “search every nook and cranny” of the store.</p><p>Nintendo has the chance to nail the next generation of the digital games experience if it can make the eShop more intuitive and easier to navigate. Add on the Virtual Game Card feature that lets you share your digital games locally with others for a limited time, and things feel even better. Whether <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer#:~:text=collar%2Dtugging%20$79.99%20price%20tag">the $79.99 price tag</a> for some digital first-party games is worth it will be up to you.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The long-awaited successor to the Switch will be available on June 5th for $449.99. It will be available for preorder in the US from select retailers starting on April 9th, as both a standalone console or bundled with <em><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer">Mario Kart World</a></em></em> for $499.99.</p><p>As predicted, the Switch 2 features a larger 7.9-inch LCD display, with support for 1080p resolution and HDR, 256GB of built-in storage, and up to 6.5 hours of battery life. The Joy-Cons are bigger, too, and now magnetically attach to the console instead of relying on a pair of sliding rails to snap into place. They also offer mouse-like functionality with select games, and the right Joy-Con sports a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/24107678">“C” button</a>, which can be used for in-game chat features, screensharing, and other actions.</p><div><p>As for games, the Switch 2 will launch with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer">Mario Kart World</a>,</em> along with third-party games like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/623660/split-fiction-review-hazelight-studios-it-takes-two">Split Fiction</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23881536/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-2-0">Cyberpunk 2077</a></em>. The console <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will also be backward-compatible</a> with original Switch games and support enhanced versions of select titles, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641365/nintendo-zelda-botw-totk-switch-2-edition-announced"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the</em> <em>Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>.</p></div><p>Below, we’ve rounded up all the preorder information you need if you want to be one of the first to get your hands on it. We’ll be updating this post regularly as more information becomes available, so bookmark this page if you’re keen on learning more ahead of the launch.</p><div><p id="qNz1cS"><h2>How to preorder via Nintendo</h2></p></div><p>The only confirmed retailer as of now is the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Fhow-to-buy%2F" rel="sponsored">My Nintendo Store</a>, which comes with a string of eligibility requirements — one of which requires you to register your interest in advance of April 9th. To do so, you’ll need to sign in with your Nintendo account and choose which console configuration you prefer (and which accessories). Then, you’ll receive an invitation email when it’s time to buy it, assuming you’ve satisfied several other conditions.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->450</span></p><div><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 offers a 7.9-inch display with 1080p resolution and HDR support. It also features improved processing power and larger Joy-Con controllers, which magnetically attach to the sides of the console.</p></div></div><p>As of right now, the reservation process is limited to Nintendo account holders in the US and Canada who are at least 18 years old. Invitations will be valid for 72 hours and will be “prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis,” according to Nintendo; you’ll also need to have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership for a minimum of 12 months and have logged 50 hours of gameplay on the original Switch as of April 2nd, 2025, to be eligible. What’s more, you must have opted in to <em>share</em> gameplay data with Nintendo (you can see if you’ve done so <a href="https://accounts.nintendo.com/privacy">in the privacy section</a> when logged into your account).</p><p>Once invitations have been sent to account holders who have met these criteria, Nintendo says it will send invitations to “remaining eligible registrants” on a first-come, first-served basis. Unsurprisingly, the invitations will be nontransferable and sent to the email address you used while registering your interest with Nintendo. Console and accessory purchases will be limited to one per eligible account, at least during the initial invitation period, with the first batch of invitations going out on May 8th.</p><p>Additional invitations will follow periodically, though Nintendo hasn’t specified details beyond that.</p><div><p id="how-to-preorder-elsewhere"><h2>How to preorder elsewhere</h2></p></div><p>As mentioned above, Nintendo is the only retailer thus far that has provided any insight into how preorders will work when they open on April 9th. That said, you can already sign up at <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/jjuweufjmbxay">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2F20019700.html" rel="sponsored">GameStop</a> to receive notifications about the upcoming console and games. Presumingly, this will also include preorder details once they’re available.</p><p>Like with previous launches, we anticipate that Amazon, <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fnintendo-switch-games-video%2F-%2FN-p86ax%3Ftype%3Dproducts" rel="sponsored">Target</a>, and Walmart will all have limited stock of the console, as well. But despite Nintendo “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606817/nintendo-switch-2-production-demand-q-a">taking risks</a>” to ensure it can meet demands, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/638668/you-might-have-a-hard-time-getting-a-switch-2">reports indicate</a> that US retailers might not have enough Switch 2 consoles to meet preorder demands. With any luck, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641559/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gameplay-requirements">Nintendo’s stringent reservation requirements</a> will thwart any potential scalpers.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
