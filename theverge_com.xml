The video was paired with <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250116009204/en/">a brief follow-up press release from Nintendo</a> that <em>also</em> didn’t go into much detail, with the company ostensibly saving all the juicy stuff for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24236766/nintendo-switch-2-games-direct-date-time">the Switch 2 Direct set to take place on April 2nd</a>. While we wait for official word, here are the burning questions we still have about the Nintendo Switch 2.</p></div><p><h4>What are the Switch 2’s specs?</h4></p><p>Perhaps the most glaring omission in the Switch 2 reveal was the fact that Nintendo didn’t say anything about how powerful the new console is. We can see that the console is bigger, but what’s the screen size? <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review">Is it OLED</a> or LCD? Is the screen resolution still 720p? <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701210/nintendo-switch-4k-pro-rumors-oled">Is 4K resolution supported</a>? </p><p>Though visible for a few brief moments, the reveal video showed off the Switch 2’s new dock. What’s the docked resolution? Is it just a charging shell, or is it still required for TV play? Can you dock the Switch 2 in the original Switch dock, or will it support all the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21349885/genki-covert-dock-review-price-portable-nintendo-switch-usbc-hdmi-adapter">super-portable third-party docks</a>? </p><p>The Switch 2 also features a second USB-C port at the top. It’s likely there to offer a way to connect USB-C headphones without sacrificing a charging port. But perhaps it might have some other mysterious function. Has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674704/nintendo-switch-bluetooth-audio-software-update">native Bluetooth support</a> been improved? It’d be nice to connect more than two wireless controllers if a Bluetooth headset is being used. What about the UI? Can we expect to see a homescreen similar to the original Switch? What about the UI for the eShop? Can <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/65057">you still post screenshots and clips directly to Facebook</a>? Will Nintendo add the ability to post to other social media or streaming platforms? </p><p><h4>How exactly do the Switch 2 Joy-Con controllers work?</h4></p><p>A lot of the reveal trailer focused on the new Joy-Cons, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo">while there’s some info we can infer</a>, there’s still more we don’t know. Do they attach <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld">via magnets</a>? Do they still have 3D rumble? Will the Switch 2 support the original Switch Pro controller or the original Switch Joy-Cons in wireless mode? </p><p>Prior to the reveal, there were rumors that the Joy-Cons would have magnetic Hall effect joysticks that would supposedly combat Joy-Con drift. So, what improvements has Nintendo made to protect against drift? Will Nintendo still offer repairs for the new Joy-Cons if they do drift? Will it sell new Joy-Cons separately at launch, and do they come in any new colors? </p><p><h4>What does that new button do?</h4></p><p>There’s a new button on the Switch 2 directly below the home button on the right Joy-Con. Does it have something to do with a new chat functionality <a href="https://gamerant.com/nintendo-switch-2-c-button-purpose-function-campus-chat-rooms-rumor/">like rumors have suggested</a>? </p><div><figcaption><em>Sure seems like that’s some mouse action.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>GIF: Nintendo / The Verge</cite></p></div><p><h4>Does the new Joy-Con work like a mouse?</h4></p><p>The reveal video featured a Joy-Con attaching to a cover and zooming around on a surface like a mouse. Is “mouse” functionality one of the Switch 2’s new gimmicks? Speaking of gimmicks, is there still an IR camera for games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/13/14262624/1-2-switch-nintendo-hands-on-preview"><em>1-2-Switch</em></a>? I also hope that the Switch 2 will still support original Switch peripherals like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20917908/nintendo-switch-ring-fit-adventure-review"><em>Ring Fit Adventure </em>Ring-Con</a>.</p><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div><p><h4>What games will be playable on the Switch 2?</h4></p><p>The Switch 2 reveal only showed off one game: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24337198/switch-2-mario-kart-nintendo">a new <em>Mario Kart</em></a>. Beyond that, we have no idea what kind of launch titles to expect or if the new <em>Mario Kart</em> will even be among them. So, what kind of games can we expect for the Switch 2? Will there be Switch 2 exclusives at launch, or will we get cross-gen launch games like <em>Breath of the Wild</em>? One of the bigger original Switch complaints was that newer, larger games often didn’t run or look all that good. Can the console run more technically intensive games? If so, will they run natively on the console, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18293458/nintendo-switch-japan-cloud-streaming-assassins-creed-odyssey">will they be playable via cloud streaming</a> like <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> and <em>Control</em>? </p><p>Speaking of<em> Mario Kart</em>, the short glimpse we saw of it in the trailer featured what looked to be 15 simultaneous racers with 24 spots behind the starting line. Does this mean the Switch 2 will feature enhanced multiplayer capabilities like larger player lobbies, and will the console natively support communication with them? What of Amiibos? Will the Switch 2 still support those, or are there plans to make more?</p><p><h4>What Switch 2 games will be backward-compatible?</h4></p><p>In today’s video, Nintendo reaffirmed that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343666/nintendo-switch-2-cartridge-backwards-compatibility">Switch 2 would be backward-compatible</a>, playing both physical and digital original Switch games but with the important caveat that not <em>all</em> games would be supported. What original Switch games won’t be compatible? Will the original Switch games that do work on the console receive some kind of graphical or performance boost like certain games on PlayStation and Xbox?</p><p><h4>How much does the Switch 2 cost?</h4></p><p>There’s also the question of how much the Switch 2 will cost. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">The original Switch</a> retailed at $299.99 in 2017. Since then, the cost of everything has gone up, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642627/tsmc-chip-price-increase-supply-shortages-apple-qualcomm">especially computer chips</a>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review">The Switch OLED</a>, the only significant console refresh Nintendo offered, was only $50 more than the base model. But without knowing its internal specs, it’s hard to guess what the Switch 2 might cost.</p><p><h4>When will the Switch 2 launch?</h4></p><p>The most important unanswered question we have about the Switch 2 is the simplest: when can we buy it? Nintendo didn’t share much beyond saying that it will launch in 2025. Much like with the original Switch, it will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345091/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-event-schedule">take the Switch 2 on a world tour</a> starting in April. It’s likely that the console’s release date will follow the tour’s conclusion, which looks to be in June. Here’s hoping Nintendo shares that critical information, along with answers to at least some of these questions during its Switch 2 Direct on April 2nd.</p><p><h4>How do the cartridges taste?</h4></p><p>Oh, wait, there is one more burning question... what flavors can we expect for the Switch 2 cartridges? I’m hoping for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14778316/nintendo-switch-cartridge-taste-test-dont-lick-it">something better than “insecticide.”</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-switch-2%E2%80%99s-bigger-screen-is-just-what-i-wanted.1084326/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345191/nintendo-switch-2-bigger-screen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">finally revealed the Switch 2</a> — but it didn’t reveal everything. Even still, the new console looks pretty much like a bigger, more refined Switch. Sure, that’s the straightforward and expected move from Nintendo. But it’s also exactly what I’ve been waiting for.</p><p>The first Switch was a revelation. When it launched, I marveled over being able to play <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> on my TV and then take the console out of the dock and play in handheld mode curled up on the couch. Nintendo absolutely nailed the execution of combining its console and portable expertise into one great device, and ever since, the Switch has been a constant companion at home and while traveling.</p><p>I would have been disappointed if Nintendo messed with what worked for the Switch with the Switch 2. I’m glad it has a bigger screen, one that appears to be even larger than the seven-inch display on the OLED Switch. I’m guessing the taller Joy-Cons will be easier to hold, which could be a massive improvement for my hands, and attaching them from the side looks like it could be easier than sliding them up and down. The second USB-C port on the top will be a <em>very</em> welcome addition for easier charging. And even though I barely used it, the return of the kickstand is great, too — maybe with the Switch 2, I’ll actually bring it to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/10/25/13403924/nintendo-switch-karen-meme-reveal-video">some rooftop parties</a>.</p><p>I also quite like the new black design with accent colors. Sure, it doesn’t pop quite as much as the red and blue Joy-Cons for the original Switch, but I think this design looks elegant with a splash of Nintendo whimsy — I love how colors peek out in different places around the hardware. And there will almost certainly be more color options at launch; Nintendo initially revealed the Switch <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161020005938/en/Nintendo-Switch-World-Premiere-Demonstrates-New-Entertainment-Experiences-from-a-Home-Gaming-System">in gray</a> and later showed off the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2017/170113.html">now-iconic red and blue</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Nintendo made a great call in making physical <em>and</em> digital Switch games backward-compatible with the Switch 2. (Before today, it was a little unclear if that would be the case.) I’ve spent years building up a large digital Switch library that is filled with incredible games, and while Nintendo says that “certain” games won’t be supported on its new console, I imagine that the vast majority of my favorite Switch games will be playable.&nbsp;</p><p>While Nintendo didn’t reveal any technical specs, we can presume it’s going to be more powerful than the original Switch. And hopefully the new console gives a boost to games that sometimes struggled on the original hardware — as much as I love <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, some performance improvements could make it even better. The same goes for other big games like <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> and <em>Pokémon Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>. Maybe we’ll finally get a <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> game on the Switch now.</p><p>Yes, there’s a lot we don’t know about the Switch 2. The only official Switch 2 game is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24337198/switch-2-mario-kart-nintendo">a new <em>Mario Kart</em></a>. Nintendo didn’t reveal the console’s UI or say if the console has any improved online features. The video briefly showed a way to use the Joy-Con like a computer mouse, but that could be a barely used gimmick. We don’t know how much it will cost or when in 2025 it will come out.</p><p>That said, because it builds upon the original Switch’s outstanding legacy, it will be a familiar experience. There will be lots of older games to play even if Nintendo doesn’t have many Switch 2 games from the jump. It doesn’t look like Nintendo has switched things up very much — and that’s fine with me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
