With <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/798848/pokemon-legends-za-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> behind us and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/876285/pokemon-pokopia-hands-on-preview"><em>Pokémon Pokopia</em></a> right around the corner, chances are high that we’re finally going to get some new information about the franchise’s next mainline game. But there’s also a chance that we’ll see more from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/620196/pokemon-champions-online-pokemon-battles-nintendo-switch-mobile"><em>Pokémon Champions</em></a> and hear about updates for other spin-off games like <em>Pokémon Unite</em>, <em>TCG Pocket, </em>and <em>Pokémon Sleep.</em></p><p>In addition to announcing the next Presents stream, <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/the-pokemon-firered-version-and-pokemon-leafgreen-version-games-are-releasing-on-nintendo-switch?cid=&amp;utm_source=tw&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=vg&amp;utm_term=frlgnswitch">Nintendo also revealed today</a> that <em>Pokémon FireRed / LeafGreen </em>— which originally released for the Game Boy Advance in 2004 — will be coming to the Nintendo Switch family of consoles via the eShop next week (note: they won’t be available as part of the Switch Online subscription). The rereleased games don’t seem to feature any significant changes from their original versions. But they will be available to download as soon as next week’s Pokémon Presents concludes, and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260220159643/en/Nintendo-News-Pokmon-FireRed-Version-and-Pokmon-LeafGreen-Version-Are-Coming-to-Nintendo-Switch-in-Multiple-Languages">Nintendo also says</a> that the game will be “available at select retailers launch week for a suggested retail price of $19.99.”</p><p>The <em>FireRed / LeafGreen </em>news seems like the sort of surprise Nintendo and The Pokémon Company might have wanted to keep under wraps until the Presents stream. But this could easily be a sign that next week’s presentation is going to be packed with so much new info that the companies wanted to get the small stuff out of the way well in advance.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTE="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Charles Pulliam-Moore</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/881332/nintendo-pokemon-presents-pokemon-day]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’ve written about a lot of different video game hardware over the years, from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review">new consoles</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/822849/analogue-3d-review-n64">retro gadgets</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025390/playdate-handheld-portable-gaming-console-review">whatever you want to call the Playdate</a>. But I can’t remember ever being perpetually sore from testing a device; such are the joys of the Virtual Boy. Nintendo has turned its biggest flop into an accessory for the Switch, but the costs involved — to your wallet, eyes, and neck — make it a tough sell. Much like the original, this is a novelty for Nintendo sickos only.</p><p>First released in 1995, the original Virtual Boy looked like a VR headset but wasn’t actually VR or a headset. Instead, the console offered stereoscopic 3D games that you viewed through a pair of bulky goggles that were propped up on a stand. It also rendered games in eye-searing red and black, making for an experience that had some potential but was ultimately ugly and uncomfortable. It was a flop and was discontinued after just a year, amassing a library of less than two dozen games.</p><p>Now Nintendo has brought that same experience to the Switch. Virtual Boy games have been added to the Nintendo Classics collection of retro games available to Switch Online subscribers this week, but the twist is, because of the unique nature of the original hardware, you need to buy an accessory to actually play them. There’s a plastic re-creation of the Virtual Boy that’ll run you $100, which is what I’ve been using, as well as a cheaper cardboard headset that’s a much more reasonable $25. Either way, you’ll need both a subscription and an accessory to play these games.</p><p>Technically the games will run in portable mode without one of the accessories connected, but without the magnifying goggles, they’re displayed so small that they’re essentially unplayable. It looks something like this:</p><p>The plastic Virtual Boy <em>looks </em>like the original hardware, complete with a fake controller port and volume dial. But really it’s an elaborate Switch (or Switch 2) case that turns it into something resembling a Virtual Boy. It works like this: The top of the Virtual Boy opens up, letting you slot in a Switch, sans Joy-Con controllers, inside. When you close it up, the Switch becomes the console powering the Virtual Boy-like experience. Look through the goggles, and you’re awash in pixelated reds and blacks (though other colors will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/868569/nintendo-switch-online-virtual-boy-3d-lineup-launch">be available post-launch</a>).</p><p>Since you don’t wear it strapped to your face, the Virtual Boy doesn’t have the same problems as a typical VR headset, where you’re supporting a bunch of weight on your head. But it’s still far from comfortable in my experience. The stand is adjustable so you can change the angle of the goggles, but I had a hard time finding an optimal viewing angle, despite trying to play it lots of different ways. And man, those red graphics; they were hard to look at in the ’90s, and things haven’t improved much. The Virtual Boy is a system where you need to take frequent breaks to save your eyes and neck. Don’t make the same mistakes I did.</p><p>All that said, the Virtual Boy’s lineup is surprisingly interesting to play in 2026. There are seven titles available at launch, and while there are a few duds — I just can’t seem to wrap my head around the first-person robot fighter <em>Teleroboxer</em> — I’ve really been enjoying playing <em>3D Tetris</em>, <em>Galactic Pinball</em>, and the space shooter <em>Red Alarm</em>. The standout might be <em>Wario Land</em>, a fairly straightforward and occasionally clunky platformer but with 3D elements like enemies that jump out right in front of you, making things feel more tense. It’s not a huge lineup by any stretch, but it gives you a good sense of what the Virtual Boy is all about. Which is to say, there are some solid games with neat 3D gimmicks that are fun in short doses. (Why the tentpole <em>Mario’s Tennis</em> isn’t available at launch, especially given <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/875986/nintendo-switch-2-release-schedule-mario-tennis-fever">the recent release of <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em></a><em>,</em> is a mystery to me.)</p><p>Nintendo tends to have a complicated relationship with its own history, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256070/nintendo-museum-kyoto-tour-shigeru-miyamoto">often glossing over its failures</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/790186/super-mario-galaxy-nintendo-switch-2">doing a poor job of celebrating what makes its games so important</a>. So on one hand, the existence of this Virtual Boy seems like something of a miracle. Few people had a chance to play the original, and here it is available through <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/873098/nintendo-switch-era-best-selling-console">Nintendo’s most successful platform ever</a>. But it’s also a product that requires jumping through a lot of hoops for a small amount of payoff. And since it’s tied to NSO, you’re spending $100 to play games only for as long as you have a subscription or the service is active. After that, you have a costly paperweight.</p><p>The Switch version of the Virtual Boy is a device that’s weird, awkward, and of limited appeal — which, now that I think about it, perfectly re-creates the experience of the original.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/881677/nintendo-switch-virtual-boy-review]]></content:encoded>
