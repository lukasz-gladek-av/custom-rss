He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>To better protect against cheaters, Activision says that <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> players on PC will need to use hardware with Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 and have Windows’ Secure Boot feature turned on when the game is available later this year.</p><p>Ahead of that, Activision is doing a “phased rollout” of the features alongside the launch of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s</em> fifth season on Thursday. At least for this season, it won’t be “enforcing against or requiring the use of either setting.”</p><p>While anti-cheat systems and other security measures can go a long way toward blocking cheaters in games, the tools have come under scrutiny for potentially slowing down gamers’ systems or for requiring users to turn on features they don’t want to use. As Activision even admits in today’s blog post, sometimes, they still aren’t enough to fully block cheaters.</p><p>Activision argues that “these hardware-level protections are a key part of our anti-cheat efforts, and we’re asking all players to get compliant now,” Activision says. “This upcoming update will let us test our implementation of both features and gives you time to enable these settings.”</p><p>Regarding performance, “TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot will not impact in-game quality,” Activision says. “These features perform checks during system and game startup but remain inactive while you play.”</p><p>Activision is also encouraging users to turn on two-factor authentication. While two-factor authentication isn’t required to play the game right now, it “may become a requirement for all users in the future.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/720007/call-of-duty-pc-anti-cheat-secure-boot-windows-black-ops-7]]></content:encoded>

Xbox Insiders can start testing a preview of the Gaming Copilot integration in the Game Bar today, and Microsoft is planning “further optimizations” for this new feature on the upcoming Xbox Ally handhelds.</p><p>“Gaming Copilot knows what you’re playing and understands your Xbox activity to provide an experience centered around you,” <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/06/gaming-copilot-beta-begins-rolling-out-to-xbox-insiders-on-game-bar-today/">says Taylor O’Malley, principal program manager at Xbox</a>. You’ll be able to ask the Copilot for help with the game you’re playing, as well as access achievements and play history. The Gaming Copilot will be available as a widget inside the Game Bar, and it includes a voice mode so you can talk to the AI assistant without having to alt + tab out of a game.</p><p>The Gaming Copilot will even use screenshots of your game to help answer questions about it, without you having to describe things in detail. That could be as simple as asking “what am I looking at?” while facing a boss in a game, and Copilot should respond with details about the boss and perhaps even methods to take it down.</p><p>This is the first step in Microsoft’s vision to turn its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628666/microsoft-xbox-copilot-for-gaming">Xbox Copilot into an AI gaming coach</a>. Microsoft is positioning the Gaming Copilot as a sidekick, one that will accompany you through games and offer tips and information about game worlds. Microsoft has previously demonstrated using the Gaming Copilot with <em>Overwatch 2</em>, letting it recommend good hero picks to complement the rest of the team.</p><p>This early preview is only available in English and limited to the US, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, and a few other regions. Microsoft isn’t making it available in the UK or any other European markets yet. It’s planning to release the Gaming Copilot in additional regions at a later date, but it’s not clear yet when exactly that will happen.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/719668/microsoft-xbox-gaming-copilot-windows-game-bar-beta-test]]></content:encoded>
