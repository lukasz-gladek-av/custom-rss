            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/645996/the-switch-2s-joy-con-charging-grip-has-two-extra-buttons<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller isn’t the only new Nintendo gamepad getting two back buttons: the Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip has the additional buttons as well, according to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-charging-grip-123690%2F" rel="sponsored">Nintendo’s online listing for the controller</a>.</p><p>Like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637833/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-details">Pro Controller</a>, the new back buttons are GL and GR that can be remapped to other buttons, the listing says. However, the Switch 2’s Charging Grip, at $34.99, is cheaper than the Pro Controller, which costs $79.99, so the grip is a more affordable way to try out those new buttons.</p><p>However, as with the original Switch’s charging grip, this new grip only charges your Joy-Con while it’s plugged in. “Attach the Joy-Con 2 controllers to the Joy-Con 2 charging grip to use as a classic-style controller – or a handy charging station with the included USB-C charging cable,” the listing says.</p><p>I wish the new charging grip had an included battery. But the ability to charge the Joy-Con while playing and use the new back buttons does make it a step up from the basic Joy-Con 2 grip included with the Switch 2. (Though the back buttons do look quite small.)</p><p>The Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip is scheduled to launch on June 5th alongside the Nintendo Switch 2. Nintendo has delayed preorders for the console in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">US</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645240/nintendo-switch-2-canada-preorders-delayed-trump-tariffs">Canada</a> and hasn’t yet said when they’ll go live in those countries. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
