            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One day, video game critics and journalists will put together a comprehensive study on the impact <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">Balatro</a></em> had on the industry — of how so many games that came after tried to capture its essence by adding complex systems to otherwise simple, easily understood games. Until then, I’m gonna play <em>Dogpile</em>.</p><p><em><a href="https://dogpilegame.com/">Dogpile</a></em> is a deckbuilding match-3 roguelike that builds on the style of merge games like <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24049020/how-to-beat-suika-game-impossible/">Suika Game</a></em> by adding a <em>Balatro</em>-like twist. The result is a cute, cozy (in both genre and vibe) game that appeals to both the numbers-go-up and the dog-loving sicko in me. Drop matching dogs on top of each other to create bigger dogs that reward you with points to unlock higher levels. The smallest unit of dog is a Chihuahua, two Chihuahuas merge to form a Pomeranian (at least that’s what I think it is), and so forth. The dogs pile up the playing field kinda like <em>Tetris</em>, and also like <em>Tetris</em>, if the dogs spill over the top of the field, it’s game over.</p><p>Merging dogs is the simplest part of the game. It’s where the player has the least control — everything is subject to the whims of gravity, physics, and trajectory — but also where <em>Dogpile</em> is the most thrilling. The dogs themselves are cute, contorted into fun, confounding shapes that sometimes show off a butthole or two. Introducing modifiers like making the dogs bouncy or magnetic adds an interesting physical component to the game — <em>Dogpile</em> is match-3 <em>Tetris</em>, yes, but built with a physics engine. It feels so silly, so “baby distracted by jangling keys” to say that a pug glomming onto another pug to make a dachshund is gameplay action worth highlighting in the year of our gaming lord 2025. But the little guy does so with a satisfying “pop” accompanied by a cute little “arf” that <a href="https://youtu.be/LiFz5J9DHig?si=gvuwe322wcDtZg4x&amp;t=23">like Benoit Blanc, I’m compelled</a>.</p><p>Though the game has nothing to do with poker, you can see the DNA of<em> Balatro</em> running throughout. Like <em>Balatro</em>, each round you’re dealt a hand from a deck of cards that have dogs as the different suits. Also like<em> Balatro</em>, you get money to spend on modifying your deck with more cards and tags that work similar to <em>Balatro</em>’s jokers. For $15 (of in-game money, there are no microtransactions), you can either buy a chow chow card or a tag that makes certain dogs spin in place to agitate the dog pile for more merging opportunities. When you win a round, you also visit the grooming salon where you modify your dog cards directly. You can give a dog positive traits like “friendly,” making them magnetically attracted to their matches. Or you can wash away negative traits like fleas, which negate any positive traits a card might have.</p><p>Building your dog deck full of synergies to increase your points is where <em>Dogpile</em> is the most like <em>Balatro</em> and where the bulk of your strategic thinking comes into play. I like to give my dogs the barking trait that makes them disturb the pile with a bark when they’re dropped. That combined with the tag that awards points every time a dog barks makes for a brain-pleasing display of meters filling up and cash register noises going off that really drives home the fact that a lot of these <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cloverpit-is-a-fun-not-gambling-roguelite-satire-of-capitalism-but-i-would-quite-like-us-to-stop-cashing-in-on-our-own-despair">well-intentioned, celebrated <em>Balatro</em>-likes</a> tap into the psychology of gambling addition to make them stick.</p><p><em>Dogpile</em> doesn’t feel very deep. There are no boss challenges. Failing to meet the point threshold doesn’t end a run, but instead makes you pick from a stock of negative events or traits that are either easily ignored or so detrimental that you lose the game immediately. Unlike <em>Balatro</em>, <em>Dogpile</em> doesn’t inspire the same feeling of endless possibility of the kinds of decks you can build.</p><p><em>Dogpile</em> isn’t the first game to complexify the humble match-3 genre, and I don’t know if its similarities to <em>Balatro</em> are intentional or not. But I like seeing how games can push <em>Balatro</em>’s formula beyond poker — especially if a dog is involved.</p><p>And yes, you can pet them.</p><p><sub><em>Dogpile</em> is out now on Steam.</sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/848041/dogpile-review-inde-game-steam-balatro-puppies]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Even at $1,000, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/799698/xbox-ally-x-review-asus-microsoft-full-screen-experience">the Xbox Ally X handheld</a> didn’t ship with magnetic drift-resistant joysticks, and neither did the $600 model. But for an extra <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G4QW8798?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">$20 at Amazon</a>, you can change that today — with officially Asus-approved and sanctioned TMR joysticks from Gulikit, the company that’s made a name for itself by supplying aftermarket drift-resistant sticks.</p><p>The company says it worked with Xbox Ally manufacturer Asus to create these sticks, that they’ll be “automatically recognized” when you swap them in, and that you can use the handheld’s built-in Armoury Crate app to calibrate them afterwards.</p><p>And while I haven’t tried these ones (I do have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23571821/nintendo-switch-joy-con-joystick-drift-button">a pair in my Switch</a>), I can confirm it’s pretty easy to pop open the Xbox Ally to install. Just loosen the Philips-head screws, poke in a guitar pick pry tool to create a small gap, and pull a little harder than you think you need to pop open the clips. The joystick modules are right underneath. There’s nothing blocking you — just pop a ribbon cable and undo their three screws.</p><p>Here’s the company’s walkthrough in case you want to see for yourself — though I do not recommend taking sharp tweezers to ribbon cables when your fingernails can do that job safer and easier. (I may have broken a few ribbon cables in my life.)</p><p>When we’re talking about TMR or the older and slightly less power-efficient Hall effect joystick technology, I usually write “drift-resistant” instead of “drift-free” because you <em>may</em> find your center point drifting over time — but the beauty of magnetic is you just have to recalibrate! Unlike the potentiometer joysticks that ship with Nintendo, Sony PlayStation, and Microsoft Xbox controllers, you’re not scraping away material that’ll lead to permanent drift as you use the magnetic versions.</p><p>Gulikit’s new Xbox Ally sticks are <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G4QW8798?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">$20 in the US today</a>, and should also be available in the UK for <em>£</em>20, and in Italy, France, and Spain for €22, this January.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/848568/xbox-ally-gulikit-tmr-joysticks]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Friend slop’ made co-op gaming goofier than ever in 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/845347/friend-slop-co-op-games-2025</link>
            <guid>1389040</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When a friend invited me to play a new game called <em>REPO</em> earlier this year, I thought I was wasting my money — not because the game looked bad, but because it looked like <em>Lethal Company</em>. The surprise-hit 2024 co-op survival horror game has players wander through unnerving ruined structures collecting trash while evading monsters. <em>Lethal Company</em> was popular with my friends (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/24040561/lethal-company-roblox-popularity-explained/">and just about everyone else</a>), but its eerie liminal spaces spooked me too much. My friends swore <em>REPO</em> was different, though, that it was so funny it was hard to be scared, especially with its goofy robot avatars — and they were right.</p><p><em>REPO</em> has become one of my favorite games, and was one of the biggest co-op titles of 2025, along with similar indie co-op hit <em>Peak</em>. Over the past several months, the two titles have become the faces of a new niche of games with a somewhat controversial name: “friend slop.”</p><p>The term usually refers to indie co-op games that are best experienced with friends and have an emphasis on humor. They’re typically PC games, cost less than $20, include proximity voice chat, feature wacky game physics, and often fall into the survival horror genre. Friend slop isn’t always scary, though. Some lighthearted flavors of “slop” popped up this year, like <em>Peak</em>, where you attempt to scale increasingly perilous mountains with your friends.</p><p>That’s just the tip — or rather, peak — of the friend slop iceberg. There’s also <em>Guilty as Sock!</em>, where you and your co-op buddies roleplay court showdowns as sock puppets. <em>Lockdown Protocol</em> takes inspiration from <em>Among Us</em>, a precursor to the friend slop trend, where one player attempts to sabotage their friends as they complete chores on a timer in a lonely base. <em>Mage Arena</em> is one of the cheapest friend slop games to arrive this year at just $2.99. It’s also one of the most unique — you compete in magic duels with your friends by verbally shouting spells.</p><p>Friend slop games tend to follow a similar formula: You and your friends need to accomplish something together, but the consequences for failure aren’t particularly intense (and it’s often funnier if you <em>don’t</em> succeed). <em>Peak</em> is a perfect example. I have yet to survive to the end of a run, and yet I keep playing. Winning <em>Peak</em> is great, but the most entertaining part is watching your friends miss a jump and fall off a mountain, eat poisonous food, or get chased down by the scoutmaster for running ahead.</p><p>In friend slop, the main objective is humor. Winning is secondary. If you’re hoping for a deep, nuanced plot, you’ll probably be disappointed. Friend slop games also tend to lose their charm when you’re playing solo. <em>REPO</em> just isn’t the same when there’s no one there to laugh every time you clumsily shatter a vase.</p><p>Therein lies one of the major criticisms of the genre and one of the reasons it’s been labeled “slop” to begin with. While <em>REPO</em> and <em>Peak</em> have been hugely popular this year, some say they’re just designed for viral, clippable moments and lack substance beyond that, partly because they’re not usually fun to play solo.</p><p>That could be a fair drawback depending on what you expect from these games. However, it misses the point of “friend slop” and overlooks a potential explanation for their popularity this year.</p><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> was also one of 2025’s biggest co-op games, and I’ve had a great time with it as well. However, it offers something completely different from <em>REPO</em> or <em>Peak</em> and feels drastically different to play, despite technically being under the same broad co-op umbrella. <em>Nightreign</em> requires concentration, skill, and strategy, whereas <em>REPO</em> mostly just requires you to keep an eye out for monsters while absentmindedly picking up junk. It’s also a much more affordable game than <em>Nightreign</em> and doesn’t hinge on any <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc">prior knowledge of other games</a>.</p><p>That difference highlights one of friend slop’s greatest strengths. For all their arguable faults, friend slop games are approachable. They ask little of you — both in terms of money and time. You don’t even need a particularly powerful PC. These games are a way for people to hang out with friends for little money and laugh with each other. To some, myself included, that’s worth just as much as a rich story or dramatic boss fights.</p><p>This year, we’ve seen the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642143/nintendo-switch-2-games-price-expensive">prices of games soar</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/828337/ram-memory-shortage-crunch-market-prices-central-micro-center">gaming PC hardware is becoming unaffordable</a> for many. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/789734/game-consoles-too-expensive">Almost everything about the hobby has become more expensive</a>. Friend slop games offer an oasis from that with low prices and low hardware requirements, staying accessible to a large swath of gamers, even more so because they’re typically easy to learn how to play. The very things that led some people to call these games “slop” are also part of what has made them so popular in 2025 in particular.</p><p>Paige Wilson, community manager at <em>Peak</em> publisher Aggro Crab, echoed that sentiment. “We actually think friend slop is a fire term,” they told <em>The Verge</em>. “Sure, it started with the intention of [having] a negative connotation, but I think we always saw the term as funny and actually pretty accurate. It’s used to describe a low-cost game that you and your friends can pick up whenever, have some fun, hang out, and expect a bit of jank. I think some people might not view it as this, but we do!”</p><p>In other words, friend slop isn’t so much about the game as it is about the people you play it with. If that’s “slop,” then I’ll gladly embrace the “friend slop” label, too.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/845347/friend-slop-co-op-games-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[The sold-out Nex Playground made my kids laugh and cry]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/848449/nex-playground-review-nintendo-wii-microsoft-kinect-motion-tracking-camera</link>
            <guid>1388980</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you told me last year the Nex Playground would outsell Microsoft’s Xbox, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/844380/nex-playground-outselling-the-xbox">even for two weeks</a>, I would have laughed my way out of the room.</p><p>It’s a three-inch cube of a game console that’s likely less powerful than your phone, one which uses a single camera to track your body. It only plays curated, <a href="https://www.kidsafeseal.com/aboutourseals.html">certified kid-safe</a> games. Though frequently compared to the Nintendo Wii and Microsoft Kinect, the Nex Playground is worse than either at tracking motion.</p><p>Nor is it cheap: $250 upfront <em>plus</em> $89-a-year or $49-a-quarter annual subscription to get more than a basic sampler. If you like a game, you can’t buy it separately. Many are little better than shovelware and most are graphically ugly; I haven’t tried a single game with the charm or polish of Nintendo or the best of Apple Arcade.</p><p>And yet, lying sick in bed with a 99-degree fever, my five-year-old begged me to let her play.</p><p>When we started a game of virtual bowling, even Grandpa wanted in. (Grandpa <em>never</em> wants in.)</p><p>“I want to try again!” said my nine-year-old, after she sent her low-rent airplane plummeting to its doom.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>This one wide-angle camera tracks up to four people.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>They didn’t care that the games were bad. They cared that they were dead simple to pick up and play, no controller and no experience necessary, on a big screen. They cared that the games made them dance and jump and swing their arms, and that their dad looked pretty funny doing the same.</p><p>I just wish the games didn’t make them cry, too.</p><p>Nearly 20 years ago, the Nintendo Wii put an infrared camera and an accelerometer in your hand to tell if you moved your arm fast, slow, closer or further, and track basic orientation. A few years later, Microsoft’s Kinect captured your whole body with no controller at all: it painted your room with a structured pattern of infrared light to estimate your skeletal position in 3D space.</p><p>The Playground is different: a single wide-angle camera up front and HDMI and USB-C power around back, nothing else to plug in. But it also doesn’t “see” 3D depth. It has to estimate your body pose from flat images.</p><div id=":R1j1djeab96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>“Holding” my bowling ball with a six-joint skeletal pose.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The bowling game has fun Christmas unlockables like a gingerbread ball and toy nutcracker pins.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>Sometimes, it’s impressive: by identifying just six joints — shoulders, elbows, hands — you can throw a bowling ball straight down the lane or veer it left and right. But with no real depth perception, it can easily get confused: my nine-year-old couldn’t sit on the couch while my five-year-old was bowling several feet ahead, because the Playground assumed all their limbs belonged to the same person. My youngest cried for several minutes when the eldest raised a hand and accidentally stole her turn.</p><p>Soon it was the eldest’s turn to cry, too, when the Playground lost her hand mid-swing and sent her ball careening into the gutter. She got mad when it happened again.</p><p>There are <em>so</em> many things that can confuse single-camera tracking, and Nex knows it. Warnings include: Don’t wear clothing with repeating patterns. Don’t wear long sleeves. Play in a well-lit room, but not <em>back</em>lit. “Avoid non-players in the camera view.”</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The USB-C power cable comes with a detachable magnetic camera privacy cover</em>.</figcaption></p></div><p>These all help a single camera tell people from their background — but parents know some are harder than they sound! Our kids get game time after their evening bath, which means PJs. Have you seen kids’ PJs? They have long sleeves and repeating patterns. Hearts. Stars. Smiley faces. Repeating cats and unicorns till the cows come home.</p><p>We had to roll up sleeves and rethink seating. Realistically, “Avoid non-players in the camera view” meant clearing the entire living room of anyone who wasn’t bowling, having them stand far off to the side, so that the camera didn’t suddenly snap to the wrong person mid-play. Sometimes we could sit on the couch with hands hidden behind blankets or laptops.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The bundled remote. Most games make you switch to it for navigating menus; rarely used for gameplay.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Even so, my kids frequently got too frustrated with the controls. “I can’t keep my hand steady! I just can’t keep it steady!” complained my five-year-old, trying to send her cute puppy for a spa treatment in Nex’s <em>Nintendogs</em>-like game. Many games don’t penalize kids for swinging their arms wildly, but some inexplicably require dragging a cursor to press virtual buttons.</p><p>It also feels like the Playground lags behind my movements, even plugged directly into a low-latency OLED TV with Game Mode turned on. In Nex’s kart racer game, I couldn’t turn the steering wheel as fast as I wanted in its fastest 150cc mode.</p><p>Again, the issues didn’t stop us from having fun, particularly when with games that don’t require precision. The kids had a blast <a href="https://www.nexplayground.com/games/mirrorama">with <em>Mirrorama</em></a><em>,</em> which turns your TV into a giant mirror with magical camera filters that let kids shoot lightning bolts from their hands, stretch their face, blur like as speedy as Sonic the Hedgehog, dance with their own clone.</p><p><sup><em>Mirrorama, above, made my kids laugh the most. </em></sup></p><p>They enjoyed <a href="https://www.nexplayground.com/games/copy-cat-deluxe"><em>Copy Cat</em></a>, where they just had to strike a zany cartoon pose and let AI judge who did it better. Meanwhile, I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwBAO7kifFA"><em>Brick Buster</em></a> to be an excellent Breakout clone — you only need move your body left or right to move the paddle, which is forgivingly large, and thrilling multiball action makes it fun.</p><p>I can’t say we’d get our money’s worth, though, because so many games are simple and inanely repetitive, or — like <em>Connect 4</em> <em>Bounce</em>, where my kid and I gave up trying to get balls to even go in — frustrating from the get-go. Many sports games are either laughably easy or have a large learning curve because the camera can’t see depth, so it can’t detect how you’re hitting a ball. With tennis, for example, you can’t aim with your arm: it only controls the timing of your swing. You have to move the rest of your body to aim left or right.</p><p>One of Nex’s biggest marketing points is that it’s already attracted huge kid brands to the platform: Bluey, Peppa Pig, Gabby’s Dollhouse, Sesame Street, How to Train Your Dragon, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. But my kids weren’t necessarily sold.</p><p><sup><em>Bluey, is one of the better licensed experiences — but my Bluey-loving kids weren’t that into it.</em></sup></p><p>They seemed entranced at first with <a href="https://www.nexplayground.com/games/unicorn-academy-friendship-adventures"><em>Unicorn Academy</em></a>, but quickly disappointed when they couldn’t ride the unicorn anywhere interesting. The TMNT game is a frustrating endless runner where you constantly have to hop into the air to clear obstacles, though I suppose it could help tire out my kids. And even though they love <em>Bluey</em>, my kids quickly asked me to quit its too-repetitive balloon-bouncing game.</p><p>There’s enough in the Playground’s library that I bet your kids will find <em>something</em> they enjoy. My eldest wants to go visit her puppy, and the other night at dinner, my youngest erupted into cheers of “Bowling!!! I love bowling!!!” when we said we might play it again. Despite countless tracking failures, they say that Nex’s <em>Flappy Bird</em> clone, where up to four people hop in the air to keep their dragons eating fruit instead of crashing into towers, is one of their favs.</p><p>I think the Playground is far too much money for not nearly enough game. But it goes to show fun isn’t all about quality of execution. Many classic arcade games are frustratingly unfair, even broken — but sometimes you just want another turn to beat the machine.</p><p><em>Photography by Sean Hollister / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/848449/nex-playground-review-nintendo-wii-microsoft-kinect-motion-tracking-camera]]></content:encoded>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>On Friday, retro and arcade game publisher ININ Games surprisingly announced it’s been able to “recalculate production” on offering a physical version of <em>R-Type Dimensions III </em>for the Switch 2 because “Two days ago Nintendo announced two new smaller cartridge sizes for Nintendo Switch 2.” Physical games on the Switch 2 have been something of a contentious topic; full physical games are reportedly expensive for developers, while game-key cards don’t actually have the game on the cart.</p><p>But later in the day, ININ removed that line from its post and published <a href="https://x.com/ININ_Games/status/2002062795857174721">a significant correction</a>: “There has been no official announcement or confirmation from Nintendo concerning cartridge storage capacities. Any references to specific storage sizes should not be interpreted as official information from Nintendo.” However, it will still be able to offer the physical Switch 2 version of <em>R-Type Dimensions III</em>, though by tacking on €10 to the retail price.</p><p>Nintendo didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Solid information about why more developers don’t offer games fully on-cartridge is hard to find, though it may come down to cost. In May, a Brazilian Nintendo journalist <a href="https://x.com/necrolipe/status/1921315639563608384?s=19">reported that</a>, based on leaks from Arc System Works, Nintendo only offered two types of physical games for developers: a 64GB cartridge and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/643635/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-explained">game-key card</a>. The YouTube channel Physical Paradise has <a href="https://youtu.be/x1wCUjEwklg?si=PhTU7qqhdB_t7nFT&amp;t=274">also reported that</a> the cost of a physical cartridge is “about” $16, “which is quite expensive.”</p><p>Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad, replying to ININ Games’ initial announcement about the new cartridge sizes, <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/2002066817704194487">said on X that</a> “cost was always the primary factor between key cards vs full cart releases.”</p><div><div><p id="do-you-know-the-actual-cost-of-switch-2-cartridges"><h2>Do you know the actual cost of Switch 2 cartridges?</h2></p></div><p>If you do, please email me at jay.peters@theverge.com or message me on Signal @jaypeters.11.</p></div><p>It’s unclear exactly how much more affordable additional cartridge capacity sizes could be or why the company might offer them to developers now. New York University games professor Joost van Dreunen tells me it could be because of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/839353/pc-ram-shortage-pricing-spike-news">rising cost of memory</a>; his two cents is that this “is in anticipation of memory going up in cost soon, allowing Nintendo to charge a more reasonable price especially for third-party games.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/848462/nintendo-switch-2-smaller-cartridges-inin-games]]></content:encoded>
