He previously wrote for <em>Business Insider, Rolling Stone, </em><em>Futurism, </em>and <em>Popular Science.</em></span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo has made some of the most iconic video games of all time, but building a library of the standouts can quickly become expensive, especially given that many titles don’t often go on sale at a significant discount. The good news is that Nintendo is already running a holiday sale in the run-up to Black Friday, allowing you to save on Nintendo Switch games, amiibo, and accessories through November 28th.</p><p>The biggest news is that Nintendo and select retailers are offering some of the Switch’s best games — including <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-Odyssey-US-Version-Switch/dp/B01MY7GHKJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Super Mario Odyssey</a> </em>and <em><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-nintendo-switch-oled-model-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-lite%2FJ7GSL5J54Z" rel="sponsored">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a></em> — for as little as $29.99, which amounts to a healthy $30 discount. In some cases, these games are at their lowest price ever, and we don’t expect any of them to be this heavily discounted again until “MAR10 Day” rolls around next year.</p><p>Typically, Nintendo offers a discount on a Switch bundle that includes a digital copy of <em>Mario Kart: 8 Deluxe</em> or some other first-party title, but that doesn’t seem to be happening this year. The company has openly admitted that it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/814273/nintendo-switch-2-console-primary-focus-pivot">shifting its focus</a> to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Switch 2</a> — which isn’t on sale and isn’t expected to be anytime soon — and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717325/nintendo-switch-price-hike-tariffs">recently raised the price</a> of the original Switch due to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">President Trump’s tariff policy</a>.</p><p>Sadly, no Switch 2 games are part of the promo; however, you can play the discounted OG Switch titles on Nintendo’s latest console. Plus, if you are looking for deals related to the Switch 2, <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/plus/hot-deals-on-video-games?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=CJ&amp;cjevent=b9fde1fbc89911f0839901040a1cb826&amp;utm_source=Vox+Media&amp;utm_term=b9fde1fbc89911f0839901040a1cb826" rel="sponsored">Woot is still running a video game promo</a> through the end of today, November 23rd, giving you a chance to save on newer releases like <em><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2-edition-2/" rel="sponsored">Mario Kart World</a></em> and the Switch 2 Edition of <em><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition-3" rel="sponsored">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em>.</p><div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODI2NDI2"><p><span>$<!-- -->30</span></p><div><p><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> remains one of the crowning achievements of the original Switch thanks to its tight platforming, ingenious level design, and a game mechanic that lets you control certain enemies and parts of the environment. There are still bosses to battle and coins to collect, but <em>Odyssey</em> feels like a breath of fresh air. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODI2NTM0"><p><span>$<!-- -->30</span></p><div><p><em>Princess Peach: Showtime!</em> is the first Nintendo game to star the Mushroom Kingdom royal in nearly 20 years, and it’s a welcome return to form. Peach finds herself having to fight, puzzle, and platform her way through different sets in a community theater. She inhabits a different role — with different abilities — in each stage, which keeps the game engaging. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24112407/princess-peach-showtime-review-nintendo-switch">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODI2NTAy"><p><span>$<!-- -->30</span></p><div><p><em>Donkey Kong Country HD </em>is the definitive version of the tough-as-nails platformer, which initially launched on the Wii in 2016. Don’t let the game’s cartoonish art, bopping soundtrack, and side-scrolling gameplay fool you, though; it will test your skills. That said, it’s still a blast to work your way through the game’s tougher sections, which require both precision and patience. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24343009/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review-nintendo-switch">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODI2NDkz"><p><span>$<!-- -->30</span></p><div><p><em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>finally lets you play as Nintendo’s titular heroine. The game’s basic premise revolves around trying to save the world using the fabled Tri Rod, an item that allows you to replicate the spirits of items and enemies you encounter along the way. The game mixes the top-down perspective of 2D <em>Zelda </em>games with gameplay from the series’ newer, open-world 3D entries. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODI2NTA4"><p><span>$<!-- -->40</span></p><div><p><em>Luigi’s Mansion 3</em> is the series’s most ambitious title, even though it retains the Luigi-as-a-Ghostbuster gameplay the series has employed since 2001. It takes place in a haunted hotel overrun with ghosts. To deal with them, you’ll need the help of Gooigi, a doppelgänger made of goop that can help you explore every nook and cranny. The game’s slapstick humor outweighs any spookiness. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20942003/luigis-mansion-3-review-nintendo-switch-gooigi-comedy">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODI2NTQx"><p><span>$<!-- -->30</span></p><div><p><em>Nintendo Switch Sports </em>didn’t change the world the way <em>Wii Sports</em> did in 2006, but it remains a fun party game. You can choose from six sports, including tennis and bowling, and use a single Switch Joy-Con as a motion controller. There’s an element of “swing the controller and hope the correct action happens on screen,” but it’s still a good time to play with friends. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/27/23044617/nintendo-switch-sports-wii-sports-party-game">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODI2NTQ5"><p><span>$<!-- -->30</span></p><div><p><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> is generally regarded as the best <em>Mario </em>RPG, and the Switch remake is well worth revisiting. Mario has more paper-like abilities than he did in the original <em>Paper Mario </em>game (including the option to turn into a paper airplane), and Nintendo didn’t feel the need to shake up the battle system or other gameplay elements like they did in subsequent entries. </p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODI2NTU1"><p><span>$<!-- -->17</span></p><div><p><em>Splatoon 3 </em>is the latest entry in Nintendo’s paint-laden shooter franchise, and the hook this time around is a deeper single-player mode. You’ll assume the role of an undercover agent fighting through a city using a mix of shooting and platforming. As you progress, you’ll begin to find artifacts of the pre-apocalypse that shine a light on what happened in the <em>Splatoon</em> universe. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23339801/splatoon-3-review-nintendo-switch">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODI2NTIz"><p><span>$<!-- -->40</span></p><div><p><em>Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe</em> is another HD remake of a Wii game, but it introduces additional abilities, mini games, and an entirely new section that’s available once you complete the original story. The game doesn’t shake up the <em>Kirby </em>formula, but it’s still a fun game to play — especially with friends, as it supports four-player local co-op.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODI2NTU4"><p><span>$<!-- -->10</span></p><div><p>Tulin is a Rito and the Sage of Wind from <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>.
