FSE launched with the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X, and it has so far only been available on PC handhelds.</p><p>The expansion to laptops, desktops, and tablets is available as part of new Windows Insider Preview Builds on the Dev and Beta channels <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/21/the-full-screen-experience-is-available-for-xbox-insiders-starting-today/">and for</a> people in the Xbox Insider Program. To turn on FSE on your PC, “hover over the Task View icon on your taskbar and choose Xbox full screen experience,” <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/11/21/full-screen-experience-expands-to-more-windows-11-pc-form-factors-for-windows-insiders/">Microsoft says</a>. “You can also open Xbox full screen experience in Game Bar &gt; Settings or by pressing Win + F11 to toggle the experience.”</p><p>However, even if you’re a Windows Insider, you may not have the access to FSE right away, as Microsoft says the feature is “gradually rolling out” with the new Windows Insider builds. It also requires that you have the Xbox app from the Microsoft store.</p><div><p>As of Friday, the company has started rolling out FSE <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/825405/microsoft-xbox-full-screen-experience-available-windows-handhelds">to all Windows-based handhelds</a>, too.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/826695/microsoft-xbox-full-screen-experience-pc-laptop-tablet-windows-insider]]></content:encoded>
