            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/620170/microsoft-official-xbox-wireless-controller-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/quentyn-kennemer">Quentyn Kennemer</a> <span>is a writer who helps The Verge’s readers save money by surfacing the best tech deals and presenting the latest product recommendations from our experts. He has covered tech and gaming for all of his 15-plus-year career for publications like Forbes, Business Insider, and more.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Of the three major gaming consoles, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review">Xbox Series X</a> / S may have the most diverse controller selection, but Microsoft’s basic <strong>Xbox Wireless Controller</strong> is still the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025443/best-xbox-controllers-one-series-x-s">best Xbox controller</a> for most people. That’s mostly because it’s the cheapest one you can buy with native support for Xbox’s built-in wireless protocol (you can also use it with PC and mobile via Bluetooth or USB-C), but it’s also just really solid overall.</p><p>It’s hard to beat the value, especially when they’re on sale for as low as $39, just a few dollars more than their all-time low, as they are in select colors at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K4HLCPR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Carbon-Black%2F1361877204" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a> right now. That’ll get you the basic crop of colors such as black, white, and blue. You can spend a bit more to get the awesome translucent models, which are starting at $57.50 (about $12 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DC8317V9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Carbon-Black%2F9585711722" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->39</span></p><div><p>The official Xbox Wireless Controller has a dedicated share button for saving clips and screenshots and sharing them online, Bluetooth support, and a USB-C port for charging up Microsoft’s play-and-charge rechargeable battery.</p></div></div><p>The Xbox Wireless Controller isn’t loaded with fancy features and gimmicks like newer, more expensive controllers. You can’t easily remove or replace any of its parts, for example, nor does it have back buttons, sensitivity adjustments, or built-in means for customizing and swapping button mapping configurations. But it still sets the standard for how a controller should look, feel, and work. The ergonomic shape and button layout are still the most widely emulated of any controller, perhaps ever.</p><p>Some people still scoff that it doesn’t have a rechargeable internal battery, but that’s a point in its favor. Its versatile battery bay lets you either use standard AA batteries or slot in a rechargeable pack. Some of those batteries offer much more play time than controllers with built-in batteries. You’ll never have to plug it in or dock it if you have a charged spare handy, and you won’t have to dismantle an entire controller or shell out for a replacement once they run dry</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/618887/dragonite-and-the-special-delivery-pokemon-day-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/charles-pulliam-moore">Charles Pulliam-Moore</a> <span>is a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s technically already Pokémon Day in Japan, and while we’re still a few hours away from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/616289/pokemon-presents">this year’s big Pokémon Presents showcase</a>, there’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pokemon/617216/oh-yes-wait-a-minute-mr-postmon">a new animated short film</a> out that right now feels like the perfect way to get pumped up for whatever surprises Nintendo has in store.</p><p>Many of the Pokémon Company’s animated projects outside of the mainline anime have been fun explorations of what people and their pokémon get up to besides battling. But director Maho Aoki’s <em>Dragonite and the Special Delivery</em> also feels like a reminder to thank your mail carriers for all the hard work they do. Produced by CoMix Wave Films — the studio behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/15/23678724/makoto-shinkai-suzume-interview"><em>Suzume</em></a>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113522/weathering-with-you-review-climate-change-makoto-shinkai">Weathering With You</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/7/15209584/your-name-love">Your Name</a></em> — <em>Dragonite and the Special Delivery </em>tells the story of Hana (Riko Fukumoto), a young Paldean postal worker who dreams of becoming an expert deliveryperson.</p><p>While most deliverypeople get the chance to venture out into the world, as a letter sorter, Hana’s days are usually spent behind a desk with her partner Fuecoco. But when Hana happens to find an unaddressed letter from a young boy who is trying to wish his traveling father a happy birthday, she recognizes it as an opportunity to prove that she has what it takes to become one of the postal system’s greats like a certain friendly Dragonite.</p><p>The short spotlights how it takes all kinds of specialized human and pokémon labor to keep the inter-regional postal system running smoothly. Unsurprisingly, CoMix Wave’s take on the pokémon world is a visual delight that makes all of the short’s creatures look downright majestic regardless of whether they’re ordinary or legendary monsters. The short also features a sweeping shot of Kalos’ Lumiose City and quite a few pokémon capable of Mega Evolution.</p><div><p>Those details could be a nod to the location and mechanic <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date">both returning in <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> (and Flygon<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/twzg0f/oc_why_did_flygons_mega_evolution_have_to_be/"> finally getting its due</a>), but we won’t know for sure until tomorrow morning.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
