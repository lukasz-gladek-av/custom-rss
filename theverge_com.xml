            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/632679/analogue-pocket-dock-update-nintendo-switch-online-wireless-controllers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Analogue has released a new firmware update for its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22831589/analogue-pocket-review">Pocket handheld</a> with bug fixes and expanded support for wireless controllers. PocketOS v2.5 — <a href="https://www.analogue.co/support/pocket/firmware/2.5">available for download here</a> — fixes an issue with backup save exports for Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, but also introduces a long list of updates for the Pocket’s TV dock accessory that improves wireless gamepad compatibility and adds official support for Nintendo’s NES and Sega Genesis controllers.</p><p>Similar to the dock that streamlines connecting the Nintendo Switch to a TV, the Analogue Dock is an optional accessory for the Pocket that lets you play retro games on a larger screen. The Dock also includes wireless controller connectivity, and over time has expanded support to include everything from PlayStation controllers to the Switch’s Joy-Cons.</p><div><p>PocketOS 2.5 fixes button mapping issues with the wireless Super Nintendo and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688780/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-64-sega-genesis-controllers">N64 controllers Nintendo released</a> to make the experience of playing retro games through its Switch Online service feel more authentic. The new update also adds support for Nintendo’s NES and Genesis wireless gamepads to the Dock, as <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/03/analogue-pocket-now-supports-every-nintendo-switch-online-controller">spotted by <em>Time Extension</em></a>, which previously only <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnaloguePocket/comments/y1qo5l/nso_nes_controller/">worked when used with a third-party Bluetooth dongle</a>.</p></div><p>The Analogue Pocket’s support for game cartridges is limited to mostly older handhelds (TurboGrafx-16 games are supported through an adapter) including the Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Game Gear. But it was designed with additional field-programmable gate array (FPGA) architecture allowing it to replicate the behavior of many different consoles. That includes the <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/guides/all-analogue-pocket-openfpga-cores-and-where-to-download-them">Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis</a> through the use of ROM files instead of cartridges, which can now be played using the appropriate gamepads.</p><div><p>Analogue also announced yesterday that its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631816/analogue-3d-delay-nintendo-64-modretro-teaser">reimagined 4K Nintendo 64 console was delayed yet again</a> and is now expected to ship “by July 2025.”</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
