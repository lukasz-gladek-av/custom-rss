The 27-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor that a couple of <em>Verge </em>staffers have tested is <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/alienware-27-4k-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-aw2725q/apd/210-brfr/monitors-monitor-accessories" rel="sponsored">$699.99</a> right now, which is $200 off its original $899.99 price. It has sold at a similar price before, but discounts have been infrequent these past several months.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6NzE4MTI2"><p><span>$<!-- -->700</span></p><div><p>Alienware’s AW2725Q is a 26.7-inch 4K OLED gaming monitor with a 240Hz refresh rate, .03ms of latency, two HDMI 2.1 ports, one DisplayPort 1.4 port, and support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro.</p></div></div><p>I love this monitor (I published a review earlier this year at <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/impressions/531783/alienware-qd-oled-monitor-27-4k-aw2725q-specs-impressions-buy/">Polygon</a></em>). My colleague Nathan Edwards digs it, too, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/784323/upgrading-240hz-oled-gaming-monitor">posting recently</a> about how making the jump to a high-refresh-rate 240Hz OLED can truly spoil you. I can attest to this; it was a little heartbreaking to go back to my 1080p IPS panels after returning the AW2725Q to Alienware.</p><p>This Alienware monitor made waves in early 2025 by proving that companies could deliver a 4K OLED for under $1,000. It wasn’t all that long ago that 1440p was the standard at that price. Whether you actually have a PC that can play games in 4K at respectable frame rates or not, it’s good to have a monitor that’s ready to play high-resolution content for when you upgrade your PC. Also, you can connect a console like a PS5, Xbox Series X, or a Nintendo Switch 2 to play titles at up to 4K at 120Hz, and they’ll look great on the AW2725Q’s 16:9 aspect ratio.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/796918/amazon-october-prime-day-alienware-aw2725q-oled-gaming-monitor-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span id="follow-author-standard_article_details-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjA5MzU0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span></span><span>Terrence O'Brien</span></span></span></p> <p><span>is the Verge’s weekend editor. He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Americans are spending more on game consoles in 2025, compared to August of last year, and that’s mostly thanks to the Nintendo Switch 2 and tariffs. Hardware sales topped $312 million in the US in August, up 32 percent from $236 million in August of 2024, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m2op74cc4s26">according to Circana</a>. That’s a huge increase, especially considering that sales of the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and original Switch all fell by double-digit percentage points year over year.</p><p>A big driver is the Switch 2, which has sold over 2.4 million units in the US during its first three months, making it the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">fastest selling console</a> of all time. It’s outpacing the PlayStation 4 (the previous record holder) by a full five percent after the three month mark. And compared to the original Switch, the Switch 2 is absolutely crushing — outpacing its predecessor by 77 percent at this stage of its lifecycle.</p><p>Consumer spending on game consoles in the US is up to $2.9 billion for the year, 20 percent higher than last year. But while the number of consoles sold is up 6.5 percent year-over-year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/782532/game-console-price-hikes-xbox-ps5-switch">prices are up 12.3 percent</a>, accounting for most of the increase in spending. A 512GB Xbox Series S started the year at $299.99, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">is now $399.99</a>. The all-digital Series X started at $449.99, and is now all the way up to $599.99. Similarly all PlayStation 5 models have seen a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762410/sony-ps5-price-hike-raise-digital-pro">$50 price bump</a>.</p><p>Despite the soaring prices, consumers haven’t been scared off yet. But, while $799.99 for a tricked out 2TB Xbox Series X in Galaxy Black is hard to swallow, we haven’t quite reached <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/7/17830868/neo-geo-mini-review-arcade-imperfect">Neo Geo prices</a> yet. That handheld debuted at $649.99 in 1990 — or about $1,500 in today’s money. So, the bar is pretty high.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjA5MzU0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Terrence O'Brien</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/797023/circana-video-game-consoles-switch-2-tariffs]]></content:encoded>
