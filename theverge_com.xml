            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Switch 2 exclusive list is getting longer with the racing game <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> coming to the console on November 20th. Today, Nintendo offered a luxurious 45 minutes devoted to its<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/31/23663707/kirby-interview-gdc-2023-kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo"> cutest pink blob</a> who, when you think about it, is really an eldritch horror of incalculable power. Here are the highlights from the <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> Direct.</p><p>Before even getting to the action of <em>Air Riders</em>, we were greeted with a smiling but tired sigh <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22823897/masahiro-sakurai-interview-super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch">from director (and Kirby’s dad) Masahiro Sakurai</a>. He explained that he was approached to lead <em>Air Riders</em> while he was working on <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> DLC, and that the new Kirby is a collaboration between his studio Sora and Bandai Namco.</p><p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> takes the original GameCube classic and modernizes it for the Switch 2. You can choose many more riders to play as instead of just Kirby including King Dedede, Banana Waddle Dee, and some cool-looking guy I just heard of named Knuckle Joe. The game also supports up to eight players in local wireless play or up to 16 players online.</p><p>And what will you do with those other 15 players? There’s races, point challenges, battle arenas, and good ole’ fashioned exploration. In <em>Air Riders</em> you can choose any number of racing machines, each with their own unique traits, and upgrade them to your hearts content. Is your paper glider machine too fragile? Spend some time exploring, gathering power ups to make it beefier. Then use your newly improved machine in a challenge designed to take advantage of your racer’s new stats.</p><p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is the first game directed by Masahiro Sakurai ever since<a href="https://kotaku.com/please-for-the-love-of-god-let-masahiro-sakurai-rest-1845241032"> Nintendo’s tiredest soldier</a> finished up work on<em> Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>. In the interim, he’s been<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/24/23320915/masahiro-sakurai-youtube-channel-creating-games"> running a series of educational videos on YouTube</a> sharing his experiences and lessons learned in game development while also, apparently, directing A<em>ir Riders. </em></p><p>That <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is showing up now along with *<strong>inhales</strong>* <em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em>, has bolstered my<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/12/23205240/kirby-dream-buffet-nintendo-wholesome"> Kirby Theory of Distress</a> which hypothesizes that Nintendo releases a Kirby game whenever the world is in worse than average trouble. Kirby comes to save us once again in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> launching on the Switch 2 November 20th.</p><p>In the meantime, Switch Online subscribers can get an early taste of the game’s soundtrack through the Nintendo Music app, which just added seven tracks ahead of <em>Air Riders</em>’ launch.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/761317/kirby-air-riders-release-date-november]]></content:encoded>

Shipping is expected to start as early as October 2025. Although the company is concurrently <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/flip-1s-flip-dual-screen-full-keyboard-handheld#/">running another Indiegogo campaign</a> for a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684190/ayaneo-flip-1s-ds-nintendo-windows-handheld-dual-screen">similar dual-screen handheld called the Flip 1S</a>, that device features more powerful specs, runs Windows 11, and starts at $1,279 with discounts, while the less expensive Pocket DS runs Android 13.</p></div><p>There are currently many handhelds that replicate the design and functionality of Nintendo’s iconic portables, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22831589/analogue-pocket-review">Game Boy</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24303052/modretro-chromatic-review-game-boy-color-handheld-palmer-luckey">Game Boy Color</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24314884/anbernic-rg34xx-handheld-emulator-retro-nintendo-game-boy-advance">Game Boy Advance</a>, but few can properly recreate the Nintendo DS experience, which is still Nintendo’s best-selling console of all time. The new Pocket DS potentially fits that bill with a 7-inch, 16:9, 1080P OLED folding top screen paired with a smaller 5-inch, 4:3, 1,024x768 LCD display on the handheld itself.</p><p>It will be powered by a very capable Snapdragon G3x Gen 2 processor, but we don’t yet know what the Pocket DS’ emulation capabilities will be. The entry-level model features 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage (expandable through a microSD card slot), but the Pocket DS can be configured with up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, pushing its price to $759, or $639 with early backer discounts.</p><p>The handheld also features a pair of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">anti-drift TMR joysticks</a>, Hall effect triggers with sensitivity adjustments, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, gyroscopic controls, a fingerprint scanning power button, and an 8,000mAh battery. Ayaneo hasn’t revealed the handheld’s actual battery life, but it will offer multiple performance modes and the ability to turn off the second screen for those trying to max out their playtime.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/761296/ayaneo-pocket-ds-dual-screen-handheld-android-13]]></content:encoded>
