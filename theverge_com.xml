He joined in 2018, and after a stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Corsair wasn’t joking around when it named the new $99.99 Sabre V2 Pro Ultralight Wireless gaming mouse. At 36 grams, it weighs just a bit more than seven US nickels. Is that <em>too </em>light? Maybe. Most of Corsair’s competitors haven’t shipped a mouse much below 50 grams (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/757680/sony-inzone-pc-gaming-headset-keyboard-mouse-hands-on">Sony’s new Inzone mouse</a> is 48 grams). I could flick it across my desk with relative ease, and that’s the point of lightweight mice. The Sabre V2 Pro is made to be easy to move so players can more quickly react in fast-paced games.</p><p>Even so, it doesn’t seem like Corsair cut too many corners to reduce the weight. The company claims its tiny 210mAh battery can last up to 70 hours per charge over a 2.4GHz wireless connection with its default 1,000Hz polling rate. The Sabre V2 Pro also supports 8,000Hz polling, letting your PC register a movement or input at 0.125ms, but battery life will dive to just 16 hours per charge in that mode. Peripheral makers love to brag about 8,000Hz polling, but most people’s reaction speeds aren’t anywhere close to sub-millisecond sensitivity, so you can probably save your battery.</p><p>The Sabre V2 Pro has a symmetrical shape, but is built for right-handed for PC gamers, with two thumb buttons on its left side. Corsair includes grip tape that can be applied to the main buttons and to the sides to customize how it feels to hold.</p><p>Tweaking this mouse’s DPI, macros, and other settings won’t require a software installation. Corsair is launching a browser-based configurator for the Sabre V2 Pro. This is slowly becoming the norm with PC gaming accessories geared toward pros. Allowing access to settings via a browser makes it easy to quickly make adjustments from any internet-connected PC, which makes them more useful during tournament play.</p><p>The Sabre V2 Pro is available now in black or white.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/776782/corsair-sabre-v2-pro-ultralight-gaming-mouse-weight-specs-price#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/776782/corsair-sabre-v2-pro-ultralight-gaming-mouse-weight-specs-price]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Epic is continuing its attempts to turn <em>Fortnite</em> into a platform that’s bigger than just battle royale — this time by giving creators the ability to make and sell in-game items. <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-developers-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items?lang=en-US">Starting in December</a>, <em>Fortnite</em> creators will be able to sell items directly from the islands they’ve built, using new tools that will be launching later on.</p><p>The benefit, of course, is that creators on the platform will have a new revenue stream (currently, they earn revenue primarily based on engagement numbers). And Epic says that they’ll normally earn “50 percent of the V-Bucks value from sales in their islands,” though through 2026 that number will temporarily be at 100 percent presumably to encourage developers to take part. As for what “V-Bucks value” entails, well, it’s a complicated calculation.</p><p>Here’s Epic’s explanation:</p><div><blockquote><p>To determine the V-Bucks value in US dollars in a given month, we take all customer real-money spending to purchase V-Bucks (converted to US Dollars), subtract platform and store fees (ranging from 12 percent on Epic Games Store to 30 percent on current consoles), and divide it by the total V-Bucks spent by players. Fortnite’s average platform and store fees are currently 26 percent (with specific fees ranging from 12 percent on the Epic Games Store to 30 percent on console platforms). So, 50 percent of V-Bucks value translates to ~37 percent of retail spending, and 100 percent of V-Bucks value translates to ~74 percent.</p></blockquote></div><p>In terms of actually creating these items, Epic says that creators will be able to utilize “a Verse-based API and new UEFN tools to create and offer purchasable durable items and consumable items in their games,” and that details are coming “soon.”</p><p>Meanwhile, in November Epic will be adding a “sponsored” row to <em>Fortnite</em>’s discover feed, which will let creators spend money for increased visibility for their islands. Also coming is a community tool that will let creators speak more directly to players for sharing updates and soliciting feedback.</p><p>Notably, Epic says that it will be taking a cut of both the sponsored row and user-created item sales because it has been “operating the business at a loss.” The developer explains that “This model will enable Epic to cover the costs of servicing the <em>Fortnite</em> ecosystem. The funds that don’t go back to creators contribute to server hosting costs, safety and moderation costs, R&amp;D and other operating expenses.”</p><div><p>Today’s announcement is just the latest in a string of updates meant to expand <em>Fortnite</em> from a single, massively popular shooter to a platform for games, much like Roblox. Things really kicked off at the end of 2023 with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic">the launch of Epic-made games like <em>Lego Fortnite</em> and <em>Fortnite Festival</em></a>, and since then the developer has added new creators tools like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24258447/fortnite-creators-first-person-shooters-fps-unreal-editor">the ability to make first-person shooters</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite/679077/epic-games-fortnite-creators-ai-npcs-darth-vader">the introduction of AI characters</a>.</p></div><p>At the beginning of the year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349588/epic-paid-fortnite-creators-a-total-of-352m-in-2024">Epic said that it had paid out $352 million to creators in 2024</a>, with user-made games accounting for more than 36 percent of time spent in <em>Fortnite</em>. Today the company said that it had paid out a total of $722 million to date.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/780819/fortnite-creators-sell-items#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/780819/fortnite-creators-sell-items]]></content:encoded>
