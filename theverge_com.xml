This year, the lineup became even more powerful and spec-packed while still retaining the low-profile and portable 14-inch design that initially drew us to it. If you’re looking to make an upgrade soon, there’s a temporary $350 discount at Best Buy on a configuration that I think is a great choice for gamers who prefer to play titles at their highest graphics settings.</p><p>Normally $2,399.99, the discounted price of $2,049.99 at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-rog-zephyrus-g14-14-3k-oled-120hz-gaming-laptop-copilot-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-9-hx-32gb-ram-nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-1tb-platinum-white%2F6613954.p" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> gets you the model that features a 2,880 x 1,800 OLED screen at 120Hz with G-Sync, AMD’s Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor, Nvidia’s RTX 5070 Ti graphics chip, 32GB of 7,500MHz DDR5 RAM, and 1TB of storage. It’s not particularly tough to find a gaming laptop with these specs. However, I think it’s a feat to cram them all into a laptop that’s small and light enough to easily bring on trips, and to deliver it at a price that’s not too high considering what you’re getting.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/713731/asus-rog-g14-zephyrus-gaming-laptop-5070ti-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
