            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/1/24310104/intel-arc-b570-battlemage-gpu-leaked-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Intel is expected to release a pair of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/29/24309086/intel-battlemage-gpu-leak-arc-b580-b570">entry-level Battlemage GPUs this week</a>, and now marketing materials posted <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qicvhaddltmw5jeupfi73dqu?ref_src=embed">by reliable leaker Roland Quandt</a> show what we might see from the lower-specced Arc B570. The leaked materials, which have details for a dual-fan ASRock Arc B570 Challenger OC GPU, suggest that the new chip may feature 18 Xe2 cores and 10GB of GDDR6 VRAM on a 160-bit memory bus.</p><p>The leak also indicates that Intel’s Arc B570 chip could come with the 8-pin PCIe power connector and a 2.6GHz GPU clock, along with support for HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 2.1. </p><p>The rumored specs for the Arc B570’s slightly more powerful counterpart — the Arc B580 — have been floating around as well. An early Amazon listing <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-arc-b570-specs-leaked-18-xe2-cores-10gb-memory-and-pcie-4-0x8">spotted by <em>VideoCardz</em></a> suggests that the Arc B580 could arrive with 20 Xe2 cores, 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM on a 192-bit memory bus, a 2.8GHz GPU clock, and an 8-pin PCIe power connector.</p><p>Judging by these specs, it seems Intel’s Battlemage chips are designed to compete with more affordable graphics cards, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23734022/nvidia-rtx-4060-ti-amd-rx-7600-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test">like the Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti and AMD Radeon RX 7600</a>. Though we still don’t know how much Intel’s new chips will cost, a product listing shared by <a href="https://x.com/momomo_us/status/1861788237456711881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1861788237456711881%7Ctwgr%5E0f3b2be26b93fa4b7b0634731f5fc84a40464720%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F11%2F29%2F24309086%2Fintel-battlemage-gpu-leak-arc-b580-b570">@Momomo_us</a> shows Intel’s “Limited Edition” B580 card priced at $250 — less than the $399 RTX 4060Ti and $269 Radeon RX 7600.</p><p>The reveal of Intel’s new Battlemage GPUs is just days away, as the company confirmed that it will make an Arc-related announcement on December 3rd at 9AM ET from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/intelgaming">its YouTube channel</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/30/24305460/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-concert-eminem-snoop-juice-wrld-ice-spice<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fortnite</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/30/24308372/fortnite-remix-finale-concert-juice-wrld-chapter-6-how-to-watch">most recent virtual concert</a> was supersized in multiple ways. Unlike previous events, which focused on specific artists like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling">Ariana Grande</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/29/24187226/fortnite-metallica-concert-interview">Metallica</a>, this one featured a cast of four different artists: Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Ice Spice, and the late Juice WRLD. And it turned each one of the large lineup into a kaiju-sized performer, while also integrating deep cuts of <em>Fortnite</em> lore and providing a tease of what’s next for the game.</p><p>Things started out at Snoop Dogg’s compound, which has been at the center of the battle royale map since the beginning of November. From there, a gigantic version of the rapper performed, before whisking players away into space for another song. In fact, the event constantly moved around: up next was Eminem who fought against a giant robot following a dramatic storm, followed by Ice Spice towering over a cityscape like Godzilla. It ended back on the battle royale island with a pair of Juice WRLD songs.</p><p>The humongous versions of the stars were reminiscent of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report">the Travis Scott show from 2020</a>, and — much like the Grande concert — the event also weaved in bits of <em>Fortnite</em>’s strange history. Eminem’s sequence was similar to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20701930/fortnite-epic-games-live-event-mecha-monster-battle-showdown-giant-robot">the game’s mecha-monster battle from back in 2019</a>, while during Juice WRLD’s songs players were turned into the glowing butterflies that first appeared in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913541/fortnite-game-shutdown-black-hole-event-storytelling"><em>Fortnite</em>’s ambitious black hole event from the same year</a>. At the end players were given a glimpse of what appears to be the new version of the battle royale island that will be playable when the game’s next chapter kicks off on December 1st.</p><p>After things wrapped up, the game was used to premiere Juice WRLD’s new animated music video for “Empty Out Your Pockets,” which takes place inside of <em>Fortnite</em>:</p><div><p>This all comes after an interesting, music-filled month for the battle royale game. At the beginning of November Epic kicked off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24283508/fortnite-remix-chapter-2-concert-snoop-dogg-ice-spice">a remixed version of <em>Fortnite</em>: Chapter 2</a>, which was a month-long and focused on a different musical artist each week. It was preceded by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24288014/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-snoop-dogg-times-square-music">a real life concert in Times Square from Snoop Dogg and Ice Spice</a>. The mini season also introduced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301624/can-i-kick-it-yes-i-can-on-thursday">a new cosmetic item in the form of kicks</a>, and saw <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301710/fortnites-subscription-is-about-to-become-a-better-deal">Epic revamp its battle pass structure</a>.</p></div><p>The concert not only closed out Chapter 2: Remix, it also set up the game’s next mainline season. It’s called “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306403/fortnite-minus-one">Hunters</a>,” and it kicks off on December 1st with new additions like Godzilla and Baymax, along with a completely new battle royale island. Here’s the first trailer:</p><div><p>While the Chapter 2 event is over, <em>Fortnite</em> isn’t done with the nostalgia. Epic is bringing back <em>Fortnite </em>OG — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23948555/fortnite-og-new-season">a throwback to the game’s original map</a> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294616/fortnite-og-permanent-december-release-date">as a permanent fixture on December 6th.</a></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
