            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334049/asus-samsung-msi-27-inch-4k-oled-240hz-monitors<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>27-inch 4K OLED 240Hz monitors seem to be like buses: you wait ages for one and then three turn up at once. Asus, Samsung, and MSI are all announcing the industry’s next-generation QD-OLED gaming monitors that offer the benefits of 4K OLED 240Hz panels at the smaller 27-inch size instead of 32 inches.</p><p>All three appear to be using the same fourth generation QD-OLED panel from Samsung Display, which Asus says offers “a longer lifespan over previous-gen OLEDs.” Both the <a href="https://rog.asus.com/monitors/27-to-31-5-inches/rog-swift-oled-pg27ucdm/">Asus ROG Swift OLED PG27UCDM</a> and the <a href="https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MPG-272URX-QD-OLED">MSI MPG 272URX QD-OLED</a> (who names these things?) include DisplayPort 2.1a (UHBR20), which offers 80Gbps of bandwidth to support 4K at 240Hz without the need for Display Stream Compression (DSC). <a href="https://news.samsung.com/kr/%ec%82%bc%ec%84%b1%ec%a0%84%ec%9e%90-ces-2025%ec%84%9c-%eb%aa%a8%eb%8b%88%ed%84%b0-%ec%8b%a0%eb%aa%a8%eb%8d%b8-5%ec%a2%85-%ea%b3%b5%ea%b0%9c?utm_source=nr_twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">Samsung’s press release</a> about its Odyssey OLED G8 (G81SF) doesn’t mention DisplayPort 2.1a compatibility, but it’s reasonable to assume it’s part of the spec list.</p><div><figcaption><em>Asus’ latest OLED monitor has a 26.5-inch viewable display.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Asus</cite></p></div><div><figcaption><em>Samsung’s Odyssey G8 now comes in a 27-inch OLED 4K 240Hz variant.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Samsung</cite></p></div><p>MSI and Asus’ models both support DisplayHDR True Black 400, and Asus also supports Dolby Vision HDR. Both MSI and Asus are offering a three-year warranty that includes burn-in protection, but Samsung hasn’t confirmed its warranty situation for its latest G8 model. Samsung also hasn’t fully detailed the specs of its latest G8 OLED model, but it’s reasonable to assume it will support DisplayHDR True Black 400 at the minimum.</p><p>Interestingly, Asus’ model only has a 26.5-inch viewable display, but both MSI and Samsung are marketing their monitors as 27-inch ones. With all three offering the 0.03ms response times of OLED, 240Hz refresh rates, and above 160PPI for improved text clarity, the choice will really come down to design, features, and pricing. Unfortunately, Samsung, Asus, and MSI haven’t announced release dates or pricing yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
