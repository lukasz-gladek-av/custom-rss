On top of your monthly subscription and the cost of the <em>Midnight</em> expansion itself, some Housing items will require a new in-game currency called “Hearthsteel” that players will have to pay for with real money. <em>World of Warcraft</em> already has <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-has-a-currency-problem-more-than-500-kinds-of-tender-can-currently-be-used-in-the-20-year-old-game/">hundreds of currencies</a>, and at one point, the game’s main currency, gold, was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/08/world/world-of-warcraft-token-worth-more-than-venezuelas-currency-trnd">worth more than the Venezuelan bolivar</a>.</p><p>Blizzard said in its <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24242736/developer-insight-hearthsteel-virtual-currency-and-housing-in-midnight">announcement blog post</a> for Hearthsteel that it will only be for Housing, not the Trading Post, mounts, or other in-game items. Blizzard also clarified that not all of the Housing items will require Hearthsteel:</p><div><blockquote><p>“The vast majority of Housing items are (and will continue to be) earnable in-game. Only a small fraction is available for purchase from the shop. Comparing this number against collectibles such as mounts is a good metric here, with more than a thousand mounts earnable in-game and only a few dozen from the shop.”</p></blockquote></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/816714/world-of-warcraft-player-housing-hearthsteel-currency]]></content:encoded>

With the changes, “many pages” will be widened from “940 pixels to now 1200 pixels,” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/506217467911081529?utm_source=SteamDB">Valve says</a>. The company picked that 1200 pixels number because it found that it “felt like a good balance where we can show more content on screen without overwhelming the page and making it hard to navigate.”</p><p>If your browser or client window is narrower than 1200 pixels, Valve says that “Steam store pages are designed to shrink appropriately to fit well” and that the pages adapt “to fit on tablets, Steam Decks, and mobile devices.” Valve says it’s even tested the changes “on a tiny old iPod that someone had laying around,” where “it mostly works, but things get pretty small.”</p><p>The changes follow Valve’s improvements to the Steam Trailer Player for store pages that it introduced <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F593110%2Fview%2F500579723494031419" rel="sponsored">in July</a>, which include a more adaptable UI and reprocessing videos to work better with the new player.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/816599/valve-steam-store-pages-wider]]></content:encoded>
