            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/635155/nvidia-g-assist-ai-assistant-available-download<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia’s G-Assist was originally an <a href="https://x.com/NVIDIAGeForce/status/848151745964392449">April Fools’ prank</a> in 2017 before becoming a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24169567/nvidias-g-assist-geforce-ai-assistant-chatbot">real tech demo</a> last year and a functioning AI assistant for RTX GPU owners today. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fg-assist-ai-companion-for-rtx-ai-pcs%2F" rel="sponsored">Project G-Assist is now available</a> inside the Nvidia app, and will help to optimize game and system settings, measure frame rates, and even change the lighting on connected devices.</p><p>G-Assist works as an AI assistant through voice or text prompts, so you can ask questions like “How does DLSS Frame Generation work?” and the assistant will give you a ChatGPT-like output. Where it gets a lot more interesting is the ability to ask G-Assist to optimize games for the best performance or image quality, or have it control the lighting of supported devices from Logitech, Corsair, MSI, and Nanoleaf.</p><p>You can even ask G-Assist to analyze and optimize your entire PC, so it will detect if a game has a frame rate limiter, whether performance of your GPU is limited, and what you can do to improve overall performance. It can even detect if refresh rates aren’t maxed out on a display and recommend options like overclocking a GPU or lowering in-game resolutions to hit a desired frame rate.</p><p>G-Assist uses a local small language model that requires nearly 10GB of space for the assistant functions and voice capabilities. The AI assistant works on a variety of RTX 30-, 40-, and 50-series desktop GPUs, but you’ll need a card with at least 12GB of VRAM.</p><div><p>G-Assist is available as an optional part of an <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fnvidia-app-update-g-assist-new-dlss-override-and-more%2F" rel="sponsored">update to the Nvidia app</a> that also includes new DLSS override options and the ability to adjust display scaling and color settings. You can <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fsoftware%2Fnvidia-app%2F" rel="sponsored">download Nvidia’s app right here</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
