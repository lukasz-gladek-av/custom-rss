            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/634125/assassins-creed-shadows-photo-mode-infinity-nikki<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Infinity Nikki </em>and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>have become my twin obsessions for their meticulously detailed environments, textures, and weather. With <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/14/24320757/infinity-nikki-review-gacha-dress-up-game">open-world dress-up game <em>Infinity Nikki</em></a>, I continue to be agog at how clothing textures are rendered with such detail and fidelity that by mere sight, I know exactly what a piece of fabric will feel like. For <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/631744/assassins-creed-shadows-review-ubisoft">an action-packed romp through feudal Japan</a>, I’m constantly in a state of awe at the natural beauty of the Japanese countryside, <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-graphics-seasons-screenshots-1851770252">a feature that has been widely celebrated</a> since its release. Both games are so visually arresting they made me fall in love with a video game staple that I’ve never really cared about before: photo mode.</p><p>Photo mode, which typically pauses the game to give players the ability to take professional grade images of their video games, is a modern gaming feature that’s been around long enough to become a standard inclusion, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/5/13/17344018/god-of-war-ps4-photo-mode">especially in AAA games</a>. But I’ve never seen their appeal. It’s a video game, not some fleeting life moment. I’m not gonna fondly flip through my PS5 media gallery in five years going, “Aww look at the time Yasuke chopped the arms and head off that guy,” like I’m looking at my grandkids’ baby photos. I definitely appreciate the skill with which others have made the most out of photo modes — like what my friend <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/applecider.bsky.social/post/3lkotizwcc224">does</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/applecider.bsky.social/post/3lkoung5vy22e">with</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/applecider.bsky.social/post/3ljduojaqhs2v"><em>Overwatch</em></a> — but it was always something I ignored. </p><p>I’ve played no shortage of games so interesting their moments <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch">demand to be captured and shared</a> but that compulsion is on another level with <em>Infinity Nikki</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>. So, starting with the dress up game, I opened photo mode, started fiddling around with apertures and vignettes and was genuinely surprised with the results. The photos looked good! The photos weren’t <em>Vogue</em> quality, but they started to resemble the pictures that get upvoted to the moon on the <em>Infinity Nikki </em>subreddit. Even though I don’t really care to post my own photos there, it’s thrilling enough to know I’m developing a talent for something I didn’t know was in me to begin with. </p><p>I took that success with <em>Infinity Nikki </em>and translated it to <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>. I’m actually glad the game doesn’t have the feature from the last <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>where your horse automatically follows the road. Without it, I am forced to take in the game’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-seasons-change-nature-review">impressive weather and foliage</a> as I drive ole’ Kikai around rather than looking at my phone after setting him on auto-pilot. That’s how I found my first picture. I was roaming around as Yasuke and I rode by a long road flanked by Japanese maples in full, deep-red autumn foliage. (At least I think they’re Japanese maples. The codex could stand a few more flora and fauna entries, Ubisoft.) The colors were so vibrant and the sound of the wind through the leaves was so invigorating, I felt I had to preserve the moment despite none of it being real. The urge was strong enough that it completely changed my feelings about photo mode altogether.</p><p>I saw that entirely fake scenery made of pixels and code and immediately opened up photo mode as though I was capturing real natural phenomena. I placed the camera behind him and zoomed out to see as much foliage as I could fit into the shot, while still keeping Yasuke as the focus of the picture. I then tinkered with the lighting to brighten the leaves and the saturation so their colors would pop. I wanted it to look like a shot Akira Kurosawa could have composed for one of his samurai epics — a kind of thought I’ve never had while taking pictures in real life or in games. This moment completely changed my perspective on video game photography. What once seemed like a cool party trick now felt like a real avenue of creative expression.</p><p>Putting the photo modes in <em>Nikki </em>and <em>Shadows</em> through their paces, I’ve discovered game photography is now something I can really, earnestly do, and want to do more of. I hope to get better at it so I can one day take those skills from capturing video games to capturing real life. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/633885/gdc-2025-best-indie-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Game Developers Conference, an annual gathering that brings thousands of game developers to San Francisco, has just wrapped up. While most of the event is about networking and interesting talks about game design and technology, there were also a bunch of unreleased indie games that we got to check out. Yes, much of video games in 2025 will probably be defined by the Nintendo Switch 2 and <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>. But based on the games we played, there might be some really fun smaller titles that could be huge hits this year, too.</p><p>Here are a few of our favorites that we’re looking forward to.</p><div><p id="dreams-of-another"><h2><em>Dreams of Another</em></h2></p></div><p><em>Dreams of Another</em> is a shooter, but you use your gun to <em>create</em> the world around you instead of destroying it. The game’s graphics have a dreamy, deconstructed quality to them, and when you shoot things, the colorful, unfocused scenes you see will solidify into things like buildings and people. Unexpectedly, my brief demo ended with a more traditional shootout against a sentient manhole cover. (I even lobbed a couple grenades to try and destroy it.) But I’m intrigued by the overall concept, and I look forward to seeing what developer Q-Games does with it in the final version of the game.—JP</p><div><p id="faraway"><h2><em>Faraway </em></h2></p></div><p>In <em>Faraway</em>, you play as a shooting star and try to make constellations. The game requires just pressing and holding one button to spin around other stars, create a trail, and essentially play a celestial game of connect the dots. It’s a simple concept, but I was impressed by it immediately. In just a 10-minute demo, I was really starting to get the hang of using my shooting star’s momentum to perfectly swing around a star to make elaborate and high-scoring constellations. That’s all the time it took to make <em>Faraway</em> far and away my favorite game of the show.—JP</p><div><p id="haste-broken-worlds"><h2><em>Haste: Broken Worlds</em></h2></p></div><p><em>Haste: Broken Worlds</em> is kind of like a 3D version of the classic mobile game <em>Tiny Wings</em>. You play as Zoe, a girl who runs forward at blinding speed through procedurally generated levels. Like with <em>Tiny Wings</em>, there are rolling hills you can launch from for added height, and if you time your fall right into the curve of another hill, you’ll get a satisfying “perfect” message and a boost to a meter that lets you pull out a hoverboard. The game has a roguelike structure, so you’ll get to pick and choose different types of levels to tackle as you make your way through a run. On the show floor, I was awful, dying within the first few levels before I had to hand the controller to the next person in line. But as soon as I got back to my hotel room, I downloaded the game’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2940200%2FHaste_Broken_Worlds_Demo%2F" rel="sponsored">free demo on Steam</a>.—JP</p><div><p id="herdling"><h2><em>Herdling</em></h2></p></div><p><em>Herdling</em> tasks you with herding mysterious, fluffy beasts. In my demo, the character starts in a dark city before quickly coming upon three adorable beasts that reminded me of a big goat mixed with <em>Sesame Street</em>’s Mr. Snuffleupagus. Your goal is to get them out of the city and out to wilder pastures. You coax the animals forward from behind with a magic stick, and while they generally follow your directions, they are sometimes difficult to direct. More than once, my herd of three walked right into a wall. By the end of the demo, however, I really started to care for my fluffy friends, especially since you can name them — though I can only imagine the cruel ways the developers will pull on my heartstrings over the course of the full adventure.—JP</p><div><p id="hotel-barcelona"><h2><em>Hotel Barcelona</em></h2></p></div><p>This is sort of the video game equivalent of a supergroup. Goichi “Suda51” Suda (best known for off-kilter games like <em>Killer 7</em> and <em>No More Heroes</em>) has teamed up with Hidetaka “Swery65” Suehiro (the writer and director behind <em>Deadly Premonition</em> and, more recently, <em>The Good Life</em>) on an extremely challenging and roguelike game set in a world inspired by slasher movies. In the short time I had with the game, I died multiple times, but the twitchy action felt very satisfying, especially once I got the hang of the controls. There’s a neat feature where you can fight alongside a ghost image of your previous run, which seems like it will come in handy. What I didn’t get to experience was the inevitable surreal twist the two creators have put on the horror setting, but the core is solid.—AW</p><div><p id="my-arms-are-longer-now"><h2><em>My Arms Are Longer Now</em></h2></p></div><p>Slapstick comedy games are really coming into their own of late. And if you loved <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20868532/untitled-goose-game-review-nintendo-switch-pc-house-panic"><em>Untitled Goose Game</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/31/24232540/summer-2024-best-indie-games"><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em></a>, this is definitely one to keep an eye on. The name really says it all: you control an unseemly long and stretchy arm and attempt to... do things, most of which are illegal. The level I played took place on a moving train, and you were tasked with stealing items from passengers while remaining undetected (probably because of how terrifying the arm is). There’s a puzzle element to it; at one point, I needed to take a briefcase from a sleeping businessman, only to find it was chained to his wrist. It’s absurd, of course, but that’s exactly the appeal.—AW</p><div><p id="to-a-t"><h2><em>To a T</em></h2></p></div><p><em>To a T</em> is a delightful game about a teenager permanently stuck in a T pose. The game is from <em>Katamari</em> series creator Keita Takahashi, so, of course, it’s wacky and silly. My demo featured an elaborate tooth-brushing sequence, musical numbers, and a talking giraffe. But the demo also hinted at the character’s fear of school and bullying over their T-pose condition. I was surprised how much that made me care for the character, and if the story sticks the landing, it could make a game that might have been pure silliness something more thoughtful. It’s out on May 28th.—JP</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
