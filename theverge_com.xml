One of those changes is an option to have horrifying / awesome <em>double eyes</em>:</p><p>The character creator is getting an improved randomizer that has a “plain-to-punk” slider, too. “Whether you’re aiming for an understated, casual look or a bold, edgy style for your V, you can now use the slider to strike the perfect balance,” CD Projekt Red says.</p><p>CD Projekt Red has also expanded the ability to change a car’s paint job to cars to more of the in-game brands. And if you see a paint job you like on another car, you’ll be able to scan it so you can use it later. But perhaps the best car-related change with update 2.2 is that Johnny Silverhand (played by Keanu Reeves) will now sometimes show up in the passenger seat while you’re driving.</p><p>Update 2.2 also brings some changes to photo mode, including a free camera and the ability to add characters to your shot. </p><div><p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> launched four years ago today, and while it had an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197547/cyberpunk-2077-glitches">infamously rocky launch</a>, the game is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23881536/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-2-0">now in an excellent place</a>. It’s coming to Macs with Apple Silicon in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283651/cyberpunk-2077-launch-mac">early 2025</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
