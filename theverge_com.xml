However, Nintendo’s fine print gives away something else (emphasis ours):</p><div><blockquote><p><em>Compatible systems must be linked to a Nintendo Account to use virtual game cards. <strong>Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive</strong> games and <strong>Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</strong> games can only be loaded on a Nintendo Switch 2 system.</em></p></blockquote></div><p>It’s no surprise that Nintendo Switch 2-specific titles won’t work on older systems; however, this mention of “Switch 2 Edition” games gives insight into Nintendo’s plans to differentiate original Switch and (likely graphically enhanced) Switch 2 titles of the same name</p><p>Although Nintendo says Switch 2 will have backward compatibility with older titles, it’s unclear exactly what Nintendo has planned here. Nintendo could follow PlayStation and Microsoft, where <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21509390/playstation-5-ps4-games-backwards-compatible-how-to-play#:~:text=PlayStation%205%20upgrades">PS4 games could get upgraded</a> to “PS5 Enhanced” versions, and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21250334/xbox-series-x-free-games-smart-delivery-one-upgrade-list-ea">Smart Delivery system</a> downloads system-specific versions depending on if you’re using Xbox One or Series X / S. Or it could have separate enhanced” versions of games that work better on the Switch 2 and are sold separately.</p><p>We won’t have to wait long to find out how “Nintendo Switch 2 Edition” games really work, as the company’s Switch 2 Direct presentation is happening on April 2nd.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
