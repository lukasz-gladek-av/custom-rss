If so, and you’re leaning toward a high-end gaming model, <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.costco.com/p/-/asus-rog-gm700-58l-gaming-desktop-amd-ryzen-9-9950x-3d-amd-radeon-9070-xt-32gb-ram-2tb-ssd-windows-11-home/4000372359" rel="sponsored">Costco</a> has a model that’s an impressive value at $1,999.99 ($300 off) for members through February 8th. It’s an all-AMD, liquid-cooled machine built into Asus’ ROG GM700 case, and includes the Ryzen 9 9950X3D — the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/626820/amd-ryzen-9-9950x3d-review-cpu-processor-benchmark-test">best desktop processor of 2025</a> — along with AMD’s Radeon 9070 XT graphics card (also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/624423/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review-benchmarks-price">very good</a>!), 32GB of DDR5 RAM and a 2TB SSD, plus a wired keyboard and mouse. Buying each of these components piecemeal would likely send you sailing over the $2,000 mark, with the CPU and GPU accounting for well over half the cost.</p><p>Obviously, two grand is still a lot of money, but I’ve compared prices for other configurations and it seems like the best value by a long shot. For example, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1891188-REG%2Fasus_g700tf_ds774_rog_g700_gaming_desktop.html" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H Photo</a> has a model for $1,899 with half the RAM and storage amounts, not to mention a step down to Intel’s Ultra 7 265F processor and Nvidia’s RTX 5070 GPU. <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fasus-rog-gm700-gaming-desktop-amd-ryzen-7-8700f-32gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060ti-16gb-1tb-ssd-black%2FJJGGLHCWKT%2Fsku%2F6613429%3Futm_source%3Dfeed%26extStoreId%3D2518%26ref%3D212%26loc%3D19726465341%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds%26gad_source%3D1%26gad_campaignid%3D19735314874%26gbraid%3D0AAAAAD-ORIgTV9oOudwwcBKKoRPQ3wTVP%26gclid%3DCj0KCQiAvtzLBhCPARIsALwhxdq2eBTlOX_gmzKHnG6IhREsZs9EDezmnn-E6DTxmxo_iW3ecYI9l94aAnNSEALw_wcB" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>’s $1,699.99 model offers 32GB DDR5 RAM with 1TB of storage along with AMD’s Ryzen 7 8700F and Nvidia’s RTX 5060 Ti. Costco’s model is vastly superior, especially in the processor department.</p><div><p id="other-verge-approved-deals"><h2>Other Verge-approved deals</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Elgato’s Stream Deck Mk.2 includes 15 customizable buttons and currently costs $130 on sale. If you already know that’s not nearly enough buttons for your needs, the company’s biggest XL model with a whopping 32 buttons is discounted to $199.99 ($50 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RL8H55Z/r?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. The <strong>Stream Deck XL</strong> works like the rest of Elgato’s models, letting you customize each button with its app however you please with plugins downloaded through its PC and macOS app.</span></li><li><span><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fpromo%2Fsave-on-select-lg-oleds-offer" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> has started its pre-Super Bowl discounts on <strong>LG OLED TVs</strong>, and the company’s offering free basic mounting and TV haul-away with select models. The most affordable is the 77-inch LG B5 that’s $1,499.99, though LG’s C5, the M5 and the stunning <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/817807/lg-g5-oled-tv-review">G5</a> are also available at higher costs. The fine print states that Best Buy will install the TV onto a customer-provided mount (I really like this EchoGear model for TVs between 42 and 90 inches that’s $103 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ECHOGEAR-Motion-Articulating-Mount-Bracket/dp/B073QX1ZMS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>), and it’ll charge extra for installing the mount onto any wall type other than drywall. If you were already planning to buy a TV, at least this will save you some money on paying for mounting through Taskrabbit.</span></li><li><span>If you’ve felt a sting of envy from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/863747/animal-crossing-new-horizons-update-3-0-switch-2-quality-of-life">everyone jumping back into</a> the wondrous, stress-free world of <em><strong>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</strong></em>, you can grab the game at a discount at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/animal-crossing-new-horizons-5" rel="sponsored">Woot</a>. The game costs $44.99 (usually $59.99), and if you have a Switch 2 and want the system-exclusive features that boost performance and add Joy-Con mouse controls for home decorating, that upgrade will cost you just $4.99 extra via the eShop. Woot will ship the international version and it might have Spanish on the packaging. But don’t fret as the Switch is region-free, so cartridges made for any region will work just fine in your console.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/867754/asus-desktop-pc-stream-deck-lg-oled-animal-crossing-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
