            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>YouTube is updating its policy to age-restrict more content containing video game scenes with “graphic violence,” <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/383711785?hl=en&amp;sjid=3922247506148764624-NC">the company announced on Tuesday</a>. The update will go into effect on November 17th and will prevent accounts under 18 and signed-out users from watching videos with games focused on showing “realistic human characters” involved in scenes of “mass violence against non-combatants” or torture.</p><p>When choosing whether to restrict a video, YouTube says it will take the length of the graphic scene into account, as well as whether it’s zoomed in or the main focus of a scene. It will also evaluate whether the video shows violence targeted at a character “that looks like a real human.” YouTube’s post doesn’t clarify if this applies to the violence seen in games like <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, a <em>Call of Duty</em> sequence like the infamous <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201735/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-remastered-release">“No Russian” mission</a>, or other kinds of realistically rendered scenes.</p><p>However, YouTube spokesperson Boot Bullwinkle said in a statement to <em>The Verge</em> that “certain content may be age-restricted if it’s non-fleeting or zoomed in,” adding that “there may be ways the creator can choose to play the mission to avoid content that would lead to an age restriction.” Creators can also choose to blur or obscure the violence, according to Bullwinkle.</p><p>The update builds upon <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802008?hl=en">YouTube’s existing policies</a>, which state that the platform may restrict videos featuring “dramatized violence” focused on torture, severe injuries, or violent deaths with blood, with an exception for games. The current policy says, “Generally, we do not remove dramatized violence when the content or metadata lets us know that the content is fictional, or when it’s apparent from the content itself, such as with animated content or video games.”</p><p>“YouTube’s policies are designed to adapt to the evolving digital world, and these updates reflect our ongoing commitment to protect younger users and foster a responsible platform,” Bullwinkle said.</p><p>In addition to stricter policies surrounding video games, the update will also prevent creators from directing users to online gambling content involving digital goods, like video game skins, cosmetics, or NFTs. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/623985/youtube-online-gambling-rules-restrictions">YouTube stopped allowing creators</a> to verbally mention or display online gambling services not approved by Google in March. The platform started blocking approved online gambling content for users under 18 at this time, and now it’s planning to age-restrict social casino content as well.</p><p><em><strong>Update, October 28th: </strong>Added clarification from YouTube.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/808545/youtube-graphic-video-game-violence-age-restriction]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>As part of Amazon’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/807825/amazon-job-layoffs-2025-ai">mass layoffs announced today</a>, the company is making “significant” changes to its gaming division, including halting much of its work on first-party AAA MMOs, according to a memo from Steve Boom, VP of audio, Twitch, and games.</p><p>“While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,” Boom said in the memo, which Amazon shared with <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>The developers of <em>New World: Aeternum</em>, one of Amazon’s MMOs, <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world?tag=updates">have already announced plans</a> to stop providing new content updates. The team said it’s not sunsetting the game “at this time” and that “servers will be live through 2026.” The developers will provide “a minimum of six months’ notice before making any changes that impact your ability” to play the game.</p><p>Amazon also publishes the MMOs <em>Throne and Liberty</em>, which is developed by NCSoft and FirstSpark Games, and <em>Lost Ark</em>, developed by Smilegate RPG. “We will continue supporting <em>Throne and Liberty</em> and <em>Lost Ark</em> with regular updates and community engagement,” Amazon spokesperson Brittney Hefner told <em>The Verge</em>. They’ll get new content updates for the foreseeable future, Hefner confirmed.</p><p>In 2023, Amazon announced that it would be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23723787/amazon-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">developing a <em>Lord of the Rings</em> MMO</a> in partnership with Embracer Group. Amazon and Embracer didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment about that game.</p><p>Last year, Amazon <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/28/24230555/amazon-games-blue-protocol-western-release-cancelled">canceled a planned Western release</a> of the Bandai Namco-developed MMO <em>Blue Protocol</em>, which was shuttered in Japan in January.</p><p>Amazon isn’t fully pulling back on its work in games. Boom pointed to the launch of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789658/amazon-luna-cloud-relaunch-gamenight-social-gaming">revamped Luna</a> and said that its Studio 5 team, which developed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnqfKmQd2Hs">courtroom game with an AI Snoop Dogg</a> for the cloud gaming service, will “continue their focus on more casual and AI-focused games, optimized for Luna.” He also said Luna is a “great example” of “how we will have an impact with customers that fits the scale of Amazon” because it “leans into both streaming entertainment and delivering value for Prime members.”</p><div><p>In addition, Boom highlighted a “successful closed alpha” for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDAH6H-5TOs">the MOBA <em>March of Giants</em></a> and noted that Amazon is still working with Crystal Dynamics on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/15/23510923/amazon-tomb-raider-game-crystal-dynamics">a new <em>Tomb Raider</em> game</a> (Amazon is also making <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770357/amazon-lara-croft-tomb-raider-sophie-turner-series">a <em>Tomb Raider</em> series</a>) and with Maverick Games on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24166351/amazon-maverick-games-publishing-deal-forza-ps5-xbox">a new open-world driving game</a>.</p></div><p>You can read Boom’s full memo below.</p><div><blockquote><p>Dear Games Team,</p><p>This morning, we are making a number of changes in our Games business. While you’ve likely seen Beth Galetti’s note earlier this morning regarding the larger changes at Amazon that are taking place today, I wanted to dive a bit deeper with all of you, since the strategic changes we are making in Games go beyond what is happening company-wide.</p><p>Over the last several months, we’ve been evaluating our go-forward plans, specifically through the lens of our mission to deliver the very best gaming experiences to customers while leaning into the things that Amazon does best. We believe that this is how we will have an impact with customers that fits the scale of Amazon. Last week’s launch of the all-new Luna is a great example, as it leans into both streaming entertainment and delivering value for Prime members, two tenets that are always top of mind in our group. Luna launched with a great catalog of social party games and AAA blockbusters, and we have a lot more to come from Jeff’s team on that front…it’s still Day 1.</p><p>We’ve also taken a critical look at the evolving dynamics of games industry and competitive landscape. While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team.</p><p>While these changes are significant, we still have a lot going on in game development. Our Montreal studio recently concluded a successful closed alpha of March of Giants and is working hard to finish the game. Our Studio 5 team just released <em>Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg</em> as the launch title in Luna and will continue their focus on more casual and AI-focused games, optimized for Luna. Finally, we are continuing to work with our external studio partners Crystal Dynamics on an upcoming <em>Tomb Raider</em> title and Maverick Games on an upcoming open world driving game.</p><p>Over the course of the day, both Christoph and Jeff will reach out with more details on how these changes will affect you and your teams. Most countries with impacted employees have been notified. Our other global hubs will follow local processes and be notified at a later date.</p><p>There is no getting around the fact that days like this are hard, and we will be losing team members whose work and dedication have had an incredible impact on our customers over the years. We don’t make these decisions lightly, and yet they are necessary for us to continue to drive our business forward.</p><p>Please reach out directly to your manager or to your HRBP with any specific questions.</p><p>Thank you,</p><p>Steve</p></blockquote></div><p><em><strong>Updates, October 28th:</strong> Added details from the </em>New World: Aeternum <em>team</em> <em>and from Amazon about two of its other MMOs</em>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/808332/amazon-gaming-layoffs-mmo-aaa-first-party-games]]></content:encoded>
