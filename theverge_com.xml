The new turn-based game from Firaxis Games and the titular, legendary designer is set to release on PC and modern consoles in on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224532/civilization-7-release-date-february-2025">February 11th, 2025</a> — over eight years after the last installment.</p><p><em>Civ VII</em> promises to expand the scope of how players can write their own historical fantasy, offering the freedom to mix and match civilizations with different historical figures, such as Hatshepsut reigning over the Roman empire in the Age of Exploration. It’s the kind of game that easily consumes hundreds of hours of playtime, constantly offering new and unexpected ways to engage with its deep city-building systems. Our own Ash Parrish details in her <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24224489/civilization-7-hands-on-demo-impressions-firaxis-games">hands-on impressions</a> how she only managed to scratch the surface in a lengthy three-hour demo.</p><p>Here’s all our coverage of the next major title in the <em>Civilization</em> series.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTM5OTI=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24224489/civilization-7-hands-on-demo-impressions-firaxis-games">Civilization 7 lets you mix and match history — and it’s a blast</a></h2><div><p>Imagine Caesar Augustus at the head of an army of Mongol warriors or Ben Franklin building the Great Wall of China. In Sid Meier’s <em>Civilization 7</em>, such flights of historical fantasy can become historical fact. The game has new ages to experience, new civilizations to build up, new leaders to guide them, and — for the first time in franchise history — the ability to mix and match leaders and civilizations to build the empire of your wildest dreams. <em>The Verge</em> had the opportunity to test out the game and talk with its developers at Firaxis Games. The brief, three-hour demo wasn’t enough time to get a feel for how well leaders and different civilizations work together, but I left feeling excited about all the ways <em>Civilization VII</em> aims to change the course of history. </p><p>In previous <em>Civilization </em>games, civs were always tied to a specific leader who was usually, but not always, a noteworthy head of state. Later iterations of the game offered multiple leaders for civs, and on a couple of occasions where it made historical sense, one leader could straddle multiple civs like France and England both having access to Eleanor of Aquitaine, who, during her unusually-long-for-the-time-period life, was the queen of both countries.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24224489/civilization-7-hands-on-demo-impressions-firaxis-games">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Here are the PC requirements for Civilization 7.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/CivGame/status/1841870892449640471">Check ‘em out</a> to see if your PC can run the game when it comes out on February 11th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/604239/sony-bloodborne-60-fps-mod-removal-dmca-takedown-lance-mcdonald<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/antonio-g-di-benedetto">Antonio G. Di Benedetto</a> <span>is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget. He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>A popular <em>Bloodborne </em>framerate mod is no longer available thanks to a DMCA takedown request from Sony. Australia-based Twitch streamer Lance McDonald first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0tqppZDYxw">developed the mod back in 2020</a> before <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1359037954576928769?mx=2">making it available to download in 2021</a>. Lance <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1885347693125566806">announced today in a post on X</a> that Sony Interactive Entertainment asked them to remove download links for the patch.</p></div><p>The hack’s sole purpose was to get <em>Bloodborne </em>running at a smoother 60 fps with improved frame pacing. FromSoftware originally released <em>Bloodborne</em> back in 2015 for the PlayStation 4, and the game has always been locked at 30 fps with occasional stuttering from inconsistent pacing (the 30 frames within each second were not always on-screen for equal amounts of time). The beloved game’s graphical limitations have persisted even on the PS4 Pro and while playing it via backwards compatibility on the PlayStation 5.</p><p>Lance’s mod has received its share of testing and praise from the “Soulsbourne” community that covet FromSoftware games but wish their technical and graphical chops were more cutting-edge. This includes being spotlighted by creators like Digital Foundry, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hDIvDPRcPA">interviewed McDonald about his hack back in 2020</a>, used his mod to make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOn2ludP6gM">a 4K / 60 fps representation on PS5 using AI upscaling</a>, and recently published a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zjzBbdl7hk"><em>Bloodborne</em> PS4 emulation video</a> that really juices up the performance and has an extra-spicy video thumbnail aimed squarely at Sony.</p><p>For years, the most rabid of <em>Bloodborne </em>fans have been quick to jump at any <em>Bloodborne</em>-related news as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173905/sony-teases-bloodborne-in-astros-playroom-update-hours-ahead-of-summer-game-fest">a potential clue</a> to an upcoming, long-awaited remake. And in this case, it only takes a short scroll of McDonald’s replies on his post to see people speculating that this takedown means Sony <em>must </em>be nearing some kind of announcement in time for the 10-year anniversary of <em>Bloodborne’s</em> release. Or, perhaps, Sony is just taking a page from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">Nintendo’s playbook</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
