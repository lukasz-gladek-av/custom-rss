            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I wouldn’t have preordered a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a> just for myself. The price is high, there’s no new <em>Smash Bros. </em>or <em>Metroid Prime</em> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640231/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-2-enhanced-edition-beyond">yet</a>), and I’ve got a perfectly good original Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck that keep me plenty busy. At first, I could only justify the $450 because I write about gaming tech for <em>The Verge.</em></p><p>But two weeks in, I can <em>almost </em>justify the cost one additional way: the Switch 2 is turning out to be an upgrade for my whole family. </p><p>I’m not primarily talking about hand-me-downs, though yes, you could absolutely hand your original Switch down to a kid while basking in the glory of the Switch 2’s larger, faster screen. Mom and dad always get the best seats in the house, right? </p><p>But no: I’m talking about how Nintendo’s new features are helping me share the delight of gaming with my 8-year-old kid like never before.</p><p>We bought my daughter a Switch Lite last Christmas, with <em>Animal Crossing</em> and <em>Let’s Go Pikachu</em>, and that’s pretty much all she played. All other gaming monopolized the living room TV, where she and her younger sister often clash over what to watch next. </p><p>But two weeks ago, my eldest suddenly realized that we could now magically beam any of my old purchased digital games from my Switch 2 to her Switch Lite, lending them out like a library for two weeks at a time. While I played <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> for the Switch 2, she practiced her skills in my old copy of <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>; soon, I’ll play the gruesome <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> while she tries <em>Stardew Valley</em>. And in both cases, I don’t need to worry whether she’ll lose a cartridge. </p><p>Then we found GameShare, a feature that lets a Switch 2 beam its entire screen and controls to a second Switch, giving a second person their own screen and control for a selection of multiplayer games. We began playing <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> as daughter and dad, alternating between who controlled Mario and who controlled his sentient flying hat, Cappy. </p><p>Since each of us effectively had our own portable TV, she didn’t shove her head between me and the screen like she sometimes does when we’re reading bedtime books. And since neither of us was monopolizing the TV, the younger kid got to keep on watching her YouTube videos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C__Vzcq2lDc">intricately animated stop-motion Lego food factories</a>. </p><p>When it was time for me to fly across the country last week, my eldest begged me to let her keep playing <em>Mario</em> <em>Odyssey</em> while I was gone. Virtual game cards came through once again: five quick taps, and a game download magically appeared on her Switch. </p><p>She <em>did</em> have to start the game from scratch, since I couldn’t find a way to sync a save game between two different consoles with two different Nintendo accounts… but it turns out that was her plan all along. Apparently 8-year-olds enjoy repetition much more than us adults!</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m still a fan of physical media, and I especially worry that Nintendo will pull the rug out from under our digital purchases <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/26/23657431/wii-u-nintendo-3ds-eshops-shut-down">given its track record</a> of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306470/the-switch-eshop-has-a-closure-date-in-china">closing eShops</a>. I think Nintendo could do a lot more to make the Switch and Switch 2 better for parents, too. </p><p>For one, I wish the company hadn’t arbitrarily locked its webcam-enabled GameChat to the new Nintendo Switch 2, as I would have loved to play <em>Mario Kart</em> with my daughter during my business trip. The original Switch and Switch Lite might not have the horsepower for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/video/685229/nintendo-switch-2-gamechat-c-button-mario-kart">simultaneous four-player screen sharing and video chat like the Switch 2</a>, but surely they have enough for the webcams alone? It’s also awkward that there’s still no obvious way to merge the save games from the offline “kid” profile on my original Switch to my daughter’s Nintendo account.</p><p>But most of all, I fear the two-screens-for-one-game GameShare may not get the attention or adoption it deserves. It’s such a clever way of repurposing cloud gaming technology, but the initial list of GameShare-compatible games is vanishingly short and doesn’t yet include obvious wins like <em>Mario Kart World</em> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em></a>, the newest mainline entry in the series and one that’s great to play with kids. </p><p>It’s been nearly 25 years since <em>Mario Kart: Super Circuit</em> for the Game Boy Advance let you hook up four portable consoles to play limited multiplayer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kxJfaR5guE&amp;list=PL9exeo9gYxCaRwVKrU5yS6Zqrf9c15I_R&amp;index=5">even if only a single person had a copy of the game</a>. <em>Mario Kart DS</em> did the same thing 20 years ago over Wi-Fi, again offering single cartridge multiplayer, with “DS Download Play.” But it required conscious effort from game developers to create new single cart mulitplayer modes for their GBA and DS titles, and not every deserving game had one. GameShare shouldn’t have that problem: since it’s just streaming a screen and controller inputs, it should theoretically work on <em>any</em> game you’d play on a single screen today. And yet for some reason, Nintendo hasn’t turned it on for many games at once.</p><p>If Nintendo can make GameShare standard for the Switch’s many fabulous third-party couch games, like <em>Overcooked 2</em>, <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em>, and <em>Lego Star Wars</em>, while enabling its own titles, like <em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em>, <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>, <em>Donkey Kong Country</em>, and <em>Luigi’s Mansion 3</em>, it could make the Switch 2 an easier choice for parents who want to play together with their kids. </p><p>And that would play right into Nintendo’s end goal for the past seven years. As Mario and Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto laid out <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2018/180210e.pdf">in 2018</a>: “Our ultimate ambition is for a Nintendo Switch to be owned not just by every family, but by every single person.” Personally, I now have a Switch 2, a Switch, and a Switch Lite in our house. We are almost Nintendo’s dream family.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/690224/nintendo-switch-2-parenting-gameshare]]></content:encoded>
