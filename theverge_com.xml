            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Life is a series of battles, and I just lost my last one against four gyoza on a skewer. It was an unexpected blow, because honestly, who could have expected me — a springy, respectably proportioned hot dog — to lose against a seemingly inflexible spear of small, unassuming dumplings? This is my struggle in <em>Sausage Legend: Arena</em>, a mobile game with a very simple premise: duel with other players’ sausages and win.</p><p>On the surface, it looks like a garden-variety mobile game riddled with bugs (it is). But the difference between <em>Sausage Legend</em> and a fleeting idea you had after overdoing it on edibles is that 3.5 million people have played <em>Sausage Legend</em>, it has been on Japanese national television, and it is shockingly fun. And with an upcoming release on Steam, it’s poised to get even bigger.</p><p>As befits combat that demands swatting two wieners at each other, <em>Sausage Legend</em> is a heavily physics-based game. Each sausage is thrust onto the battlefield by a fork; players flop their sausages around to bludgeon each other to death. As someone with the vestigial sensibilities of a 13-year-old shitposter, I love this ballet of well-timed jabs and opportunistic ripostes, all while I admire the resilience and elasticity of my humble meat sword.</p><p>I fight lightning-infused cocktail sausages and weisswurst. There are brats and goteborgs, as well as pickled cucumber and a slice of pepperoni pizza (which, I guess technically contains sausage). There are more than 50 different sausages and other food items, each with different advantages — length, strength, special powers, and so on. My health bar smugly refuses to replenish between rounds. I learn that at some point, I will encounter a chrome-covered metal sausage that looks like something out of the deepest pit of T-1000 <em>Terminator</em> fanfic. There are barely any instructions, there are tedious ads, and when I reopen the game, it has not saved my meager progress. And yet, I crave more sausage.</p><p>For developer Tadaki Tani, the inspiration behind <em>Sausage Legend</em> didn’t come from playing with his food. “In the beginning, we found <a href="https://thekidshouldseethis.com/post/the-etiquette-of-a-giraffe-fight">giraffes fighting</a> on YouTube and the giraffes were ‘hanging’ their heads around and round, and that’s how we got the first idea [for the game],” he explains through a translator. The first prototype of the game used giraffes, but the fighting scenes didn’t quite work out. Why not try sausages? And <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/krishrach/theres-a-new-game-where-you-fight-with-sasusages-and-its-act">so, in 2016, <em>Sausage Legend</em> was born</a>.</p><p>Tani is the CEO of MilkCorp, a studio he founded in 2009 that offers meme-y mobile games like <em>My Grizzly Bear</em>, <em>Sleep In Office</em>, and <em>Pollen Heaven</em>. <em>My Grizzly Bear</em> is exactly what it sounds like — a free grizzly bear care simulator whose <a href="https://milkcorp.com/app/my-grizzly-bear/?lang=en">official page (correctly) reads</a>, “The only people who would think of doing something like that are Youtubers desperate for views.” <em>Pollen Heaven</em> is a self-described “<a href="https://milkcorp.com/app/pollen_heave/?lang=en">silly game</a>” based on Tani’s own hay fever. <em>Sausage Legend: Arena 2</em>, its Japan-only sequel, features a medieval story world where slaves must sausage-duel for their freedom. The development team consists of Tani, and one other person.</p><div><p>“There are a lot of people playing because of her.”</p></div><p>The biggest boost to <em>Sausage Legend</em> came from a niche corner of the internet: a Hololive vtuber named Oozora Subaru, who became besotted with the original game and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVHLS_2Ai2w">plays it obsessively</a> to the delight (or chagrin, in some cases) of her fans. (We did reach out to Hololive’s parent company Cover for comment, but it did not respond.) In 2021, Subaru <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0zw-fplbc0">got her own legendary sausage</a> in <em>Sausage Legend 2</em>, styled like a duck, which is her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=cmUnxqcY-zE">informal mascot</a>. Her fellow vtuber Hakui Koyori also got a special sausage: the “Koyori Skin of the Large Intestine” sausage which sported a fluffy pink tail. “There are a lot of people playing because of her,” Tani says, noting that it took around 10 of her streams to see a noticeable uptick in players.</p><p>Later this year, Tani is going to release an expanded version of <em>Sausage Legend: Arena</em> on Steam — essentially a more filled-out <em>Sausage Legend 2</em> story mode with added features. Slaves must take up arms (sausages) to fight for their freedom in a spectacular pastime favored by nobles: the sausage duel. There will be a deckbuilding mechanic to help you strategize the duels a little better — “the character doesn’t heal itself, but the cards will help you do that,” Tani says — as well as a few new modes and moves.</p><p>“We want to expand the game, and we want [more] people to know about it,” Tani says earnestly, before presenting me with a little acrylic standee of a hot dog. <em>Sausage Legend</em>’s upcoming release on Steam is poised to bring the game to a wider audience, one that I fervently hope will include avid modders. Half of the playerbase is Japanese, while the rest are overseas in the US and Taiwan, with France coming in fourth. Tani and I are both surprised that Germany isn’t in the top five; his favorite sausage type is weisswurst, which seems appropriate in the canon of <a href="https://gabrielknight.fandom.com/wiki/Wurst_Lady">significant video game sausages</a>.</p><p>After the successful collaborations he’s had — crossovers with the 2016 movie <em>Sausage Party</em>, Morinaga Pino ice-cream, and Hololive — I ask if he would consider working with Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest, perhaps even the Olympics of sausages. “If there is a chance, we would love to,” he says with a smile. “Just eating a hot dog is the best way to eat a sausage.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIxNzQ="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Alexis Ong</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/791353/sausage-legend-steam-launch-interview]]></content:encoded>
