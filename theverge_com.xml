Beginning January 20th, experiences — which Epic Games calls “islands” — will not be able to offer in-island transactions as “a ‘spin’ or ‘increased luck’ for a prize wheel,” according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCreative/comments/1qefc13/update_to_fortnite_developer_rules_inisland/">an Epic staffer on Reddit</a>.</p><p>Epic is adding the rule after <em><a href="https://www.fortnite.com/@ferins/3225-0366-8885?lang=en-US">Steal The Brainrot</a></em>, one of the biggest non-Epic games available to play in <em>Fortnite</em>, implemented a prize wheel that let players pay V-Bucks (<em>Fortnite’s</em> in-game currency) for spins and luck to acquire in-game items. <em>Steal The Brainrot</em> also added lootboxes, and the moves have drawn criticism from players, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-fortnite-enables-third-party-microtransactions-steal-the-brainrots-developer-is-slammed-by-fans-for-immediately-adding-45-premium-bundles-and-gambling-style-mechanics">as reported by <em>IGN</em></a>.</p><p>Until this month’s change, Epic didn’t let creators offer in-game transactions in their experiences, meaning that creators instead were paid through <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/28/23659492/fortnite-creator-economy-2-0-epic-games-catch">an engagement-based system</a>. (Roblox, one of <em>Fortnite’s</em> biggest competitors, does let creators sell in-game items.) But Epic made the change <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/tools-for-in-island-transactions-now-available-to-fortnite-developers?lang=en-US">to give</a> “independent Fortnite developers more agency over their creative and commercial decisions.”</p><p>Through the end of this year, Epic will pay creators 100 percent of the V-Bucks value from any in-island transactions. That rate is set to change to 50 percent after 2026.</p><div><p>Here is the <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/guidelines-for-in-island-monetization-in-fortnite#%E2%9D%8Cdonotofferanyin-islandtransactionsthatdirectlyorindirectlyinfluenceprizewheels">full text of the rule</a> banning transactions that influence prize wheels:</p></div><div><blockquote><p><strong>Do not offer any in-island transactions that directly or indirectly influence prize wheels.</strong></p><p>The examples below are NOT allowed:</p><p>A luck boost that can improve the outcomes on a prize wheel</p><p>In-game content that can be used to purchase a spin on a prize wheel</p><p>Any spin on a prize wheel, such as a single spin, extra spin, or bundle of spins.</p></blockquote></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/863597/fortnite-creators-steal-the-brainrot-prize-wheel-spins-block]]></content:encoded>
