It’s part of more than 20 titles that <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-gamescom-2025/">will be available</a> at the Xbox booth at Gamescom, including a new theater experience to demonstrate <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>.</p><p><em>Silksong </em>will be available to play on the new Xbox Ally devices at Gamescom, just months after Xbox president Sarah Bond <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682390/silksong-spotted">revealed in June</a> that <em>Silksong</em> will be available “at launch and in Game Pass” when Asus’ new handhelds launch later this year.</p><p>Gamescom attendees will also get to try out Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">new Xbox and Windows UI</a>, as well as play<em> Roblox, Sea of Thieves, </em>and<em> Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</em> on the new Xbox Ally handhelds. <em>Grounded 2</em> will also be at Gamescom, as well as the first public hands-on of <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>.</p><p>We’ve been waiting three years to get a Silksong release date, after Microsoft originally said in 2022 that the sequel to the indie side-scrolling action platformer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/12/22175400/hollow-knight-silksong-sequel-xbox-game-pass-trailer">was coming within 12 months</a>. A playable demo at Gamescom sure makes it even more likely that <em>Silksong</em> will debut later this year.</p><p>Microsoft is also fully revealing <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> during Opening Night Live at Gamescom on August 19th, as well as promising “a couple more surprises at the show from our partners too.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/714490/xbox-gamescom-silksong-playable-demo-xbox-ally-handheld]]></content:encoded>
