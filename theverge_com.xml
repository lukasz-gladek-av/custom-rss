At least for this season, it won’t be “enforcing against or requiring the use of either setting.” EA has <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/articles/battlefield/battlefield-6/pc-requirements/">also said</a> that <em>Battlefield 6</em> PC players will need to have Secure Boot and TPM 2.0 enabled to play the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-open-beta">upcoming open beta</a>.</p><p>While anti-cheat systems and other security measures can go a long way toward blocking cheaters in games, the tools have come under scrutiny for potentially slowing down gamers’ systems or for requiring users to turn on features they don’t want to use. As Activision even admits in today’s blog post, sometimes, they still aren’t enough to fully block cheaters.</p><p>Activision argues that “these hardware-level protections are a key part of our anti-cheat efforts, and we’re asking all players to get compliant now.” The update “will let us test our implementation of both features and gives you time to enable these settings.”</p><p>Regarding performance, “TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot will not impact in-game quality,” Activision says. “These features perform checks during system and game startup but remain inactive while you play.”</p><p>Activision is also encouraging users to turn on two-factor authentication. While two-factor authentication isn’t required to play the game right now, it “may become a requirement for all users in the future.”</p><p><em><strong>Update, August 6th</strong>: </em>Battlefield 6’s<em> open beta will also require Secure Boot and TPM 2.0 to be turned on.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/720007/call-of-duty-pc-anti-cheat-secure-boot-windows-black-ops-7]]></content:encoded>
