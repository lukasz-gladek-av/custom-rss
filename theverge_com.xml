Shipping is expected to start as early as October 2025. Although the company is concurrently <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/flip-1s-flip-dual-screen-full-keyboard-handheld#/">running another Indiegogo campaign</a> for a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684190/ayaneo-flip-1s-ds-nintendo-windows-handheld-dual-screen">similar dual-screen handheld called the Flip 1S</a>, that device features more powerful specs, runs Windows 11, and starts at $1,279 with discounts, while the less expensive Pocket DS runs Android 13.</p></div><p>There are currently many handhelds that replicate the design and functionality of Nintendo’s iconic portables, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22831589/analogue-pocket-review">Game Boy</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24303052/modretro-chromatic-review-game-boy-color-handheld-palmer-luckey">Game Boy Color</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24314884/anbernic-rg34xx-handheld-emulator-retro-nintendo-game-boy-advance">Game Boy Advance</a>, but few can properly recreate the Nintendo DS experience, which is still Nintendo’s best-selling console of all time. The new Pocket DS potentially fits that bill with a 7-inch, 16:9, 1080P OLED folding top screen paired with a smaller 5-inch, 4:3, 1,024x768 LCD display on the handheld itself.</p><p>It will be powered by a very capable Snapdragon G3x Gen 2 processor, but we don’t yet know what the Pocket DS’ emulation capabilities will be. The entry-level model features 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage (expandable through a microSD card slot), but the Pocket DS can be configured with up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, pushing its price to $759, or $639 with early backer discounts.</p><p>The handheld also features a pair of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">anti-drift TMR joysticks</a>, Hall effect triggers with sensitivity adjustments, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, gyroscopic controls, a fingerprint scanning power button, and an 8,000mAh battery. Ayaneo hasn’t revealed the handheld’s actual battery life, but it will offer multiple performance modes and the ability to turn off the second screen for those trying to max out their playtime.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/761296/ayaneo-pocket-ds-dual-screen-handheld-android-13]]></content:encoded>
