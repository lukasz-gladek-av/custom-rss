            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo is back, but for CES 2026 both its screens are going full edge-to-edge — like a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24140334/asus-zenbook-duo-vs-lenovo-yoga-book-9i">Zenbook Duo</a> built for gaming. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21431381/asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-15-review">original Zephyrus Duo</a> was a quirky keyboard-in-the-front-club member, with a 15.6-inch main display and a 14.1-inch-wide, skinny touchscreen crammed between the hinge and side-by-side keyboard and trackpad. The new model features two full-size 16-inch 3K 120Hz OLED HDR displays that can reach 1,100 nits of peak brightness and a detachable keyboard / trackpad you can use wirelessly or over the bottom display.</p><p>And since this multi-screen monster is a gaming laptop, it offers Intel Panther Lake and Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs (up to the RTX 5090). Pricing isn’t finalized, but it’s expected to launch in mid-to-late Q2 2026.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>The new Zephyrus Duo (center) beside its predecessor (right).</em></figcaption> <cite>Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The new Zephyrus Duo is basically a double Zephyrus G16, so it’s a little chunkier at 0.77 inches / 19.6mm thick, and it weighs 6.28 pounds / 2.85kg. The detachable keyboard deck allows you to use its dual screens in two-up or side-by-side dual-screen positions, tent mode, flat mode, or as a normal single-screen laptop. Like the G16, it has a plethora of ports including HDMI 2.1, USB-C / Thunderbolt 4, USB-A, and a full-size SD card slot.</p><p>I got a glimpse of the new Zephyrus Duo at an early preview event, and holy hell am I excited for this thing. We’ve long been big fans of Asus ROG Zephyrus laptops here at <em>The Verge</em>, because they’re so versatile as travel-friendly laptops that are great for both work and gaming. The thought of taking that same formula and turning it into a multi-display setup for new levels of multitasking sounds incredibly compelling. (<em>Battlefield 6</em> on one screen and WordPress and Slack on the other, anyone?)</p><p>As for the conventional ROG Zephyrus G14 and ROG Zephyrus G16 gaming laptops, they’re getting a modest but nice-sounding refresh with Intel Panther Lake chips. The design remains mostly unchanged, with RTX 50-series GPUs on offer, but the slash lighting on the lid is now 35 LED segments instead of just seven — and it can now show the battery level. The hinges are easier to open, the OLED displays are now factory-calibrated and HDR-compatible (reaching up to 1,000 nits of brightness), and the bottom panel is redesigned for better cooling that Asus claims enables improved performance.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>Yep, those look like ROG Zephyrus G14 laptops.</em></figcaption> <cite>Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>Also, the G14 now sports a full-size SD card slot (hooray for us photographers) and will be available for the first time with Intel as well as its usual AMD options. The new G14 and G16 don’t have official pricing yet, but they’re both expected in mid-to-late Q2 2026 like their dual-screen cousin.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NDQ2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Antonio G.

The revamped Crosshair also supports MSI OverBoost Ultra, allowing users to boost the GPU by up to 115W and the CPU by 85W (or 140W when focused exclusively on the CPU).</p><p>While the Crosshair 16 Max HX has some updates over the previous generation, it maintains the more inconspicuous chassis design. The 2026 Crosshair has a bit of RGB on the keyboard, but otherwise keeps the design fairly low-key, with an MSI logo and subtle mecha-style accents on the lid.</p><p>The Crosshair 16 Max HX is expected to launch as early as April 2026 starting at $1,649.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/850944/ces-2026-msi-crosshair-16-max]]></content:encoded>

He joined in 2018, and after a two-year stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>HP’s branding is missing on its new gaming laptops (and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/845706">gaming monitors</a>) announced at CES 2026 — HP-owned HyperX has gotten a <em>big </em>promotion in its place. This swap is the biggest aesthetic change in the Omen lineup (the logo is on the lid and on the screen’s bottom bezel). In other words, not much is different on the outside compared to 2025’s models. But there are some spec strides worth noting across the lineup.</p><p>The Omen 15, which replaces the Victus 15, has a 15.3-inch 16:10 aspect ratio display that starts at 1,920 x 1,200 but can be configured with up to a 3K 120Hz OLED screen. Every configuration has a four-zone RGB backlit keyboard that boasts an 8K polling rate (all new models announced today can be configured with this keyboard for an added cost), and you can opt for the latest Intel or AMD-based processors. The Omen 15 sports two user-accessible RAM ports and ships with 8GB DDR5 RAM by default. As for graphics, this model starts with Nvidia’s RTX 5050 but can go up to the 5070 (8GB VRAM for each GPU option).</p><p>The Omen 16 can also be configured with Intel or AMD processors (only the AMD units offer two slots of user-serviceable RAM), with the option of Nvidia’s RTX 5060 or 5070 (both are 8GB VRAM variants). This model boasts a 16-inch 16:10 aspect ratio screen that has the same starting resolution as the Omen 15, but can be configured with up to a 2.5K 165Hz OLED screen (it has a slightly lower screen-to-body ratio compared to the 15, at 87 percent compared to 91 percent). This model is available in black or white.</p><p>Lastly, there’s the Omen Max 16 that has supercharged specs compared to the base Omen 16. Its top-end 2.5K OLED screen can go up to 240Hz, and the graphics card offered starts at the 5070 Ti and includes the 5090 for those who want the highest level of performance possible in the lineup. You can opt for AMD or Intel here, but your choice impacts overall RAM speed and quantity possible. The priciest Intel models support up to 64GB of DDR5-6400 RAM, while the AMD models support up to 48GB DDR5-5600, but both models allow for user-replaceable memory. Like the Omen 16, this one’s available in black or white.</p><p>HP hasn’t announced pricing or an expected launch window for any of these laptops.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/845774/hyperx-omen-15-16-max-specs]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The next generation of HyperX’s Origins wired keyboards debuted at CES 2026, and the company has focused on adding more performance and customization. For example, its new Origins 2 and Origins 2 Pro are both 65-percent options with high-profile keys that boast a PCB with hot-swappable switches that doesn’t require soldering to tweak.</p><p>The Origins 2 features HyperX’s pre-lubed linear red switches (this model is compatible with most three- and five-pin mechanical switches), while the Pro model has Hall effect switches (HyperX claims that most two-pin magnetic switches are supported, if you want to hot swap them). The Hall effect switches support all of the features that gamers have come to expect, including rapid trigger, adjustable actuation points that can be set within HyperX’s Ngenuity software, and simultaneous opposing cardinal direction (SOCD), the latter of which is a controversial feature used in competitive gaming.</p><p>Moving beyond the switches, if you prefer a different color to the default black housing surrounding the keys, you can snap it off with a built-in tool and install another option that HyperX will soon sell — or you’ll be able to find the official 3D files at <a href="http://printables.com/@HyperX">Printable</a> to print your own.</p><p>Both compact options have O-ring mounts for each key to give them what HyperX calls “a light bounce and deeper sound,” but they can be removed if you’d prefer to not have them. Also, they have plate-mounted stabilizers installed out of the box to reduce wobble, but they support aftermarket screw-in stabilizers, too.</p><p>In terms of performance, the Origins 2 and Origins 2 Pro feature 8K polling rate, which tells your PC to register inputs 8,000 times per second as opposed to 1,000Hz, the standard among cheaper gaming gadgets that registers inputs 1,000 times per second. For most people 1K is still perfectly fine, and the jump to 8K may not even be noticeable.</p><p>HyperX is also launching a wired mechanical keyboard in the 1800 form factor called the Origins 2 1800. Its specs are similar to that of the Origins 2 65-percent model, and it offers a similarly deep level of customization, both to its aesthetics and to the PCB itself. You can replace the switches and stabilizers as well as the plastic housing covering the keyboard’s chassis.</p><p>HP, which owns HyperX, hasn’t shared pricing or release dates for these keyboards.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/846558/hyperx-origins-2-gaming-wired-keyboard-customization-specs]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1397821</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Among HP’s many announcements for CES, its biggest overall change is for its gaming division. HP’s Omen line of gaming laptops, monitors, and desktops are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/845774">dropping the HP name entirely</a> and instead will henceforth be branded as HyperX. The HP Omen 16 Max laptop becomes the HyperX Omen 16 Max. HP Omen monitors will become HyperX Omen monitors. And even the HP Victus 15’s spiritual successor will be a HyperX Omen 15.</p><p>This all strikes me as odd, and all these new computers and monitors with the spelled-out HyperX or shortened Hx logos look a bit low-rent to my eyes. There’s just something about that logo on a computer that seems chintzy.</p><p>HyperX was a gaming brand that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298904/hp-acquires-hyperx-kingston-announcement">HP acquired in 2021</a>. At that time, it was well-known and regarded for its gaming headsets, mice, microphones, and keyboards, but it started <a href="https://hyperx.com/pages/about">back in 2002</a> under Kingston making DDR1 RAM sticks. Omen, on the other hand, has a pedigree based in making actual computers. It stems from the lineage of another HP acquisition, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoodooPC">VoodooPC</a>, a Canadian company founded way back in 1991 that made unique desktops.</p><p>If you’ve never experienced lower-back pain and are therefore too young to be familiar with VoodooPC, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1933275/the-hp-firebird-was-a-revolution-in-desktop-pc-design.html">PC World’s look back at the 2009 HP Firebird</a> gives a good glimpse into the company’s ingenuity. And HP’s own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/8/16/12508720/hp-omen-x-desktop-gaming-cube">cube-shaped Omen X desktop</a> from 2016 was another example of the bold design it inherited (and also squandered) with Voodoo / Omen.</p><p>I may not have the love for HyperX like some folks do, but I’ve got nothing against its products or the darling status it had among gamers pre-HP acquisition. It made nice accessories, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22686476/hyperx-cloud-iii-wireless-features-price-release-date">headsets that were beloved</a> for their lightweight comfort and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297466/audio-gear-headphones-earbuds-speakers-mics#:~:text=HyperX%20QuadCast%20microphone">streaming-focused microphones</a> known for their iconic RGB lighting. Even recently, under HP, it introduced some interesting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336191/check-out-these-colorful-modular-mouse-shells">mice with novel ideas about customization</a>.</p><p>But it was always an accessory brand and often a “bang for your buck” one at that. So it’s super weird to me that the accessory brand now has its name elevated to laptop, desktop, and monitor status instead of the higher-level Omen name trickling down to some keyboards, mice, headsets, and mics. (Not that I’m rooting for the HyperX name to go away.)</p><p>When I see that logo on a laptop I can’t help thinking of no-name brands sold by the likes of Amazon and Newegg — the types I tell family and friends to stay away from in favor of established ones like HP Omen / Victus, Lenovo Legion, and Asus ROG (to name a few). I know that’s not the case with HyperX, and I’ll get used to recommending them the same I do with the equivalent HP models now. But this feels like an unforced error.</p><p>As HP reps were excitedly telling me about their new unified branding, it took me right back to a year ago, watching Dell execs willfully shoot themselves in the foot when they <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24325799/dell-pro-max-premium-plus-ces-laptop-pc-rebrand-announcement">announced the death of their XPS brand</a> in favor of lesser-sounding laptop names. 364 days later, Dell is doing an about-face and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/851047">XPS laptops are back</a>. When Dell COO Jeff Clarke recently announced that reversal to a room full of media members and analysts, he capitulated, “Marketing matters.” Now, HyperX-ing all the things feels like a similarly bad omen for HP.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NDQ2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Antonio G.
