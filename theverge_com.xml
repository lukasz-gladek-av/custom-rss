That’s what makes the VMU Pro unique. Although it’s been upgraded with a 16-bit IPS TFT color screen and enough power to emulate NES, Sega Master System, and even Game Boy Color titles, it can still be inserted into an original Dreamcast controller and used to store save game data.</p><p>Other upgrades include a rechargeable battery (the original Dreamcast VMU was notorious for going through CR2032 coin cell batteries when used on its own), MP3 playback for those living without a smartphone, the ability to copy and backup save game data directly from an original VMU, Wi-Fi, and unlimited storage through microSD memory cards.</p><p>The retro emulation on a full-color screen is a fun feature, but if that’s the only reason you’re considering the VMU Pro, the <a href="https://anbernic.com/en-ca/products/rg-nano">Anbernic RG Nano</a> offers far superior emulation (including 3D consoles like the N64 and PS1) on a similarly-sized handheld. The VMU Pro will appeal more to those who still have a Sega Dreamcast in regular play rotation but are looking for a more reliable and easier way to store and swap game saves.</p><p>That’s assuming the VMU Pro isn’t going to be prohibitively expensive. In 2022, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/21/23365268/sega-dreamcast-vmu-virtual-memory-unit-card-2022-fundraiser-indiegogo-console">Dreamware Enterprises launched its own upgraded VMU called the VM2</a> with a backlit but monochromatic and pixelated screen for $114. It was a pricey upgrade for a console that Sega no longer supports, so hopefully three years of electronics evolution will result in a cheaper price tag for the VMU Pro.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can see the new “System Lock” option in a new video in the Nintendo Today app that’s actually about a battery-preservation feature.</p><p>The lock setting “locks your system with a PIN to protect it from people who don’t play on it,” according to the description in the menu shown in the video. “You’ll need to enter your PIN when you wake the system from sleep mode.”</p><p>The original Switch has a “Screen Lock” option, but all that does is require pressing the same button three times to use the device after waking it up from sleep mode. It seems like this new setting improves upon that by actually letting you decide a specific PIN to enter.</p><p>The Switch 2 is set to launch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">on June 5th</a>, and ahead of the release, Nintendo has been teasing out system features through the Nintendo Today app. In addition to the PIN and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664999/nintendo-switch-2-battery-health-charging-90-percent-limit">battery-preservation settings</a>, the app also showed how the Joy-Con mouse mode will let you <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1921588064238883038">use a cursor on the homescreen</a>.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
