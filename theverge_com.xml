That makes today your last chance to snag an <strong>Xbox Series S</strong> — either the 512GB model for $379.99 (which is even cheaper on sale for $329.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Xbox-512GB-SSD-Console-S/dp/B0D932YWSZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>) or the 1TB model for $429.99 (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Xbox-512GB-SSD-Console-S/dp/B0D934SHFG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fxbox-series-s-1tb-all-digital-console-disc-free-gaming-with-xbox-wireless-controller-120fps-xbox-series-s%2FJJGXPX33FK%2Fsku%2F6595695" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>) before the list price of both increases by $20. You can also grab the <strong>Xbox Series X Digital Edition</strong> for $549.99 (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Xbox-Gaming-Console-video-game/dp/B08H75RTZ8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fxbox-series-x-1tb-all-digital-console-disc-free-gaming-with-xbox-wireless-controller-4k-gaming-120fps-xbox-series-x%2FJJGXPX3GC2" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>) or the <strong>standard 1TB model</strong> for $599.99 (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Xbox-Gaming-Console-video-game/dp/B08H75RTZ8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fxbox-series-x-1tb-console-with-xbox-wireless-controller-4k-gaming-120fps-xbox-series-x%2FJ3ZKK5X72V%2Fsku%2F6428324" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>) before they each jump by $50. The <strong>Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition</strong> is also still available for $799.99 (<a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fxbox-series-x%257Cs%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-series-x-disc-drive-console-2tb---galaxy-black%2F415664.html%3Futm_medium%3Dpmax%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D%2524PMAX_%2524NB_MNFR_Preowned_Hardware_Microsoft%26utm_id%3D20628582149%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds%26gad_source%3D1%26gad_campaignid%3D20628588614%26gbraid%3D0AAAAAD5TdcTcNGUk5-mkSlPFrMO458clK%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwxfjGBhAUEiwAKWPwDvDTdXI6HkpERlAUimivSp0Tezp4GrSeIjU5kWgW3yiNFNgCBSFDBhoCwBAQAvD_BwE" rel="sponsored">GameStop</a>), before its price increases by $70.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->330</span></p><div><p>The Xbox Series S is smaller than the 4K-capable Xbox Series X, but it can still play the same digital games — albeit topping out at 2560 x 1440 QHD resolution. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->550</span></p><div><p>The Xbox Series X is Microsoft’s flagship console, serving as its most powerful (and biggest) option focused on fast, 4K gameplay. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><p>If you need help figuring out which console to buy, here’s the quick breakdown: the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review">Series X</a> is the more powerful option, capable of native 4K support, faster performance, and starts with 1TB of built-in storage, which is double what you’ll get with the smaller, less expensive Series S. The Series S, meanwhile, is designed for 1440p gaming and offers less built-in storage at 512GB. Notably, like the Xbox Series X Digital Edition, it also lacks an optical drive, so you can only play digital games.</p><p>Other than that, though, both consoles play all the same games and work with Xbox Game Pass, so whichever one you choose, you’ll still get access to the dozens of new titles recently added, ranging from <em>Hogwarts Legacy </em>and multiple <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>games to <em>Hades</em>, <em>Cities: Skylines – Remastered</em>, <em>Stardew Valley</em>, and more.</p><div><p id="three-more-good-deals"><h2>Three more good deals </h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong><em>Kirby Air Riders</em></strong> won’t hit stores until November 20th, but you can already buy the <em>Kirby Air Rider </em>sequel for $64.99 ($5 off) when you place your <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.costco.com/kirby-air-riders---nintendo-switch-2.product.4000404894.html" rel="sponsored">preorder at Costco</a>.

The USB-C screwdriver comes with 16 durable steel bits in a magnetic case, and runs on a rechargeable 2000mAh battery. It can also handle up to 340 screws on a full charge, making it great for assembling and fixing everything from PCs to furniture.</span></li><li><span>The<strong> Cuisinart Smash Burger Press </strong>is on sale for $10.07 ($15 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CRWVCMW4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> for Prime members.
