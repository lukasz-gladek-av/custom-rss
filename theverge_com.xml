You can now get up to 25 percent more Robux if you purchase the currency through gift cards, on your computer, or on the web, <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/users-can-enjoy-up-to-25-more-robux-on-computer-web-and-gift-cards/3275270">according to a developer forum post</a> from last week.</p><p>As for how that might look in practice, here’s some examples from the post:</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/2/24311337/roblox-robux-app-store-fees-worth-more-party">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODE5NQ==" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/18/24298330/roblox-child-safety-chat-parent-accounts">Roblox will restrict kids under 13 from chatting outside of games</a></h2><div><p>Roblox is starting to roll out some recently-announced child safety features, and the <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/11/major-updates-to-our-safety-systems-and-parental-controls">updates include</a> some new limitations for how users under 13 can communicate on the platform. Beginning Monday, users younger than 13 won’t be able to DM players outside of games or experiences on Roblox. And they’ll need parental permission to be able to send in-game DMs — though this change won’t be fully implemented across the platform until the first quarter of 2025.</p><p>The changes follow recent reports highlighting instances of Roblox failing to protect children. A big article <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/?srnd=undefined">from <em>Bloomberg</em></a> described how predators on the platform use chat to communicate with kids. And a report from Hindenburg Research described Roblox as “an X-rated pedophile hellscape.” These new restrictions on chat will build on Roblox’s <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313120-Safety-Features-Chat-Privacy-Filtering">automatic chat filters</a> intended to block users from sharing personal information.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/18/24298330/roblox-child-safety-chat-parent-accounts">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODgyMg==" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289837/roblox-banning-preteens-social-hangout-spaces">Roblox is banning kids from ‘social hangout’ spaces</a></h2><div><p>Roblox is going to block kids from accessing certain types of experiences following reports alleging that the platform has enabled child abuse.</p><p>One new measure will stop kids under 13 from accessing experiences with “certain types of interactive features,” Roblox says <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/updating-experience-guideline-policies-to-keep-our-younger-users-safe/3249079">in a post on its developer forum</a>. Those include “social hangouts,” where the primary purpose is to communicate with others over text or voice chat, and “free-form 2D user creation” experiences, where players can do things like draw on a chalkboard or whiteboard.

In a report published on Tuesday, the <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/">investment firm Hindenburg Research</a> claims Roblox is “consistently overstating the amount of people on its platform by 25 percent to 42 percent or more.”</p><p>Roblox, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578491/roblox-ipo-announced-dau-increase-pandemic">which went public in 2021</a>, reported <a href="https://ir.roblox.com/news/news-details/2024/Roblox-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=non%2DGAAP%20guidance.-,Based%20on%20the%20carrying%20amount%20of%20deferred%20revenue%20and%20deferred,2024%20and%20an%20increase%20in">having 79.5 million</a> daily active users in its most recent earnings report. However, Hindenburg claims Roblox “intentionally conflates” actual people with daily users, as that number could also include alt accounts and bots. The research alleges that Roblox can separate alt accounts from single users, even though the company’s disclosure says daily active users “are not a measure of unique individuals accessing Roblox.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24265145/roblox-hindenburg-reseach-dau-child-safety-short-seller-report">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTY5OTI=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/6/24237685/robloxs-ceo-on-getting-to-1-billion-users">Roblox’s CEO on getting to 1 billion users</a></h2><div><p>Roblox CEO David Baszucki has a goal that even he admits is “a little audacious”: to grow the company’s share of the global gaming market’s revenue to 10 percent in the coming few years. </p><p>For comparison, the company’s investor guidance of $4.2 billion in bookings this year is about 2 percent of the global gaming market, which Roblox estimates to currently be between $160 billion and $180 billion.

That’s significantly more than the roughly 30 percent revenue split Roblox gives developers for purchases made with its native Robux currency inside freemium experiences.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/6/24237039/roblox-share-revenue-creators-paid-experiences-rdc-2024">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MjU3NTI=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24174713/ikea-hiring-roblox-virtual-reality-store">Ikea will pay 10 Roblox players to roleplay as employees in its virtual store</a></h2><div><p>Corporate publicity stunts involving virtual reality are almost always bad, but Ikea’s new <em>Roblox</em> store feels especially silly.

In a recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-studio-boss-children-making-money-on-the-platform-isnt-exploitation-its-a-gift">interview with <em>Eurogamer</em></a>, however, <em>Roblox</em>’s studio head, Stefano Corazza, said the platform has actually been a gift to the young developers who make money by creating games on the platform.</p><p>“You can say, ‘Okay, we are exploiting, you know, child labor,’ right? Or you can say: we are offering people anywhere in the world the capability to get a job, and even like an income,” Corazza said. “So I can be like, 15 years old, in Indonesia, living in a slum, and then now with just a laptop, I can create something, make money, and then sustain my life.” (An unidentified <em>Roblox</em> PR person present during the interview told <em>Eurogamer </em>that most of the developers earning money on <em>Roblox</em> are 18 or older.)</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/4/24121420/roblox-child-exploitation-robux-child-labor">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MzMzMDk=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/4/24121362/roblox-heads-to-washington">Roblox heads to Washington</a></h2><div><p>In late January, a handful of social media CEOs were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/31/24056136/congress-child-safety-hearing-kosa-meta-x-discord-snap-tiktok">hauled before Congress to testify</a> about what they were and weren’t doing to project kids on their services.

It’s not nearly as polished <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23992574/fortnite-festival-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band">as Epic’s newly-launched <em>Fortnite Festival</em></a>, but if you’ve been looking for something like that in <em>Roblox</em>, <em>Beat Galaxy</em> is in the ballpark.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Roblox’s chatbot assistant for developers is available now in beta.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>You can now buy subscriptions in Roblox experiences that offer them.</p><p>The company rolled out the ability for developers to make them <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/19/23881336/roblox-in-experience-subscriptions-developers">in September</a>, and now, if you want, users can <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/subscriptions-within-experiences-now-available-for-users-to-purchase/2702306">actually start paying for them</a>.

He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Discord is offering users <a href="https://discord.com/safety/safer-internet-day-2025">a new way to block people</a> without the confrontational nature of an actual block. The new feature, called Ignore, is essentially a mute function that can hide annoying or abusive users without attracting unwanted attention — thus avoiding unnecessary anxiety or flare-up drama.</p><p>You can apply the new Ignore feature by going to a user’s profile, tapping the triple-dot menu, and selecting Ignore (in the same menu where Block can be found). Once you activate it, you’ll no longer see that user’s profile and messages, and you will see less of them across Discord, as it will mute their notifications and activity, including in server message notifications (in other words, alerts). However, the big distinction is that, unlike with a Block, Ignore will still let them see your profile and activity and allow them to send you messages (which you won’t know about unless you unhide them). But they will be none-the-wiser about their Ignore status.</p><p>Discord says it’s adding Ignore to its safety “toolbox” to give users, especially teens, more discreet ways to take space from others without making situations scary. Discord is also joining OpenAI, Google, Roblox, and others in establishing a non-profit foundation called ROOST, which will offer open-source technology for detecting child sexual abuse material (CSAM) to various organizations.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
