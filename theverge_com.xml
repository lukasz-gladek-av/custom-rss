Before the first reviews of the new console have appeared online, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pro-modding">YouTube channel ProModding</a> has already shared a 17-minute teardown video of the handheld that includes close-ups of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642793/nintendo-switch-2-dlss-support-nvidia-ray-tracing">custom Nvidia processor</a>.</p><p>Aside from Nintendo hiding a few screws and release latches beneath stickers on either side of the console, the teardown appears to be relatively straightforward if you already have the tools needed to carefully remove ribbon cables and other connectors and don’t care about voiding the Switch 2’s warranty.</p><p>The teardown doesn’t provide many new insights into the Switch 2’s internal hardware, but ProModding did share a few observations of the new console. The Joy-Con controllers do sit tighter when attached to the Switch 2 than they did on the original, but can still be wobbled. Nintendo appears to be using the same types of thermal paste it used on the first Switch, which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVxMUmT11e0">some gamers have replaced</a> to improve performance and prolong the life of their consoles.</p><p>They also note that the folding support stand on the back of the Switch 2 is “too flimsy” and that there is a “high risk of breakage” when attempting to unfold it from only one side.</p><p>If you want to know how repairable the Switch 2 is, you might need to wait for iFixit’s teardown. Yesterday, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678622/ifixit-nerfs-nintendo-switch-repair-score-battery-drift">iFixit retroactively reduced the original Nintendo Switch’s repair score</a> from the 8 out of 10 it gave the console in 2017 to a 4 out of 10, based more on its battery setup and progress made by competitors like Valve’s Steam Deck than the finicky Joy-Con sticks.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Switch 2 also has new software features like the Discord-like GameChat, which could make it easier to trash talk your friends. There are new accessories, too, including an improved Pro Controller.</p><p>Now that the Switch 2 is finally in people’s hands, we can all dive in on what it’s like to actually have the console in our homes and in our bags. And, of course, there will be lots of games to play.</p><p>Here’s all of our coverage of the launch.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6Njc5NDY4" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/679468/nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-more-titles">Nintendo is updating even more games for the Switch 2</a></h2><div><p>As Nintendo gets ready for the launch of the Switch 2 on June 5th, it’s now rolling out updates to even more titles than it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/668830/nintendo-switch-2-game-updates">previously announced</a>. On a series of support pages <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-switch-2-updates-for-multiple-first-party-switch-games-are-now-available">spotted by <em>Nintendo Life</em></a>, Nintendo has revealed free updates meant to boost the performance across games on the Switch 2.</p><p>Here’s a list of the additional games Nintendo is updating:</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/679468/nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-more-titles">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6Njc5MzQ2" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/679346/nintendo-switch-2-review-guidelines-plan-launch">How I plan to review the Nintendo Switch 2</a></h2><div><p><cite>Photo by Owen Grove / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p>Reviewing a new video game console is usually an isolating experience. You get a device in the mail, hook it up to your television, and then play a bunch of games on your own or, occasionally, with the small handful of other people who have one in for review. You have to quickly test everything you can think of, then race to get an article ready to publish ahead of launch to help readers understand what they’re getting into.</p><p>That’s how things went when Tom Warren and I covered the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review">Xbox Series X</a> in 2020. But with the Nintendo Switch 2, things aren’t quite so simple — and it’s going to take a lot more people.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/679346/nintendo-switch-2-review-guidelines-plan-launch">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6Njc5MzY3" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/679367/fortnite-nintendo-switch-2-update-gamechat-mouse-controls">Fortnite on the Switch 2 will support GameChat and mouse controls</a></h2><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite/679077/epic-games-fortnite-creators-ai-npcs-darth-vader"><em>Fortnite</em></a> is coming to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/676901/nintendo-switch-2-launch-here">the Switch 2</a> with some massive visual improvements and new features that are going to make it feel like a new game for the Nintendo crowd.</p><p>While we knew that <em>Fortnite </em>would be playable on the Switch 2 at launch, today <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-comes-to-nintendo-switch-2">Epic announced</a> all of the new features that are being incorporated into the game via an update. After years of maxing out at 30 fps on the original Switch, <em>Fortnite </em>will now run at 60fps on the Switch 2. The game is also getting a resolution bump to 2176x1224 when docked and 1600x900 when undocked (up from 1560x880 docked / 1170x660 undocked). Draw distance, textures, shadows, and water rendering are also getting an overall quality boost that will make the game more crisp.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/679367/fortnite-nintendo-switch-2-update-gamechat-mouse-controls">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>The Switch 2 will let you hoard up to 30,000 screenshots.</p><p>The original Switch capped the number of screenshots you could save to a meager 10,000, but for the Switch 2 Nintendo has increased the limit to 30,000, <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/nintendo-switch-2-allows-you-to-save-up-to-30000-screenshots/">according to <em>NintendoSoup</em></a>. That’s split between the console’s system memory and a microSD card, with each having a capacity of 15,000 images.</p><p>The Switch 2 can also store up to 6,500 30 second videos — 1,500 in its system memory, and an additional 5,000 on a microSD card.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Welp, that didn’t take long at all.</p><p>While parts of the world are still watching for deliveries and setting up shop in front of GameStops and BestBuys waiting for a Switch 2, some folks have already gotten a head start on the Great Nintendo Content Rush of 2025.</p><p>Already there are <em>multiple</em> streams on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mario+kart+world">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/mario-kart-world">Twitch</a> showing off <em>Mario Kart World</em> to the envy of the rest of us plebs.

According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/andyrobinson.bsky.social/post/3lqrwa2ehur26"><em>VGC’s</em> Andy Robinson</a>, logging in after a system transfer (and day one update download) is a lot like an Xbox, with all of your Switch 2 games ready to install.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6Njc5MzI3" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/679327/nintendo-switch-2-handheld-teardown">Look inside the Nintendo Switch 2 with the console’s first teardown</a></h2><div><p>It’s already<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details"> June 5th</a> in some parts of the world, which means the Nintendo Switch 2 is now out in the wild.
