While a slew of leaks in the past few months spoiled some of the surprises, seeing him in action is an entirely different thing. He has a passive ability that is unlike any character we’ve seen before, with the ability to not only shield downed teammates while reviving them, but he can also drag them to safety. The shield’s power level increases if Newcastle is carrying a higher-tier knockdown shield, which adds another tweak to an often overlooked item.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/5/23058327/apex-legends-saviors-newcastle-ranked-battle-royale">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTAyNzgz" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/28/22999936/apex-legends-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-warriors-update">Apex Legends next-gen console updates with 4K and HDR launch tomorrow</a></h2><div><p>Respawn Entertainment has confirmed that <em>Apex Legends </em>upgrades for the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S consoles will launch tomorrow <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/warriors-collection-event">with the new Warriors collection event</a>. Until now, the battle royale shooter has shared versions across the console generations.

After a healthy dose of promoted live streams, the game quickly carved out a unique space and grew rapidly in popularity, racking up 25 million registered players in one week and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382560/apex-legends-100-million-players-respawn-ea">crossing the 100 million mark</a> in time for its second birthday. Now, <em>Apex Legends</em> is turning three, and in a conversation with <em>The Verge</em>, game director Steven Ferreira said that this year, players should expect to see the title do things that are completely unlike what we’ve seen so far while still keeping the battle royale as the core of the game.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/4/22917825/apex-legends-defiance-hands-on-interview-battle-royal-sandbox">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTE3MDMz" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22750879/apex-legends-escape-ash-storm-point-respawn-ea">Apex Legends: Escape takes the battle royale shooter on vacation at the perfect time</a></h2><div><p>In the years since Respawn and EA launched <em>Apex Legends</em>, the shooter has carved out its place among a crowded field of contenders. Other games have tried to enter the market and failed to make much impact alongside the other battle royale titans like <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>, <em>PUBG</em>, and <em>Fortnite</em>. Still, despite a healthy player base and competitive scene, a new update, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/escape">dubbed Escape</a>, arrives following one of the roughest seasons <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/4/18209895/fortnite-apex-legends-respawn-ea-battle-royale-free-release-date-hands-on">since the debut</a>, and it might be exactly what the game needs.</p><p>Last season’s new character, Seer, drew criticism from many players until Respawn nerfed his special abilities.

But the most pivotal addition to the battle royale game is its ranked mode. Split into six tiers, this new mode will likely be the lifeblood of <em>Apex Legends </em>going forward, keeping it engaging for competitive players and carving out a community of top-tier streamers and aspiring pros who can form the backbone of a future e-sports scene. </p><p>The good news is that <em>Apex Legends</em>’ ranked mode is wonderfully designed. It fixes almost every big complaint I’ve had about such modes in other games, giving me a rewarding way to spend my time in a way that never feels like a second job, as so many games-as-a-service titles like Bungie’s <em>Destiny 2</em> can feel. I’ve only just started playing, but can already see myself spending dozens to hundreds of hours here, so long as Respawn keeps it from growing stale and finds ways to combat the inherent toxicity ranked modes are infamous for. </p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687943/apex-legends-ranked-mode-competitive-playlist-season-2-review">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTkwMDk3" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18536028/apex-legends-iphone-android-mobile-ea-respawn">EA wants to bring Apex Legends to mobile</a></h2><div><p>Today EA released its quarterly earnings, and unsurprisingly <em>Apex Legends</em> was a big hit.

And, in fact, one of those streamers, <em>Fortnite </em>extraordinaire Tyler “Ninja” Blevins, may have earned as much as $1 million for doing so, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-electronic-arts-apexlegends/top-gamer-ninja-made-1-million-to-promote-eas-apex-legends-launch-source-idUSKBN1QU2AC?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technologyNews">according to <em>Reuters</em></a>.</p><p>Ninja’s live-streaming and social media promotions helped <em>Apex Legends</em> gain traction among his 13.6 million-plus Twitch followers, as well as his Twitter following of over 4 million and Instagram audience of over 13.2 million. Now, an anonymous source tells <em>Reuters</em> that his efforts were reportedly worth the seven-figure sum.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18264366/ninja-ea-apex-legends-1-million-dollars-promoted-stream-fortnite-sponsorships">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTk0OTAy" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/10/18254498/apex-legends-esports-battle-royale-team-liquid-tsm-100-thieves">E-sports teams are flocking to Apex Legends</a></h2><div><p><em>Apex Legends </em>is the hottest game of the moment, skyrocketing to 50 million registered players in its first month of existence. Its combination of lightning-quick action and squad-focused gameplay has made it not only a popular game to play, but an exciting one to watch as well. <em>Apex</em> regularly dominates the Twitch charts, often topping mainstay <em>Fortnite</em>. So it’s no surprise that <em>Apex Legends</em> is primed to become the next big e-sport.</p><p>Over the last few weeks, established e-sports teams have been slowly assembling <em>Apex Legends</em> squads. The last week, in particular, has been a flurry of announcements. TSM, 100 Thieves, Gen.G, and NRG all added either entire <em>Apex</em> teams or individual players over the last few days. One of the more surprising moves saw venerated e-sports organization Team Liquid move its <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 4</em> “blackout” team over to <em>Apex</em>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/10/18254498/apex-legends-esports-battle-royale-team-liquid-tsm-100-thieves">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTk2MDA1" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/27/18242941/fortnite-anthem-apex-legends-gaming-time">There’s not enough time to play all of these online shooters</a></h2><div><p>For the past few nights, most of my time has been spent exploring the fantastical sci-fi realm of <em>Anthem</em>, fighting off countless alien bad guys and putting far too much energy into making sure my armor is just the right color. During that same period, I’ve been getting in regular matches of <em>Apex Legends</em>, Respawn’s new team-based battle royale that’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213537/apex-legend-voice-chat-solo-play-xbox-ps4-pc">perfect for people who don’t like to talk while they shoot</a>. Meanwhile, I’ve also been preparing myself for the impending eighth season of <em>Fornite</em>, wrapping up a final few quests and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/15/18226060/fortnite-earthquakes-tremors-island-season-8">tracking the earthquake-induced cracks in the landscape</a>.</p><p>I’ve also realized that I don’t have time for all of this.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/27/18242941/fortnite-anthem-apex-legends-gaming-time">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTk3NzE1" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/18/18229778/apex-legends-fortnite-battle-royale-comparison">Apex Legends is a better battle royale, but I’d rather hang out in Fortnite</a></h2><div><p>Even though I’ve been playing <em>Fortnite</em> for the better part of a year, I still get surprised by the butterflies. There I am, running along the edge of a giant crater or sneaking through a dense forest, and some blue, fluttering wings catch my eye. I don’t exactly stop and stare — that’s too dangerous in a battle royale where everyone is out to kill you — but it’s enough to capture my attention for a brief second, before I move on to explore other parts of the island.</p><p>There’s nothing similar to those charming butterflies in <em>Apex Legends</em>. Respawn’s <em>Titanfall</em>-themed shooter stormed out of the gates when it launched two weeks ago, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/11/18221014/apex-legends-25-million-player-milestone-respawn-battle-royale-ea">racking up 25 million players in seven days</a> and regularly dominating the Twitch charts. <em>Apex</em> isn’t the first battle royale game to challenge <em>Fortnite</em>, but none of its contemporaries have had this kind of momentum. Even neon-haired <em>Fortnite</em> star Ninja is playing Respawn’s game, winning the game’s first major tournament last week in front of hundreds of thousands of viewers.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/18/18229778/apex-legends-fortnite-battle-royale-comparison">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li></ul><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/7/18216116/apex-legends-titanfall-battle-royale-ps4-xbox-pc/archives/2"><span>More Stories</span></a></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
