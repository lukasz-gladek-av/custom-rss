The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24270763/anbernic-rg-p01-wireless-controller-switch-pc-android-ios-steam">company’s first gamepad</a>, the RG P01, offered features like <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg-p01?variant=45681067426049">Hall effect triggers and joysticks</a> for just $18. Pricing for the new Anbernic RG G01 hasn’t been revealed, but it may be more expensive due to several upgrades, including a curved color display on the front and a heart rate sensor.</p></div><p>The RG G01 won’t be the first controller with a built-in screen. Companies like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stealth-Wireless-Controller-Officially-Licensed-PC/dp/B0DJTJDN73/ref=sr_1_11??tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Turtle Beach already offer them</a>. While a display adds to the cost, it lets gamers adjust settings, program macros that automatically trigger a series of button presses, and remap controls, without having to leave a game and connect to a mobile or desktop app. The RG G01 has four customizable buttons on the back that can be reconfigured using the display.</p><p>As for the heart rate sensor that appears to be integrated into the RG G01’s grips? Its functionality is questionable. Nintendo announced a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/5/4496818/nintendo-president-iwata-wii-vitality-sensor-shelved">heart rate-tracking accessory for the Wii at E3 2009</a> called the Vitality Sensor that could have potentially incorporated a player’s pulse into games, but it was cancelled. Anbernic’s RG G01 will display your heart rate on the controller’s screen and it has a pulse alarm, but there’s no details on what exactly it will warn you about.</p><p>The RG G01 will include both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless connectivity, and the option to tether to a device with a USB-C cable. It’s fully compatible with systems running Steam, Linux, Windows, Android, iOS, and Nintendo’s various Switch consoles. There’s a six-axis gyroscope for playing games with motion controls, “electro-inductive capacitive joysticks,” and dual-mode triggers with switches that limit their travel for faster response times – a feature that was noticeably missing from the Anbernic RG P01.</p><p>Anbernic only says the controller is “Coming Soon!”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/866600/anbernic-rg-g01-smart-wireless-gaming-controller-heart-rate-sensor-display]]></content:encoded>
