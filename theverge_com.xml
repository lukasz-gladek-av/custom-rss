Luckey told one person in a reply that it’s “Never too late to change your mind” about their Analogue 3D pre-order.</p><p>For its part, Analogue maintains its 100 percent refund policy on canceled pre-orders, and “We are working hard to get your 3D order in hands asap and appreciate your patience. If you have an open preorder, no action is needed.” It will also email buyers a week before the consoles ship to make sure their listed addresses are up to date.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
