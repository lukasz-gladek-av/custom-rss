            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Towerborne</em>, a side-scrolling action RPG published by Xbox Game Studios that has been available in early access, will officially launch on February 26th. But instead of launching as a free-to-play, always-on online game as originally planned, <em>Towerborne</em> is instead going to be a paid game that you can play offline.</p><p>“You will own the complete experience permanently, with offline play and online co-op,” Trisha Stouffer, CEO and president of <em>Towerborne</em> developer Stoic, says in <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/08/towerborne-launches-february-26-with-massive-full-game-update/">an Xbox Wire blog post</a>. “This change required deep structural rebuilding over the past year, transforming systems originally designed around constant connectivity. The result is a stronger, more accessible, and more player-friendly version of Towerborne — one we’re incredibly proud to bring to launch.”</p><p>“After listening to our community during Early Access and Game Preview, we learned players wanted a complete, polished experience without ongoing monetization mechanics,” <a href="https://www.towerborne.com/FAQ/">according to an FAQ</a>. “Moving to a premium model lets us deliver the full game upfront—no live-service grind, no pay-to-win systems—just the best version of <em>Towerborne</em>.”</p><p>With the popular live service games like <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Roblox</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/858127/top-five-most-played-games-xbox-ps5-2025">getting harder to usurp</a>, <em>Towerborne’s</em> switch to a premium, offline-playable experience could make it more enticing for players who don’t want to jump into another time-sucking forever game. It makes <em>Towerborne</em> more appealing to me, at least.</p><p>With the 1.0 release of the game, <em>Towerborne</em> will have a “complete” story, new bosses, and a “reworked” difficulty system. You’ll also be able to acquire all in-game cosmetics for free through gameplay, with “no more cosmetic purchasing.” Players who are already part of early access will still be able to play the game.</p><p><em>Towerborne</em> will launch on February 26th on Xbox Series X / S, Xbox on PC, Game Pass, Steam, and PS5. The standard edition will cost $24.99, while the deluxe edition will cost $29.99.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/859176/towerborne-launch-release-date-paid-offline]]></content:encoded>
