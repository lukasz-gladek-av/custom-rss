            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>A new <em>Mario Kart</em> is usually built around some kind of notable feature. <em>Double Dash</em> added co-op play, while the DS iteration let you play other people online. With <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/15/5714102/mario-kart-8-review">it was gravity-defying tracks</a> and, later, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/1/23941695/mario-kart-8-deluxe-wave-6-dlc-tracks-release-date-characters">the idea of expanding the game through DLC courses</a>. With <em>Mario Kart World</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer">perhaps the biggest launch title for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, there isn’t one single innovation that sets it apart. Instead, it’s the overwhelming chaos created by all the new features — and it’s a blast.</p></div><p>You can tell <em>World</em> is different right when you start a new race. Instead of beginning from a stopped position, your kart is already in motion before the race begins. That’s a small detail, though. What struck me when I played the game is just how much is going on. The tracks are larger, with wider roads and more alternate paths, and there are lots of moving pieces. Here’s a small sampling of the obstacles I faced during a few races: a road with towering giraffes and speeding ostriches getting mixed up with traffic; goombas that not only walked around but charged as soon as they saw me; koopa troopas that tossed things to knock me off course; and thwomps that would block the road but also fall over to create a temporary ramp.</p><p>There are also some new ways to navigate as you can now drive across water — and those waters are often choppy — and grind on certain rails like you were playing <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em>. I even saw some destructible elements, like guardrails that went flying when crashed into. Oh, and and races now include 24 drivers at a time. At one point, when I was close to taking the lead in a race, a pair of Bullet Bills whipped past me at the exact same time, sending me tumbling toward the back of the pack.</p><p>Perhaps the best example of this chaotic mindset is the new “knockout tour” mode, which is a bit like a <em>Mario Kart </em>take on battle royale. As you make your way through a course, you’ll come up against gated sections that only certain racers can get through. So, for example, the gate might only be accessible for those in 20th place or better, meaning all those trailing behind will get knocked out. The placement for subsequent gates will then increase throughout the race until there’s a winner, and it becomes a mad dash to stay on the track as long as possible.</p><p>There are also just a lot of neat, little details in <em>World</em>. Racers get squashed flat when run over, and you can spot tiny details like Mario’s poncho ruffling in the wind or Boo plugging his ears when a bomb detonates nearby. The rain, the water, the racers’ eclectic outfits — this is a really fun game to look at (which, of course, is extremely hard to do in the middle of a race).</p><p>Throw all of these elements together, and you get an experience that is filled with chaos and presents more opportunities than ever for exciting, emergent moments. That’s saying something considering how wild <em>Mario Kart</em> has been in the past. <em>Mario Kart 8</em> and its Switch port are a tough, best-selling game to follow up, but <em>World</em> might end up topping it through sheer excess.</p><p><sub>Mario Kart World <em>launches alongside the Nintendo Switch on June 5th.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/642493/nintendo-switch-mouse-controls-metroid-prime-4<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Perhaps the most noticeable difference between the original Nintendo Switch and the Switch 2 — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641598/the-nintendo-switch-2-will-cost-449-99">besides the more expensive price</a> — is the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642024/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controllers-mouse-magnetic-attach-c-button">Joy-Con controller</a> and its come-out-of-nowhere mouse functionality. I got the chance to demo them at a hands-on event, and damn are my shoulders and wrists <em>sore</em>. </p><p>There were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641985/nintendo-switch-2-every-game-announced-direct">several games</a> at the event that showed off the new mouse functionality, and I tried a couple of them, specifically <em>Drag x Drive</em> (pronounced drag <em>and</em> drive) and <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. Let’s start with <em>Drag x Drive</em>, the 3v3 wheelchair basketball game that essentially exists to show off the new Joy-Con mouse features. </p><p>But before I dive in: at the hands-on event, every game that showed off the mouse features was set up with a nice flat table, but the developers of the Switch 2 understand that most people don’t play console games with a handy table nearby and ready to go. From the hardware developer roundtable that took place at the event, I learned that you can use your lap as a surface, but not on bare skin — the controller also might have issues with certain fabrics, but at the very least, you gotta wear pants.</p><p>From the very first time I flipped a Joy-Con on its side, I knew using it as a mouse was going to be a problem. Holding a Joy-Con in the configuration required to use it as a mouse forces my hand to contort at an angle that is just off enough to feel awkward. To get at the buttons, my fingers can’t lay in a flat, neutral position like they would on a mouse. They have to curl, forcing my wrist to pivot up in an unnatural position.</p><p>It’s not immediately painful, but after moving my arms up and down across the table to mimic powering a wheelchair, I could feel tension shooting up my wrist all the way to my shoulder. After the short demo session, in which I practiced moving the chair and passing and shooting the ball, my right arm burned with an unpleasant sting, and I don’t have a history of carpel tunnel syndrome or other pains of the wrist and shoulder. </p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640231/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-2-enhanced-edition-beyond"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> was a better experience in terms of how the Joy-Con mouse felt in my hand, but worse in terms of function. For the demo, I held the two Joy-Cons in each hand, and I could choose to use my right hand as either a mouse or hold it normally. I will say that it was neat that I could seamlessly transition between mouse mode and regular mode with the twist of my wrist — the game automatically sensed which way I was holding the controller and responded accordingly. But <em>neither </em>felt good to use. The right hand controlled Samus’ aiming and shooting, and in both modes, I missed 90 percent of her shots because it was so hard to aim precisely. </p><div><p>I don’t know how some of y’all played the previous<em> Metroid Prime</em> titles, first-person action adventure games, with a Wiimote, and this felt like the Wii’s “waggle physics” — a term that describes the Wii’s imprecise and ofttimes janky motion controlling — resurrected from the dead. I know I would have enjoyed the demo way more if I had the option to play with a regular-ass controller.</p><p>Mouse functionality is one of the biggest differentiators between the OG Switch and the Switch 2: Electric Boogaloo, but I simply don’t care for it. There’s nothing I saw at the hands-on event that really demonstrated the use case for this feature. It’s awkward, the novelty it introduces does not improve gameplay, and frankly, it <em>hurts </em>to use. I hope that there are more games coming, like <em>Civilization VII</em>, for which the mouse functionality actually makes sense, that’ll convince me this is cool. But for now, I don’t see it.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
