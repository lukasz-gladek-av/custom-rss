We got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777071/super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-nintendo-direct-september-2025">a new trailer for the <em>Super Mario Bros Movie</em> sequel</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/777095/so-can-yoshi-read">a new Yoshi game</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/777084/things-are-heating-up">a new <em>Mario Tennis</em> game</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/777097/what-even-is-this-thing">this weird thing</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777117/hades-2-release-date-september-nintendo-switch">a <em>Hades II </em>release date</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777159/pokemon-pokopia-nintendo-switch-2">a new <em>Pokémon</em> game</a>, and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777056/metroid-prime-4-release-date-nintend-direct-september-2025#comments">Metroid Prime 4</a></em>’s release date. But if that weren’t enough, and apparently it wasn’t according to Nintendo, the company has <em>also</em> revealed a first look at the latest <em>Fire Emblem</em> game titled <em>Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave</em>.</p></div><p>The reveal trailer gave us a glimpse of the world of <em>Fortune’s Weave</em>. The game features what looks to be the same kind of factional rivalries that made <em>Fates</em>, <em>Awakening</em>, and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726336/fire-emblem-three-houses-review-nintendo-switch">Three Houses</a></em> so special. <em>Fortune’s Weave</em> also features totally new characters in a brand new setting that, so far, looks much more interesting than what <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23557639/fire-emblem-engage-nintendo-switch-review"><em>Fire Emblem Engage</em> had to offer</a>.</p><p>At the heart of <em>Fortune’s Weave</em> is the Heroic Games, a gladiator-like contest that will no doubt have massive implications on the wider story. <em>Fortune’s Weave</em> looks to have the same tactical RPG rock-paper-scissors combat that I love about the series including new combat units that have some gladiatorial flair. We’ll learn all <em>Fire Emblem Fortune</em>’s <em>Weave</em> has to offer when it launches on the Switch 2 some time next year.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777187/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave-annoucement-trailer#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/777187/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave-annoucement-trailer]]></content:encoded>

Promotional art for the expansion seems to suggest that the Hoopa, a mythical pokémon known for creating portals to other dimensions, will be featured in <em>Mega Dimension</em>’s story. Nintendo did not announce exactly when the DLC will drop, but you can pre-order it today through the eShop.</p><p>Nintendo also revealed that <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A </em>will introduce new mega evolutions for Chesnaught, Delphox, and Greninja, the fully-evolved forms of <em>Pokémon X </em>and <em>Y</em>’s starter pokémon. Up until now, The Pokémon Company has been teasing and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pokemon/767403/pokemon-legenda-za-mega-hawlucha">revealing new megas</a> one by one with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pokemon/775547/pokemon-legends-za-mega-malamar">a series of inspired ad campaigns</a>. But with <em>Legends Z-A </em>due to release in about a month, it seems like the company is putting its foot on the gas to get everyone as hyped as possible.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/pokemon/777169/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-nmega-raichu#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTE="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Charles Pulliam-Moore</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/pokemon/777169/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-nmega-raichu]]></content:encoded>
