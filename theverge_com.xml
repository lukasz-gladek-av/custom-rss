            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/644516/legend-of-zelda-switch-2-upgrade-price<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo’s hoping to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642868/nintendo-switch-2-price-console-games-accessories">relieve some of the sticker shock</a> it gave fans with its game pricing with the news that the Switch 2 upgrades for both <em>Legend of Zelda</em> games will only cost $10 if you already own them. The games are priced for the Nintendo Switch 2 at $69.99 for <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and $79.99 for <em>Tears of the Kingdom.</em> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy">In an interview with <em>IGN</em>, Bill Trinen</a>, Nintendo of America’s VP of product and player experience, broke down the pricing situation.</p><p>“What you’re looking at is for the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, that’s the physical price for somebody that has not bought the base game,” he said. “For somebody who has bought <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> or <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, the upgrade packs for those are $9.99. And if you happen to be a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack member, both of the <em>Zelda</em> upgrade packs are inclusive within that membership.”</p><p>Trinen did not explain if digital copies of the two games would be cheaper than their physical versions. Additionally, <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>, a game that uses surprisingly fun and informative mini-games to explain the inner workings of the console, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643842/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">will also be priced at $9.99</a> although some think the game should be included with the Switch 2 akin to <em>Astro’s Playroom</em> for the PS5.</p><p>But it seems that, for Americans at least, the pricing conversation regarding Nintendo Switch 2 games will have to take a back seat to the more pressing matter of figuring out the exact price of the console itself. Pre-orders have started for the Switch 2 in other countries while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">the US is forced to wait</a> to hear how or if the Trump presidency’s tariffs, which includes a 24 percent tariff on Japanese goods, will impact the console’s $449.99 price.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
