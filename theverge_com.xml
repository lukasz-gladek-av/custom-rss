            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/683635/retroid-pocket-dual-screen-add-on-nintendo-ds-touchscreen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21441254/nintendo-ds-3ds-discontinued-eulogy">Nintendo DS was a wildly successful console</a>, but emulating its unique dual screen design on modern handhelds is a challenge. You can try to squeeze both screens onto a single touchscreen, attempt to completely <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/18/23923136/ayaneo-flip-ds-kb-handheld-gaming-pc-nintendo-emulation">recreate the DS’ unique hardware</a>, or do what Retroid is doing and release a temporary clamp-on, secondary screen that’s compatible with its handhelds and other third-party devices.</p><p>The Retroid Dual Screen Add-on is <a href="https://www.goretroid.com/en-ca/products/retroid-dual-screen-add-on">currently available through the company’s online store</a> in black, purple (inspired by the GameCube), and translucent white color options for $69, but are currently sold out. That includes a version designed for Retroid’s own Pocket handhelds including the RP Mini, RP Mini V2, RP4 Pro, and RP5, and the version for third-party handhelds. As long as a device isn’t taller than 115mm and supports DisplayPort over USB-C it should be compatible, but Retroid specifically points out the Steam Deck is not.</p><p>Featuring a 5.5-inch AMOLED screen with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and dedicated brightness buttons on the side, the Dual Screen Add-on attaches to devices with an expanding clamp and can be positioned at three different angles using a “click-stop hinge.” However, the second screen can’t be folded flat against the handheld it’s attached to like with the DS.</p><p>The add-on features touchscreen functionality, which is supported through the DisplayPort protocol. If your handheld of choice is lacking touch capabilities, hanging the add-on off the bottom will let you play DS games that heavily relied on lower touchscreen interactions. But since Retroid’s Dual Screen Add-on is at its core just an external display for a handheld, what games you can play and how the screen will be utilized is left to the device’s operating system or the emulator you’re using.</p><p>The add-on weighs around 130 grams, thanks in part to it skipping a built-in battery. It’s powered directly by the device it’s connected to, but it does have its own USB-C port with pass-through charging capabilities so you can keep both the display and your handheld running without killing its battery.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
