If you wanted to go wireless, your best option was the 8BitDo 64 which offered a similar button and joystick layout as the N64’s original controllers, but with a modernized design. For a more authentic but conveniently wireless N64 experience, <a href="https://x.com/analogue/status/2017266637154435335?s=61">Analogue has released an update for the 3D</a> today that adds support for Nintendo’s modernized N64 controller.</p><p>Nintendo’s wireless controller was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688780/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-64-sega-genesis-controllers">announced in 2021 alongside N64 games</a> coming to the Nintendo Switch Online platform. Coming from Nintendo it’s about as accurate a recreation of the N64’s original hardware as you can find, but at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-64-controller%2F" rel="sponsored">$54.99</a> it’s more expensive than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Analogue-Windows-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DK6VCGBC/ref=sr_1_1?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$39.99 8BitDo 64</a>, and it can only be purchased if you’re already subscribed to the Nintendo Switch Online service. The only way to get a more authentic wireless N64 controller is to upgrade the original wired versions using <a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-mod-kit-for-original-n64-controller?variant=42794771415217">8BitDo’s $39.99 Mod Kit</a>.</p><p>The Analogue 3D version 1.2.0 firmware update is <a href="https://www.analogue.co/support/3d/firmware/1.2.0">available for download now through the company’s website</a> and <a href="https://www.analogue.co/support/3d/guide/getting-started#updating-3dos">can be installed</a> by either copying it to the console’s memory card, or connecting the 3D to a PC with a USB-C cable. Other improvements include fixes for compatibility issues with some 4K displays and switches and audio clipping problems. The Analogue 3D’s Library will also now remember when a game has been added to your collection and will track your total play time for each title.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/870968/analogue-3d-n64-nintendo-switch-online-wireless-controller-software-update]]></content:encoded>
