I’d describe it as roguelike-ish; you pick a starting character with certain attributes and a specific weapon, and you’ll level up that weapon, other weapons, and other items as you collect gems by defeating enemies. Your weapons fire automatically, so you mostly just have to worry about picking up experience and items while avoiding baddies.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/4/23292852/vampire-survivors-cheats-secrets-menu-0-10-update-spells">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NTY0MTQ=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/5/22960148/vampire-survivors-game-pc-mac-italian-names-lore-head-canon">My big fat Italian vampire-slaying family</a></h2><div><p>I was floored as soon as I got to the main menu of <a rel="sponsored" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1794680%2FVampire_Survivors%2F"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>. I knew this hot indie darling sounded up my alley when I heard it described as a reverse-bullet hell blended with a roguelike, but I was not prepared for it to hit so close to home. While the main menu looks low-rent and the Castlevania-inspired aesthetics seems at first like a poor imitation, what stopped me in my tracks was the starting character. Antonio Belpaese: the first in a lineup of four Belpaese family members and a menagerie of other characters with incredibly Italian-sounding names. Even before playing a minute of the game, I was enthralled by my namesake taking the lead. As I struggled through the first few runs and slowly unlocked more characters, I felt like this game represented me and my big Italian-American immigrant family in a small way that elevated the whole experience like few games I have ever played.</p><p>When people talk about <em>Vampire Survivors,</em> it’s all about how much fun the mechanics of the game are and how it’s blown up on Steam for the cheap Early Access price of just $3. The gameplay is indeed exceptional. You try to survive an onslaught of increasing numbers of baddies using only auto-firing weapons, slowly improving your arsenal with pickups and passive power-ups. It’s a roguelite that gives that dopamine hit as the numbers go up and is completely devoid of a story, but it is rich in culture. Specifically, my family’s culture.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/5/22960148/vampire-survivors-game-pc-mac-italian-names-lore-head-canon">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NTY0Nzk=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/19/22941145/vampire-survivors-early-access-steam-pc-mac-luca-galante">Slaying monsters in Vampire Survivors is like walking through a casino</a></h2><div><p><em>Vampire Survivors</em> is an Early Access roguelike on Steam that has completely sunk its teeth into me.</p><p>Each round starts simply: you have just one weapon to take on a few baddies. The weapon autofires, so you only have to worry about moving your character to avoid enemies and scoop up experience gems. But as you level up, get more weapons, and fight more monsters, your screen quickly becomes filled with a smorgasbord of magical weapons and fearsome enemies covering nearly every inch of the screen.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/629678/zombies-run-marvel-move-six-to-start-layoffs-fitness-tech<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Six to Start, the company behind Zombies, Run! and Marvel Move, has laid off all but two of its staff, <em>The</em> <em>Verge</em> has learned. The news was delivered last week to staffers in a Zoom call, in which they were told that parent company <a href="https://www.olivex.ai/">OliveX</a> could no longer afford to keep Six to Start afloat and would shut down the company if they can’t find a buyer. Laid-off staffers were also served redundancy notices, which <em>The Verge</em> has confirmed.</p><p>The <a href="https://zrx.app/">ZRX: Zombies, Run!</a> app is an immersive fitness game that plops walkers and runners into audio-based storytelling. When enemies, be they the undead or Marvel villains, “chase” you, you’re encouraged to pick up speed. At the end of an episode, you can also collect items to trade for badges or in-game buildings. First founded in 2012, the app says it has about 10 million users worldwide.</p><p>Such immersive storytelling games, especially <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/18/23686893/marvel-move-six-to-start-running-fitness">Marvel Move</a>, are expensive to produce. They involve writing storylines, hiring voice actors to perform the material, and artists to create graphics. One source with knowledge on the matter noted that it’s unlikely the app will completely shut down for now, as there are plenty of loyal Zombies, Run! players and subscribers. Instead, it’s likely OliveX is trying to massively lower costs by slashing or completely pausing new content, relying on the hundreds of episodes still in the archive. OliveX is apparently actively looking for buyers, and there may already be interested parties, the source says.</p><p>OliveX first acquired Six to Start in 2021, but another source, speaking on condition of anonymity, claims Six to Start staffers clashed with both OliveX and its owner, Animoca Brands. The games’ anti-capitalist themes were at odds with the parent companies’ aims to create crypto and NFT projects. The source claims that working under OliveX was “agony.” To date, there have been no NFTs within any of Six to Start games.</p><p>It’s unclear what will happen for ZRX: Zombies, Run! subscribers in the short-term. While there is an extensive library of content, part of the draw was regular releases of new episodes. <em>The Verge</em> reached out to OliveX and Six to Start for comment, but did not immediately receive responses.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
