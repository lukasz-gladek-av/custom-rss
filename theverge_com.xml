In reality, it’s primarily a speaker that can connect to sources over Bluetooth, a USB cable, or an analog audio cable, <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Speakers-in-the-design-of-a-gaming-PC-Edifier-New-Cyber-displays-CPU-load-via-2-8-inch-display.1134125.0.html">as spotted by <em>Notebookcheck</em></a>. The <a href="https://www.edifier.com/cn/product/product-866.html">Huazai New Cyber speaker</a> is currently available in China 1,499 yuan, or around $210 in aurora white and phantom black color options. It’s unclear if the company plans a wider global release.</p><p>The Cyber speaker pairs a 4-inch subwoofer on the with three passive radiators to further boost lower frequencies and two 52mm mid-high range drivers. Those are all hidden on the lower half of the speaker behind a fabric screen, while the upper portion features electronics like amplifiers, a power supply, braided speaker cables, and a signal processor that are arranged and mounted to look like components you’ll find inside a gaming PC such as a graphics card and memory slots.</p><p>There are five circular RGB lighting elements with animated effects that make them appear to spin, mimicking the appearance of cooling fans, while a 2.8-inch screen can be used as a decorative element displaying images, screensavers, or custom messages. But it has some practical uses, too, such as showing performance metrics like CPU, RAM, and GPU usage while the speaker is connected to an actual computer with a USB cable, or song lyrics while streaming music from a smartphone.</p><p>The Cyber speaker’s footprint is comparable to bookshelf speakers which are often used as part of desktop PC setups. But to expand its usefulness while it’s gobbling up a sizable chunk of your desktop real estate, Edifier includes an additional USB-A and USB-C port you can use to charge other devices.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/798148/edifier-huazai-new-cyber-speaker-bluetooth-gaming-pc]]></content:encoded>
