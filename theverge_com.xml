Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One month into the year and Netflix is ready to detail its plans for 2025 — or at least, some of them. In a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/1/24056196/netflix-2024-tv-streaming-schedule-squid-game-arcane-3-body-problem">now-annual</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24057435/netflix-2024-movies-release-dates">tradition</a>, the streamer has outlined some of its biggest releases across film, television, and gaming.</p><p>And while plenty of the listed titles were already known, there are also some pleasant surprises. The movie lineup looks particularly strong, with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/24/24163962/knives-out-sequel-wake-up-dead-man-release-date-netflix">Wake Up Dead Man</a></em> — the next <em>Knives Out </em>mystery, following <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23349099/glass-onion-a-knives-out-mystery-review-netflix-tiff-2022">Glass Onion</a></em> — and Guillermo del Toro’s take on <em>Frankenstein</em> both due out later this year. Meanwhile, some of the streamer’s most important properties are coming to an end with the final seasons of both <em>Stranger Things</em> (which still doesn’t have a premiere date) and <em>Squid Game</em> (which now does).</p><p>And while <em>Stranger Things</em> is ending, its creators, the Duffer brothers, did detail two projects they will have coming to Netflix in 2026: <em>The Boroughs</em> and <em>Something Very Bad Is Going to Happen</em>. (They also hinted that there are some <em>Stranger Things</em> spinoffs in the works, without getting into detail.)</p><p>As for what to expect this year, here are the highlights:</p><div><p id="film"><h2>Film</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><em>The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep</em> — February 11th</span></li><li><span><em>Plankton: The Movie</em> — March 7th</span></li><li><span><em>The Electric State </em>— March 14th</span></li><li><span><em>The Old Guard 2</em> — July 2nd</span></li><li><span><em>Fear Street: Prom Queen</em> — summer</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span><em>Frankenstein</em> — November</span></li><li><span><em>Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery</em> — fall</span></li><li><span><em>RIP</em> — fall</span></li><li><span><em>Happy Gilmore 2</em> — 2025</span></li><li><span><em>K-Pop: Demon Hunters</em> — 2025</span></li></ul></div><div><p id="tv"><h2>TV</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><em>Cobra Kai</em> season 6 (part 3) — February 13th</span></li><li><span><em>Zero Day</em> — February 20th</span></li><li><span><em>Devil May Cry</em> — April 3rd</span></li><li><span><em>You</em> season 5 — April 24th</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span><em>Squid Game</em> season 3 — June 27th</span></li><li><span><em>Black Mirror</em> season 7 — 2025</span></li><li><span><em>Department Q</em> — 2025</span></li><li><span><em>The Sandman</em> season 2 — 2025</span></li><li><span><em>Stranger Things </em>season 5 — 2025</span></li><li><span><em>The Witcher</em> season 4 — 2025</span></li><li><span><em>Wayward</em> — 2025</span></li><li><span><em>Wednesday</em> season 2 — 2025</span></li></ul></div><div><p id="games"><h2>Games</h2></p></div><p>While the lineup of (announced) games coming to Netflix is fairly small, there are two notable highlights: a mobile version of <em>WWE 2K</em> this fall to go along with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337368/wwe-offers-a-nostalgic-look-back-at-its-past-before-raws-netflix-debut">the new deal between the two</a>, and more Netflix Stories games (Netflix’s branding for interactive fiction) based on series like <em>Ginny &amp; Georgia, Sweet Magnolias, Love Is Blind, </em>and<em> Outer Banks</em>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
