Dell, for instance, <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/microsoft-corporation-xbox-series-x-1tb-white/apd/ad180049/gaming-gaming-accessories/" rel="sponsored">is still offering</a> the digital-only<strong> Xbox Series X (1TB)</strong> for $449.99, saving you $100 on the new MSRP. The smaller, 512GB <strong>Xbox Series S</strong> is also available at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-S-512GB-SSD-All-Digital-Gaming-Console-Robot-White%2F11213159055%2F" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a> for just $273.99 ($106 off), while the 1TB model is going for $347 ($83 off) at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Xbox-Series-S-1TB-White%2F9606813888" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>.</p><p>In case you need a refresher, the Series X is more powerful and capable than the smaller Xbox Series S. The Series X offers support for native 4K resolution, for example, while the smaller Series S is primarily designed for 1440p gaming. Microsoft’s higher-end console also offers 1TB of storage, double the base Series S, along with faster performance thanks to an expanded 12 teraflops of GPU performance.</p><div><p>Both the disc-less Xbox Series X and Series S lack an optical drive, meaning they’re limited to playing digital titles. That being said, they can play all of the same titles, including those offered through Xbox Game Pass — including newer RPGs like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/656405/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-xbox-ps5-pc">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a></em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/654770/oblivion-remaster-hands-on-xbox-gamepass-bethesda"><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></a>, along with former exclusives such as <em><a href="http://Indiana Jones and the Great Circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a></em>.</p></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->274</span></p><div><p>The Xbox Series S is smaller than the 4K-capable Xbox Series X, but it can still play the same digital games — albeit topping out at 2560 x 1440 QHD resolution.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->450</span></p><div><p>The Xbox Series X is Microsoft’s flagship console, serving as its most powerful (and biggest) option focused on fast, 4K gameplay.
