            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/611627/sony-playstation-5-ps5-saros-housemarquestudio-housemarque<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Housemarque, the PlayStation-owned studio that made the excellent sci-fi roguelike <em>Returnal</em>, has just announced its next game: <em>Saros</em>. The game will launch on PS5 in 2026.</p><div><p>Here’s a brief description of the game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK4W-hBrSZs">from its reveal trailer</a>:</p></div><div><blockquote><p>Set on the planet Carcosa under the threat of an ominous eclipse, take on the role of Arjun Devraj, a powerful Soltari Enforcer searching for answers on a lost off-world colony.</p><p>SAROS features permanent progression systems, where every death reshapes the world while offering new upgrades to overcome challenges. With a haunting story, deep third-person action, and a grounded performance by Rahul Kohli, SAROS presents the next evolution in Housemarque’s gameplay-first experience.</p></blockquote></div><p>In a blog post, Housemarque’s Gregory Louden provided <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/announcing-saros-the-next-game-from-housemarque-coming-2026/">a tad more detail</a>:</p><div><blockquote><p>A key gameplay distinction between Saros and Returnal is permanent resources and progression making every death valuable. After every death you will face a changed world, but in Saros you will be able to choose and permanently upgrade your loadout from an evolving set of weapons and suit upgrades to “come back stronger” to overcome the challenges you face on Carcosa.</p></blockquote></div><p>I’m personally very much looking forward <em>Saros</em>; <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio">Returnal</a></em> is one of my favorite games ever, and I look forward to seeing what Housemarque brings to its next title.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
