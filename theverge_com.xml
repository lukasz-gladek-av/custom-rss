            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The arrival of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">the Nintendo Switch 2</a> heralds some much-needed improvements over its predecessor, especially its Joy-Con controllers. Here’s a quick breakdown of what the announcement trailer showed us about the Switch 2’s Joy-Cons.</p><p>Before the official reveal of the console, there were rumors alluding to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld">how the new Joy-Cons would work and their internal mechanisms</a>. The most significant rumor was that they were held to the console via magnets, and in the reveal video, that appears to be the case. The video features the Joy-Con seemingly snapping to a cover as though attracted by a magnetic force.</p><div><figcaption>The new Joy-Cons snap to everything as though powered by magnets.</figcaption> <p><cite>Gif: Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>The video shows that the Joy-Cons have a protrusion that fits into an oval depression in the main body of the console, plugging into ports (with that iconic Nintendo Switch “snap” sound) instead of sliding down rails. There’s also a button at the top of each controller that is ostensibly how the Joy-Cons detach from the main console, but the reveal video didn’t show that in action. According to some of the Switch 2 rumors reported on by <em>The Verge</em>, pressing that button actuates a pin that will push the Joy-Cons away from the console, and in the video, you can see on the inside track of each controller a small circle at the top that looks like it pushes out.</p><div><figcaption>You can see a tiny protrusion at the top of the Joy-Con that is likely what detaches the controller from the console.</figcaption> <p><cite>Gif: Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>The Joy-Cons, like the Switch 2 itself, are larger. In the version of the console shown in the announcement video, they’re black with accents in the traditional red and blue colors from the original Switch. Other elements from the previous Joy-Cons are still there, like the indicator lights and the SL / SP buttons that are visible when the Joy-Cons are being used individually. The left Joy-Con still has its square screenshot button and the right one has the home button, but directly below that is a new button whose function is still unconfirmed.</p><p>The biggest problem plaguing the original Switch Joy-Cons was a condition known as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained">Joy-Con drift</a>. Users reported that their analog sticks would display movement without input from the player, kind of like a cursor moving on a computer screen without moving the mouse. Nintendo didn’t share any information about the internal mechanisms powering the Joy-Cons, so we don’t know how susceptible they will be to this problem.</p><div><p>We’ll know more about the Joy-Cons, along with the console and its upcoming library of games, when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24236766/nintendo-switch-2-games-direct-date-time">Nintendo holds its Switch 2 Direct on April 2nd</a>. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
