During its direct showcase, the company revealed more information on the sequel to <em>The Super Mario Bros Movie</em> — <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> including a brand new trailer.</p><p>The teaser trailer was just that, a taste of what’s to come. It features Mario resting under a tree in the Mushroom Kingdom while a butterfly zooms up to space as the theme to <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> begins to play.</p><p>We had some inkling Nintendo would go in the galaxy direction for its sequel. The first movie, which grossed over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/1/23695720/nintendo-mario-movie-billion-box-office">a billion dollars</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/14/24072786/jack-black-voice-peaches-peaches-peaches-peaches-peaches">spawned memes</a>, and earned a Golden Globe nomination, hinted at a wider world beyond the Mushroom Kingdom. There’s also the fact that eagle-eyed internet sleuths found domains registered to NBC Universal, Nintendo’s movie production partner, that contained the name of the film. (An <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/666569/super-mario-world-movie-sequel-nintendo-universal">earlier leak</a> also suggested the movie was titled “<em>Super Mario World</em>”.)</p><p>According to Nintendo executive Shigeru Miyamoto, <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> will be the centerpiece of Mario’s 40th anniversary celebration. Due out in April, Chris Pratt, Charlie Day, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Jack Black will reprise their roles as Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, and Bowser.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777071/super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-nintendo-direct-september-2025#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/777071/super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-nintendo-direct-september-2025]]></content:encoded>
