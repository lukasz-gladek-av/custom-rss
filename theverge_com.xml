            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642093/nintendo-switch-smartphone-app-zelda-notes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>While sharing screenshots and videos from the original Nintendo Switch has always been an excessively complicated process, it’s going to be much easier for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">the Switch 2</a>.</p><p>During <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream">today’s Direct presentation</a>, Nintendo spent a lot of time talking about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">the Switch 2’s new built-in GameChat functionality</a> that will give players a way to share their screens during group video calls. But the company also announced that it’s rolling out an update for the Switch family of systems’ companion smartphone app. </p><p>Now simply called the “Nintendo Switch app,” the application will continue to support Nintendo’s old voice chat feature for specific titles like <em>Splatoon 3 </em>and <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>on the original Switch. But for Switch 2 owners, the Nintendo Switch app will serve as the easiest way for you to move screenshots and videos from the console onto your phone, computer, or internet.</p><p>To move screenshots previously, you had to pop a Switch’s SD card out from behind its kickstand and slot it into another device. You could also share images and videos directly to Facebook and, <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/65057/~/discontinuation-of-x-%28formerly-twitter%29-integration-and-social-media">until last year</a>, X / Twitter by linking your Switch to accounts on either of those platforms. It was also possible to move media straight from your Switch to your smartphone by going into the Switch’s Album section, hitting share, and then taking a picture of the QR code generated by the console. That last option was as clever as it was cumbersome, but it won’t be an issue for the Switch 2. </p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fwhats-new-with-nintendo-switch-online-on-nintendo-switch-2%2F" rel="sponsored">According to Nintendo</a>, Switch 2 users will be able to access the console’s 100 most recent screenshots and videos directly from the smartphone app. Obviously, a Nintendo Account will be required to make this work, but the company noted that you will <em>not </em>need a Nintendo Switch Online membership to take advantage of the smartphone app’s media transfer feature.</p><p>The media transfer details alone are already a significant upgrade for the application, which never felt all that well-integrated into many of Nintendo’s games. But, as if to emphasize that it really does see the application as an important part of the Switch’s future, Nintendo also announced the forthcoming release of <em>Zelda Notes</em>, a special set of features designed specifically for the Switch 2 editions of <em>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears for the Kingdom</em>. Located within the smartphone app, <em>Zelda Notes </em>is meant to serve as a useful tool to help guide you through the <em>Zelda </em>games with features like spoken directions to specific locations you’ve marked on a map. You can use <em>Zelda Notes </em>to hear Princess Zelda recall memories of places she’s been as you guide Link to them. The application will also give players a way to share blueprints for their unique Autobuild creations.</p><p><em>Zelda Notes </em>feels like a very smart way to get people excited about coming back to two older games many people have already spent quite a bit of time playing. It’s kind of wild to think of Nintendo’s smartphone app being one of its more promising Switch reveals, but these kinds of surprises are how you keep things interesting.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/642143/nintendo-switch-2-games-price-expensive<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>At least two of Nintendo’s Switch 2 games are going to be more expensive than most games on the first Switch. Many Switch games cost $59.99, but Nintendo revealed today the Switch 2’s <em>Mario Kart World</em>, a June 5th launch title, will cost $79.99, while <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, releasing a little over a month later, will cost $69.99.</p><p>These aren’t Nintendo’s first titles to exceed a $59.99 price. That honor goes to <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591275/nintendo-70-dollar-game-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">launched at $69.99</a>. When that price was announced, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2023/02/08/update-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-costs-70">told <em>Game Informer</em></a> that “we determine the suggested retail price for any Nintendo product on a case-by-case basis.”</p><p>Nintendo is taking some of the sting off <em>Mario Kart World’s</em> higher price if you get it as part of a special $499.99 Switch 2 bundle. (On its own, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">the Switch 2 costs $449.99</a>.) But it appears that Nintendo’s next-generation console could have games that are generally more expensive than before.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/642049/nintendo-switch-2-verge-staff-reacts<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo has finally aired its big Switch 2 Direct, and now we know a whole lot about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/630264/nintendo-switch-2-specs-details-performance">its next console</a>. <em>The Verge</em> staff has a lot of feelings about the device, which will launch on June 5th, and we’ve collected our first impressions below.</p><div><p id="a-soulless-design"><h2><strong>A soulless design</strong></h2></p></div><p>Look, I love black. My entire wardrobe is almost exclusively black. But the Switch 2’s mostly-black design looks off to me. The original Switch may have launched with a gray Joy-Con option, but the neon red and blue controllers that also launched on day one became iconic. Now, the Switch 2 has just splashes of colors, and they’re mostly hidden.</p><p>I imagine Nintendo will inevitably release full-color Joy-Con 2 controllers in the future, but I think the Switch 2 out of the gate could have looked much more fun.</p><p><em>-Antonio Di Benedetto, laptop reviewer</em></p><div><p id="a-meaningful-screen-upgrade"><h2><strong>A meaningful screen upgrade</strong></h2></p></div><p>No, it’s not an OLED. And yes, Nintendo will almost certainly repeat its strategy of launching a Switch 2 with that display technology down the line. But even right now, there’s a lot to like about the Switch 2’s new 1080p screen.</p><p>Its much larger 7.9-inch size is a blessing for the eyesight of a generation that grew up with Nintendo consoles — myself included. And I was pleasantly surprised that the company went with a 120Hz panel that supports variable refresh rate (VRR) and wider HDR color.</p><p>It won’t deliver the inky blacks of OLED, but as long as Nintendo’s quality assurance is up to snuff, the LCD won’t dissuade me from buying a Switch 2 on day one.</p><p><em>-Chris Welch, senior reviewer</em></p><div><p id="the-joy-con-seem-like-a-big-improvement"><h2><strong>The Joy-Con seem like a big improvement</strong></h2></p></div><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642024/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controllers-mouse-magnetic-attach-c-button">new Joy-Con</a> are bigger, look more comfortable, do indeed attach via magnets, and can even be used like a mouse. Now, the real question is: will the sticks drift?</p><p><em>-Jay Peters, news editor</em></p><div><p id="social-features-no-thanks"><h2><strong>Social features? No thanks</strong></h2></p></div><p>Just imagine: the joy of Zoom meetings, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">now integrated into your gameplay</a>. Voice chat and video streaming are the worst parts about gaming to me. I will not be using these features to scare my friends away by yelling at them.</p><p>-<em>Marina Galperina, senior tech editor</em></p><div><p id="the-new-gamecube-controller-is-one-flaw-from-perfection"><h2><strong>The new GameCube controller is one flaw from perfection</strong></h2></p></div><p>I play a lot of my Switch games with a licensed PowerA replica GameCube controller. While it unfortunately uses AA batteries, it includes an additional ZL button that lets me play most of my Switch games. While Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641482/nintendo-is-releasing-a-gamecube-controller">official wireless GameCube controller</a> for the Switch 2 brings rechargeable batteries, Nintendo opted to give it a little nub of a ZL button instead of a full button. Hardly the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637833/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-details">Pro Controller</a> replacement or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/9/23546851/nyxi-wizard-nintendo-switch-driftless-gamecube-controller-hall-effect#:~:text=for%20the%20Gamecube.-,I%20love%20the%20WaveBird,-(as%20do%20our">WaveBird</a> successor I was hoping for.</p><p><em>-Umar Shakir, news writer</em></p><div><p id="a-higher-than-expected-price"><h2><strong>A higher-than-expected price</strong></h2></p></div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">$449.99</a> is higher than I was expecting for the Switch 2. I was hoping for $399. But still I’ll be doing everything I can to snag the $499.99 bundle with <em>Mario Kart World</em>, a game that costs an eye-watering $79.99 on its own. </p><p>Let’s just hope pre-orders, which start on April 9th, go ok. (I’m expecting disaster.)</p><p><em>-Jay Peters</em></p><div><p id="donkey-kong-bananza-looks-great"><h2><strong>Donkey Kong Bananza looks great</strong></h2></p></div><p>I’m sure I’ll play plenty of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer">Mario Kart World</a></em>, but I’m an antisocial sort at heart, so I spent most of this Direct waiting for Nintendo’s first-party, single-player killer app. I never would have bet on <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641537/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> </em>leading the charge. </p><p>He may be as old as Mario, but this is only Donkey Kong’s second-<em>ever</em> 3D platformer, his first since 1999’s <em>Donkey Kong 64</em>, and his first solo game since <em>Tropical Freeze</em> in 2014. He’s an unlikely candidate for a system seller. Then again, that’s probably what <em>Mario Kart </em>is for.</p><p><em>-Dominic Preston, news editor</em></p><div><p id="charging-for-a-tutorial"><h2><strong>Charging for a tutorial?</strong></h2></p></div><p>The age of new consoles being bundled with a free game is behind us, but it’s confusing why Nintendo is charging for the <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> app. Although it does appear to include a small selection of mini-games, the app seems to be more of a highly-polished interactive tutorial than a game.</p><p><em>Wii Sports</em> not only helped make that console a huge hit for Nintendo, it also cleverly introduced gamers to the Wiimote and Nunchuck’s unique capabilities and motion-controlled gaming. The <em>Welcome Tour</em> app feels like a similar idea, but with much less replay value.</p><p><em>-Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter</em></p><div><p id="no-super-smash-bros"><h2><strong>No <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> </strong></h2></p></div><p>Throughout the Switch 2 Direct, I was waiting for the iconic <em>Super Smash Bros. </em>logo to flash across my screen. And I nearly jumped out of my seat <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641602/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-masahiro-sakurai">during the <em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a> trailer, which looked almost like an intro for a new <em>SSB </em>game.</p><p>It wasn’t, unfortunately, though <em>SSB</em> creator Masahiro Sakurai, who also directed the original <em>Air Ride</em>, is directing <em>Riders</em>. Here’s hoping he’ll be up for another <em>SSB</em>.</p><p><em>-Emma Roth, news writer</em></p><div><p id="gamecube-games-on-nintendo-switch-online"><h2><strong>GameCube games on Nintendo Switch Online</strong></h2></p></div><p>It’s been more than two decades since Nintendo released <em>F-Zero GX, </em>my favorite anti-gravity racer of all time, and Switch 2 Direct revealed that it and several other GameCube games are <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fwhats-new-with-nintendo-switch-online-on-nintendo-switch-2%2F" rel="sponsored">coming to the new console</a> as a Nintendo Switch Online feature. In addition to <em>GX</em>, I can’t wait to finally play bangers from Nintendo’s most adorable console in higher resolution without the need to screw around with the pain of emulators.</p><p><em>-Wes Davis, weekend editor</em></p><div><p id="virtual-cartridges-look-useful"><h2><strong>Virtual cartridges </strong>look useful</h2></p></div><p>After my decision to stick with digital game downloads for the original Nintendo Switch led to frustrations with playing those games on the Switch OLED, I was planning a return to physical cartridges for the Switch 2.</p><p>But Nintendo’s reveal of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637307/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-card-lending-system">new virtual game cards</a> last week has changed my mind. Being able to more easily move games between several versions of the Switch without the consoles needing a constant internet connection is exactly the upgrade Nintendo needed to introduce to streamline digital game management with the Switch 2 enroute.</p><p><em>-Andrew Liszewski</em></p><div><p id="promising-updates-for-old-games"><h2><strong>Promising updates for old games</strong></h2></p></div><p>Nintendo squeezed in some promising info about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641578/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatibility-games-faq">Switch 2 updates for older titles</a> during today’s Direct. The selection of games getting updates — which includes <em>Arms</em>, <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, and <em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em> — is relatively small, and it sounds like Nintendo is taking steps to make them compatible with the Switch 2’s new GameChat feature. But Nintendo also said that the updates “may improve performance,” which feels <em>very </em>significant for certain titles on the list like <em>Pokémon Scarlet </em>/ <em>Violet </em>and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>.</p><p>-<em>Charles Pulliam-Moore, film and TV reporter</em> </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
