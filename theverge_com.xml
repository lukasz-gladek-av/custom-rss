            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313974/nzxt-flex-pc-rental-response<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>After <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pomC1CfpC0">a long video published over the weekend by Gamers Nexus</a> called NZXT’s Flex PC rental program <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/1/24310181/nzxt-pc-rental-program-gamers-nexus-investigation">“a scam,”</a> the company responded Tuesday with a statement titled <a href="https://nzxt.com/news/nzxt-update-addressing-your-concerns-about-the-flex-subscription-program">“Addressing Your Concerns About the Flex Subscription Program.”</a> “I want to acknowledge that we messed up,” said NZXT CEO Johnny Hou <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSp5B--HKL4">in a video</a>, promising changes like making the names of PCs available for rent or purchase easier to tell apart.</p></div><p>However, what it said has not satisfied Gamers Nexus, which <a href="https://x.com/GamersNexus/status/1864657751986626988?">posted its own response</a>, saying NZXT’s statement “not only misrepresents facts, but distorts the reality of their predatory rental computer program. The statement ignores major points and introduces several new concerns.” The post says GN is working on a new investigation into the program that “will take weeks or months to finalize.”</p><p>The two main actions NZXT says it’s taking are on the PC names, like switching the name of its “Player: One” rental PC to “Flex: One Subscription PC,” and influencer campaigns “where the statements did not accurately reflect the details of our NZXT Flex program.” NZXT says it has pulled all of its “influencer-led” advertising while it updates the language and process.</p><p>NZXT says it is adjusting the language in its subscriber agreement as well and will make it clear that the company doesn’t sell user data on customers’ returned PCs. “Every Flex PC that comes back is fully wiped,” Hou said.&nbsp;</p><p>Hou also addressed the rental PC specs that Gamers Nexus said fluctuated “day-to-day,” noting that the Flex program “doesn’t give you fixed specs” due to the changing availability of components. “Sometimes we don’t have more supply coming in, so in the midst of that we actually have to change the specs of our PCs.”</p><p>However, this still doesn’t explain why NZXT displayed the same estimated frames per second across builds with different components.<em> The Verge</em> has contacted NZXT about the program, but the company has not responded.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314026/ea-electronic-arts-expands-accessibility-pledge-tech-patents<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Electronic Arts is expanding its accessibility program with 23 additional tech patents that other companies and developers can freely use without being slapped with an infringement lawsuit. The expansion more than doubles the total number of patents that EA has opened up since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22638535/ea-accessibility-patent-pledge-apex-legends-ping-system">launching the pledge in 2021</a>, and includes generation and recognition tools for speech and audio.</p><p>“We believe that games should be accessible to everyone and our industry-leading teams are always looking for new ways to make this a reality,” Kerry Hopkins, SVP of Global Affairs at EA, said in a press release. “By making this technology available to others, we continue to work to enhance accessibility and inclusivity for players around the world by removing unintended barriers to access.”</p><p>Some examples of open tech patents include systems that can improve speech recognition, generate expressive speech audio from text data, and generate speech that mimics a player’s voice based on minimal sample speech data. One system uses machine learning to make a player’s voice sound older, while another “infers a player’s emotion while playing a video game” and automatically adjusts the game’s background music to best suit their emotional state.</p><p>EA says these patents could be used to improve gaming experiences for players with speech disorders or who struggle with verbally expressing themselves, helping them to communicate in a way that better represents their age, emotion, language, and speaking style. Alongside this announcement, EA is also releasing a <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/IRIS-Unreal-Plugin/">Unreal Engine 5 plugin that enables in-engine use of IRIS</a> — EA’s photosensitivity analysis tech — to help game developers identify frames that could impact photosensitive players.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
