            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/apps/673208/discord-ai-forums-anniversary-gamechat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Discord has become <em>the</em> place for gaming communities on the internet. The company just celebrated its <a href="https://discord.com/blog/thank-you-for-ten-years">10th anniversary</a>, and its impact is now big enough that it’s available directly on PlayStation and Xbox and was ripped off by Nintendo for the Switch 2’s GameChat.</p><p>But as it tries to grow, one of the big challenges Discord faces is that, for big or longer-running communities, it can be hard to know where to start, hard to catch up to the speed of real-time conversations, and hard to sift through the potentially huge amounts of conversations and channels. A lot of communities used to form around forums, but Discord just isn’t a good replacement for that kind of structured messaging, as covered <a href="https://aftermath.site/discord-forums-move-champions-neverwinter-star-trek-support-faq">by <em>Aftermath</em>’s Luke Plunkett</a>.</p><p>“This is something we want to solve,” Peter Sellis, Discord’s SVP of product, tells <em>The Verge</em>. “It is not our intention to lock a bunch of this knowledge into Discord.”</p><p>One way Discord wants to tackle the problem is add features that are “more amicable to structured knowledge sharing, like forums, that we could probably do a better job of investing in and is something we want to do for game developers,” Sellis says.</p><p>Another involves LLMs. “There’s an incredible opportunity now with large language models and their ability to summarize conversations,” he says. That could help Discord take a long conversation between multiple people — “what is essentially a really poorly structured shareable object,” he says — and boil it down to “something that could be more shareable and then potentially syndicated to the web.”</p><p>Sellis couldn’t share many other details, and couldn’t give a timeline for when any of this might be ready: “I haven’t seen a solution that we feel great about yet.”</p><p>Discord wants to do it right, he says — especially because a solution that makes information more easily accessible outside of Discord could involve a lot of work for server moderators and admins. “We have a very sensitive radar for stuff that causes them a bunch of work that doesn’t give them the return they need,” he says. (It’s wise <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/1/23781306/reddit-moderators-iama-celebrity-ama">not to piss off your moderators</a>.)</p><p>None of this was imminent, if it even happens at all. That said, “I assure you that this is something that people within Discord feel the pain of themselves,” Sellis says. “And when our engineers and product designers and product managers feel it personally, they generally want to solve it.” </p><p>Another big challenge Discord faces is how to build the product to serve both the needs of giant community servers and the tiny servers where groups hang out — especially when, according to Discord, 90 percent of “all activity on Discord” happens in “small, intimate servers.”</p><p>Sellis calls it “one of the biggest challenges for the team” — but also says that it’s “honestly the biggest opportunity.” He says that Discord thinks about how it can make people “feel comfortable in both these spaces, understand that there are different types of spaces, and the technology is familiar, but still different in both of these places.”</p><p>Sellis says that the biggest Discord server is Midjourney, a key company in text-to-AI image generation that lets you generate visuals right inside Discord. Midjourney became popular because it turned the “single-player game” of generating AI images into a multiplayer community. “You can just watch people try things, experiment, fail, succeed, embarrass themselves, etc. And that made it kind of like a collective action.”</p><p>He says Discord is seeing something similar with the recently launched <a href="https://support-apps.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/31598005086359-Wordle-FAQ#h_01JV3DTV60EKV39E0Y1ZAXERGX"><em>Wordle</em> app</a> on the platform, too, which lets you compete with your friends. </p><p>That all speaks to some of Discord’s larger vision. Sellis is seeing a trend that “everything is starting to kind of look like a game” and “Discord can be used as a social layer on any game to essentially improve its engagement, its socialness, and its multiplayer capacity. That’s something we like and are going to lean into.”</p><p>And as for Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">GameChat</a>? “I would say imitation is a very sincere form of flattery,” Sellis says. “Hard to imagine being more flattered than being copied by Nintendo.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

On Thursday, <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-live-action-film-adaptation-announced">Bandai Namco and A24 announced</a> a live-action <em>Elden Ring </em>film directed by Alex Garland.</p><p>Japanese developer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc">FromSoftware released <em>Elden Ring</em></a> across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC in 2022, while a version for the Nintendo Switch 2 is set to be released this year. The action RPG became an instant hit, and puts you in the role of a Tarnished tasked with restoring the Elden Ring by defeating various challenging bosses throughout the Lands Between. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/610585/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview"><em>Elden Ring </em>spinoff <em>Nightreign</em></a> is coming out on May 30th, 2025.</p><p>Garland is a writer, director, and producer best known for films like <em>Ex Machina</em>, <em>28 Days Later</em>, and <em>Dredd</em>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/16/22981060/fromsoftware-elden-ring-franchise-intellectual-properties-future-expansion">FromSoftware first hinted</a> at the potential to expand <em>Elden Ring</em> “beyond the realm of games” in 2022. Last year, George R.R. Martin — the <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> creator <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/george-r-r-martin-reveals-there-is-some-talk-about-making-a-movie-out-of-elden-ring-but-theres-one-big-obvious-thing-that-could-limit-his-involvement-with-it-ign-fan-fest-2025">who helped write the game</a> — also said, “There is some talk about making a movie out of <em>Elden Ring</em>.” A publication called Nexus Point News first reported on the adaptation with A24 earlier this month, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/662200/elden-ring-movie-nexus-point-news-be-careful">but pulled its original article</a> and didn’t explain why.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
