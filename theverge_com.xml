He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Following a court order that blocks Apple from taking a commission on purchases made outside the App Store, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1917716512347152499">says on X</a> that the company plans to bring <em>Fortnite</em> back to iOS in the US “next week.”</p><p>The app hasn’t been available on iOS in the US since August 2020, when Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments">kicked it off the App Store</a> for implementing Epic’s own in-app payment system in violation of Apple’s rules. Since then, Apple and Epic have been embroiled in an ongoing legal battle, including a ruling <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown">more in Apple’s favor in 2021</a> and today’s ruling that is a major victory for Epic.</p><p><em>Fortnite</em> has returned to iOS in the EU, but only via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store">Epic’s own mobile app store</a>, which isn’t available in the US.</p><p>Sweeney also offered a “peace proposal” from Epic to Apple in his post on X. “If Apple extends the court’s friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we’ll return <em>Fortnite</em> to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic.”</p><p>Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
