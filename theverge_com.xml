The title, which launched in October 2025, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/798848/pokemon-legends-za-review-nintendo-switch-2">feels like a return to form</a>, according to our reviewer Charles Pulliam-Moore, and continues to push the series out of its iterative rut. At this price, the game is cheaper than the original Switch version (but pro tip: the Switch 2 cartridge will work in the original Switch, too, and will let you play the full game as if it were a regular Switch cart).</p><p>For those who haven’t jumped into a Pokémon game in a while, <em>Legends: Z-A</em> follows the formula that <em>Arceus</em> introduced. Rather than strictly operating as a turn-based RPG, the player can engage in real-time battles against Pokémon — even catching them sneakily without engaging in a fight is possible. Personally, games like <em>Pokémon Sword / Shield </em>burned me out on the idea of playing another, as it felt similar to playing previous titles, but with better graphics and a larger world. But shaking up how you engage with the core mechanics sounds like a good time.</p><div><p id="other-verge-approved-deals"><h2>Other Verge-approved deals</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>If you need an affordable-but-good MagSafe charging puck to recharge your iPhone while you’re in bed or working, <strong>Anker’s MagGo Qi2 puck with 15W charging</strong> is $14.99 at <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMH2JVMM/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> in black or white. Sure, there are chargers out there that can go up to 25W (a speed that’s available only for iPhone 16 and 17 models), but that will significantly boost the price. Keep in mind that this puck doesn’t include a power adapter, so you’ll need to provide your own, or you can plug it directly into your laptop.</span></li><li><span>Some may choose to go for a modest TV upgrade in time for the Super Bowl. If you’re someone who likes to live más, perhaps the TV for you is <strong>TCL’s massive 98-inch QM6K QD-mini-LED 4K TV with Google TV software</strong> built-in. This model originally sold for $2,299.99, but you can grab it for $1,698.98 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DSR9N3M2/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> (or a dollar more at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Ftcl-98-class-qm6k-series-4k-uhd-hdr-qd-mini-led-smart-tv-with-google-tv-2025%2FJ36QYTQ5JG%2Fsku%2F6617499" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>) now, and be assured: it will arrive in time for the Super Bowl on February 8th. The QM6K supports up to 144Hz refresh rate, meaning it’s great for console and PC gaming. One thing to note, however, is that it has a matte anti-reflective screen. However, the matte high vertical alignment (HVA) panel still boasts a very high contrast ratio.</span></li><li><span>It might be a while until we see deals on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/867757/apple-airtag-new-uwb-bluetooth-range-speaker">new <strong>second-gen Apple AirTags</strong></a> that are as good as what we’ve seen on the previous model. For reference, you’ve been able to get a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Luggage-Backpack-one-tap-Bluetooth/dp/B0D54JZTHY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">four-pack of AirTags for around $70</a>, or slightly less. The improved model with better tracking and accuracy, plus a louder speaker, is $99.99 for a four-pack at every retailer — except <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.costco.com/p/-/apple-airtag-2nd-generation-4-pack-includes-additional-airtag-1-pack-2nd-generation/4000277035" rel="sponsored">Costco</a>. There’s a members-only deal that includes a fifth second-gen AirTag with the purchase of the $100 kit.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/870030/pokemon-legends-za-switch-2-apple-airtags-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
