            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo has brought two of the very best <em>Super Mario</em> games to the Switch and Switch 2. It’s no surprise that <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> and its sequel are excellent; these are critically acclaimed games, and two of the best-selling titles for the Wii, Nintendo’s top-selling console prior to the Switch era. So it’s great to have a pair of the most inventive platformers ever made easily accessible in 2025. At the same time, these releases are disappointing in just how simple they are. Nintendo has an enviable amount of history and talent, and re-releases like this would be the ideal place to share that with the world. Alas, we get straightforward ports instead.</p><p>The <em>Galaxy</em> games, which originally debuted in 2007 and 2010, represent a sort of evolutionary offshoot of the 3D <em>Mario</em> platforming line. The sci-fi premise — which, among other things, introduced Rosalina to the world — involves Mario traveling to small planets, many of which are bite-sized spheres that fit on a single screen. The goal, as always, is to collect shiny stars to open up more levels to explore. But what makes <em>Galaxy</em> and its sequel unique is how tightly-focused every level is. Each usually has a single idea that it explores <em>just</em> long enough before moving on to the next thing.</p><p>That design-first focus means that these games have aged remarkably well. It feels weird at first to not have complete control over the camera, but I adjusted pretty quickly, helped along by the fact that the levels are almost all small and designed around those camera limitations. Like the best <em>Super Mario</em> games, these are an explosion of ideas; one second you’re fighting against gravity while side-scrolling inside of a giant pill, the next you’re using Yoshi’s tongue to flip across perilous gaps. Given the way the <em>Super Mario</em> series has evolved, going in very different directions with releases like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch">the more open-ended <em>Odyssey</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch">the silly side-scrolling of <em>Wonder</em></a><em>,</em> there remains nothing like <em>Galaxy</em> and its sequel.</p><p>I also love that playing with detached Joy-Con controllers is a pretty solid approximation of using an old Wii remote and nunchuk, a control scheme the original games were built around. (You’ll be doing a lot of pointing at the screen here.) Both <em>Galaxy</em> and its sequel also still look great; the mix of classic, cartoony Mario style and glittery sci-fi locales work really well together.</p><p>Which is probably why Nintendo hasn’t done much for these ports — they don’t need a lot of work to begin with. The resolution is a little better, there are touchscreen controls for when you’re playing in portable mode, the storybook elements have been expanded somewhat, and there’s a very welcome new “assist” mode that makes things a little easier. Even still, considering these releases cost $40 each (or $70 as a physical bundle) the lack of frills is disappointing.</p><p>This is pretty much par for the course for Nintendo. The most recent re-release of the first <em>Galaxy</em> came in the form of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438499/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em></a>, a similarly barebones collection on the original Switch that was inexplicably only available for a limited time. So I’m conflicted here. Yes, this is a chance for a whole new audience to play two incredible games. But would it have killed Nintendo to show these games just a little more love? To treat them like more than promotional fodder for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777071/super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-nintendo-direct-september-2025">the next <em>Super Mario</em> movie</a>?</p><p>Maybe I’m spoiled by the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23848883/karateka-making-of-digital-eclipse-game-preservation">Digital Eclipse</a> and the Criterion Collection, but it’s clear that Nintendo — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256070/nintendo-museum-kyoto-tour-shigeru-miyamoto">a company that has its own museum, for crying out loud</a> — could do a lot more to celebrate its most innovative and successful games. It’s a company with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/31/16577860/super-mario-odyssey-travel-interview-kenta-motokura">creative</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24112724/super-mario-bros-wonder-interview-nintendo-switch">talent</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interview/678097/mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2-interview-kosuke-yabuki">that</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/11/14881076/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-interview">sticks</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23604504/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-super-nintendo-world">around</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/18759918/super-mario-maker-2-nintendo-switch-takashi-tezuka-interview">for decades</a>, each of whom is full of insights into how these games get made. With all of the inventiveness on display in <em>Galaxy</em>, it’s prime material for such a celebration.</p><p>It doesn’t seem like that will happen any time soon, though. So in the meantime I’ll just repeat the obvious: <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> still rules.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/790186/super-mario-galaxy-nintendo-switch-2]]></content:encoded>
