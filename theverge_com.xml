            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/612024/until-dawn-trailer-limited-lives<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/charles-pulliam-moore">Charles Pulliam-Moore</a> <span>is a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><br>The first teaser for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/14/24343454/sonys-until-dawn-movie-wants-to-channel-games-dust-yourself-off-and-try-again-energy">Sony and Screen Gems’ big screen <em>Until Dawn</em> adaptation</a> made it seem like it might just be another supernatural horror with a splash of <em>Groundhog Day </em>tossed in to keep things mildly interesting. But judging from the way the studios are describing the film, it sounds like this <em>Until Dawn </em>will also feature another important element from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/24/9187447/until-dawn-review-playstation-4">its video game counterpart</a>.</p><p>Though old man Hill (Peter Stomare) still won’t tell Clover (Ella Rubin) and her friends just what kind of danger they’re wandering into in <em>Until Dawn</em>’s new trailer, the meddling youths have a much easier time figuring out the basics of what’s going on. Somehow, the strange building they’re staying in is able to hurdle them back through time after they’re murdered by different kinds of monsters, and the phenomenon gives them another chance to survive through the night.</p><p>That much was obvious in <em>Until Dawn</em>’s first teaser, and the new trailer shows off a few more of the ghouls Clover’s group will encounter. Something that was less apparent, though, was how the movie will limit the number of extra lives each character will have. According to Sony and Screen Gems’ new synopsis for the film, the fact that group only gets a handful do-vers is one of the more terrifying things about their situation. That makes it sound like a couple of characters might run out before they’re able to escape, which could make <em>Until Dawn </em> feel even more like the game when it hits theaters on April 25th.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Both technologies will improve the image quality of <em>Indiana Jones</em>, and Multi Frame Generation will also enable smoother frame rates in the process.</p><p>Nvidia has released a new Game Ready driver today (572.42) that includes support for the <em>Indiana Jones</em> improvements. Both the DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA features of the game will be updated to work with Nvidia’s new transformer-based AI models, and Bethesda is also adding fully ray-traced shadows to the game.</p><p>“Using DLSS Ray Reconstruction, surface detail is improved, shadows are more precise, lighting is enhanced, and reflections more accurate,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Favowed-indiana-jones-great-circle-geforce-game-ready-driver%2F" rel="sponsored">explains Nvidia</a>. “Even in darker scenes, temples, and forests, DLSS Ray Reconstruction adds an extra level of refinement to the image.”</p><p>The transformer AI model change also promises to improve image quality throughout <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, and RTX 50-series owners will be able to enable Multi Frame Generation to get smoother frame rates.</p><p>Nvidia’s latest Game Ready driver also includes day one support for Obsidian’s <em>Avowed</em>, which is available today for Premium Edition owners. Avowed will support DLSS, Frame Generation, and Reflex, but it’s not launching with native DLSS 4 support. You can use the Nvidia app to force <em>Avowed </em>to use DLSS 4, though.</p><p>Nvidia has also addressed some bugs with its latest drivers, including fixing <em>Valorant </em>crashes on RTX 50-series, the <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> freezing problems, and <em>Delta Force</em> performance issues on some systems.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
