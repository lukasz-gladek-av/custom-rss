He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo’s GameCube controller for the Switch 2 will cost $64.99, according to the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-2-nintendo-gamecube-controller-120833%2F" rel="sponsored">controller’s listing</a> on the company’s website. The controller releases on June 5th, the same day as the Switch 2, but Nintendo will be making it available to order ahead of that date.</p><p>Initially, the controller will be available to buy from May 8th to May 12th to people who receive direct invitations from Nintendo to buy a Switch 2, according to a footnote on the controller’s listing. Starting May 13th, Nintendo will offer it to people who pay for a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. Nintendo will limit purchases to one per Nintendo Account.</p><p>The controller looks very similar to the original GameCube one, but the Switch 2 version is wireless and has some additional buttons to match what’s on other Switch 2 controllers. It won’t work with all regular Switch 2 games, though; in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/556487/gamecube-controllers-functionality-switch-1">a statement to <em>Polygon</em></a>, Nintendo said that since the controller “doesn’t have all the buttons and features found in other controllers that can be used with the Nintendo Switch 2 system, there may be some issues when playing other games.”</p><p>For the Switch 2, Nintendo will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24339906/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-nso">offer GameCube games</a> as part of a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. On the Switch 2’s launch date, the GameCube lineup will include <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, <em>F-Zero GX</em>, and <em>Soulcalibur II</em>. </p><p><em><strong>Update, April 24th</strong>: Added that Nintendo will limit to one controller per Nintendo Account.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The summer of video game releases is starting to heat up. Remedy Entertainment, the studio behind <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc">Alan Wake</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20832997/control-review-creators-thriller-ps4-xbox-pc">Control</a></em>, announced that its first multiplayer title <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/651425/a-rough-day-at-the-office">FBC: Firebreak</a></em> will launch on June 17th. It’ll be available on PC (both Steam and the Epic Game Store), the PS5, and Xbox. It’ll also be available on subscription platforms Game Pass and PlayStation Plus.</p><p>Set in the <em>Control</em> universe a few years after the original game, <em>Firebreak</em> is a three player co-op shooter where players take on missions inside of the headquarters of the FBC — Federal Bureau of Control — which has become overrun by supernatural forces. “The game features highly replayable missions known as Jobs, each uniquely designed with different challenges, objectives, and environments that require teamwork and adaptability,” Remedy explains.</p><p>The new game will be a paid release, priced at $39.99, and it sounds like it will be a nice change of pace from demanding live-service games. The studio says that, while there are updates planned for after launch, “all future playable content, including new Jobs, will be free. Players will have the option to purchase cosmetics, but none of these items will affect gameplay, and there will be no limited-time rotations or daily log-ins. ”</p><p>You can see some of the game in action here:</p><div><p><em>Firebreak</em> is part of <em>Remedy</em>’s plan to build <em>Control</em>’s supernatural universe into something much bigger. In addition to the multiplayer spinoff, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300511/control-2-action-rpg">a direct sequel is in development</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/29/24231469/control-sequel-movie-tv-remedy-annapurna">the studio has also partnered with Annapurna Pictures for future film and TV adaptations</a>.</p></div><div><p><em>Firebreak</em>’s release also comes during a very busy period for games, which will also include the launch of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642420/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-preview">the Nintendo Switch 2</a> (and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em>), alongside games like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349379/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-xbox-pc-ps5">Doom: The Dark Ages</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610946/death-stranding-2-trailer-ps5-state-of-play-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a></em>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
