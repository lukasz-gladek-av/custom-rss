            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339979/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-renders-onleaks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>New day, new Nintendo Switch 2 leaks. Nintendo is getting ever-closer to its April 2025 deadline to reveal its Switch successor, but thanks new renders <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/nintendo-switch-2-design-renders-exclusive/">from OnLeaks and <em>91Mobiles</em></a>, we may now have an even better idea of what the new console might look like.</p><p>If you’ve been following our coverage of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">other</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld">Switch 2</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">leaks</a>, these renders shouldn’t look too surprising. According to the new renders, the console will resemble the original Switch, but it will be bigger, with an 8.4-inch screen. Interestingly, OnLeaks and <em>91Mobiles</em> report that the screen will “most likely” be an “OLED panel” — previous reports have said the console would have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/26/24051407/analyst-tips-8-inch-lcd-for-nintendo-switch-2">an LCD screen</a>.</p><p>The renders show that the top of the Switch 2 will feature a power button, a volume rocker, a 3.5mm headphone jack, a game card slot, and, new for the Switch 2, a USB-C port. OnLeaks and <em>91Mobiles</em> also say that “there also seems to be a sensor of sorts” and they speculate that “this might be an ambient light sensor or something else.” These renders also have a U-shaped kickstand that has appeared in other leaks. </p><p>As for the Joy-Cons, OnLeaks and <em>91Mobiles’ </em>renders show the mysterious second new button on the right Joy-Con. However, they say the new button is <em>above</em> the Home button; other leaks have included the new button <em>below</em> it. The Joy-Cons in the renders have the large buttons in the back that are apparently used to detach the controllers from the console, which are apparently attached magnetically.</p><p>The renders also show an interesting color scheme for the Joy-Cons: they are mostly black but have color accents — light blue on the left one and orange on the right — under the joystick pads and on the bumped-out part of the controllers with the SL and SR buttons. A similar design popped up earlier this month for an alleged Switch 2 left Joy-Con <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336340/thats-a-nice-blue">with light blue accents</a>. I love it, personally.</p><p>Hopefully, given the tidal wave of recent leaks, we don’t have to wait too much longer for Nintendo to officially announce the new console. But whenever the console actually launches, it’s going to have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339466/nintendo-switch-2-pc-gaming-handhelds-steamos">some stiff competition</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
