Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fen-gb%2FSupport%2FNintendo-Switch%2FNintendo-Switch-Game-Vouchers-FAQ-1560656.html" rel="sponsored">discontinuing vouchers</a> for Switch games. The program, which lets Switch Online members save money on digital games, will come to an end on January 30th, 2026.</p><p>Though players will no longer be able to purchase vouchers after this date, vouchers will still expire one year after they’re purchased. Nintendo <a href="https://www.polygon.com/deals/2019/5/16/18627669/nintendo-switch-online-game-vouchers-deal">first introduced Switch game vouchers</a> in 2019, allowing Switch Online members to purchase a pair of vouchers for $99.98 and redeem them for two eligible games.</p><p>Since many of the games on <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fgames%2Fgame-voucher-eligible%2F%23sort%3Ddf%26p%3D0" rel="sponsored">Nintendo’s voucher eligibility list</a> — like <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree,</em> <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>, and <em>Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership</em> — cost $59.99, players can use their vouchers to save about $10 on each game. Nintendo <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/45255/kw/voucher#s1q1:~:text=the%20Nintendo%20website.-,Nintendo%20Switch%20Game%20Vouchers%20cannot%20be%20redeemed%20for%20games%20exclusive%20to%20the%20Nintendo%20Switch%C2%A02%20system.,-How%20to%20check">says players</a> can’t use vouchers to purchase Switch 2 exclusives, but users can still get around this by using them to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/679468/nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-more-titles">buy first-gen games enhanced</a> for the Switch 2 at a discount, and then paying for the Switch 2 upgrade.</p><p>Nintendo says it will continue to add games to its list of eligible titles until next year. It’s not clear whether Nintendo plans on implementing another kind of cost-saving method that would come in handy for pricier Switch 2 games, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer">like the $79.99 <em>Mario Kart World</em></a>. Nintendo also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/614210/auto-draft">ended its My Nintendo Gold Points loyalty program</a> in March, which means players can no longer earn points from buying games and use them to get discounts on digital purchases.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/703993/nintendo-switch-game-voucher-discontinued]]></content:encoded>
