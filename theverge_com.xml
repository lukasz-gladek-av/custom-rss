As reported by <a href="https://www.notateslaapp.com/news/3008/tesla-to-switch-to-unreal-engine-for-improved-fsd-visualizations"><em>Not a Tesla App</em></a>, Tesla hacker greentheonly says they <a href="https://x.com/greentheonly/status/1953882658284392579">found</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/759016/blank">evidence</a> of the change in Tesla’s 2025.20 firmware for Tesla Model S and Model X cars with AMD chips.</p><p>Unreal Engine is perhaps best known as a development tool for video games, but Epic has been making a bigger push as of late for <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/uses/automotive">automakers to use Unreal Engine</a>. Currently, Tesla uses the Godot engine for the visualizations, according to greentheonly, so if Tesla switches to Unreal Engine, it would join a growing number of automakers that use Epic’s engine inside its cars, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172761/rivian-r1t-r1s-refresh-update-motor-battery-price">Rivian</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/21/24229743/lincoln-nautilus-ford-digital-experience-infotainment-review">Ford</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21506572/epic-games-unreal-engine-general-motors-gmc-hummer-ev-human-machine-interface">GMC</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/1/23144461/volvo-epic-unreal-engine-hmi-human-machine-interface-partnership">Volvo</a>, and <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/spotlights/from-vr-to-hmi-why-lotus-is-still-one-of-auto-s-biggest-disruptors">Lotus</a>.</p><p>Tesla and Epic Games didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.
