It can save you time and money, too, compared to buying PC components piecemeal. If you’re weighing your options, consider some Presidents Day offers on iBuyPower’s pre-built desktops, including the <strong><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibuypower.com%2Fstore%2Frdy-element-9-pro-r07" rel="sponsored">$1,899 RDY Element 9 Pro R07</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fibuypower-slate-gaming-desktop-pc-amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-amd-radeon-rx-9070xt-16gb-32gb-ddr5-rgb2tb-nvme-ssd-black%2FJ3R75JYGZ5" rel="sponsored">$2,099.99 Slate</a></strong> — both of which are stocked with high-end AMD processors and GPUs that can tear through most games at 1440p with fast frame rates. They also come with 32GB of DDR5 RAM and 2TB of storage, along with a mouse and keyboard.</p><p>Digging into the Element 9 Pro R07, it features AMD’s Ryzen 7 7800X3D processor, a Radeon 9070 XT graphics card with 16GB of VRAM (roughly on-par with the Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti), 32GB of DDR6 6000MHz RAM, and a 2TB NVMe SSD built into the Asus B650EM Max Gaming motherboard. It ships in iBuyPower’s Element 9 Pro case, which has tempered glass on the front and one side, and features a 360mm RGB liquid cooling system. The system includes an 850W power supply, a wired mouse, and a keyboard, plus a three-year labor warranty and two years of parts coverage. The GPU will be shipped uninstalled, so that’s the only component you’ll need to insert with iBuyPower’s <a href="https://content.ibuypower.com/Download/GPU-Manual.pdf">instructions</a>. Normally $2,149, you can currently get it for $1,899 at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibuypower.com%2Fstore%2Frdy-element-9-pro-r07" rel="sponsored">iBuyPower</a> when you use coupon code <strong>STARS </strong>at checkout.</p><p>The Slate has slightly different specs, some that are improved over the Element above and some that are a bit below what it provides. The biggest highlight is that the Slate features AMD’s Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor, which edges out the 7800X3D in performance (although both are very capable CPUs). It also features an AMD Radeon 9070 XT graphics card, 32GB of DDR5 RAM at 5,200MHz instead of 6,000MHz, and a 2TB NVMe SSD. Like the R07, it includes a wired keyboard and mouse to get you started, along with a 750W power supply, a liquid cooling system, and a one-year warranty. It’s available for $2,099.99 at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fibuypower-slate-gaming-desktop-pc-amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-amd-radeon-rx-9070xt-16gb-32gb-ddr5-rgb2tb-nvme-ssd-black%2FJ3R75JYGZ5" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/878927/ibuypower-gaming-desktop-pc-presidents-day-sale-deal]]></content:encoded>
