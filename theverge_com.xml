He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Epic Games is making some big changes to its store to provide an enticing alternative to Apple’s in-app purchases for developers. The company is announcing the changes less than a day after a major court ruling that mandates that Apple can’t collect fees on purchases made outside of apps or restrict how they point to off-platform payments, meaning that more developers may choose to direct users to other payment options.</p><p>Beginning in June, Epic says that for any payments processed via the Epic Games Store, developers will pay a zero percent revenue share – meaning developers themselves will keep all of their revenue – “on their first $1,000,000 in revenue per app per year,” <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/new-epic-games-store-webshops-and-revenue-share-update">according to a blog post</a>. After that, Epic’s typical 88 / 12 percent revenue share will kick in. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction">Apple</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars">Google</a> offer a lowered commission rate on sales below $1 million, too, but only to 15 percent versus Epic’s zero. </p><p>Also beginning in June, Epic will launch a new feature that lets developers launch Epic Games Store-hosted “webshops.” These webshops “can offer players out-of-app purchases as a more cost-effective alternative to in-app purchases, where Apple, Google, and others charge exorbitant fees,” Epic says.</p><p>To incentivize buying things from webshops, Epic says that player spending will accrue 5 percent Epic Rewards “on all their purchases.” <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/features/epic-rewards">Epic Rewards</a> can be applied to future purchases from Epic’s store.</p><div><p>Shortly after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">ruling last night</a>, CEO Tim Sweeney also announced that Epic plans to bring <em>Fortnite</em> back to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659271/fortnite-ios-apple-app-store-us-return">US iOS App Store next week</a>. Apple kicked the game off the App Store <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments">in 2020</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
