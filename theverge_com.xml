The company showed off the Claw A8 BZ2EM at Computex 2025, which comes with an AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip along with up to 24GB of DDR5 memory.</p><p>That’s a bit less than the 32GB of memory that came with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24311944/msi-claw-7-ai-plus-8-ai-plus-lunar-lake-32gb-ram-gaming-pc-handhelds">Intel-equipped Claw 8 AI Plus released late</a> last year, but it still has an 8-inch full HD display, a 120Hz refresh rate, and a 1TB M.2 SSD. The AMD-powered Claw A8 will also come in two colors: white and lime green.</p><div><p>MSI had a bit of a rough start with the release of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review">original Claw handheld in March 2024</a>, but it seemed to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338654/i-finally-touched-the-msi-claw-8-ai-plus">redeem itself</a> with the launch of the MSI Claw 8 AI Plus.

It also has what MSI calls a “glittering” white coating. MSI didn’t reveal a release date or price for either model, but it will likely be in the same ballpark as the standard Intel-powered MSI Claw 8 Plus, which <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmsi-claw-8-ai-a2vm-8-120hz-fhd-1200p-gaming-handheld-intel-core-ultra-7-258v-intel-arc-32gb-1tb-ssd-console-black%2F6608225.p%3FskuId%3D6608225" rel="sponsored">Best Buy lists as costing $999.99</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
