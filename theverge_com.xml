I’m <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister">Sean Hollister</a>, and I’ve been <em>The Verge</em>’s unofficial handheld gaming PC reviewer since 2022, when the Steam Deck and kin <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579493/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc">took over my life</a>. (I also helped launch this website back in the day!) And I’ve just spent the past week reviewing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/799698/xbox-ally-x-review-asus-microsoft-full-screen-experience">the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X</a>, Microsoft’s very first “Xbox” handhelds that are built and co-developed by Asus.</p><p>We’re doing a neat new thing where we let paying subscribers ask us anything about the hottest new gadgets, stories, and events — and I wasn’t about to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/790817/amazon-alexa-show-google-gemini-nest-hands-on-ama">let my colleague Jen have all the fun</a>!</p><p>So I’ll be hosting my own subscriber-only AMA right here, and I’ll show up on launch day tomorrow, Thursday October 16th at 9am PT / 12pm ET to answer as many as I humanly can. After all, you subscribers are the ones paying to let me keep this awesome job! And I hear <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom</a> might show up too.</p><p>You can start asking your questions <strong>in the comments right now in this post,</strong> and if you tune into that comment section live on Thursday, I’ll answer some follow-ups as well. But if something needs extra testing, please get those Qs in ASAP so I have a chance to check!</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/800212/i-just-reviewed-the-xbox-ally-ask-me-anything]]></content:encoded>
