            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/636320/world-of-warcraft-hardcore-permadeath-rollback-onlyfangs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Blizzard has announced that it will make exceptions to its hardcore permadeath policy and allow some characters to return to life. According to a report in <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/not-so-permadeath-blizzard-revives-hardcore-wow-characters-killed-by-ddos-attacks/">Ars Technica</a></em>, Blizzard made the pronouncement in response to a string of DDoS attacks that seemed specifically targeted to cause the in-game deaths of members of a high-profile raiding guild.</p><p>Hardcode mode was introduced with <em>World of Warcraft Classic</em>. It’s a super intense, extremely difficult style of play where a character’s death is permanent no matter how it comes — whether it be falling in a mythic difficulty dungeon, getting ganked in PvP, or simply getting overrun by level 1 boars — is permanent. In regular <em>WoW</em>, characters can come back from or cheat death with a variety of mechanics which are disabled in Hardcore. The game mode has other adjustments, like requiring players to manually set their PvP flag, that Blizzard made to make the mode slightly less punishing.</p><p>Until now, there were no exceptions to the policy even in situations outside of a player’s control such as a death suffered during disconnection from the game server. And it seems like malicious actors were exploiting that strict policy to cause the deaths of members of a popular streaming guild OnlyFangs. According to <em>Ars Technica</em>, DDoS attacks seemed to coincide with the guild’s raiding attempts causing the permadeath of several members. The attacks were so frequent that soadapoppin, a popular Twitch streamer and OnlyFangs’ member, suggested that the guild might need to shutter operations indefinitely unless some kind of protections were put in place.</p><p>Blizzard addressed the issue on the <em>World of Warcraft</em> forums saying that it is aware of the targeted nature of the DDoS attacks and are taking steps to rollback some player deaths</p><p>“We’re taking steps to resurrect player-characters that were lost as a result of these attacks,” wrote <em>WoW Classic</em> associate production director Clay Stone. “In the future, Blizzard may elect — at our sole discretion — to revive Hardcore characters that perish in a mass event which we deem inconsistent with the integrity of the game, such as a DDoS attack.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/636243/metaphor-refantazio-ui-menu-interview-koji-ise<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Video game menus tend to fade into the background — but that’s not the case with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a></em>. Like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15098458/persona-5-review-ps4-ps3"><em>Persona</em> games before it</a>, the fantasy RPG has an interface that’s slick, aggressive, and certainly not the kind of thing you’ll forget. And according to lead interface designer Koji Ise, the intent was to create menus that matched and enhanced what players were feeling at any given moment. “As long as we’re able to identify ‘at this point the player should be feeling this,’ we’re able to match our UI and animations to act as emotional accelerators,” he says.</p><p><em>Metaphor</em> is developed by Atlus, and it’s a spiritual successor of sorts to the <em>Persona</em> series. Both are turn-based RPGs, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24262346/metaphor-refantazio-katsura-hashino-interview-persona"><em>Metaphor</em> shifts the setting from modern-day Japan to a new fantasy realm</a>. That turn-based nature means the menus are integral to the experience. You don’t skip past them to get to the action; they <em>are</em> the action. Since <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/2/24058364/persona-3-reload-review-xbox-ps5-steam">Persona 3</a></em>, the franchise has become highly regarded for its stylized menus, and that’s something Ise wanted to continue with <em>Metaphor</em>, though it was actually his first experience working in video games.</p><p>“Before this I used to work on website designs, and mainly used Flash to make various animations,” he explains. “It allowed us to make very interactive animations, which maybe you don’t see as much anymore. I thought that my forte with creating interactive animations would serve me well working with Atlus in trying to create UI there.”</p><p>The starting point was purely visual. Ise knew he wanted to create something intrinsically fantasy to match the game’s setting. Early designs included one made with parchment paper and another that tried to emulate the anxiety the lead character experiences throughout the story. “We started from ground zero,” Ise says, noting that he didn’t initially look at a game like <em>Persona 5</em> as a starting place. Here are a few of the early concepts:</p><p>But as game development continued, and <em>Metaphor</em>’s features became finalized, things shifted to the more functional aspects of the interface design. This is where the <em>Persona</em> connection came in. “As we were firming up the specification, there were certain elements from <em>Persona</em> that we decided to carry over,” he says.</p><p>The biggest challenge, according to Ise, was adding the emotional element. As an example, since combat can be very difficult in <em>Metaphor</em>, he wanted to heighten the feeling of speed and aggression with the menu design. “When players are smashing away at an enemy, we assume that emotions are running high and they’re experiencing exhilaration,” Ise explains. “Your life hangs in the balance with every fight. So we wanted to make sure that came across within the UI.” Nailing those feelings involved working closely with the other teams at Atlus.</p><p>Similarly challenging was balancing Ise’s vision for the visual style with the practical concerns of crafting a UI for a video game. “There were times in the development process when it seemed a little too lopsided on the aesthetic side of things, and there was feedback from the team that it went a little overboard or was too hard to understand,” Ise says. “So we try to strike that balance without killing the design or the visuals. Because if we lean in too much towards the functional side of things that would take away what makes us Atlus.”</p><p>All of this requires a great deal of work in terms of design, iteration, and coordination. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24262357/persona-metaphor-menu-design">As <em>Metaphor</em> and <em>Persona</em> director Katsura Hashino told me last year</a>, building these menus “is actually really annoying to do” because of all that time and effort. Ise agrees, saying “it was a lot of trouble.” But he notes that “we wanted to make sure that the menu became the face of the title, something where the design would be unforgettable for players.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
