That’s the idea behind Retro Mod Works’ <a href="https://www.retromodworks.com/product-page/ps-placeable">PS Placeable</a>, a mod that “consolizes” the PSP and was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMQ-yDYdgks">featured yesterday in a video</a> from the YouTube channel Macho Nacho Productions. </p><p>Retro Mod Works charges $274.99 for a prebuilt PS Placeable. Those are waitlisted at the moment, though — a message on the site says the project is a “one man show” and that the demand for the Placeable was higher than anticipated. </p><p>Retro also offers to mod customer-provided PSPs for $100 less, and there’s an option <a href="https://www.retromodworks.com/product-page/psp-bt-mod-kit">preorder DIY parts</a> and do the conversion work yourself. The mod requires either a PSP-2000 or PSP-3000 revision, as the first PSP didn’t have a video output. It’s not clear when the DIY parts will ship — we’ve asked Retro Mod Works and will update if we get a reply.</p><div><figcaption><em>A stack of PS Placeables.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Retro Mod Works</cite></p></div><p>The primary person behind the project, named Dan, told Macho Nacho host Tito Perez that he “hated the idea of buying digital games” for which he has physical copies, and wanted a way to add Bluetooth controller support while preserving the UMD drive. He’s also mentioned in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PSP/comments/1e3bw4a/what_should_we_name_this_the_play_station/lddy4me/">replies on Reddit</a> that his goal is to help people revive broken PSPs with the mod, which doesn’t need the console’s screen.</p><p>But buying one of these mod kits can be pricey or require skills most people don’t have. If you just want to play PSP games on your TV and don’t care about having a UMD drive, the PSP Go — which lacked Sony’s oddball optical drive but supported Bluetooth controllers and also had a way to output video — is still <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp4432023.m570.l1313%26_nkw%3DPSP%2BGo%26_sacat%3D0">pretty easy to come by</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
