Not to worry; I’ve got you covered for some of the best ones.</p><p>This week’s trailers included a teaser for Netflix’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284809/squid-game-season-2-teaser-trailer">second season of <em>Squid Game</em></a><em>, </em>a new haunted house horror film from Steven Soderbergh, and a look at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285689/disney-plus-star-wars-skeleton-crew-trailer-wild-ride"><em>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew</em></a>. Daniel Craig showed up in a trailer for a new A24 movie called <em>Queer.</em> </p><p><h3>Squid Game season 2</h3></p><p><em>Squid Game</em> is finally returning for its second season soon, and in a new teaser, Lee Jung-jae’s Gi-hun looks like he’s preparing to stage an uprising. Whatever happens, it looks like the season will be a bloody, violent return for the dystopian competition on December 26th.</p><p><h3>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew</h3></p><p>I’m very excited that Jude Law’s <em>Star Wars </em>debut, <em>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, </em>is essentially a swashbuckling pirate adventure. The vibes it’s throwing off feel like a nice blend of <em>The Goonies</em> and <em>Star Trek: Prodigy, </em>and I’m certainly ready. The series debuts December 3rd on Disney Plus.</p><p><h3>Presence</h3></p><p>The moody trailer for Steven Soderbergh’s haunted house horror film <em>Presence </em>doesn’t show the supernatural figure that’s terrorizing Lucy Liu and her suburban family. That’s because it all takes place from the perspective of the ghost itself, which I didn’t realize until I read <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/trailers/presence-trailer-steven-soderbergh-horror-1236195815/"><em>Variety’</em>s write-up of this trailer</a>. It’s already an eerie preview, but knowing that made it much more so on my second viewing. The movie hits theaters on January 24th.</p><p><h3>Queer</h3></p><p>Luca Guadagnino’s <em>Queer, </em>based on William Burroughs’ semi-autobiographical novel of the same name, stars Daniel Craig as William Lee, an American expat who lives in 1950s Mexico City and falls for a younger man named Eugene (Drew Starkey). Having already gotten showings at the Venice Film Festival, some reviews have praised it for <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/queer-review-luca-guadagnino-daniel-craig-venice-film-festival-1236076219/">Daniel Craig’s performance</a> and <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/queer-review-daniel-craig-luca-guadagninos-1235986089/">Guadagnino’s “trippy” direction</a>. <em>Queer </em>releases <a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/05a98e4d-2610-420f-ab75-503e09238d6e">on November 27th</a>.</p><p><h3>Xenoblade Chronicles X</h3></p><div><p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284092/nintendo-is-keeping-things-interesting">continued to <em>not</em> reveal</a> the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284092/nintendo-is-keeping-things-interesting">successor to the Switch</a> in a batch of announcements this week that included the surprise launch of a new music streaming app that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284073/nintendo-music-streaming-app-switch-online-subscribers">only plays Nintendo songs</a>, the release of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282741/xenoblade-chronicles-x-nintendo-switch-release-date-march-2025"><em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em></a> as a paid app, and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282741/xenoblade-chronicles-x-nintendo-switch-release-date-march-2025">remaster of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em></a>, a 2015 Monolith Soft action RPG. The game will be available on March 20th, 2025, for the Nintendo Switch.</p></div><p><h3>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</h3></p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180608/mario-and-luigi-brothership-release-date-nintendo-direct"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em></a> got a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/2/24286150/yo-ho-row-ho-with-mario-luigi">new trailer</a> this week, backed by a banger of a sea shanty that’s been stuck in my head all day today. The latest game in the <em>Mario &amp; Luigi</em> RPG series puts the brothers on a seafaring adventure that continues to make the Switch an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24162364/paper-mario-rpg-nintendo-switch">excellent Nintendo console for <em>Mario </em>RPG games</a>. It’s available November 7th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
