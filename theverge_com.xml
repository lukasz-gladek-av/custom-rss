The console comes with 256GB of internal storage, but that probably won’t be enough room for your entire digital game library. Thankfully, however, <strong>Samsung’s 512GB P9 microSD Express card</strong> is already on sale for $94.99 ($5 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FT995SPF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> you clip the on-page coupon. The 256GB model is also available on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FT99KCV8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, though only for its MSRP of $54.99.</p><p>The current discount may seem small, but the P9 is already around $20 less expensive than most other 512GB microSD Express cards. The only option that’s cheaper is <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FONN-MICRO-SD-EXPRESS%2F15708762625" rel="sponsored">a card from Onn</a>, Walmart’s house brand, which is available for around $85 but is frequently out of stock. Also, while the Switch 2 is one of the first mainstream gadgets to use a microSD Express card for extra storage, you can pop them into certain cameras, tablets, and drones with a microSD USH-I slot. The P9 offers sequential read speeds of up to 800MB/s, but only gadgets with a microSD Express card slot can take full advantage of the highest speeds.</p><p>As for how far 512GB of storage gets you, well, it depends. The number of digital games that will fit on the P9 is reliant on their size; <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/814762/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a></em> requires 43.4GB of space, while <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/777653/silksong-impressions-team-cherry-metroidvania-sherma-is-cool">Silksong</a></em> only takes up 4.1GB. If having a combined 768GB of storage for games seems like overkill, consider that the Switch 2 version of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade </em>requires a 93GB download.</p><p>Even physical game collectors may end up needing a microSD Express card, as many publishers have opted to release their games on game-key cards. These titles use a physical cartridge to authenticate your copy of the game, but require you to download a digital copy onto your system’s internal storage. There are also plenty of indie games that are only released digitally, or are only released on a cartridge long after their initial launch. Regardless of which types of games you choose, though, it’s better to have more space than you need than have to decide which games to take with you on a trip.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandt Ranj</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/815946/samsung-p9-microsd-express-card-nintendo-switch-2-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> is being delayed again: it will now launch on November 19th, 2026.</p><p>“We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve,” <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/ak3ak31a49a221/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-set-to-launch-november-19-2026">Rockstar Games says</a>. “We want to thank you again for your patience and support. While the wait is a little longer, we are incredibly excited for players to experience the sprawling state of Leonida and a return to modern day Vice City.”</p><p>Previously, <em>GTA VI</em> was set to launch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660057/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026">on May 26th, 2026</a>. Before that, Rockstar planned to release the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23988446/gta-vi-trailer-leaked-vice-city">in 2025</a>. It will be released on PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.</p><p>“When we set a date, we really do believe in it,” Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=4150086&amp;post_id=178213565&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=69bfp&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">tells <em>The Game Business</em></a>. “We said when we set the last date, if a game requires more polish to be the best possible version of itself, then we will give that game more time. And that’s exactly what happened. We feel really good about this release date. It’s in the same fiscal year, it happens to be a great release window, and naturally we’re really supportive of Rockstar’s approach.”</p><p><em>GTA VI</em> will take place in Vice City and stars two protagonists, Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos. “Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them,” according to Rockstar’s description of the second trailer for the game, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQRLujxTm3c">which was released in May</a>. “But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive.” Rockstar’s first <em>GTA VI</em> trailer debuted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdBZY2fkU-0">in late 2023</a>.</p><p>Last week, Rockstar was accused of union busting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/811999/gta-vi-rockstar-games-union-busting">after firing 30 to 40 employees</a>. A Rockstar spokesperson <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/-grand-theft-auto-studio-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-information">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a> that it took action against a “small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum” and that “this was in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/816005/grand-theft-auto-vi-gta-g-delayed-november-2026]]></content:encoded>
