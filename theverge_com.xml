            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/the-vergecast/645075/nintendo-switch-2-microsoft-ai-vergecast<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In most ways, Nintendo’s Switch 2 is exactly what we wanted: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream">a Switch, only better</a>. Nintendo has an occasional tendency to follow its best and most successful consoles with some of its weirdest ideas – Wii U, anyone? — but this time seems to have stayed the course in the best way. Still, this <em>is </em>Nintendo, so there are a few oddities in this console.</p><p>On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a>, we talk about all the best and worst things about the Switch so far. (I should say: one of the very worst things is that its pre-orders have been delayed because of the Trump administration’s tariffs, and there’s a strong chance it’s going to be even more expensive than we think. We recorded episode before a lot of the tariff stuff went down, but that’s surely the worst news of the lot.) <em>The Verge</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a>, one of the few people who has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642420/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-preview">actually played with the new console</a>, tells us all about her experience. We dig into how the screen looks, whether <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642699/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-preview-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> </em>can be a generational game like <em>Breath of the Wild </em>was, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642493/nintendo-switch-mouse-controls-metroid-prime-4">strange feeling of the mouse controls</a>, the big emphasis on video chat, and much more.</p><div><p>After that, <em>The Verge</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> reports on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643336/microsoft-50-years">Microsoft’s 50th anniversary celebration</a> last week, which turned into a strange mix of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/644769/microsoft-fires-employee-protestor-war-profiteer">party and protest.</a> Tom also walks us through <a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/643246/microsoft-50-business-model-cloud-ai">the company’s first five decades</a>, and some of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643336/microsoft-50-years#dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjM2OTUx">huge hits and near misses</a>. Then he explains why Microsoft seems to be betting its <em>next </em>50 years <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643235/microsoft-copilot-vision-windows-desktop-apps-mobile">on artificial intelligence</a>, and what that might look like coming out of Redmond. Microsoft has had a strange journey, full of huge swings, and it’s certainly not done yet.</p></div><p>Finally, we answer a question on the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about whether Trump’s tariffs should change your buying habits. As always with this administration, it’s tough to know what’s real and what isn’t. But all signs point to things <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643041/trump-tariff-consumer-electronics-gadgets-smartphones-laptops-wearables">getting more expensive</a> — and in some cases, potentially hard to find at any price. If you’ve been eyeing an upgrade, it might be time to hit the button.</p><p>Oh, before we go, <strong><a href="https://vote.webbyawards.com/PublicVoting#/2025/podcasts/shows/technology">please vote for <em>The Vergecast</em> in the Webby Awards</a></strong>!
