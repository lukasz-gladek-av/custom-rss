It’s called <em>Mario Kart World</em>, and it will be a day-one Switch 2 exclusive. It features an open-world mode, in-game atmospheric effects that depend on “the time of day and weather conditions,” and up to 24 drivers per race.

Hopefully, Nintendo will reveal all that and more — and maybe even sprinkle in some surprises, too.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>As much as I want to hear about DLSS...</p><p>I wouldn’t expect this to be a spec-heavy event. Ever since the Wii, Nintendo has prioritized the full experience of its consoles over the race to the top on graphics and speed:</p><div><blockquote><p>This shift came because of what Nintendo called its “blue ocean” strategy. The idea was that the increasing technological complexity of games was actually making them <em>less</em> appealing to many consumers.</p></blockquote></div></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>The Switch 2 has big shoes to fill.</p><p>While we wait for the next <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/638534/nintendo-switch-2-direct-stream-time-date-watch">Switch 2 Nintendo Direct</a>, let’s take a look at the legacy Nintendo’s new console is stepping into. The first Switch started by selling faster in its first two days than the Wii during the same period of its life, a record. It’s also on track to beating the DS as Nintendo’s highest-selling console ever, a milestone it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/605948/nintendo-switch-lifetime-sales-nintendo-ds">close to in February</a>.</p><p>Can the Switch 2 live up to that?</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>It’s hard to know what Nintendo has in store.</p><p>Rumors abound, but Nintendo has a history of carving its own path and going a surprising route. My colleague Andrew Webster wrote this shortly after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">the Alarmo clock</a> was announced:</p><div><blockquote><p>The rapid succession of announcements and reveals from the company over the last few weeks has been surprising and indicative of its idiosyncratic nature. And while it might seem random, the weeks full of museum openings and alarm clock launches are likely part of a very calculated strategy.</p></blockquote></div></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjM4NTM0" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/638534/nintendo-switch-2-direct-stream-time-date-watch">How to watch the Switch 2 Direct</a></h2></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjA2NTA0" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606504/nintendo-switch-2-direct-new-time">Nintendo shares more info on its Switch 2 direct</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div><div><p>As we settle in for the long, excruciating wait for more tangible news on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">Switch 2</a>, Nintendo has thrown us a little extra nugget of information. While we knew the company was planning to share more about the Switch 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24236766/nintendo-switch-2-games-direct-date-time">on April 2nd</a>, now we have a time: 9 AM ET / 6 AM PT / 10 PM JST. If you were taking bets on this time, you would have won handily as this is generally the usual time Nintendo holds its big events. <a rel="sponsored" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fsuccessor%2Fen-us%2Fnintendo-direct%2Findex.html">The announcement on Nintendo’s website</a> didn’t contain any extra detail about the duration of the event or the exact breakdown of topics that’ll be covered, other than to say it “will share a closer look” at the new device.</p><p>Last month, the company finally confirmed the existence of its new console dubbed, helpfully, the Switch 2. The reveal itself was sparse on detail, only confirming that the console would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345191/nintendo-switch-2-bigger-screen">be larger than its predecessor</a> and that its Joy-Con controllers appear to attach <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo">via some kind of magnetic action</a>. Because of the reveal’s relative lack of concrete information, we’re left with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24344718/nintendo-switch-2-specs-date-price-launch-games-mario-kart">so many questions about the new console</a>. Nevertheless, there was still lots of speculation about what the Switch 2 could possibly do. Theories were put forth that the new Joy-Cons contained some kind of mouse functionality and that the extra button on the right Joy-Con was related to some kind of party chat feature. Hopefully, Nintendo will let us know those if theories were correct during the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct on Wednesday, April 2nd bright and early at 9 AM.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606504/nintendo-switch-2-direct-new-time">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Here’s our video about the Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>I <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DE44_b_xIY0/">recorded this</a> with a sleeping baby in the next room, so I apologize if my voice sounds a bit quiet. It’s only just past 6AM here on the West Coast — why did Nintendo announce its n<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">ew console</a> so early?</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NzM4" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">Here’s the Nintendo Switch 2</a></h2><div><p>Nintendo shared the first details about the Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itpcsQQvgAQ">in a video published Thursday</a>. Nintendo doesn’t give a specific release date for the console besides “2025.”</p><p>The console looks a lot like the original, but it’s bigger. In the video, the Joy-Con controllers are black with colored accents, and they attach to the side of the console instead of sliding on and off. The Joy-Cons appear to snap on quite easily — leaks have suggested they could be attached via magnets.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MzM4" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24236766/nintendo-switch-2-games-direct-date-time">Nintendo announces Switch 2 Direct for April</a></h2><div><p>Now that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">Nintendo’s reveal of the Switch 2</a> has put to rest years of anticipation and rumormongering, it’s time to hear more information about the console and, importantly, all the games.
