            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/627171/nintendo-alarmo-alarm-clock-ifixit-teardown-magnetic-hall-effect-sensor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Nintendo is still shipping the Switch with Joy-Con hardware that will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained">potentially develop issues like joystick drift and false inputs</a> over time. We’ll have to wait until <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606504/nintendo-switch-2-direct-new-time">April 2nd to find out if Nintendo is fixing the issue with the new Switch 2</a>, but as iFixit discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjGaEMXa3mQ">during a teardown of the Alarmo alarm clock</a>, the company is already embracing more reliable Hall effect sensors in at least one of its devices.</p></div><p>Unlike disassembling most modern smartphones, iFixit’s teardown of Nintendo’s Alarmo appears to be relatively painless. Removing a single tri-point screw on the bottom of the alarm clock allows its faceplate to be simply twisted off, providing easy access to its internal hardware.</p><p>There aren’t a lot of surprises inside Alarmo. Below its 2.4-inch LCD screen, you’ll find the 24GHz mmWave presence sensor the alarm clock uses to detect your body movements and whether you’re sleeping through an alarm. There’s also an easy to replace CR2032 coin cell backup battery that’s used to preserve settings while the clock isn’t getting power from a USB cable.</p><p>Somewhat unexpected, given Nintendo’s refusal to update its Joy-Con hardware, is the presence of a magnet and Hall effect sensor inside the rotary dial button atop Alarmo. That tech, which is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279435/8bitdo-ultimate-mobile-gaming-controller-android-hall-effect">already in use in many third-party controllers</a>, should not only improve accuracy while using the dial to navigate the alarm clock’s menus, but it will also help ensure that in five years’ time Alarmo’s dial can still work as reliably as it does today.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/626695/sony-playstation-ai-characters-aloy-horizon-forbidden-west-prototype<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony is working on a prototype AI-powered version of at least one its PlayStation game characters. An anonymous tipster has shared an internal video from Sony’s PlayStation group with <em>The Verge</em> that demonstrates an AI-powered version of Aloy from <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>.</p><p>The video is narrated by Sharwin Raghoebardajal, a director of software engineering at Sony Interactive Entertainment who works on video game technology, AI, computer vision, and face technology for Sony’s PlayStation Studios Advanced Technology Group. Raghoebardajal demonstrates an AI-powered version of Aloy that can hold a conversation with a player through voice prompts during gameplay.</p><p>Aloy can be seen responding to queries with an AI-powered synthesized voice and facial movements, both in a demo setting and within the full <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> game. Raghoebardajal makes it clear this is just a prototype that has been developed alongside Guerrilla Games to demonstrate the technology internally at Sony.</p><p>The technology demo uses OpenAI’s whisper for speech-to-text, and both GPT-4 and Llama 3 for conversations and decision making. Sony’s has its own internal Emotional Voice Synthesis (EVS) system that it uses for speech generation, according to Raghoebardajal, and audio to face animation is powered by Sony’s own Mockingbird technology.</p><p>While the demo is seen running on PC, Sony has also experimented with running parts of this technology directly on PS5 consoles with “little overhead,” according to Raghoebardajal. Sony first demonstrated this internally a year ago, before showing a more advanced version behind closed doors at its Sony Technology Exchange Fair (STEF) in Tokyo in November.</p><p>“This is just a glimpse of what is possible,” says Raghoebardajal. This tech demo doesn’t answer the more obvious questions over whether it even makes sense to talk to Aloy when you’re supposed to be playing as her in <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, or the impact such a technology could have on voice actors and game developers.</p><p>Nvidia has been working on its own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24031687/nvidia-ai-npcs-convai-ces-2023">similar technology for AI-powered NPCs</a> in games, where you speak freely to video game characters. Ace, as Nvidia calls it, has been demonstrated several times throughout 2024, and the GPU maker has even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/19/24105681/nvidia-ai-ace-video-game-character-npc-covert-protocol">worked with Inworld AI</a> to create <em>Covert Protocol</em>, a playable tech demo of Nvidia’s AI game technology.</p><p>Microsoft has also been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23948454/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-developer-tools-inworld-partnership">partnering closely with Inworld AI</a> to eventually bring AI characters to Xbox, allowing game developers to use generative AI characters, storylines, and more. Microsoft has also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615048/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-model-gaming-muse">created its own Muse AI model that generates gameplay</a>, designed initially for game developers to create a game environment for prototyping and ideating.</p><p>There is already a lot of fear among game developers and studios about how AI could impact the creative process of making video games, particularly when so many layoffs are impacting the gaming industry. Almost half (49 percent) of 3,000 respondents to a Game Developers Conference (GDC) 2024 <a href="https://images.reg.techweb.com/Web/UBMTechweb/%7B4fe03be1-d6b1-4f91-95f4-b4bdea9e739e%7D_GDC24-SOTI-Report_Final.pdf">survey</a> said that generative AI tools are currently being used in their workplace, with 31 percent saying they personally use them.</p><p>Sony’s experiments with AI-powered PlayStation characters are bound to generate more conversation around the role of AI in video game creation, just ahead of GDC next week in San Francisco. We reached out multiple times to Sony for a comment on this leaked internal video, but the company didn’t respond in time for publication.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/627006/infinity-nikki-interactive-map-update-infold-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The developers of <em>Infinity Nikki</em> have finally solved one of the game’s biggest problems: where the hell is everything? Piggybacking off similar efforts in other gacha games like <em>Genshin Impact</em>, the developers at Infold Games have created an interactive map that’ll guide you to all the bits and bobs littered throughout the game’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/14/24320757/infinity-nikki-review-gacha-dress-up-game">impressively expansive world</a>.</p><p>Because <em>Infinity Nikki</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/605811/infinity-nikki-gacha-mechanics">is a gacha game</a>, there are fifty ‘leven different kinds of <em>things</em> to collect and trade for resources, currencies, and clothes. You can map some of the collectibles in <em>Infinity Nikki </em>to the ones in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and it works out pretty well. Some of them are easier to find than others. The whimstars are like spirit orbs you earn from shrines and they’re pretty easy to find as the game has a built-in system to help you locate them. The dews of inspiration are like korok seeds; there’s ten and a half million of them and your best chance of finding them is through sheer luck and determination – i.e. impossible. </p><p>It kinda sucks that they’re so hard to find because dews can be exchanged for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619372/infinity-nikki-eerie-season-event-march-2025">really cool outfits</a> that can help out if you’re stuck in one of the styling boss battles. The <em>Infinity Nikki</em> community has clamored for the developers to put a tracking system for them in the game similar to the way your bi-pedal cat companion Momo can guide you to nearby whimstars. The developers have fulfilled other community wishes like expanding the number of outfit slots from four to seven (thanks!) and now they’ve answered this ask in a big way.</p><p>Visiting <a href="https://pearpal.infoldgames.com/en/home">this site</a> will grant access to an interactive map whereby you can finally locate all those damnable dews of inspiration. If you use your <em>Infinity Nikki</em> log in information, the map will be personalized to show what items you’ve picked up and what you’re still missing. Best yet, this map can be used for literally everything – missing treasure chests, secret clothing vendors, hidden caves, and more. It’s not as convenient as an in-game map would be but it updates in real time to make checking things off your list a little easier.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
