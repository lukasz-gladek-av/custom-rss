            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/635554/samsung-odyssey-3d-monitor-pricing-preorder<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After Samsung <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031774/play-vr-games-without-a-vr-headset">first revealed</a> its glasses-free 3D monitor last year, the company is <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-launches-next-gen-odyssey-gaming-monitors-showcase-immersive-3d-oled-excellence-now-available-to-reserve/">finally letting customers reserve</a> preorders for the display, with a <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-27-odyssey-3d-g90xf-4k-uhd-165hz-1ms-nvidia-g-sync-compatible-and-amd-freesync-premium-pro-gaming-monitor-mercury-silver/6621151.p?skuId=6621151">since-removed</a> Best Buy page showing a price of $1,999.99. The 27-inch Odyssey 3D G90XF comes with a 4K display <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24225133/samsung-odyssey-3d-gaming-monitor-glasses-free-announcement">that uses eye-tracking</a> to “deliver a natural-looking high-definition 3D image.”</p><p>You’ll need to install Samsung’s Reality Hub app to make games appear in 3D. Samsung says it’s working with developers “to make the most out of this 3D technology,” as upcoming games like <em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em> and <em>Lies of P. </em>DLC <em>Overture</em> will be optimized for the monitor. The display features a 165Hz refresh rate, 1ms gray-to-gray response time, along with support for AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync.</p><p>The Odyssey 3D can also convert “nearly all” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334067/samsung-odyssey-g8-g6-3d-smart-monitor-m9-specs">content into 3D using the panel’s lenticular lens</a>, but there are some big caveats. You can only use the feature if your PC has an Nvidia graphics card (RTX 3080 or higher is recommended), and you can’t use it with DRM-protected content. Samsung also notes that some video players might not support the 3D conversion tool, adding that it’s not available in HDR mode, either.</p><p>Along with the Odyssey 3D, Samsung is launching the 27-inch and 32-inch Odyssey OLED G8 (G81SF) next month. The 27-inch model costs $1,299.99, according to <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/693198/samsung-odyssey-oled-g8-g81sf-27-4k-uhd-(3840-x-2160)-240hz-gaming-monitor">a listing still live on MicroCenter</a>, and offers a 4K OLED display sitting at 166 pixels-per-inch (PPI). It comes with a .03ms gray-to-gray response time, a 240Hz refresh rate, and a built-in system that protects against burn-in.</p><p>There’s a new 49-inch Odyssey G9 (G91F) model as well, with a product page on Best Buy (that’s also been taken down) suggesting a cheaper, $999.99 price. This monitor comes with a dual QHD display with a 1ms response time and a lower 144Hz refresh rate compared to the 240Hz with the <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/gaming/49-odyssey-g9-dqhd-240hz-1ms-gtg-displayhdr-1000-gaming-monitor-ls49cg954enxza/">Odyssey G9 G95C</a>.</p><p>Lastly, Samsung is also launching a ViewFinity S8 (S80UD) monitor with a larger 37-inch 4K display for $599.99, as shown on <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-37-viewfinity-s8-s80ud-led-4k-uhd-high-resolution-monitor-with-hdr10-usb-c-and-ergonomic-stand-black/6615666.p?skuId=6615666">this Best Buy product page</a>. Despite these early retail listings, the exact pricing of these monitors is still unclear. Samsung spokesperson Courtney Camp tells <em>The Verge</em> there are “no details to share on pricing just yet.”</p><p>You <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/monitors/get-it-first/?r=true&amp;referrer=usnewsroom">can reserve</a> the Odyssey 3D, Odyssey OLED G8, and Odyssey G9 from now until April 8th and receive a $50 credit toward your preorder.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
