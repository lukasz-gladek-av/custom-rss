G-Assist will be able to connect to external tools and use APIs to expand the capabilities of what Nvidia offers right now.</p><div><p>Nvidia has published <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/g-assist">sample plugins on GitHub</a> that can be compiled and used by G-Assist:</p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Spotify</strong> — hands-free music and volume control</span></li><li><span><strong>Google Gemini </strong>— allows G-Assist to invoke Gemini for cloud-based complex conversations</span></li><li><span><strong>Twitch</strong> — you can use this plugin to checks if a streamer is live with voice commands like, “Hey, Twitch, is [streamer] live?” </span></li><li><span><strong>Peripheral Controls</strong> — change RGB lighting or fan speed on <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fsoftware%2Fnvidia-app%2Fg-assist%2F" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored" target="_blank">Logitech G, Corsair, MSI and Nanoleaf devices</a></span></li><li><span><strong>Stock Checker</strong> — provides real-time stock prices</span></li><li><span><strong>Weather Updates</strong> — provides current weather conditions in any city</span></li></ul></div><p>These plugins all run locally using a small language model on Nvidia’s RTX GPUs, and developers will also be able to share their own custom plugins through GitHub. G-Assist uses a local small language model that requires nearly 10GB of space for the assistant functions and voice capabilities. The AI assistant works on a variety of RTX 30-, 40-, and 50-series desktop GPUs, but you’ll need a card with at least 12GB of VRAM.</p><p>If you’re interested in trying out G-Assist or building a plugin, the app is available as an optional part of <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fsoftware%2Fnvidia-app%2F" rel="sponsored">Nvidia’s main app for Windows</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One of the year’s biggest PlayStation 5 games is launching this fall: <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/23/ghost-of-yotei-comes-to-playstation-5-on-october-2/">Sony just announced</a> that <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24253576/ghost-of-tsushima-2-yotei-ps5-pro-2025">Ghost of Yōtei</a></em> will hit the PS5 on October 2nd. The news was accompanied by a fresh trailer that’s mostly dramatic samurai cinematics, but also some brief glimpses of its bloody combat and traversing the beautiful landscape on horseback.</p><p>The follow up to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21323144/ghost-of-tsushima-review-ps4-game-developer-samurai">2020’s <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a> from developer Sucker Punch, <em>Yōtei</em> features a new samurai protagonist called Atsu, who is, naturally, on a quest for revenge. The trailer introduces a gang of outlaws, and her ultimate goal is to find and eliminate all six. “One by one, she’s hunting them down to avenge her family,” the official description reads. “But while Atsu’s story begins with vengeance, she’ll find there’s more to her journey than just revenge. As she explores Ezo, Atsu will meet unlikely allies and forge connections that help give her a new sense of purpose.”</p><p>The game’s structure sounds fairly open, as Sony says “you’ll choose which leads to follow as you pick which Yōtei Six member you want to hunt down first.”</p><p><em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> is one of s small number of major exclusives planned for the PS5 this year. It will follow the launch of <em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610946/death-stranding-2-trailer-ps5-state-of-play-on-the-beach">which comes out on June 26th</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He previously worked at <em>Android Police</em> and <em>Tech Advisor</em>.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Shortages of the Switch 2 look increasingly likely after Nintendo admitted today that it “cannot fulfill” all of the preorder applications it has already received through its own Japanese store. </p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1914982671522083155">statement on X</a> via Nintendo’s Japanese account, president Shuntaro Furukawa confirmed that the company’s storefront has received 2.2 million applications to preorder the new console in Japan alone. That’s a number that “far exceeds our expectations, and far exceeds the number of Nintendo Switch 2 consoles that can be delivered from the My Nintendo Store on June 5th.”</p><p>In its first month on sale the original Switch <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/historical_data/index.html">sold 360,000 units in Japan</a>, suggesting that Nintendo is seeing six times the demand for its sequel. The Japanese demand for day one is almost as high as the 2.74 million Switch consoles the company sold worldwide in its first few weeks in 2017.</p><p>Furukawa didn’t say how many consoles Nintendo has ready for the launch, but only that “a significant number of customers” won’t be lucky in the My Nintendo Store lottery. Those who don’t get a console will be automatically re-entered into a second lottery, while third-party retailers in Japan will begin taking preorders tomorrow, April 24th. In Japan Nintendo is offering two versions of the Switch 2: a Japanese-only model for ¥49,980 (about $350) and a ¥69,980 (about $500) multilingual version which is exclusively available through the My Nintendo Store.</p><p>Preorders have already been open for several weeks in some parts of the world, including most of Europe, and stores have sold out fast. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643616/nintendo-switch-2-us-preorders-date">US preorders open tomorrow</a> for $449.99, following an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">initial delay</a> over tariff concerns.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
