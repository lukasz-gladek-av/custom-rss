            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> is good, it’s <em>good</em>. The latest in Nintendo’s sci-fi exploration franchise, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22710468/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch">the first since <em>Metroid Dread</em> in 2021</a>, <em>Beyond</em> captures the moody sense of isolation and discovery that has been so core to <em>Metroid</em> since it debuted in 1986. Those quiet moments truly make you feel all alone on a harsh alien planet, punctuated by intense action set pieces and some incredible boss fights. At its peak, the game is among the best in the series. The problem is that Nintendo added a whole bunch of stuff on top of that — including chatty companion characters and a boring, empty hub world — which gets in the way.</p><p>Despite the 4 in the title, <em>Beyond</em> is a largely standalone experience. The latest in bounty hunter Samus Aran’s many adventures starts in the midst of a war with some space pirates, before she finds herself mysteriously transported to a faraway world. The planet is typical <em>Metroid</em> stuff: Once home to an advanced civilization, it’s now covered with ancient technology lying in slumber, and all kinds of dangerous creatures. Early on Samus learns that the only way to get home is to find a series of “transporter keys” and take them to a giant tower. Oh, and the dead alien race, which look like talking axolotls, view her as a chosen one meant to fix the mistakes that led to their downfall, which expands her quest even further.</p><div><div><p id="got-any-burning-metroid-prime-4-questions"><h2>Got any burning Metroid Prime 4 questions?</h2></p></div><p>Join me and <em>Verge</em> games reporter Ash Parrish for a subscriber-exclusive AMA on December 3rd at 1PM ET. We won’t get into story spoilers for the long-gestating game, but we can tell you if mouse controls are any good.</p></div><p>Doing all of this involves the standard <em>Metroid</em> formula. You start out with only a few abilities — a gun and the ability to turn into a little ball — and steadily gain new ones, which let you further explore. The joy in a <em>Metroid</em> game comes from unraveling its intricately designed levels, spaces full of secrets and connections between them that usually only become apparent once you have the right ability or knowledge. You’ll regularly see doors that can only be opened with a weapon you don’t have yet, or ledges too high to reach with your current abilities.</p><p>Rather than mess with what works, <em>Beyond</em> just does it really well. The levels both challenge your brain and are absolutely dripping with atmosphere. Sometimes that comes in the form of small details, like scurrying alien bugs or packs of wolves that watch your every movement. Other times, it’s more elaborate. In one abandoned factory level, you wander through eerie hallways filled with powered-down security bots. It’s very unsettling, and later, after you solve some complex technical challenges to get things up and running, the mood shifts completely as the bots come to life and attack you. <em>Beyond</em> has an excellent balance between solo exploration and action, with a handful of large-scale battles, including some white-knuckle boss fights. It also adds a few new tools to Samus’ arsenal with psychic powers that let her manipulate certain objects and slow down time to bend shots around obstacles.</p><p>If that’s exactly what <em>Beyond</em> was, it would be a brilliant game, and a welcome addition to the <em>Metroid</em> canon, one that was worth <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15782806/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-announced-e3-2017">the near decadelong wait from announcement to launch</a>. Unfortunately, Nintendo also decided to add some new and very un-<em>Metroid</em> elements to the game that dampen the experience.</p><p>First up are the new companion characters. It’s not like Samus has always worked solo — she previously had an AI guide in <em>Metroid Fusion</em>, for instance — but here the other characters are much more involved. Over the course of the game you’ll discover a handful of soldiers who were similarly transported to the planet, and you’ll spend much of the game working alongside them to get home.</p><p>This has a big impact on the game: While the story is usually background material in <em>Metroid</em>, where you can dig in as much or as little as you like, here it’s much more present because Samus isn’t alone. She’s still a silent protagonist, but her new crew — each of whom is a generic sci-fi archetype, ranging from nerdy gearhead to gruff sergeant — can be pretty chatty. This is mostly relegated to cutscenes in which people are constantly risking their life for Samus, though they’ll regularly chime in over the radio to provide hints as well. The dialogue doesn’t overwhelm the experience, but it also doesn’t add much to it; the characters are so forgettable that I found myself tuning them out.</p><p>More frustrating is the new hub area. While much of your time in <em>Beyond</em> is spent in those well-designed levels, connecting each of them is a vast expanse of desert, which you traverse on an <em>Akira</em>-style motorcycle. At first, it’s very cool; blazing across a highway while heavy metal blares and lightning strikes gothic alien towers in the distance is an excellent introduction to the bike. But eventually it becomes clear that the desert is a bare and boring place. There are some basic shrines where you can solve simple puzzles to unlock new power-ups, and some space junk and other points of interest to investigate. Mostly, though, you’re speeding across an empty place while getting stuck in tedious vehicular battles.</p><p>This problem becomes even worse as you progress because of the game’s structure, which necessitates lots of backtracking. So every time you need to go back to an area to use one of your new power-ups or talk to a character, it means a long trek through nothing. The game eventually devolves into an unavoidable collect-a-thon near the end, which really kills <em>Beyond</em>’s momentum as you approach the conclusion.</p><p>These parts of the game are especially frustrating because otherwise <em>Beyond</em> does so much well. While Metroidvania has become an inescapable genre, the <em>Prime</em> games are still unmatched when it comes to bringing that style of exploration-heavy gameplay into a 3D world. <em>Beyond</em> is a fitting follow-up, but you really have to push through some drab and unnecessary additions to see its best moments.</p><p><sub>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond <em>launches on December 4th on the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/835325/metroid-prime-4-review-nintendo-switch]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Over the past couple of years, I’ve tried to switch to many different gaming keyboards and always ended up back with a Wooting 60HE. Wooting changed PC gaming with the 60HE, popularizing the use of Hall effect switches and a Rapid Trigger system that speeds up how quickly you can activate keys. Now it’s back with a v2 that upgrades the best gaming keyboard to improve its sound and feel.</p><p>I’ve been testing the $239.99 Wooting 60HE v2 over the past week, and I’m impressed with my early hands-on, but I don’t know if I would rush to upgrade from an original modded 60HE.</p><p>The Wooting 60HE v2 has the same 60 percent layout as the original, so there are no dedicated function keys or an F row. There are also no arrow keys, but Wooting has a clever “mod tap” system that lets you enable arrow keys in the right shift section of the board.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODM2MTg0"><p><span>$<!-- -->240</span></p><div><p>Wooting’s 60HE v2 is an upgrade to the popular 60HE. It has true 8K polling, a new closed-bottom switch, and an aluminum case that together improve the sound and feel.</p></div></div><p>The big changes with the 60HE v2 are all about what comes as standard now. Wooting has really focused on improving the sound and feel of the v2 so it’s a lot closer to a modded 60HE with custom switches, dampening, and more.</p><p>Wooting has ditched the screws for the v2, opting for a pressure fit instead. I’ve been testing the aluminum case that looks and feels a lot like the alumaze cases Wooting sold as optional extras for the 60HE. The case includes a new silicon dampening option, or the regular EDPM foam.</p><p>I felt like the silicon option dampened the sound of the switches too much, so I preferred the EDPM instead. You can also just not use any dampening if you prefer that type of sound. Wooting is also using PET film to prevent the switches from making contact with the PCB, and a factory tape mod on the rear of the board. Both of these help improve the overall sound.</p><p>The switches on the 60HE v2 have also been upgraded to Wooting’s new “Lekker Tikken” switch, a closed-bottom Hall effect switch with a 4.0mm actuation range. Hall effect switches use a magnet so the board can track how far a switch has been pressed, but the sound profile has typically been worse than Cherry MX-style switches.</p><p>Wooting’s new switches have definitely improved the sound profile, but they use a longer 22mm spring that makes the switches feel a little heavier than the Geon Raws I’ve been using for months. I can usually adapt to different switches after a few hours of use, but I found myself quickly moving back to the Geon Raws as I preferred both the sound profile and feel. Wooting’s switches are still a great default switch though, and the stem wobble of the original switches has been greatly improved here.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The new Lekker Tikken switches.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The upgraded 60HE v2 is also faster than the original model, thanks to true 8kHz polling and a low input latency of just 0.125ms. That’s the same latency as the 8kHz USB polling on Wooting’s larger <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24247911/wooting-80he-keyboard-gaming-hands-on">80HE that I reviewed last year</a>. I don’t think you’d actually notice this latency improvement unless you measured it, but it’s nice to have either way.</p><p>I opted to test the split-spacebar 60HE v2, and I’m still a bit undecided on whether I like it. It allows you to have three keys where you’d normally only have the single space bar. I like the idea in principle, but I found myself constantly hitting the button in the middle of the split space bar.</p><p>I found it better to assign that to a function key that would have to be paired with another key to activate, but if you can get used to this layout, then having that extra button right next to the space bar could certainly be useful in competitive games. The right-hand side of the split felt a little too far to reach to make it useful in a pinch, though.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The aluminum case comes in silver or black.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The biggest issue with a split-spacebar for me is just the lack of keycap sets that support it, but if you’re happy with the double-shot PBT ones that Wooting supplies, then it’s less of an issue.</p><p>Overall, the 60HE v2 feels like a solid upgrade to the original, but it’s not a revelation like Wooting’s first Hall effect keyboards were. The thing I like the most about the 60HE v2 is that it feels like a fully modded keyboard out of the box, so you don’t have to play around with different switch options unless you want to, and the sound dampening options are super easy to switch between, thanks to the friction fit.</p><p>At $239.99, it’s a premium PC gaming keyboard, especially now that Wooting has competition that has finally caught up. Logitech, Razer, SteelSeries, and plenty of Chinese brands now have more affordable Hall effect boards that aim to match Wooting both in terms of hardware and software. None are good enough to dethrone the 60HE v2, but if you’re on a tighter budget, then there are plenty of more affordable options now.</p><p>As I have a pair of fully modded 60HE keyboards, I’m not upgrading to the 60HE v2 just yet, but if you’ve been put off doing mods yourself and want the best gaming keyboard available today, then the 60HE v2 will be well worth the investment.</p><p><em>Photography by Tom Warren / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/836168/wooting-60he-v2-keyboard-gaming-hands-on]]></content:encoded>
