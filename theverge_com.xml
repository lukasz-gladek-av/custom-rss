The company has offered cloud gaming as a beta to a “subset” of subscribers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23919517/netflix-game-streaming-beta-tvs-us">since 2023</a>, so this news from Peters indicates that the company is going to continue to invest in it.</p><p>Peters didn’t say exactly when the co-op and party games might be available. But he did say that “we think of this as a successor to family board game night or an evolution of what the game show on TV used to be.”</p><p>Netflix will also continue to focus on “more narrative games based on Netflix IP” — Peters says those games are “consistent fan favorites and we’ve got a lot in the library to work with there.”</p><div><h3>Related</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24171526/netflix-games-too-hot-too-handle-interactive-fiction">The future of Netflix games could look like reality TV</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23919517/netflix-game-streaming-beta-tvs-us">Netflix tests streaming games to US TVs to take on PlayStation and Xbox</a></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
