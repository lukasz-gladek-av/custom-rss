            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/605372/ea-battlefield-labs-community-testing<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>EA <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-ca/news/announcing-battlefield-labs">has announced</a> a new “Battlefield Labs” community testing program to give people the opportunity to test the next <em>Battlefield</em> game. You can <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs">sign up for the program now</a>, and EA says that the “first phase” of testing will go live in “the coming weeks” for invited players in Europe and North America.</p><p>As I write this, there’s a long queue to attempt to sign up for Battlefield Labs; there are just under 200,000 people ahead of me and my estimated wait time is “more than an hour.” EA <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1886450457800810928">says that</a> “your position in the registration queue does not affect your chances of being invited,” so if you don’t want to deal with the queue, you might want to wait a bit to try to register.</p><div><p>Battlefield Labs follows other early testing initiatives from EA like its work with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/14/23207209/skate-free-to-play-developers-interview-ea">new <em>Skate</em> game</a> and with the <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/project-rene-playtesting-the-next-generation-of-the-sims">Project Rene game in <em>The Sims</em> franchise</a>. But Battlefield Labs is also likely an attempt to avert another <em>Battlefield 2042</em> situation; that game had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042s-opening-weekend-has-been-a-disaster">a rough launch</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/1/22913193/ea-battlefield-2042-launch-expectations">didn’t meet EA’s expectations</a>.</p></div><p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/_fGteYuaNxA?feature=shared">a video</a> accompanying the announcement, EA detailed how its “Battlefield Studios” – Dice (which created the franchise), Criterion (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23882537/ea-criterion-battlefield">known for its racing games</a>), Motive (which worked <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23567481/dead-space-remake-ea-motive-ps5-xbox-pc-review">on <em>Dead Space</em></a> and is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/20/23363085/ea-marvel-iron-man-game-motive-studio">making a new <em>Iron Man</em> game</a>), and Ripple Effect (which made <em>2042’s</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587667/battlefield-2042-portal-custom-game-modes-vehicles-weapons-maps-ea-play">Portal mode</a>) – are teaming up on the development of this next game, which will have single player and multiplayer modes. The series is under the oversight of Respawn Entertainment head Vince Zampella <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814517/ea-battlefield-vince-zampella-apex-legends-respawn-boss-ceo-shakeup">following a shakeup</a> shortly after <em>2042’s</em> launch.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
