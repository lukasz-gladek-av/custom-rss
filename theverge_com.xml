The console is Analogue’s reimagined and upgraded version of the Nintendo 64 with 4K output and full compatibility with original N64 cartridges from every region, including both PAL and NTSC versions.</p><p>Exactly a year after the original announcement, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24265587/analogue-3d-nintendo-64-price-preorder-date">Analogue shared more details about the Analogue 3D</a> including the console’s design, which looks similar to the N64’s. As with the company’s other <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22831589/analogue-pocket-review">consoles like the Pocket</a>, the Analogue 3D uses <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323002/mister-fpga-project-retro-computer-console-early-pc">FPGA technology</a> to exactly replicate the functionality of Nintendo’s original hardware which has proven to be notoriously difficult to accurately emulate, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746897/nintendo-switch-online-n64-emulation-quality-bad">even for Nintendo</a>. It also has four N64 controller ports plus Bluetooth for those wanting to play wirelessly, and includes optional display modes that mimic the appearance of games played on older CRT TVs.</p><p>Preorders for the $249.99 Analogue 3D opened on October 21st, 2024 with shipping expected sometime in Q1 2025, but that was followed by a string of delays that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631816/analogue-3d-delay-nintendo-64-modretro-teaser">pushed the console’s release to July 2025</a>, and then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707586/analogue-3d-4k-n64-delay-august-2025">August 2025</a>, and then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762883/analogue-3d-delay-q4-2025">sometime in Q4 2025</a>. Last month Analogue confirmed the 3D was<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/801174/analogue-3d-4k-nintendo-n64-console-q4-2025-shipping"> still on target to ship in Q4 2025</a>, but yesterday the company finally locked down November 18th, 2025 as the console’s official ship date.</p><p>If you’ve been dragging your feet on preordering the Analogue 3D until you were confident it would ship, you’re unfortunately now out of luck as both the white and black versions are listed as sold out on the company’s online store. However, Analogue has expanded production runs of its previous consoles, and has released several versions of the Analogue Pocket in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24236829/analogue-pocket-handheld-gaming-game-boy-color">different colors</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/12/24197135/analogue-pocket-aluminum">finishes</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/819903/analogue-3d-nintendo-64-console-ship-date-november-18]]></content:encoded>
