            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278781/overwatch-2-season-14-6v6-test<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard is <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24151413/director-s-take-continuing-the-6v6-discussion/">bringing back 6v6 matches</a> in testing for <em>Overwatch 2</em> when it launches its next season in December. The company had previously switched the series to a 5v5 format, and Blizzard is now trying these tests to find how it can “make the core game even stronger” through a balanced new version of the classic 6v6 mode that lets each team have multiple tank characters once again.</p><p>Game director Aaron Keller says Blizzard knows the 5v5 format appealed to and brought in a new group of players, and developers are hoping to repeat that success with the addition of 6v6 (which won’t replace current formats). For a detailed write-up of what’s changing, you can read <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24151413/director-s-take-continuing-the-6v6-discussion/">the full director’s take</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24206210/overwatch-2-six-player-team-multiplayer-test">In July</a>, Keller noted some of the issues 6v6 faced were hero balancing, game performance, and how to make sure players can still get into games quickly if it splits the population between 5v5 and 6v6 game modes. One hero balancing change includes giving tanks less survivability and making them not as powerful.</p><p><em>Overwatch 2</em> Season 14 will have two different opportunities to try 6v6; the first will use a new “Open Queue” format where each team of six must have at least one of each role (tank, damage, support) and no more than three of any role. You’ll also be able to switch roles on the fly. The second 6v6 test will happen in the middle of the season and will let you have two of each role per team.</p><p>There will also be a 5v5 test in Season 13 in which there will be a maximum of two players in each role, and tanks will be weaker than previously.</p><p>My colleague Richard Lawler, who is an avid player, said <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s change that removed one tank player from each team <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24206210/overwatch-2-six-player-team-multiplayer-test">made the game simpler</a>, but also “made it seem like the outcome of the game depended a little too much on that one role.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
