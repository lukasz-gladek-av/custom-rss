And in <a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/">a statement about the layoffs shared with <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>, Funcom said <em>Dune: Awakening</em> was “the biggest release we’ve had in our 32-year long history of making great games” and “has already shown incredible potential.”</p><p>However, “the transition from development to long-term live operation, while also building towards a major console release next year, will require us to restructure our teams and focus our resources from across projects and studios,” Funcom said. “Unfortunately, this also means having to say goodbye to cherished colleagues.” The company “cannot yet determine the exact impact.”</p><p>The restructuring appears to have impacted The Outsiders. David Goldfarb, founder and studio creative director at The Outsiders, said <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/locust9.bsky.social/post/3m2jumlqlmc2m">on Bluesky</a> that “all of us” at the studio have been affected by the layoffs, meaning that “our 10 year old studio will be closing.” The team is going to “try to continue on in some new form,” he said. “Change is always tough and right now we are all hurting.”</p><p>Funcom didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/793011/funcom-dune-awakening-layoffs-metal-hellsinger-the-outsiders-shutdown]]></content:encoded>
