During the <em>Minecraft</em> Live event over the weekend, Mojang revealed a new update that will seriously transform the way we see the world of <em>Minecraf</em>t.</p><p><a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-vibrant-visuals">Vibrant Visuals</a> is the graphical update players have been waiting for. It’s got dynamic lighting, improved shadows, enhanced water reflections, volumetric fog, changes to underwater visuals, and more. The update is coming soon to <em>Minecraft: Bedrock Edition</em> and will be a toggle-able feature meaning every player will be able to turn it on and off as they wish. </p><p>Mojang shared a video of Vibrant Visuals in action and the difference between what the game looks like now and what it will with the update are subtle but stunning. Sunlight shines through trees and window panes. Shadows elongate or contract with the position of the sun and other light sources. Glowing light in caverns create a darker, spookier vibes along with glowing eyes for spiders, Endermen, and <em>Minecraft</em>’s other menacing creatures.</p><p>Mojang says Vibrant Visuals is still in the testing phase for<em> Bedrock Edition</em>, but that it plans rolling out the update for Java Edition devices soon.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
