When I tried, the game showed a message that says “unable to sign in to your account for online services” and to “please try again later.” I also watched frustrated Twitch streamers who are trying to compete in a scheduled tournament that weren’t able to log in or play games.</p><p>In other updates, Epic said that the login issue also affected two of its other games, <em>Rocket League</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em>” and that it was investigating login errors for titles using Epic Online Services.</p><div><p><em>Fortnite</em> dealt with an extended downtime <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094877/fortnite-down-outage-chapter-5-season-2-update-download">last year</a> during the launch of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24093527/fortnite-chapter-5-season-2-greek-gods-battle-royale">its Greek mythology-themed season</a>.
