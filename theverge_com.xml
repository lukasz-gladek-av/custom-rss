They offer speeds that are nearly as fast as your console’s built-in storage, too, so you don’t need to worry about running into any performance issues like you would if you were to use a traditional external hard drive or other USB-based storage solutions. </p><p>What’s nice, too, is that they support many of the quality-of-life features found on Microsoft’s latest consoles, including the handy Quick Resume function, which allows you to run multiple titles simultaneously and quickly switch between suspended games in an instant. The compact plug-and-play cards are also incredibly easy to install — just insert them into one of the dedicated ports on your console, and you’re all set. </p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->110</span></p><div><p>Western Digital’s storage expansion cards for Xbox Series X / S consoles are speedy, plug-and-play cards that match the performance of the consoles’ onboard SSDs.

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you play <em>Roblox</em> on a Chromebook, things could feel faster soon. Roblox is rolling out an x86 version of the game “built specifically for Chromebooks,” where players can expect “up to 2x faster performance on x86 devices across all your favorite games and experiences,” according to <a href="https://chromeos.dev/en/posts/roblox-takes-flight-literally-on-chromebook">a ChromeOS blog post</a>.</p><p>This will translate to “smoother gameplay, quicker load times, and an overall better Roblox experience,” the blog post says, and it includes a few vague charts to help support that. Frame rates in two popular experiences, <em>Adopt Me</em>! and <em>Brookhaven RP,</em> will increase by 99 percent and 67 percent, respectively, but the post doesn’t include the specific frame rate counts. “While it varies by device, some saw increases of 15 frames per second or more on the same hardware,” Google spokesperson Peter Du tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Load times in those games will apparently be reduced by 54 percent and 55 percent, too, but there aren’t specifics in the post on exactly how many seconds those improvements will shave off.</p><p>The blog post also says that Chromebook players will be able to get a “special Chrome jetpack for your avatar” and an item in <em>Bloxburg</em>, another popular <em>Roblox</em> game. And YouTube Shorts creators can try out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkRfArvrzheW2E7b6SVT7vQ/community?lb=Ugkxkl8CviBbAcyA2JPKHRkOdkkZG-2hAL-K">a new Shorts effect</a> that gives you a <em>Roblox</em>-themed head.</p><p><em><strong>Update, February 27th</strong>: Added a quote from Google.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
