            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/618705/pokemon-legends-z-a-chikorita-tepig-totodile-battles<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/charles-pulliam-moore">Charles Pulliam-Moore</a> <span>is a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Like its predecessor, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> </em>is bringing back three classic starter pokémon to get you started on your next adventure.</p><p>Though <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>will likely introduce a number of new creatures, Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile will be the first three partner pokémon you can choose between as you journey into the depths of Lumiose City. The starters were the stars of the <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>teaser The Pokémon Company debuted during this year’s Pokémon Presents. Details about the game are still sparse, but we now know a little bit more about how its battles will work.</p><p>Like other <em>Pokémon </em>games, you will be able to fight wild pokémon found throughout certain areas, but rather than just launching attacks turn by turn, <em>Legends: Z-A </em>will require players to think strategically about the range moves have and where their monsters are on the battlefield. The video — which focuses on how moves can have different effects and levels of damage depending on a pokémon’s position on the field — makes <em>Legends: Z-A</em>’s battles look a bit like fighting in <em>Diablo</em>. </p><p>The video also emphasizes how, because the game is set entirely in Lumiose, many of the areas where wild pokémon can be found are special locations like alleys and rooftops, where the creatures are learning to cohabitate with humans. Like in <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a></em>, players will be able to catch monsters <em>without </em>battling in some cases by simply throwing pokéballs at them from a distance.</p><p>That mechanic, in particular, should make the game feel much more fluid than <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet, </em>but we won’t know for sure until <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>debuts for the Switch family of systems sometime later this year.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/620196/pokemon-champions-online-pokemon-battles-nintendo-switch-mobile<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>To celebrate the day when Pikachu pika’d his way into our hearts and minds almost <em>30 years ago</em>, The Pokémon Company held a Pokémon Presents showcase highlighting what games and experiences to expect in the coming months. There were updates on <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, a new season of <em>Pokémon Concierge</em>, and a totally new multiplayer gameplay: <em>Pokémon Champions</em>.</p><p>While the reveal was light on the specifics,<em> Champions</em> appears to a game focused solely on battling. Players will be able to import their pokémon from <em>Pokémon Scarlet</em> or <em>Violet</em>, Pokémon Home, and other games into<em> Champions</em> to use in battles against players around the world. There are restrictions, however, on the pokémon you can use. The fine print says that not every pokémon available in Home and elsewhere will be available in <em>Champions</em> and those obtained in <em>Champions</em> cannot be ported back to Home.</p><p>It seems like <em>Champions</em> is a gamified version of the online battle simulators competitive <em>Pokémon</em> players use to test team composition and monster builds. The Pokémon Company was specific in that the game is coming to “the Nintendo Switch family of systems,” indicating this game might make an appearance on the forthcoming Switch 2. It’s also coming to Android and iOS.</p><p><em>Pokémon</em> is a very malleable franchise, able to fit a wide variety of game genres that The Pokémon Company seems keen to experiment with. There was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/18/11259028/pokken-tournament-review-nintendo-wii-i"><em>Pokken Tournament</em></a> for the fighting game community, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590249/pokemon-unite-nintendo-switch-hands-on-esports">Pokémon UNITE</a></em> for the MOBA fans, all the casual co-op and 1v1 experiences in the mainline games, and so much more. (Anybody remember <em>Pokémon Conquest</em>, the strategy RPG that was essentially Pikachu meets <em>Nobunaga’s Ambition</em>?) With <em>Pokémon Champions</em>, The Pokémon Company has found yet another way to reach gamers outside of its core games.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
