That includes the <strong>8BitDo Ultimate</strong> controller, which has dropped to a record low $29.99 ($15 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSP5BB7Y?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/r6ia22zmu2c1t">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-ultimate-wired-controller-for-xbox-and-windows">8BitDo</a>. The DualShock-like <strong>8BitDo Pro 2 </strong>is also on sale<strong> </strong>at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CYZKNSS1?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-pro-2-wired-controller-for-xbox-%E5%A4%8D%E5%88%B6">8BitDo</a> starting at $29.99 (about $15 off), which is only $2 more than the lowest price to date.</p><div><p>The newest 8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox includes Hall effect analog sticks and triggers, plus two rear buttons, customizable mapping and sensitivity, and is also compatible with PC and mobile devices.</p></div><div><p>The latest 8Bitdo Pro 2 wired controller for Xbox and Windows offers a DualShock-like shape and layout with Hall effect triggers and sensors, software customization, and two mappable rear buttons.</p></div><p>8BitDo’s wired Xbox controllers have been on the market for a few years now, so even if you already have one, you may have missed the refreshed Hall effect models. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22966831/8bitdo-ultimate-wired-controller-for-xbox-announced-price-release-date">The older ones</a> have ALPS-based sticks, which are commonly used in the standard controllers that ship with major consoles. They use mechanically moving parts and sensors to read the sticks’ positioning, which can eventually degrade and cause misreads to the point that your in-game characters can move even when you’re not touching the controller.</p><p>Hall effect sticks, instead, use magnetism and the sensors don’t have moving parts, and while they aren’t completely immune to eventually getting stick drift, they should last much longer. That doesn’t mean you can’t still break a controller from excessive sweaty rounds of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337409/marvel-rivals-fantastic-four-season-1-date-trailer"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>. The triggers on both controllers benefit from similar technology and also include dedicated vibration motors.</p><p>The 8BitDo Ultimate and 8BitDo Pro 2 offer other perks that are nice to have at this price point, too, like dual rear buttons, software-based remapping (the 8BitDo Ultimate supports on-the-fly switching between three profiles using a dedicated button), and configurable sensitivity and vibration settings. In addition to Xbox One, Series X, and Series S, you can also use the controllers on Windows PCs, Android, and iOS devices by plugging them in using the detachable USB-C cable.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
