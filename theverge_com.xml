Previously, he was a freelance writer for Popular Mechanics, Men’s Health, and Esquire.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>We’ve seen Sony’s DualSense Edge discounted on a few occasions this year, and now it’s back on sale ahead of Black Friday as part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/824326/playstation-5-ps5-pro-black-friday-deal-sale-2025">Sony’s ongoing holiday promo</a>. Right now, you can snag the pro-style gamepad in either black or white at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSYFB99D/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PS5-DualSense-Edge-Wireless-Controller%2F1707140316" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fsony-interactive-entertainment-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-for-ps5-pc-mac-mobile-white%2FJXHQ3CJ4RR%2Fsku%2F6532912" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> for around $169 ($30 off), which is just $10 shy of its previous low. The black version of the DualSense Edge is seldom discounted by this much, so now’s a good time to pick one up if you prefer the stealthier look.</p><p>If you spend a lot of time gaming on the PlayStation 5, the DualSense Edge elevates the experience by offering more customization than Sony’s standard DualSense controller. For starters, its deep software integration with the PS5 lets you create up to four profiles, each with customization options for button mapping, stick sensitivity, and assigning commands to the rear buttons. You can create separate profiles for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/784888/ghost-of-yotei-review-ps5"><em>Ghost of Yōtei</em></a> and <em>Arc Raiders</em>, for instance, and swap between them on the fly without having to leave your game.</p><p>In addition to custom profiles, the DualSense Edge lets you adjust the feel of the triggers (L2 and R2), so you can tailor them to specific play styles and games. You can set the triggers to be more sensitive for online shooters like <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, or less sensitive for racing games to achieve smoother acceleration and braking. Moreover, the Edge makes it easy to swap out stick modules in case one stops working.</p><p>As much as we enjoy how much you can customize the DualSense Edge, though, it’s not without its faults. In his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23564531/sony-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-ps5-features-review">review</a>, <em>The Verge</em>’s Cameron Faulkner found that the controller averaged only about eight hours of battery life on a full charge, which is worse than the standard DualSense controller. It does, however, come with a long charging cable that can lock into the controller, preventing it from accidentally being yanked out.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzE5"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandon Russell</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/822252/sony-dualsense-edge-controller-black-friday-deal-sale-2025]]></content:encoded>
