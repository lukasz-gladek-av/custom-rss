            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span id="follow-author-standard_article_details-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></p> <p><span>is an editor covering deals and gaming hardware. He joined in 2018, and after a two-year stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <strong>MX Master 4</strong> is Logitech’s latest wireless mouse in the MX series, featuring <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/787339/logitech-mx-master-4-mouse-haptics-specs-features-price">a new haptics-equipped thumb grip</a> that can provide tactile feedback while multitasking. It <em>just</em> launched last week at $119.99, but <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsearchpage.jsp%3Fid%3Dpcat17071%26st%3Dmx%2Bmaster%2B4" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> has it available in multiple color schemes for $89.99. You don’t need me to tell you that this is a fantastic deal, given that it’s an improvement on the already-great (and, as of now, slightly pricier) MX Master 3S that came out in 2022.</p><p>The haptics implemented in the MX Master 4 may not unlock a new paradigm of productivity for you (clicking in the haptics-equipped thumb rest opens up the Actions Ring, which has been available for some time on past products), but it’s nice to have. One setting that I particularly like allows the device to buzz when your pointer floats from one monitor to the next, which is handy for keeping track of its location.</p><p>Other improvements include the USB-C Bolt transmitter in the box, with which other Logitech devices can link through. Its design is mostly unchanged, but its plastic feels like it’ll last longer than the soft-touch shell on the MX Master 3S.</p><div><p id="other-deals-youll-dig"><h2>Other deals you’ll dig</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>The <strong>Playdate</strong> is a funky gaming handheld. In case you haven’t heard of it before, it’s a tiny gadget that operates with two buttons, a D-pad, and a crank. Yep, a crank, much like you’d find on a fishing pole. It’s a design choice that has led to an eclectic catalog of games, most of which you won’t find anywhere else. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/789734/game-consoles-too-expensive">Consoles are expensive right now</a>, and this one’s no exception. However, Panic (maker of Playdate and publisher of several games) is hosting a <a href="https://play.date/shop/fall-bundle/">fall bundle</a> that includes two Playdate consoles and two covers for $449. It’s a discount of $77 — they’re typically $249 each, including the cover. We’ve been extensively following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23733264/panic-playdate-handheld-gameboy-season-one-two">the rollout of Playdate games here</a>.</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>In case you’ve been wanting to increase the storage size of your Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally on the cheap, you can do just that at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1835939-REG%2Fcrucial_ct2000p310ssd2_p310_2tb_pcie_gen4.html" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H Photo</a> with its deal on <strong>Crucial’s 2TB 2230-sized SSD</strong>. Originally $239.99, it’s down to $121.99 for a limited time. While some newer gaming handhelds (including the Asus ROG Xbox Ally) can utilize the full-size M2 2280 SSDs, this is a great, inexpensive options for ones that can only accommodate the tinier size.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/792702/logitech-mx-master-4-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
