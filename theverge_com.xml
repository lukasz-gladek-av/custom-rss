            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> is coming to macOS later this week, after it was originally set to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283651/cyberpunk-2077-launch-mac">debut in early 2025</a>. <em>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</em> will officially be available for Apple silicon devices for the first time on July 17th, from Apple’s own Mac App Store, Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG.com.</p><p>CD Projekt Red has optimized <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> for a variety of Mac hardware, all the way from the early M1 models up to the latest M4 chip family. Only some M1 and M2 Macs are supported, though — you’ll need a Mac with 16GB or more of unified memory to play <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, so base 8GB M1 and M2 chips won’t be compatible.</p><p>There will be graphics presets that are optimized for each Apple silicon model, and more powerful Apple silicon chips will also fully support <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/23/23653237/cyberpunk-2077-overdrive-mode-full-ray-tracing-path-tracing">features like path tracing</a>, which is a film-like full ray tracing mode that greatly improves lighting and occlusion in the game.</p><p>AMD’s FSR upscaling and frame generation will also be available in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on Mac, helping the game feel more smooth with options like path tracing enabled. There will be MetalFX upscaling, too, alongside support for Apple’s Magic Mouse and Trackpad hardware.</p><p>Apple and CD Projekt Red haven’t shared performance data for what to expect across different Apple silicon Mac configurations. If you own an Apple XDR display, or any other HDR monitor, you’ll get HDR support in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and there’s even spatial audio and head-tracking with Apple AirPods.</p><p>Mac owners have technically been able to run <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on their devices for a couple years now, thanks to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/7/23752164/apple-mac-gaming-game-porting-toolkit-windows-games-macos">Apple’s own Proton-like game porting tool</a>. This official release means the game takes full advantage of Apple silicon and Apple’s native Metal graphics APIs, including its Tile-Based Deferred Rendering (TBDR) architecture.</p><p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> debuts on Mac just as CD Projekt Red releases the latest 2.3 patch for the game, which includes additional cars and new photo mode features. The game will support cross progression across all platforms and includes the <em>Phantom Liberty</em> expansion and all of the major updates to the game so far.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/707106/cyberpunk-2077-mac-release-date]]></content:encoded>
