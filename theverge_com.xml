The gaming-focused voice and chat app announced that a mobile pilot for Video Quests — ads that allow Discord users to earn rewards like avatar decorations and in-game items by watching a video — will launch in June 2025, after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/30/24116761/discords-sponsored-quests-are-coming-next-week">rolling out on PC and consoles last year</a>.</p><p>”Expanding our advertising platform to mobile is an obvious, natural evolution in our strategy,” said Discord’s product leader, Peter Sellis. “Our mission is to create the most authentic, player-centric advertising platform in the galaxy. This expansion will provide brand partners access to Discord’s highly engaged, cross-platform mobile audience — and create new opportunities for businesses to connect with our community in meaningful, and performant, ways.”</p><p>The new mobile ads don’t seem particularly intrusive — they will appear as a “Quest bar” at the bottom of the screen, which can be dismissed or tapped on to open the dedicated Quest tab. The full-screen videos will only then play if a user chooses to accept the Quest.</p><p>Discord already allows users on other platforms to <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/22225719947543-Discord-Quests-FAQ#h_01HVPBZR5FZ4PEXTW08Q4RYP41">hide in-app promotions for specific Quests</a>, or opt out of personalized promotions. These options will also be available for mobile users.</p><p>Video Quests are one of two Quest formats that Discord launched last year, the other being Play Quests, which reward players for completing in-game tasks. Discord had gained a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/01/983159051/why-does-discord-not-use-ads-and-why-is-microsoft-interested-we-asked-discords-c">reputation for being an ad-free platform</a> prior to introducing Quests, having instead relied on user subscriptions to bring in revenue. Mobile Quest ads were already being tested in a limited beta, but this rollout suggests they will now start appearing more broadly.</p><p>The announcement of mobile ads comes amid rumors that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/technology/discord-ipo.html">Discord is preparing to launch an initial public offering</a>. The company was last valued at roughly $15 billion by private investors in 2021, and had reportedly discussed a $10 billion acquisition deal with Microsoft that same year that ultimately didn’t materialize anything.</p><p><em><strong>Update, March 20th:</strong> added confirmation about ad settings for mobile users.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
