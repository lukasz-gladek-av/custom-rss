            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/677230/valorant-unreal-engine-5-replays-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Riot Games is planning to switch <em>Valorant</em>, its popular first-person tactical hero shooter, over to Unreal Engine 5 in July. The engine upgrade from Unreal Engine 4 is part of a number of new changes coming to the shooter over the coming months, including a replay system in September.</p><p><em>Valorant </em>has been running on Unreal Engine 4 since a beta of the game originally released in 2020, and Riot Games has been using Unreal 4 for more than 10 years to build the game. The upgrade to Unreal 5 will arrive with patch 11.02 at the end of July, and Riot is promising it shouldn’t disrupt gameplay.</p><p>The game’s overall look and feel should be similar, and Riot says the engine upgrade will improve framerate performance and make patch downloads faster in the future. It’ll be interesting to see what else this engine upgrade unlocks, particularly whether Riot will improve character models and animations in the future. <em>Valorant </em>players that log in while patch 11.02 is live will get a special gun buddy to commemorate the upgrade.</p><p>The second big upgrade coming to <em>Valorant </em>later this year is the long-requested replay system. It will arrive on PC first with patch 11.06 in September, followed by a release on console later this year. The replay system will let you analyze recently played competitive games at launch, and Riot is looking at adding more modes later.</p><p>The replay system should help players report cheating or bad player behavior in <em>Valorant</em>, and Riot is also adding multi-factor authentication to the game to help with smurfing in the competitive modes — where higher ranked players log into accounts to boost them. You’ll also soon be able to report accounts that are abusing rank or matchmaking.</p><p><em>Valorant</em>’s upcoming 11.0 patch later this month will also add a new map to the game, and it will be available in the competitive mode on day one. During the initial patch cycle of two weeks, rank rating (RR) losses on this new map will be cut by 50 percent while <em>Valorant </em>players get used to playing this new map.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The microSD card you used in your original Switch or Switch Lite will offer limited functionality with Nintendo’s new handheld, as it will only let you view screenshots or video clips you captured previously — that’s it.</p><p>That’s because Nintendo opted for a significantly faster spec in its new handheld console, which boasts an advertised 4.4x improvement in terms of transfer speeds over the microSD cards you might already have lying around. That improvement is signified by a small, easy-to-miss “EX” emblem etched onto the front of the card.</p><p>What’s harder to miss is how much more expensive Express cards are, with some costing more than $50 for just 256GB of storage. The Switch 2 supports microSD Express cards up to 2TB in size, although 1TB is the largest capacity widely available (that’s an overstatement, as many are sold out currently), with some cards selling for up to $200 a pop. Phew. I suppose it makes sense that they’re pricier since they’re classified as bonafide PCIe NVMe SSDs by the <a href="https://www.sdcard.org/pdf/SD_Cards_8_0_WhitePaper20200515.pdf">SD Association</a>. Walmart’s Onn label is a beacon of light, as its microSD Express cards are significantly cheaper than the competition, with its <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FONN-MICRO-SD-EXPRESS%2F15708762625" rel="sponsored">512GB model costing $65.88</a> when it’s in stock.</p><p>Thankfully, since the Switch 2 has 256GB of built-in storage, you most likely won’t need a microSD Express card immediately upon receiving your console. Getting a microSD card was a rite of passage with the original Switch since all versions, aside from the newer OLED edition that launched in 2021, came with just 32GB.</p><p>If you’re in the market for one of these pricier storage expansion cards ahead of the console’s launch, we’ve listed the available options below.</p><div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->60</span></p><div><p>Available to pre-order, launching June 5th.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->55</span></p><div><p>Available to pre-order, launching June 5th.</p></div></div></div></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This lets you get it on either platform for $33.99. We previously saw the game discounted by an additional $2 pre-launch, but this is currently the best price available.</p><p><em>Nightreign </em>seems like more of everything that was already great about <em>Elden Ring</em>, plus the ability to squad up with up to three players to cooperatively take on treacherous enemies and bosses. The game utilizes procedural generation to alter some of the base game’s locales. So, don’t let familiarity get to your head to the point that you’re trying to take this adventure on alone (I’m talking to you, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/14/23025610/elden-ring-pc-let-me-solo-her-malenia-boss">let me solo her</a>); both its difficulty and tuning weren’t exactly made with solo players in mind.

Sure, it doesn’t have some of the new models’ most appealing features, like person detection, higher video resolution (1440p versus 1080p), or a wider field-of-view, but it’s still worth considering if you’re trying to save money. It uses two AA batteries instead of three in the new model. And, if you want longer battery life, plus the ability to sync extra Blink devices at home, you can opt for the <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SGC46M9?ref=ods_ucc_vicc_vdfs_en_t&amp;tag=theverge02-20">$34.99 Blink Video Doorbell bundle</a> that includes the Sync Module 2.

For $24, you can get 25 comics and graphic novels, including nine volumes of <em>The Witcher</em>, <em>The Witcher: Ronin</em> manga, eight volumes of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, plus multiple art books. One of the most fascinating inclusions is a 1993 comic of <em>The Witcher</em>, which has the first-ever visual representation of Geralt of Rivia. Proceeds from your purchase will go to Special Effect, a UK-based charity that gives to gamers with disabilities.</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>If you plan to buy a bunch of <strong>Switch 2 games and accessories</strong>, welcome to the club.
