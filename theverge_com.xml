            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/602619/netflix-2025-release-dates-tv-film-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-webster">Andrew Webster</a> <span>is an entertainment editor covering streaming, virtual worlds, and every single Pokémon video game. Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One month into the year and Netflix is ready to detail its plans for 2025 — or at least, some of them. In a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/1/24056196/netflix-2024-tv-streaming-schedule-squid-game-arcane-3-body-problem">now-annual</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24057435/netflix-2024-movies-release-dates">tradition</a>, the streamer has outlined some of its biggest releases across film, television, and gaming.</p><p>And while plenty of the listed titles were already known, there are also some pleasant surprises. The movie lineup looks particularly strong, with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/24/24163962/knives-out-sequel-wake-up-dead-man-release-date-netflix">Wake Up Dead Man</a></em> — the next <em>Knives Out </em>mystery, following <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23349099/glass-onion-a-knives-out-mystery-review-netflix-tiff-2022">Glass Onion</a></em> — and Guillermo del Toro’s take on <em>Frankenstein</em> both due out later this year. Meanwhile, some of the streamer’s most important properties are coming to an end with the final seasons of both <em>Stranger Things</em> (which still doesn’t have a premiere date) and <em>Squid Game</em> (which now does).</p><p>And while <em>Stranger Things</em> is ending, its creators, the Duffer brothers, did detail two projects they will have coming to Netflix in 2026: <em>The Boroughs</em> and <em>Something Very Bad Is Going to Happen</em>. (They also hinted that there are some <em>Stranger Things</em> spinoffs in the works, without getting into detail.)</p><p>As for what to expect this year, here are the highlights:</p><div><p id="film"><h2>Film</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><em>The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep</em> — February 11th</span></li><li><span><em>Plankton: The Movie</em> — March 7th</span></li><li><span><em>The Electric State </em>— March 14th</span></li><li><span><em>The Old Guard 2</em> — July 2nd</span></li><li><span><em>Fear Street: Prom Queen</em> — summer</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span><em>Frankenstein</em> — November</span></li><li><span><em>Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery</em> — fall</span></li><li><span><em>RIP</em> — fall</span></li><li><span><em>Happy Gilmore 2</em> — 2025</span></li><li><span><em>K-Pop: Demon Hunters</em> — 2025</span></li></ul></div><div><p id="tv"><h2>TV</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><em>Cobra Kai</em> season 6 (part 3) — February 13th</span></li><li><span><em>Zero Day</em> — February 20th</span></li><li><span><em>Devil May Cry</em> — April 3rd</span></li><li><span><em>You</em> season 5 — April 24th</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span><em>Squid Game</em> season 3 — June 27th</span></li><li><span><em>Black Mirror</em> season 7 — 2025</span></li><li><span><em>Department Q</em> — 2025</span></li><li><span><em>The Sandman</em> season 2 — 2025</span></li><li><span><em>Stranger Things </em>season 5 — 2025</span></li><li><span><em>The Witcher</em> season 4 — 2025</span></li><li><span><em>Wayward</em> — 2025</span></li><li><span><em>Wednesday</em> season 2 — 2025</span></li></ul></div><div><p id="games"><h2>Games</h2></p></div><p>While the lineup of (announced) games coming to Netflix is fairly small, there are two notable highlights: a mobile version of <em>WWE 2K</em> this fall to go along with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337368/wwe-offers-a-nostalgic-look-back-at-its-past-before-raws-netflix-debut">the new deal between the two</a>, and more Netflix Stories games (Netflix’s branding for interactive fiction) based on series like <em>Ginny &amp; Georgia, Sweet Magnolias, Love Is Blind, </em>and<em> Outer Banks</em>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/602963/nvidia-dlss-4-game-ready-driver-release<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia is launching its next-gen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">RTX 5090</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/598045/nvidia-rtx-5080-review-test-benchmark">RTX 5080</a> GPUs today, but it’s also releasing an exciting update for existing RTX GPU owners. A new GPU driver (572.16) allows you to force DLSS 4 inside games or apps that don’t currently support it, providing improved image quality and even less VRAM usage in some cases.</p><p>While DLSS 4 is debuting today in 75 games and apps, the Nvidia app now has a new override feature that will improve image quality in games that use DLSS by allowing you to switch to Nvidia’s new transformer model. This means you don’t have to wait on developers to update their games. Owners of RTX 40-series GPUs will also get access to a new frame generation model that is 40 percent faster and uses 30 percent less VRAM than the old one.</p><p>Nvidia has also updated its RTX Video Super Resolution (VSR) feature, which can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/28/23618245/nvidia-rtx-video-super-resolution-upscale-videos-rtx-gpu">upscale old blurry YouTube videos</a>, to a new and more efficient model. It now uses 30 percent fewer GPU resources on the highest-quality setting, allowing more RTX GPUs to enable this feature. VSR will also now upscale HDR video, so if you’re watching lower-resolution HDR videos, these can now be automatically upscaled.</p><p>While existing RTX owners will get access to more efficient models, those looking to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/601473/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-gpu-preorder-buy-price-release-date-availability-founders-edition">purchase RTX 50-series cards today</a> will also be able to enable DLSS Multi Frame Generation. This new feature builds on top of Frame Generation by generating three additional frames per traditionally rendered frame.</p><p>In our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">RTX 5090</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/598045/nvidia-rtx-5080-review-test-benchmark">RTX 5080 reviews</a>, we found that Multi Frame Generation is a promising addition but only works well if your base frame rate after DLSS Super Resolution is applied is high. Otherwise, even if your base 30fps after Super Resolution gets boosted beyond 100fps, it will still have the input latency of a 30fps game.</p><p>Nvidia also surprised potential RTX 50-series owners with a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fnvidia-app-update-dlss-overrides-and-more%2F%23nvidia-smooth-motion" rel="sponsored">new Smooth Motion feature</a> in today’s driver update. It’s a driver-based AI model that enables “smoother gameplay by inferring an additional frame between two rendered frames” for games without DLSS Frame Generation support. Nvidia says Smooth Motion is exclusive to the RTX 50-series and can be applied to games running with DLSS Super Resolution, at native resolution, or even titles with other upscaling technologies and it will typically double “the perceived frame rate.”</p><div><p>You can download Nvidia’s new <a href="https://us.download.nvidia.com/Windows/572.16/572.16-desktop-win10-win11-64bit-international-dch-whql.exe">572.16 drivers directly here</a> or use the Nvidia app to get the latest release.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
