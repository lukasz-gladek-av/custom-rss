Team Cherry calls it the game’s “first big expansion.”</p><p>“New areas, bosses, tools, and more!” Team Cherry <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025">says in a blog post</a>. “Hornet’s adventures continue in our nautically themed expansion, coming free for all players next year. We’ll keep further details a secret for now, but expect additional info shortly before <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong - Sea of Sorrow</em> releases.”</p><p>More than 7 million people bought <em>Silksong</em>, according to Team Cherry, and “millions more” played on Xbox Game Pass.</p><p>The original <em>Hollow Knight</em> is getting updated, too. Team Cherry is working on a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of the game that “incorporates all the updates and enhancements that Silksong received on the platform: High frame-rate modes, higher resolutions, and many additional graphical effects.” Players who own the Switch version of the game will get the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition as a free update when it’s available in 2026.</p><p>Ahead of that launch, Team Cherry says it will be “updating all versions of the original game for current platforms, adding features and fixing bugs.” Those changes include “full 16:10 and 21:9 aspect ratio support for those of you with Steam Decks or ultrawide monitors,” and PC players can try the new updates <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/367520/discussions/0/705506553887849293/">in public beta</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/845189/hollow-knight-silksong-sea-of-sorrow-dlc-expansion-switch-2]]></content:encoded>
