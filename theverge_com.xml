            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/681568/ifixit-nintendo-switch-2-repairability<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After retroactively <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678622/ifixit-nerfs-nintendo-switch-repair-score-battery-drift">lowering the original Nintendo Switch’s repairability score</a> from an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/4/14813838/ifixits-teardown-nintendo-switch">8 out of 10</a> to just 4 out of 10 to reflect 2025 standards, iFixit has found the Switch 2 to be even harder to fix. Following its <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/110926/switch-2-teardown">full teardown of the new console</a>, iFixit is giving the Switch 2 a 3 out of 10 repairability score thanks, in part, to a battery that’s once again “glued in with powerful adhesive” and flash storage modules and USB-C ports that are soldered to the main board.</p><p>Nintendo continues to rely on the tri-point screws the company has been using to assemble its consoles and handhelds for decades, and on the Switch 2, many are hidden behind stickers that get damaged in the process of removing them to access the screws. The company has never released repair parts or manuals for the original Switch, and there are currently none available for the Switch 2, so you’ll need third-party alternatives to reassemble the console.</p><p>Components like the headphone jack, speakers, microphone, and microSD reader on the Switch 2 are easy to remove. As are buttons that are soldered to breakout boards, and the console’s cooling fan that’s held in place by three screws.</p><p>But iFixit describes removing the Switch 2’s battery as an “absolute mission” and “just as bad as the original Switch.” Lots of isopropyl alcohol and a “whole set of pry tools” were needed to remove it, and in the process the foam Nintendo glued to the battery was left disintegrated making a future battery swap a difficult and messy endeavor. </p><p>The Switch 2’s gamecard reader, which was modular and relatively easy to remove and replace in the original Switch and Switch OLED models, is now soldered to the console’s mainboard as it is on Switch Lite. iFixit also found three different types of thermal paste used in the Switch 2 which in the original Switch would solidify over time making it hard to remove and less effective at preventing the console from overheating.</p><p>Even the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/681274/ifixit-nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-teardown-potentiometer-joystick">new Joy-Cons on the Switch 2 are harder to disassemble</a>, which is problematic because the joysticks are using the same potentiometer technology as the original Joy-Cons that rely on a resistive material that can wear away over time. That’s one of the causes of the original Switch’s notorious joystick drift issue and this time around it’s going to be even harder to do repairs or replace the sticks altogether with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/22/23566353/switch-joy-con-drift-solution-nintendo-gulikit">Hall effect</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">TMR alternatives</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/681361/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-edition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Last night, I stayed up way too late playing through the Great Plateau section of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em>, and I’m falling in love with the game all over again.</p><p>The opening moments of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> are iconic. The wide shot of Hyrule you see after leaving that first cave is breathtaking, showing you the world of possibilities ahead. Solving the puzzles on the Great Plateau requires some real creativity and experimentation, especially to survive the colder parts of the area. All of that magic is still there with the Switch 2 version of the game, which you can get as a $9.99 upgrade if you already own the Switch version or as a standalone $69.99 purchase, but it all plays better.</p><p>As far as I could tell, the frame rate stayed at a steady 60fps no matter where I went in my initial explorations, which makes the game feel much smoother and more responsive. That was nice for my skirmishes with the Great Plateau’s Bokoblins; they’re basic enemies, but I liked sparring with them at the faster frame rate all the same. The game also has a higher resolution on Switch 2, and while the graphics aren’t improved too dramatically from the original game, I thought the Switch 2 version looked great on my 4K TV. (I did notice things like grass or rocks popping in as I got close to them, though.)</p><p>Best of all, the load times are <em>much</em> faster, which could be the improvement that really makes the Switch 2 version worth it. On the original Switch, the load times weren’t too bad, but they would regularly force you to pause as you waited for the next area to load. On the Switch 2, it felt like I was loading into shrines or a fast-travel point with only a brief delay, and over the course of an entire playthrough, those shorter loads will add up.</p><p>In my initial testing, the Zelda Notes companion app’s navigation tool (found within the Nintendo Switch app) also seems like it could be a big time-saver. The feature functions like a GPS for all sorts of things you can discover, including shrines, towers, enemies, and even Korok seeds. I opened it up, picked a Korok seed that was apparently near me, and the app guided me toward it by showing my position on the map in the app and telling me what direction to go. It even nudged me to climb upward, which was helpful because I happened to pick the Korok that’s found on the highest spire of the Temple of Time.</p><p>The navigation feature arguably takes away from the self-guided exploration that makes <em>Breath of the Wild</em> so special. Since it’s an optional feature, though, I don’t think it takes away from the experience too much — especially since it requires booting up an entirely separate app on a separate device, so you have to do some work to get it up and running. If you’re playing through the game on the Switch 2 for the first time, I’d recommend that you don’t use it. But if you want to find every single Korok seed, it could be a lifesaver.</p><p>What surprised me most with my first couple hours with the Switch 2 version of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> was that I was getting into its captivating loop all over again. Even though I’ve played through the game multiple times on the original Switch, I still found myself darting around the Great Plateau to take on random camps of baddies, diving into a pond to get a Korok that I knew was hidden there, and marking shrines and towers on my map. On the Switch 2, it’s all much more refined, making it an excellent way to play one of Nintendo’s best games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
