While there is “no evidence of any exploitation of the vulnerability, nor has there been any impact on users or customers,” Unity already has fixes available to developers, <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/unity-platform-protection-take-immediate-action-to-protect-your-games-and-apps/1688031">according to a post from Larry Hryb</a>, aka “Major Nelson.”</p><p>Specifically, developers need to take action if “you have developed and released a game or application using Unity 2017.1 or later for Windows, Android, or macOS,” Hryb says. Unity’s “platform partners” have also “taken further steps to secure their platforms and protect end users.”</p><p>Valve already released <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/507340830949770871">a new version of Steam</a> that adds mitigations for the exploit, and “for Windows, Microsoft Defender has been updated and will detect and block the vulnerability,” Hryb says. Google and Meta have taken steps as well, according to Hyrb. There are “no findings to suggest” that the vulnerability can be exploited on iOS, visionOS, tvOS, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, UWP, Quest, and WebGL.</p><p>According to the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) record <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59489">about the exploit</a>, “if an application was built with a version of Unity Editor that had the vulnerable Unity Runtime code, then an adversary may be able to execute code on, and exfiltrate confidential information from, the machine on which that application is running.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/791609/unity-security-exploit-developers-update-games]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/791438/hori-wireless-horipad-turbo-nintendo-switch-2-controller</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hori%E2%80%99s-new-switch-2-controller-lets-you-deactivate-its-home-and-screenshot-buttons.1316080/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Hori has announced another addition to the ever-growing list of cheaper alternatives to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">Nintendo’s $90 Switch 2 Pro Controller</a>. The Wireless Horipad Turbo is around $35 cheaper than Nintendo’s, and while it lacks a lot of premium features such as Amiibo support and the ability to remotely wake the Switch 2, it adds a lock button on the back that disables the buttons in the middle of the controller. That includes the Home and Screenshot shortcuts so they won’t do anything if accidentally pressed in the middle of a game.</p><p>The Wireless Horipad Turbo is currently <a href="https://horistore.com/shop/g/gnsx-126/">available for preorder in Japan through Hori’s online store</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0FRM1SR6Z?th=1">Amazon Japan</a> for 7,980 yen, or about $54, in mist black, aquasian, shine yellow, frost white, and ruby magenta color options. It’s expected to launch before the year is out. There are no details on when or if it may see a US release, or if pricing will be comparable if it does, but it will be compatible with all versions of the Switch.</p><p>Aside from the use of translucent housing, the Horipad Turbo looks very similar to Nintendo’s Switch 2 Pro Controller, including the game chat button located between the D-pad and right analog joystick. Hori has opted for drift-resistant <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">tunneling magnetoresistance</a> (TMR) joysticks instead of Hall effect or capacitive options, which alone could make it more appealing than Nintendo’s gamepad. But the company has also skipped other features, including a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p><p>You will find an extra set of buttons on the back of the Horipad Turbo, and the company has gone the extra mile by allowing you to remap the functionality of the action, shoulder, and trigger buttons, as well as the D-pad and joysticks. You can even reprogram a single button to replicate the functionality of two others simultaneously, and you can activate rapidfire using an additional button on the front of the gamepad featuring the red, white, and blue Hori logo.</p><p>The lock button on the back of the Horipad Turbo can be toggled between disabling the Hori, Home, and Screenshot buttons. There’s also an option that locks the plus and minus buttons, ensuring you won’t pop into a menu screen at an inopportune time with an accidental press.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/791438/hori-wireless-horipad-turbo-nintendo-switch-2-controller]]></content:encoded>
