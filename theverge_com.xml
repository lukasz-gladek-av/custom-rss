            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/656552/clair-obscur-expedition-33-battles<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> has flashy, thrilling battles, but the best thing about them is how you can twist the game’s many systems to your advantage. The turn-based RPG combat might feel familiar, but it offers a lot of ways to customize your approach to battles so that you can do absolutely devastating amounts of damage.</p><p>In <em>Expedition 33,</em> you play as a group of Expeditioners who aim to destroy The Paintress, a mysterious being that erases everyone of a certain age every year. In battles, you can have up to three of your party participating in a fight, and should they all die, you can call in your teammates who are in reserve to try and finish off the enemies. </p><p>To show you how deep the rabbit hole can go in customizing your team, here’s my approach to building out just one character, the fencer Maelle. Every character can equip three “Pictos,” which offer passive buffs like giving you the defense-boosting Shell status at the start of a fight. But after you win a few fights with a Pictos equipped, other characters can <em>also</em> equip the Pictos as a “Lumina” by using “Lumina Points,” which you accumulate through leveling up and by using a resource you can find in the game.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Kepler Interactive</cite></p></div><p>When you mix and match Pictos and Luminas to stack complimentary bonuses, things really get going. For my version of Maelle, I set a combination of Pictos and Luminas that could let her deal potentially enormous amounts of damage, especially if a lucky critical hit and a coin-flip 200 percent damage buff went through. But as a counterbalance to Maelle’s huge power, some of the Pictos and Luminas also increased the amount of damage she <em>received</em>, so I added defensive ones that helped her better withstand hits.</p><p>In battle, each character also has a unique mechanic that, when used properly, lets you make their attacks more effective. Maelle, for example, relies on different “stances” that you can shift into: an offensive stance that increases the damage you give but also the damage you receive, a defensive stance that reduces the damage you take, and a “virtuous” stance that does 200 percent damage but can be harder to set up.</p><p>With Maelle, you can move into the different stances based on which of your six different “skills” you use in battle — and like with Pictos and Luminas, those are also customizable and have their own traits and potential synergies. </p><p>It can be a lot to manage, and the game often helps in battles by adding a little sparkle to suggest a move for your current situation. But even within the first few hours of the game, I was able to grasp the potential of what was possible with the battle system. And with Maelle, when I nailed the combination of setting up the right stance and a lucky break from my Pictos and Luminas, I regularly could absolutely demolish my foes by dealing thousands of points of damage. (A late-game Pictos that let me exceed 9,999 points of damage in a single hit was particularly welcome.)</p><p>That’s just my approach with one character; each of the other party members has their own playstyles to experiment with and potential skills to use. Your equipped weapons are an element to consider, too. The game shines when everyone’s abilities and skills line up perfectly for a series of explosive hits, and it’s especially satisfying when things come together to melt down a tricky boss’s health bar.</p><p>I definitely didn’t use <em>Expedition 33</em>’s battle system, which makes things easy to experiment with, to its fullest. Once I found a combination of characters and skills that I liked, I rarely deviated from them. But I have lots of ideas on how to try things differently for a hard mode run — I’m sure there are a lot more ways to absolutely break the game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/656284/bionic-bay-review-ps5-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Wandering through <em>Bionic Bay</em>’s dark alien world is unsettling and awe-inspiring. There are massive structures with no clear purpose and autonomous factories filled with whirring saw blades and devastating lasers. It’s grim and unforgiving, with little light and harsh shadows that give everything a sinister tone. But then you step on a bomb and your character bounces off of walls like a pinball, and you realize it’s a game of contrasts.</p><p><em>Bionic Bay</em> is a curious blend of two very different genres. On the one hand, it’s an atmospheric side-scrolling adventure in the mold of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/28/12050342/inside-review-xbox-one-steam"><em>Inside</em></a> and <em>Limbo</em>, filled with disturbingly stunning environments to explore. At the same time, it’s a hard-as-nails platformer like <em>Super Meat Boy</em>, with elaborate physics that will have you dying repeatedly while trying to find the best route through deadly obstacles. Somehow, the disparate vibes come together surprisingly well.</p><p>What first drew me to <em>Bionic Bay</em> was that dark world. It’s mysterious to the point that I still don’t actually know what it is you’re doing or why. But that mystery is a large part of the appeal. As you make your way through its levels, you’re subject to some incredible and intimidating environments, and it’s largely up to you to figure out what story the world is trying to tell. There are fiery factories, green areas where organic life merges with technology and architecture in disturbing ways, and dank sewers lit up by dripping bioluminescent goo. All of these spaces make you feel minuscule in comparison. It’s the kind of game where almost every moment makes for a great screenshot.</p><p>In order to see it all, though, you have to deal with a very tough game. While there is some relatively simple platforming at first, you’re soon presented with seemingly insurmountable tasks, like a series of spinning saw blades that require exacting jumps to get through. But it’s not as precise as it may seem. One of the more unique elements of <em>Bionic Bay</em> is its physics; the little guy you control is very sturdy and can survive being bounced around, so you can sometimes flop your way through trickier areas.</p><p><em>Bionic Bay</em> is also something of a puzzle game. You have access to multiple powers, like the ability to swap places with an inanimate object or slow down time (though you can only actively be using one). Combine these tools with the floppy physics and there are a lot of creative ways to get through the game.</p><p>Key to this is that <em>Bionic Bay</em> encourages experimentation. You will die a lot, but because the game has such a forgiving checkpoint system, there’s rarely much punishment for failure. Being able to quickly retry a jump keeps the game from being too frustrating while also making it easier to find a route that actually works. And if you have a wild idea about, say, riding on the back of a rocket to avoid killer laser beams, there’s no harm in trying.</p><p>The game isn’t easy. I’ve found myself stuck on a few occasions. And while I wish the game focused a little more on exploration, the weird and unforgiving world is also what helped me persevere through the trickier challenges. I just had to see what was next.</p><p>If you’re a fan of sci-fi works like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/19/15663380/blame-netflix-anime-tsutomu-nihei"><em>Blame!</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24086957/dune-part-two-movie-review"><em>Dune</em></a>, with their impressive sense of scale, <em>Bionic Bay</em> offers something very similar. You just have to work hard to see it all.</p><p><sub>Bionic Bay <em>is out now on the PS5 and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
