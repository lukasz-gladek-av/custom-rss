This time, it’s a mobile app called Nintendo Music, which lets users listen to classic gaming tunes from Nintendo games spanning the last few decades, including <em>Splatoon</em>, <em>Animal Crossing,</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. It’s only available to Switch Online subscribers, and it’s launching today on both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nintendo-music/id6466376604">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.znba&amp;hl=en_CA">Android</a>.</p><p>The app features curated playlists themed around games, moments, moods, or characters, though you can also build your own. It also supports streaming as well as downloading tracks for offline listening. Curiously, it includes a spoiler feature that lets you filter out tracks that, somehow, might spoil a game you haven’t played or finished yet. And if you just want some Hyrule white noise, the app also lets you “loop songs or extend select tracks to 15, 30, or 60 minutes for uninterrupted listening.”</p><div><p>Here’s <a href="https://support.m.nintendo.com/hc/en-us/articles/10463992555535-In-which-regions-will-Nintendo-Music-be-available">a list of all the regions</a> the app will be available in.</p></div><div><p>The announcement of Nintendo Music comes not long after a handful of other surprise, non-<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">Switch 2 reveals from Nintendo</a>, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">the launch of an alarm clock</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275596/nintendo-switch-online-beta-playtest-program-leak-mmo">a mysterious MMO that’s currently in testing</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283812/microsoft-q1-2025-earnings-revenue-profits-windows-xbox-gaming-surface<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft’s Q1 2025 earnings are in, and the results show that Microsoft’s software gaming revenues are way up even as Xbox hardware revenue is declining.</p><p>The company says that its Xbox content and services revenue grew 61 percent year over year from the previous quarter — a figure driven by “53 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition,” according to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q1/press-release-webcast">the company’s press release</a>. But hardware revenues again declined, down 29 percent this quarter, which may be influenced by Microsoft’s continued strategy to make its games available <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24073286/xbox-console-exclusivity-hardware-update-game-pass">more widely than just Xbox consoles</a>.</p><p>During the quarter, Microsoft introduced its new Xbox Game Pass “Standard” tier and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24195312/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-increase-standard-subscription">price hike</a> for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Q1 also saw the arrival of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24195537/call-of-duty-xbox-game-pass-modern-warfare-3">on Xbox Game Pass</a>, but this quarter doesn’t include the impact of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24173669/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-october-25th">launched last week</a>. (Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on its earnings call that the game was the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284059/black-ops-6-was-the-biggest-call-of-duty-release-ever">“biggest <em>Call of Duty</em> release ever.”</a>)</p><p>The company’s Intelligent Cloud division was also a bright spot, with total revenues up 20 percent year over year to $24.1 billion driven by Azure. Azure and other cloud services revenue was up 33 percent, “including 12 points” from demand for its AI services. Productivity and Business Processes, which includes its Office products, was up 12 percent year over year to $28.3 billion in revenues. </p><p>Microsoft’s OEM and Devices revenue — which are now reported together — were up 2 percent. However, that figure was driven by “growth in Windows OEM” and “partially offset by a decline in Devices,” Microsoft says.</p><p>Microsoft, like many other companies, is investing heavily in AI-focused <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/16/24246010/microsoft-copilot-pages-multiplayer-ai-business">features and tools</a> right now, especially to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24254032/microsoft-copilot-news-presenter-notepad">improve Copilot</a>. “AI-driven transformation is changing work, work artifacts, and workflow across every role, function, and business process,” Nadella says in a statement. “We are expanding our opportunity and winning new customers as we help them apply our AI platforms and tools to drive new growth and operating leverage.” Microsoft’s AI business is set to surpass an annual run rate of $10 billion this quarter, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284038/ai-is-big-business-for-microsoft">Nadella said on the call</a>.</p><div><p>The company has also made security its top priority and released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/23/24251945/microsoft-security-report-secure-future-initiative">a report in Q1 about its efforts</a>. During the quarter, Microsoft also had to grapple with the effects of the Blue Screens of Death caused by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/20/24202527/crowdstrike-microsoft-windows-bsod-outage">the massive CrowdStrike outage</a>.</p></div><p><em><strong>Update, October 30th</strong>: Added updates from Microsoft’s earnings call.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
