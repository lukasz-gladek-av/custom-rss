            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/610946/death-stranding-2-trailer-ps5-state-of-play-on-the-beach<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Death Stranding</em>’s sequel continues to look absolutely bonkers. The upcoming game — known as <em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> — got a fresh trailer and a long-awaited release date of June 26th <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSy6fI0SBU">during a presentation at SXSW</a>.</p><p>The PlayStation 5 exclusive will cost $69.99 and is available for pre-order starting on March 17th. Those who buy the Digital Deluxe Edition ($79.99) or Collector’s Edition ($229.99) get early access starting on June 24th.</p><p>Hideo Kojima presented the 10-minute trailer, which opens on two characters — one is Neil, who is played by Italian actor Luca Marinelli — arguing with each other. Following that, there’s plenty of Sam (Norman Reedus) navigating the wastes with his BB and his cargo, facing bad weather, an avalanche, and the series’ signature horrific monsters. The game has a lot of star power, with the trailer highlighting characters like Fragile (Léa Seydoux), Tarman (George Miller), Higgs (Troy Baker), Tomorrow (Elle Fanning), Dollamn (Fatih Akin), Rainy (Shioli Kutsuna), The President (Alastair Duncan), Lucy (Alissa Jung), Heartman (Nicholas Winding Refn), and Doctor (Debra Wilson).</p><p>Near the end, the trailer shows Neil donning a bandana that, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/epic-death-stranding-2-trailer-reveals-release-date-new-gameplay-and-some-serious-metal-gear-vibes"><em>IGN</em> notes</a>, is very reminiscent of Solid Snake, the lead character of Kojima’s famed <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> series. The shot is creepy, with quick flashes showing his face intermittently replaced with a skull.</p><p>Kojima also announced “The Strands of Harmony World Tour,” a <em>Death Stranding</em> concert tour that will visit 19 cities and feature the music of <em>Death Stranding</em>, performed by a live orchestra and singers. That begins on November 8th, 2025, in Sydney, Australia.</p><div><p>First <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/8/23498369/death-stranding-2-kojima-game-awards-ps5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in 2022</a>, <em>On the Beach</em> is a direct sequel to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2019’s <em>Death Stranding</em></a>, a game that saw <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> director Hideo Kojima branch out with a new studio.
