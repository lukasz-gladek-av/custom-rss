            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300863/minecraft-movie-trailer-jack-black-steve<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24235698/minecraft-movie-trailer"><em>A Minecraft Movie</em></a> has a new trailer giving us a taste at the kind of story moviegoers can expect. The trailer predominately features Jack Black as Steve, the silent protagonist players embody in <em>Minecraft</em>. In the trailer, Black’s Steve is way more chatty, giving us his backstory as a child who quite literally yearns for the mines. As an adult, Steve finds a special blue cube that transports him to the <em>Minecraft</em> world where, “anything you can imagine is possible.” </p><p>It should come as no surprise that the movie, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a> before it, is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isekai">isekai</a>. A group of unsuspecting folks including Danielle Brooks, Jason Momoa, Emma Myers, and Sebastian Eugene Hansen are magically transported to the world to find a blocky paradise of Steve’s making. The trailer features another look at the movie versions of popular <em>Minecraft </em>devices like redstone-powered minecarts, crafting tables, and ender pearls. There’s even a reference to the crazy contraptions players can create in the game with an automatic chicken cooker that uses lava as a heating element.</p><p>In conjunction with the trailer’s release, Xbox has published a blog that goes into detail about all the devices seen in the trailer. Check it out <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/19/minecraft-movie-official-trailer-game-features/">here</a>. And you can watch Jack Black and Jason Momoa chew the scenery when <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> releases April 4th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
