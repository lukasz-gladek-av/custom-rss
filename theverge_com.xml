            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you ever doubted the “console wars” were over, here’s a new piece of data to consider: <em>Helldivers 2</em>, formerly console exclusive to Sony’s PS5, is currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-ps5-console-exclusive-helldivers-2-now-tops-xbox-sales-chart-as-sony-continues-to-dabble-with-its-multi-platform-strategy">the best-selling title on Xbox</a>. In fact, it’s the <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/helldivers-2-first-third-xbox-best-selling-games-chart/">first <em>and third</em> best-selling game</a>, if you count its more premium edition, and it’s currently the ninth-most played game on the platform — mostly beaten by free-to-play games like <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Roblox </em>but also <em>Minecraft </em>and <em>GTA V</em>.</p><div><p>It doesn’t surprise me that <em>Helldivers 2</em> is popular on Xbox, because it was a huge hit on PS5 and PC. Last May, Sony revealed that <em>Helldivers 2</em> had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time-with-over-12-million-sold-in-12-weeks">become PlayStation’s fastest-selling game of all time</a> with 12 million copies sold in 12 weeks, and it <a href="https://x.com/alineaanalytics/status/1961422671381504312">may have now crossed 18 million</a> after reportedly racking up <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/augusts-most-downloaded-games-across">nearly a million on Xbox</a> in its first week on sale.</p></div><p>No, what’s surprising is that we now live in an era where companies like Sony and Microsoft no longer entirely see their hit games as a way to get players to buy their own consoles, and instead just want to sell as many copies of these games as they can. Back in May, we wrote about how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661814/xbox-best-selling-games-ps5-oblivion-minecraft">the top three games on PlayStation came from Microsoft</a>, and now it’s reciprocal!</p><div><p>Sony has come around to this position slowly, but by 2022, it planned for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/26/23142569/sony-playstation-pc-mobile-game-releases-first-party-portfolio">roughly half of its games to come out on PC or mobile</a> instead of just console, and though PlayStation game boss Hermen Hulst suggested in 2024 that some of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167560/sony-thinks-its-pc-games-will-tempt-you-to-buy-a-playstation-really">Sony’s big single-player games might be held in reserve</a>, the company revealed this August that it’s gradually <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1953483758667170146">“moving away from a hardware centric business model</a>.” It’s about selling games, not consoles.</p></div><p>Here’s where some of you will no doubt point out: is <em>Helldivers 2</em> actually a PlayStation game? Since PlayStation is merely the publisher and doesn’t own its developer Arrowhead Game Studios, is it really such a big deal?</p><p>I would say yes, because Sony has been the one in control, the one making the strategic decisions over when and where and how much PlayStation goodness to share. When players balked at how <em>Helldivers 2</em> originally required you to log in with a PlayStation account on PC, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24150327/sony-helldivers-2-review-bombing-psn-login">it was out of Arrowhead’s hands</a>. When players wanted an Xbox version, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/getting-helldivers-2-on-xbox-would-need-sony-and-phil-spencer-to-duke-it-out-arrowhead-community-lead-says">Arrowhead said it was entirely up to Sony</a>.</p><p>Microsoft doesn’t have to cut such publishing deals to bring Xbox’s biggest games to PlayStation, though. When it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224284/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date">chose to bring <em>Indiana Jones</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610793/hellblade-2-ps5-release-date-xbox-ninja-theory"><em>Hellblade 2</em> to PS5</a>, it could do so because it owns both giant publisher / developer Bethesda and developer Ninja Theory itself.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/693576/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-steam-notepad">What is an Xbox</a>, and what is a PlayStation, if not <em>the</em> place to play specific games? Is it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/763357/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-hands-on-notepad">a launcher and a set of familiar controls</a>? Is it a feeling? That’s the challenge facing Microsoft and Sony if they continue down this road.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770311/playstation-game-helldivers-2-best-selling-game-on-xbox#comments">1<!-- --> <!-- -->Comment</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/770311/playstation-game-helldivers-2-best-selling-game-on-xbox]]></content:encoded>

The new ratings will appear thanks to Roblox’s new partnership with the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC), which was announced today.</p><p>As part of the partnership, players in other countries will see age ratings from the ratings agency for their region. Right now, Roblox uses its own <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/8862768451604-Content-Maturity-Labels">“content maturity labels”</a> to indicate maturity level of experiences, but these will be replaced with ratings from the agencies in the future.</p><p>“With so many families engaging with Roblox, it is hugely beneficial to provide parents with trusted and familiar ratings no matter where they live,” Patricia Vance, president of the ESRB and chairperson of IARC, says in a statement. “The globally streamlined process will provide Roblox creators with an efficient and proven process for obtaining age and content ratings, while informing parents of what their kids may experience before they play.”</p><p>Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/09/roblox-to-expand-age-estimation-to-all-users">also announced</a> a plan to, by the end of the year, require all users who use any of its communication features to have their age estimated by the platform. Right now, users older than 9 can communicate via Roblox’s in-game, filtered chat without going through the age estimation process. The age estimation will rely on “a combination of facial age estimation technology, ID age verification, and verified parental consent,” Roblox chief safety officer Matt Kaufman says in a blog post.</p><p>The platform has come under significant scrutiny over its child safety practices, with the state of Louisiana suing Roblox <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760162/roblox-louisiana-lawsuit-child-predators-safety">in August</a> for allegedly creating an environment where “child predators thrive.” These new child safety features announced today build on other recent changes like Roblox <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760805/roblox-sexual-content-lawsuit-age-verification">locking down sexual content</a> and adding <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641167/roblox-parental-controls-block-friends-experiences">improved parental controls</a>.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770305/roblox-esrb-age-ratings-iarc-age-estimation#comments">1<!-- --> <!-- -->Comment</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/770305/roblox-esrb-age-ratings-iarc-age-estimation]]></content:encoded>
