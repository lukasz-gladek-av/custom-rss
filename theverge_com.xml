            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Netflix’s gaming strategy to date has been scattershot. Since Netflix gaming debuted in 2021, the streamer has launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/8/23340894/netflix-lucky-luna-platform-game-iphone-android">indie darlings</a>, streaming tie-ins, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24249136/netflix-civilization-6-street-fighter-4-game-releases">blockbuster ports</a>. There have been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22699241/netflix-night-school-acquisition-oxenfree">studio acquisitions</a>, attempts at original AAA games, and experiments with cloud streaming. A few years on, it’s not entirely clear what the strategy is — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/8/23296545/netflix-games-1-percent-subscribers">or if it’s really working</a>.</p><p>So when Alain Tascan, former executive VP of game development at <em>Fortnite</em> maker Epic Games, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24204447/netflix-president-of-games-alain-tascan">joined as Netflix’s new president of games last year</a>, his assessment was to “readjust and focus on fewer areas with more intention.” As he explains it: “we need to find our voice.”</p><p>According to Tascan, that means focusing on games that fit into one of four categories. These include narrative games, like its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24171526/netflix-games-too-hot-too-handle-interactive-fiction">interactive fiction titles tied to Netflix reality shows</a>, along with multiplayer party games and games aimed at kids. Rounding out the quartet is what Netflix calls “mainstream” releases, which basically means anything with the potential for a huge audience. That could be a licensed tie-in like last year’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/20/24325810/squid-game-unleashed-netflix-mobile-game"><em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em></a> or original games like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/632526/spirit-crossing-netflix-games-mmo-spry-fox">just-announced <em>Spirit Crossing</em></a>, an ambitious MMO that looks like a cross between a Studio Ghibli film and a larger-scale <em>Animal Crossing</em>.</p><p>Tascan likens this strategy to the early days of Netflix’s original programming. It started with a few series, like <em>House of Cards</em> and <em>Orange Is the New Black</em>, and now Netflix produces a huge range of shows, movies, and live programming. For games, the idea is to focus on titles that fit into the four (admittedly broad) categories and then, eventually, expand from there. “We’re starting with those,” he says. “Down the road we might add more if it makes sense, but I think starting first from these four is already a lot.”</p><p>This also means scaling back in some areas. Last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276700/netflix-gaming-studio-closure-blue">Netflix shut down an internal studio focused on AAA titles</a>, helmed by industry veterans from franchises like <em>Halo</em> and <em>God of War</em>, before it even released a game. And while Netflix has become a notable publisher of indie games on mobile, it sounds like that, too, will become a smaller part of the overall plan. “We will continue supporting some of them, but I feel that indie gamers are not really coming to Netflix to find indie games,” Tascan says. Everything has to fit with the overall strategy. “If a game that has been created independently fits one of those categories nicely, we’ll probably go after it,” he says.</p><p>The eventual goal is to become, well, the Netflix of games — a sort of one-stop shop where it’s fast and easy to find something new to play. Part of achieving that is having a broad range of games meant to appeal to Netflix’s existing audience and potential new subscribers. But just as important, according to Tascan, is reducing the friction to playing games. Unlike a Netflix show, which simply involves pressing play, getting into a game involves more steps, like finding it in an app store and downloading it.</p><p>While that’s the case right now, Tascan wants the service’s gaming efforts to eventually be playable “instantaneously” and to make them platform agnostic, meaning you can play them on any device. Right now, due to a combination of technical hurdles and app store restrictions, the process isn’t exactly smooth. “Being accessible instantaneously on any screen is the ultimate goal,” he says. “I’m coming from a world where I’ve seen success by taking walls down. <em>Fortnite</em> was one of the first games to really do cross-play, and I feel that was one of the big reasons for its success.”</p><p>He believes this future will happen within the next five years, citing various converging elements like streaming technology improving and becoming cheaper; an audience that now expects experiences to carry over between devices thanks to games like <em>Fortnite</em>; and Netflix’s growing global audience. “We’re getting really close,” Tascan says. “It’s all evolving in the same direction.”</p><p>As a first step, the streamer will be launching its first TV-focused games by the end of this year. Currently, all Netflix games are mobile titles. But these new, unannounced games will be playable via a smart TV and controlled via a smartphone, removing the need for game controllers — another point of friction.</p><p>Perhaps even more ambitious, Tascan believes that one or several of these unknown games have the potential to have a similar impact to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report">Travis Scott concert in <em>Fortnite</em></a>, a moment that took players by surprise and permeated pop culture in a way that games rarely do. “I hope that some of the offerings we have at the end of the year will create this type of moment,” he says.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/633478/microsoft-xbox-steam-games-support-ui<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft revealed earlier this year that it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming">combining “the best of Xbox and Windows together”</a> for handhelds, and now the company is starting to drop the first hints at what that UI might look like. In a <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/03/gdc-2025-opening-a-billion-doors-with-xbox/">blog post</a> about Xbox “opening a billion doors,” Microsoft briefly revealed a new Xbox UI that looks a lot more console-like across multiple devices and even appears to list Steam games.</p><p>After briefly posting an image of a new Xbox UI across multiple devices, Microsoft quickly removed it once <em>The Verge</em> inquired about it. The image has a new Xbox UI that can be seen on a TV, where you can clearly see the Steam label listed. The same UI, with the Steam mention, is also shown on the tablet and handheld versions.</p><p>While the image appears to be a mockup, with owned games listed twice as well as action-adventure titles, I don’t think the Steam label here is necessarily a mistake. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell me that the company is currently working on an Xbox app update that will show every game you have installed on your PC. That includes games from Steam and the Epic Games Store, and I understand Microsoft will label these games accordingly.</p><p>I’m told Microsoft is still in the early stages of this Xbox app update, so the company might never ship the feature to list all your Steam games, but this mocked up image shows how they might show up eventually. Xbox chief Phil Spencer has also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/26/24112591/microsofts-gaming-chief-hints-that-xbox-could-get-pc-stores-one-day">previously hinted</a> that PC stores like Epic Games Store and Itch.io could one day arrive on Xbox consoles.</p><p>Microsoft has also been working on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318799/microsoft-xbox-app-new-games-homescreen">making the Xbox app the home of PC gaming</a>, and listing Steam games in this app would certainly help. GOG has a similar system in place, so you can see games you own on PC across multiple launchers.</p><p>I asked Microsoft to comment on the appearance of this Xbox app UI, but the company didn’t respond in time for publication.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, the ESA says the timeline for the implementation of the tags will be “determined on a company-by-company basis and is always voluntary.”</p><p>“The timeline for implementation of the tags is company-dependent,” Aubrey Quinn, ESA’s senior vice president for communications, tells <em>The Verge</em>. “While we cannot speak for them about their plans, we know companies are working with the relevant departments across their individual organizations to bring the tags to their consumers.”</p><p>The five founding members and Sony Interactive Entertainment “first developed” the initiative. When we asked why Sony isn’t a founding member, Quinn told us to reach out to Sony, which didn’t reply to a request for comment. Amazon Games, Riot Games, Square Enix, and Warner Bros. Games have joined the initiative, too.</p><p><em>The Verge</em> has asked all of the companies involved when they might implement the tags. Here’s what we’ve heard back.</p><div><ul><li><span><strong>Google</strong> spokesperson Zoe Ortiz declined to comment.</span></li><li><span><strong>Riot Games</strong>: “As part of the accessibility steering committee, we played an active role in defining these tags, and our accessibility team is building a plan to implement them,” says Enid Brown Nelson, director of product accessibility at Riot Games. “We want everyone to have the chance to play and enjoy our current and future games, so we’re always looking for ways to make them more welcoming—no matter who you are or how you play.”</span></li><li><span><strong>Ubisoft</strong>: “Ubisoft is actively planning the integration of these tags into its product pages and will have more to share soon,” says David Tisserand, accessibility director at Ubisoft.</span></li><li><span><strong>Xbox</strong>: “Team Xbox is working to implement Accessible Games Initiative tags across titles,” says Anna Waismeyer, senior gaming accessibility research lead at Microsoft. “Once ready, players will be able to find both Xbox Game Accessibility Feature Tags and Accessible Games Initiative tags digitally in a variety of Xbox experiences.”</span></li></ul></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
