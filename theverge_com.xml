            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister">Sean Hollister</a> <span>is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/21578775/lego-nintendo-game-boy-fan-model-nick-lever-masters">We asked for the perfect Lego Nintendo Game Boy</a>… did Lego deliver? After <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339971/nintendo-game-boy-lego-release-date-october-2025">revealing this January</a> that it would take up the challenge, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=13923&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fgame-boy-72046" rel="sponsored">it has revealed</a> a most impressive take on the 1989 classic that’ll cost a relatively reasonable $60 in the US. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-Game-Boy/dp/B0DX3J6MT7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">It’s already up for preorder today</a> for an October 1st ship date. At 3.5 inches (14cm) wide and 5.5 inches (9cm) tall, it looks like it’ll have almost the same dimensions as the original.</p></div><p>As you’ll see in the many images below, this Game Boy doesn’t <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21578775/lego-nintendo-game-boy-fan-model-nick-lever-masters">rely on miniature hats</a> for its iconic fuchsia A and B buttons — Lego has seemingly created pitch-perfect buttons that appear to recess into the frame. The console’s curves are also captured remarkably well!</p><p>And unless I’m very much mistaken, it comes with <em>printed</em> tiles rather than sticker labels to help replicate the Game Boy’s many, many iconic labels for its buttons, volume dial, on-off switch, “Dot Matrix With Stereo Sound” highlight, as well as larger features like the Game Boy’s mono speaker grille, battery compartment latch, and serial number around back that have proven difficult to emulate in bricks. (That serial number has an easter egg, by the way.)</p><div><p><cite>GIF by The Verge / video by Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>But perhaps best of all, this Lego Game Boy can show off actual scenes from the classic games using swappable lenticular lenses that’ll show you different images when viewed from different angles. You can pop in a brick-built cartridge of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening </em>or <em>Super Mario Land</em>, and “watch” the classic Nintendo logo drop as you rotate the screen downwards (you’ll have to imagine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz2QPBkDkFc">the Game Boy’s da-DING beep</a>). Or, pop in a different lenticular lens to see Link cozy up to Marin on the beach in <em>Awakening</em>’s most bittersweet scene:</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/14/24073412/i-built-that-lego-game-boy-and-now-its-even-better">I built Nick Lever’s fan-designed Lego Game Boy myself</a>, and have the real deal that plays actual cartridges too, but I’m going to be mighty tempted to pick up the official Lego one as well. If those buttons move when you push them, I doubt I’ll resist! Do wish it came with <em>Tetris</em>, too, though.</p><div><p>Lego and Nintendo have also recreated part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3eYc6dMOhw">the original US Game Boy commercial</a> using the set. It’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMeI3BwtTje/">on Instagram</a>, and you may be able to play it (with a tap) in its embedded form below.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/712786/here-is-legos-official-nintendo-game-boy-with-lenticular-display]]></content:encoded>
