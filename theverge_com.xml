Pocketpair has also shared that, in addition to 5 million yen each plus late fees, they’re “seeking an injunction against the game and compensation for a portion of the damages incurred between the date of registration of the patents and the date of filing of this lawsuit.</p><p>The Pokémon Company cites three Japanese patents, No. <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7545191B1/en">7545191</a>, No. <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7493117B2/en?oq=7493117">7493117</a>, and No. <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7528390B2/en">7528390</a>. From the translation of the claims, they appear to describe Pokémon-style activities, with ‘191 focused on the act of throwing a ball at characters in a field, ‘117 tied to aiming, and ‘390 on riding characters. We’ll have to dig more deeply into the original Japanese patent language and Japanese patent law to understand how strong these patents might be in the lawsuit, however.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Patent JP7493117B2 (Nintendo, Pokemon Company)</cite></p></div><p>Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248602/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-pocketpair-patent-infringement-lawsuit">lawsuit</a> landed nine months after <em>Palworld</em>’s launch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/22/24047087/palworld-early-access-steam-xbox-gamepass">broke Steam records</a> and racked up an impressive 12 million copies sold within its first month. </p><p>Shortly after the launch, Nintendo released a statement saying that it was aware of <em>Palworld</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050320/pokemon-palworld-investigation-copyright-plagiarism">would be investigating claims</a> that the game ripped off Pokémon designs and other elements of Nintendo’s monster-catching game. The suit has led to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24253687/palworld-ps5-japan-release-date-nintendo-pokemon-lawsuit">delay of<em> Palworld’</em>s Japanese PS5 launch</a> but hasn’t stopped the development of a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/2/24260580/pubg-developer-palworld-mobile-nintendo-lawsuit">mobile port of the game</a> licensed by <em>PUBG Mobile</em> publisher Krafton. To close the announcement, Pocketpair said, “We will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings.”</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24290345/return-to-office-mandates-amazon-productivity-remote-work-hybrid-decoder-podcast"><h2>What’s really behind Big Tech’s return-to-office mandates?</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289937/nyt-tech-workers-strike-games-wordle"><h2>NYT tech workers are making their own games while on strike</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24289730/apple-mac-mini-m4-review"><h2>Apple Mac Mini M4 review: a tiny wonder</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24289831/apple-macbook-pro-m4-review-14-2024-laptop-specs-benchmarks"><h2>Apple MacBook Pro M4 review: the Pro for everyone</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24290703/apple-green-bubble-message-reaction-rcs-android"><h2>Apple is finally letting green bubbles send message reactions</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Are you the type to sink into your couch, controller in hand, TV across the living room, for a few hours of <em>Madden? </em>If so, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">Sony’s new PlayStation 5 Pro is not for you</a>. But if you find yourself leaning forward, creeping ever closer to the screen, looking for every clue hidden in the grass or every tiny twitchy graphical advantage, a $700 console might not be such a silly idea.</p><p>On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a>,<em> The Verge</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister">Sean Hollister</a> joins the show to talk about his experience with the PS5 Pro. We go through what you can expect from this super-powered new gaming machine, which games and which gamers might get the most from it, and why the PS5 Pro might have more in common with a gaming PC than a standard console.</p><p>But before we get to that, there’s some news this week to talk about. After a hotly contested election, and looking ahead to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24287838/donald-trump-wins-2024-presidential-election">the upcoming Trump presidency</a>, we spend a few minutes talking through <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289649/big-tech-leaders-donald-trump-presidential-election">our plans to cover</a> the new administration — and how we’re thinking differently than we did in 2016. Once we’re done with that, we talk about our reviews of the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24289730/apple-mac-mini-m4-review">Mac Mini</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24289831/apple-macbook-pro-m4-review-14-2024-laptop-specs-benchmarks">MacBook Pro</a>, and the way they seem to nicely simplify the process of buying a Mac. For the first time in a long time, the lineup makes a lot of sense.</p><p>Then it’s gaming time. In addition to the PS5 Pro, Sean talks us through the news that Nintendo’s next console <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289674/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-backward-compatibility">will be backwards compatible</a> with Switch games, but cautions that the announcement isn’t necessarily unequivocally good news. Then he gives us an update on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">Nintendo’s fight against emulators</a>, which has taken a bit of a confusing turn.</p><p>Finally, in the lightning round, we talk about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289768/openai-chat-chatgpt-sam-altman-hubspot">the ultra-expensive new domain name</a> for ChatGPT, and why .coms are still so important. We also talk about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24289443/nvidia-geforce-now-monthly-playtime-caps-performance-membership-1440p">the new cap</a> on Nvidia’s GeForce Now cloud gaming service, and the good and bad news <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24289972/matter-smart-home-standard-1-4-spec-new-features-device-types">in the Matter 1.4 standard</a>. Matter: it’ll be great next year. Every year. Forever.</p><p>If you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started, beginning with Apple and gadget news:</p><p>And in gaming news:</p><p>And in the lightning round:</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
