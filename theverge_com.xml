            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/659347/fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle-season-battle-pass<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Fortnite’s</em> new <em>Star Wars</em>-themed season will add new locations, weapons, skins, vehicles, and even new Force powers to the game when it kicks off on Friday, <a href="http://fortnite.com/news/strap-in-starfighter-star-wars-is-taking-over-in-fortnite-galactic-battle">according to a blog post</a>.</p><p>The <em>Fortnite</em> island’s new <em>Star Wars</em> spots include a First Order base, a smuggler hub called the Outpost Enclave, a Resistance base with X-Wings, and a dedicated location where you can find Darth Vader Samurai (a <a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Vader_Samurai">real and very good skin</a> in the game). The locations seem like they’ll be worth dropping at; you’ll be able to fly the X-Wings, for example, and defeating Darth Vader Samurai in battle will net you a red lightsaber and a Force power that lets you throw it.</p><p>Speaking of Force powers, a hologram of Rey will also be on the island, and she can give you a Force push power. Find the hologram of Emperor Palpatine and you can get Force lightning. If you want to actually <em>play</em> as <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Sidious">Sheev Palpatine</a>, he’ll be one of the skins you can unlock in the season’s battle pass, which also includes Poe Dameron and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/656281/general-grievous-is-coming-to-fortnite">General Grievous</a>.</p><p>Throughout the season, Epic will make changes to the map like adding more <em>Star Wars</em> characters to find or letting you use a Star Destroyer’s turbolaser to blast your opponents. And on June 7th, there will be a live, in-game event where players will “take the fight to Emperor Palpatine.”</p><div><p>The new season, first teased <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/651258/fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle-darth-jar-jar-binks">in April</a>, will also feature <a href="https://screenrant.com/star-wars-darth-jar-jar-theory-explained/">Darth Jar Jar</a>. It all builds upon <em>Fortnite’s</em> previous <em>Star Wars</em> tie-ins, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/15/20966222/fortnite-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-crossover-event-stormtroopers">many</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21019726/fortnite-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-rey-finn-sith-trooper-skins-buy-now">other</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/3/24148086/may-the-fortnite-be-with-you">skins</a> and the debut of an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/13/21020843/fortnite-star-wars-the-rise-of-sykwalker-clip-exclusive-premiere-risky-reels">exclusive clip of <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em></a> before the movie hit theaters. Epic and Disney are also offering a free <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/658155/fortnite-is-offering-a-free-stormtrooper-outfit">Stormtrooper outfit</a> if you link your Epic and MyDisney accounts, which the two companies say is a “first step” ahead of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest">planned “universe” they’re building</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
